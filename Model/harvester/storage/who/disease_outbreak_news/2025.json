          "Since the beginning of 2025 and as of 21 December 2025, a total of 19 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS- CoV), including four deaths have been reported to WHO globally. Of the 19 cases, 17 were reported by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), and two were reported from France.\r\nBetween 4 June and 21 December 2025, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of KSA reported a total of seven cases of MERS-CoV infection, including two deaths. In addition, at the beginning of December 2025, the National IHR Focal Point (IHR NFP) for France also reported two MERS-CoV travel – associated cases; involving individuals with recent travel to countries in the Arabian Peninsula.\r\nThe notification of these latest cases does not change the overall risk assessment, which remains moderate at both the global and regional levels. These cases show that the virus continues to pose a threat in countries where it is circulating in dromedary camels, with regular spillover into the human population. WHO recommends implementation of targeted infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures to prevent the spread of health care-associated infections of MERS-CoV and onward human transmission."

The majority of cases (84%; n=2224), have been reported from the KSA (Figure 2). Since the beginning of 2025 and as of 21 December, a total of 19 cases have been reported to WHO. Overall, 17 cases were reported in the KSA from five regions named: Riyadh (n=10), Taif (n=3), Najran (n=2), Hail (n=1), and Hafr Al-Batin City (n=1) (Figure 3). In addition, two travel associated cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported in France, with likely exposure occurring during recent travel in the Arabian Peninsula (Figure 3).",

The cases were reported from three regions: Najran (2), Riyadh (3), and Taif (2). No epidemiological links were identified between the seven cases. In addition, between 2 and 3 of December 2025, the IHR NFP for France reported two cases of MERS – CoV with recent travel to the Arabian Peninsula during the month of November.",

          "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The case fatality ratio (CFR) among confirmed cases is around 37%. The CFR is calculated based solely on laboratory-confirmed infections and may overestimate the actual mortality rate since milder cases often go undetected or unreported.",
          "Humans can contract MERS-CoV through multiple transmission pathways; the primary route being through direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels, which serve as the virus’s natural host and primary zoonotic reservoir. Additionally, human-to-human transmission can occur via infectious respiratory particles primarily in close-contact situations and can also occur through direct or indirect contact; this is especially prominent in health-care settings. Human-to-human transmission of the virus has occurred in health care facilities in several countries, including transmission from patients to health care providers and transmission between patients before MERS-CoV was diagnosed. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS‐CoV early or without testing because symptoms and other clinical features may be non‐specific. Outside these environments, there has been limited documented human-to-human transmission.",
          "MERS can present with no symptoms (asymptomatic), mild symptoms (including mild respiratory issues), or severe illness leading to acute respiratory distress and death. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing difficulties, with pneumonia frequently observed, though not always present. Some patients also experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea. Severe cases may require intensive care, including mechanical ventilation. Those at higher risk of severe outcomes include older adults, individuals with weakened immune systems, and those with chronic conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, or lung disorders.",
          "The number of MERS-CoV infections reported to WHO substantially declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, this was likely the result of epidemiological surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 being prioritized. Similar clinical pictures of both diseases may have resulted in reduced testing and detection of MERS-CoV infections. However, the MoH of the KSA has been working to improve testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV since the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic, with MERS-CoV included into sentinel surveillance testing algorithms since the second quarter of 2023, for samples that test negative for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, recommended IPC measures (e.g., mask-wearing, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving ventilation) and public health and social measures in the community to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, (stay-at-home orders, reduced mobility) also likely reduced onward human-to-human transmission of respiratory infections including MERS-CoV. Potential cross-protection conferred from infection with or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and any reduction in MERS-CoV infection or disease severity and vice versa has been hypothesized but requires further investigation.

However, the index case in that outbreak had a history of travel to the Middle East.",
          "Three limited healthcare-related clusters have recently been reported from the KSA, two in 2024 comprised of three and two cases each, and one in 2025 comprised of 7 cases; the previous cluster before that had been observed in May 2020, also in the KSA. Extensive contact tracing was applied in the 2025 cluster, which lead to detection of four asymptomatic and two mild cases, who fully recovered. Despite these recent clusters, zoonotic spillover remains an important mode of human infection, leading to isolated cases and limited onwards transmission between humans.",
          "Global total cases reflect laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR (2005) or directly by Ministries of Health from Member States. These figures may underestimate the true number of cases if some were not reported to WHO, as they may be missed by current surveillance systems and not be tested for MERS-CoV – either due to similar clinical presentation as other circulating respiratory diseases or because infected individuals remained asymptomatic or had only mild disease. The total number of deaths includes those officially reported to WHO through follow-up with affected Member States.",
          "The notification of these new cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk,  camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked), or in a healthcare setting. Due to the similarity of symptoms with other respiratory diseases that are widely circulating, like influenza or COVID-19, detection and diagnosis of MERS cases may be delayed, especially in unaffected countries, and provide an opportunity for onward human-to-human transmission to go undetected. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.",
          "No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and therapeutics are in development. Treatment remains supportive, focusing on managing symptoms based on the severity of the illness."

          "Clinical Management",
          "The incubation period is typically 2-15 days (median 5 days), although prolonged incubation periods have been reported in the immunocompromised. Although mild disease does occur, clinicians should be aware that symptoms may frequently progress rapidly non-specific signs of upper respiratory tract infection, cough and breathlessness, to respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse. [3] MERS-CoV infection should be managed supportively with respiratory support titrated to the needs of the patient; there is a wide spectrum of severity, with many patients requiring mechanical ventilation.",
          "The largest clinical trial in MERS compared a combination of lopinavir–ritonavir and interferon β-1b with placebo (95 patients).",
          "Active treatment caused lower 90-day mortality in hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS (90-day mortality of 48% and 29% respectively). Further analysis suggested a positive effect only in patients treated within 7 days of symptom onset. Although there is increasing use of corticosteroids for some respiratory conditions (specifically in COVID-19 and some other forms of pneumonia), their use in MERS-CoV is of uncertain benefit, and harms relating to their immunomodulatory effects may be significant; more data are needed. The use of convalescent plasma has not been proven, although has been used in a limited number of patients in a non-trial setting. While antibiotics have been used in severe disease to presumptively treat concurrent bacterial infection, there are no controlled data on efficacy. A retrospective analysis of 349 MERS patients examined macrolide antibiotic therapy. No difference in 90-day mortality was found in the 136 patients receiving macrolides compated with those who did not",
          "Infection prevention and control:",
          "Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, slow triage of suspected cases and delays in implementing timely IPC measures. IPC measures are therefore critical to prevent the spread of MERS-CoV in healthcare facilities and onwards in the community. Healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients and perform risk assessments at every interaction in healthcare settings to determine the necessary protection measures. For patients with suspected MERS-CoV infection that require hospitalization, place patient in an adequately ventilated single room away from other patient care areas. In addition to standard precautions. Droplet and contact precautions should be implemented when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection who are suspects of any respiratory disease, including probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. [6,7]",
          "Droplet and contact precautions should be maintained until the patient is no longer symptomatic (for at least 24 hours) and has two upper respiratory (URT) swabs (taken 24hrs apart) test negative in RT-PCR or according to local guidance. Additionally, airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures or in settings where aerosol generating procedures are conducted. Early identification, case management and prompt isolation of suspected respiratory infected patients and cases, quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate IPC measures in health care settings, including improving ventilation in enclosed spaces and public health awareness can prevent the spread of human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.",
          "Public health and social measures:",
          "MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunosuppression. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus may be circulating.",
          "General hygiene measures, such as regular hand hygiene before and after touching animals or animal products and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.",
          "In addition, hygiene practices should be observed including the five keys to safer food should be followed when dealing with food items of camels; people should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.",
          "WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions."

          "Seasonal influenza (‘the flu’) is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses that circulate globally and year-round. It can cause illness ranging from mild to severe, sometimes resulting in hospitalization or death.  Seasonal influenza activity has increased globally in recent months, with an increased proportion of seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses being detected. This rise coincides with the onset of winter in the northern hemisphere and an increase in acute respiratory infections caused by influenza and other respiratory viruses typically observed at this time of year. Although global activity remains within expected seasonal ranges, early increases and higher activity than typical at this time of year have been observed in some regions.\r\nSeasonal influenza viruses, including A(H3N2) viruses, continually evolve over time. Since August 2025, there has been a rapid increase of A(H3N2) J.2.4.1 alias K subclade viruses detected from several countries based on available genetic sequence data. These subclade K viruses have several changes from related A(H3N2) viruses. Current epidemiological data do not indicate an increase in disease severity, although this subclade marks a notable evolution in influenza A(H3N2) viruses.\r\nEarly estimates suggest that the influenza vaccine continues to provide protection against hospital attendance in both children and adults, even though its effectiveness against clinical disease during the current season remains uncertain. Vaccines remain essential, especially for people at high risk of influenza complications and their care givers. Even if there are some genetic differences between the circulating influenza viruses and the strains included in the vaccines, the seasonal influenza vaccine may still provide protection against drifted viruses and the other virus strains included in the vaccine. Vaccination is still expected to protect against severe illness and remains one of the most effective public health measures. \r\nWHO continues to monitor global influenza activity and influenza viruses, supports countries in surveillance capacity and updates guidance as needed."

          "In many northern hemisphere countries, acute respiratory infection levels increase at this time of year. These increases are typically caused by seasonal epidemics of respiratory pathogens such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other common respiratory viruses. The exact timing of the onset, the duration, magnitude and the severity of each epidemic might vary by location, influenced by multiple factors such as type of circulating viruses (including influenza and other respiratory pathogens), relative population immunity and environmental conditions.",
          "In the northern hemisphere, some countries have reported early starts to the influenza season. In other countries, influenza activity is starting to increase, but has not yet reached the epidemic threshold.",

          "Global influenza surveillance and monitoring is conducted through the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of over 160 institutions in 131 Member States. GISRS is tasked with conducting year-round surveillance and monitoring of influenza viruses and serving as the global alert mechanism for the emergence of novel influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens with pandemic potential.",
          "In the northern hemisphere temperate and sub-tropical countries, areas and territories, influenza activity was generally low from June to August 2025. Activity gradually increased in September and continued to increase through November 2025. Influenza A viruses, especially A(H3N2) viruses, predominated during this period (Fig. 1).",
          "In the southern hemisphere temperate and sub-tropical countries, areas and territories, influenza activity generally decreased from June 2025 and remained low through August. However, a slight increase has been observed since September. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated in June and July; however, A(H3N2) viruses have predominated since September (Fig. 2).",
          "In tropical areas, there has been sustained influenza activity from June through November. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated through July. Since then, the proportion of influenza A(H3N2) viruses among reported detections has increased and has become predominant since the end of September (Fig. 3).",

A(H3N2) subclade K viruses have genetically drifted from related J.2.4 viruses and have several amino acid changes in their HA in comparison. Detections of subclade K viruses are increasing in many parts of the world, with the exception, to date, of South America.

In the western part of the region, influenza detections increased in September and October with A(H3N2) predominant since October. All seasonal subtypes have been detected continuously in the middle and eastern parts of the region. Influenza activity peaked in May 2025 in South Africa with almost exclusively A(H3N2) detections; in recent weeks influenza activity has increased slightly but remained low.",

In countries in the northern part of the region, influenza detections increased in October with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominant and lesser proportions of influenza A(H3N2) and B virus detections reported. In the Arabian Peninsula, influenza detections also increased in October but with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominant.",

          "As of 21 November 2025, reported rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) in primary care were at baseline levels for most countries and areas of the WHO European Region. However, detections were increasing and regionally pooled test percent positivity in primary care sentinel surveillance rose above 10% in weeks 45 and 46 (ending on 15 November), marking the start of the 2025/26 influenza season for the European Region. This was approximately four weeks earlier than the median, but not out of the ordinary, with epidemiological trends similar to those observed in the 2022/23 influenza season.",
          "Influenza activity was variable between countries, with those in the west of the Region generally seeing earlier increases of influenza indicators compared to others. Influenza admissions, detections, and percent positivity in hospital surveillance were also increasing from inter-seasonal levels, with a higher proportion aged 65 years or older. A majority of influenza detections from sentinel and non-sentinel primary care and hospital surveillance systems were A(H3N2) viruses.",
          "Region of the Americas",
          "During the 2025 southern hemisphere season in the Americas, influenza transmission exceeded the seasonal threshold in mid-March, remaining mostly at low to moderate levels. Circulation was driven by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, reaching a peak positivity of 19%. Activity then declined to low levels until the end of August, when an increase in circulation was observed, associated with influenza A(H3N2) in Brazil and Chile. As of beginning of November, Chile remains at moderate levels of influenza A(H3N2) transmission, without evidence of increased severity or rises in outpatient consultations. As of 4 November 2025, subclade K had not been detected in South America.",
          "In the northern hemisphere countries of the Americas, during week 45 of 2025, seasonal influenza circulation remained low, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating in the Caribbean and Central America. In North America, influenza activity—although still low—was increasing, mainly driven by influenza A virus detections. While most detections in Mexico were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, a predominance of influenza A(H3N2) has been observed in the United States and Canada, with growing detections of the A(H3N2) subclade K.",
          "South-East Asia Region",
          "Influenza detections in the South-East Asia Region started increasing from June,  peaked in August and since then  have generally remained low with some exceptions. During the 2025 till November, the proportion of Influenza A among all influenza viruses tested positive was 66% Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant sub-type (43%) in transmission followed by A(H1N1)pdm09 (~20%). In Thailand, influenza detections of predominantly A(H3N2) increased in October and November. Influenza A(H3N2) detections also increased since July in Bangladesh and October in Sri Lanka. While the region has seen an increase in Influenza A(H3N2), 22 sequences of   subclade K have   been reported in GISAID from Nepal (1), India (4) and Thailand (17) as of 30 November.",
          "Western Pacific Region",
          "Since the beginning of October 2025, influenza seasonal activity has increased in the Western Pacific Region. In some countries, including Japan and the Republic of Korea, the onset of the typical seasonal influenza activity period started earlier than in previous years. As of 9 November 2025, influenza positivity ranged from 8% to 56% in the northern hemisphere countries. In southern hemisphere countries, influenza activity shows mixed trends; positivity has declined in Australia, remains high in New Zealand and is rapidly increasing in Fiji. The elevated influenza activity in New Zealand and Fiji is unusual for this time of the year.",
          "The predominant circulating influenza subtype is influenza A(H3N2), marking a shift from A(H1N1)pdm09, which predominated during the 2024-2025 northern hemisphere winter season. The increases in influenza have predominantly been driven by the expansion of A(H3N2) subclade K, which represents 89% of sequences submitted to GISAID from the Western Pacific Region (as of 21 November 2025)."

          "WHO advises Member States to maintain surveillance for respiratory pathogens through an integrated approach, considering country context, priorities, resources and capacities. WHO has published guidance on integrated respiratory virus surveillance. WHO has also updated guidance on assessing influenza epidemic and pandemic severity , including the impact on healthcare facilities.",
          "Clinical management and prophylaxis",
          "Clinical care for seasonal influenza focuses on identifying illness severity, assessing risk of progression, and linking to definitive care. Most cases are mild and self-limiting, but severe disease, marked by respiratory distress, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ failure, requires urgent supportive care and often hospitalization. Clinical management of influenza involves high-quality supportive care—oxygen therapy, monitoring, hydration and respiratory support—and is foundational to improving outcomes, especially in severe cases.",
          "Diagnostic testing should support rapid decision-making: nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is conditionally recommended for confirmation of suspected disease in severely unwell patients, while either NAAT or digital immunoassay may be used for non-severe cases, depending on context and resource availability. Testing should be performed early with the aim of identifying people in need of treatment and linking them to care, including antivirals where indicated.",
          "Patients at high risk of progressing to severe disease are likely to benefit from antiviral to reduce their chance of admission to hospital. High-risk groups include adults ≥65 years, those with immunocompromising conditions, chronic cardiovascular, neurological or respiratory disease; malignancy, pregnancy and diabetes further elevate risk. Individuals ≥85 years or those with multiple risk factors are considered extremely high risk and might be considered for antiviral prophylaxis if exposed to influenza.",
          "Infection prevention and control measures in health-care settings",
          "Seasonal influenza is known to cause health care-associated infection outbreaks, in particular in long-term care facilities. WHO advises the use of syndromic screening at all entry points to health-care settings and as part of daily inpatient assessment to ensure that patients with suspected or confirmed infections that are transmissible in health-care settings, including influenza, are identified as soon as possible and that appropriate transmission-based precautions are implemented. WHO advises the use of droplet precautions when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed influenza. This includes appropriate patient placement (isolation) of suspected or confirmed cases, and the use of a medical mask by all health and care workers and visitors when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed influenza.",
          "Appropriate risk assessment for additional personal protective equipment (e.g. eye protection, filtering facepiece respirators, gown, gloves) should be performed by health and care workers when caring for patients with influenza. Increased risk of influenza transmission may occur instances where care activities or patient symptoms are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions onto mucosa of eyes, nose or mouth; or if in close contact with a patient with respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughing/sneezing) and sprays of secretions may reach the mucosa of eyes, nose or mouth directly, or indirectly via contaminated hands. When performing an aerosol-generating procedure on patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, patient placement in an airborne infection isolation room as well as airborne and contact precautions with eye protection are advised.",
          "Vaccination",
          "Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza disease. Safe and effective vaccines have been used for more than 60 years. Influenza viruses are constantly changing, so the composition of the seasonal influenza vaccine is regularly updated to contain viruses that are more related to those circulating. WHO, through the Global Influenza Programme and GISRS, in collaboration with partners, continuously monitors influenza viruses and activity globally and recommends seasonal influenza vaccine compositions in February and September for the following northern and southern hemisphere influenza seasons, respectively.",
          "WHO recommends annual vaccination for high-risk groups, including health and care workers. People should ideally get vaccinated just before the influenza season begins for the most effective coverage, although getting vaccinated at any time during the influenza season can still help prevent flu infections. While the effectiveness of the vaccine may vary across seasons and risk groups, it reduces disease severity and lowers the chance of complications and death. Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk of influenza complications and their caregivers.",
          "Genetic changes or drift can occur in the circulating influenza viruses before or during the influenza season, including during the time between vaccine strain selection and the influenza season. Even if there are some genetic differences between the circulating influenza viruses and the strains that are included in the vaccines, the seasonal influenza vaccine may still provide protection against drifted viruses. Current vaccines include three influenza viruses: influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses. Therefore, circulation of a drifted virus does not always result in seasonal influenza vaccines being less effective in offering protection against influenza associated illness.",
          "As of now, it remains unclear how the vaccine will protect against clinical disease during this current season. However, early vaccine effectiveness estimates show the current vaccine is 70 to 75% effective at preventing hospital attendance in children aged 2 to 17 years and 30 to 40% effective in adults.

          "The implementation of appropriate and proportionate public health and social measures (PHSM) is an essential component in the overall response to seasonal influenza epidemics. Measures such as performing hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette as well as voluntary self-isolation and mask wearing of individuals who are symptomatic or have tested positive for influenza viruses can reduce transmission of influenza viruses.  Countries should consider developing a plan to scale up additional PHSM in the event of high or extraordinarily high epidemics.",
          "Risk communication and community engagement",
          "Member States should consider to update and strengthen their risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) strategy integrating respiratory viruses. Enhanced risk communication and community engagement approach support empowerment of individuals to make informed decisions, countering misinformation, and community-led protection strategies.",
          "Clear, regular, evidence-based, culturally acceptable and context adapted RCCE approaches are essential for building and maintaining trust with the concerned and affected populations to ensure adoption of interventions, practices and behaviours. For RCCE efforts to be successful, it is vital that national policies for RCCE incorporate community engagement and feedback mechanisms that acknowledge and address contextual challenges faced by different population groups, particularly those made most vulnerable. The integration of RCCE approaches to promote vaccination against influenza is also recommended.",
          "WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel to or trade with the countries named in this report, based on the information available on the current event."

          "The purpose of this report is to raise awareness about the local transmission of clade Ib monkeypox virus (MPXV) among men who have sex with men (MSM) in countries previously unaffected or to date reporting only cases linked to travel. This report summarizes recent epidemiological developments, response activities, and the associated global public health risk.\r\n\r\nThe second declaration of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) for mpox was lifted on 5 September 2025. As both MPXV clades I and II and their subclades continue to circulate globally, leading to substantial outbreaks in African countries, WHO continues to advise emergency preparedness and response activities. Multiple modes of transmission underlie ongoing virus circulation, with sexual contact remaining the primary amplifier of transmission in most settings.\r\n\r\nSince 5 September 2025, several countries across four of six WHO regions have confirmed clade Ib MPXV infection in individuals with no recent travel reported (WHO African Region, Region of the Americas, the European Region and the Western Pacific Region), most of which are being detected among men who have sex with men,  suggesting local transmission, particularly given that infections often manifest with few or no symptoms (paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic cases) leading to undetected onward transmission. \r\n\r\nOverall, the surveillance data in most countries is sufficient to detect and respond effectively to mpox outbreaks. However, thorough epidemiological investigation, contact tracing and implementation of public health interventions to control spread remain challenging. Mpox is known to resolve on its own over two to four weeks in most cases. However, timely access to quality healthcare is essential to identify, prevent and manage secondary bacterial infections and other complications. Individuals living with immune suppressive conditions remain at high risk of more severe mpox disease and death, most notably people living with undetected and/or untreated, uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Men who have sex with men with new and/or multiple partners remain at increased risk of clade Ib and also IIb MPXV infection. WHO assesses the public health risk posed by clade Ib MPXV to men who have sex with men as moderate and the risk to the general population as low in most countries."

          "Since the lifting of the second PHEIC for mpox on 5 September 2025, and as of 24 November 2025, 43 new confirmed cases of clade Ib MPXV have been reported across six WHO regions outside areas where sustained community transmission of this virus strain has been occurring. In four of these regions (Region of the Americas, South-East Asia Region, European Region and the Western Pacific Region), 24 cases had reported no recent international travel, suggesting local transmission. Based on this, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United States of America are now considered to be experiencing community transmission of clade Ib MPXV. In addition, travel-related cases continue to be reported in many countries.",
          "Among the 43 cases, half (22) were documented among men who have sex with men, while other cases were linked to travel to countries with known community transmission of clade Ib, or secondary to travel-related cases (household contacts and/or sexual partners).",

The index (probable) case linked to travel within the African Region and the two confirmed cases were his household contacts. No further cases have been reported following detection of this cluster.",
          "These are the first cases of mpox reported in the country.",

          "The United States of America reported three unrelated cases of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV in Long Beach (one case) and Los Angeles (two cases) counties, California. All three occurred among men who have sex with men, none of whom had a history of recent international travel or known exposure to mpox cases. None of the individuals had a previous MPXV infection or prior orthopoxvirus vaccination, and one case was immunocompromised.  All three individuals were hospitalized, received standard medical care, and have fully recovered. Prior to the lifting of the PHEIC, the United States of America had reported six cases of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV, all linked to travel.",

Of these, 18 cases were classified as autochthonous, with no relevant history of recent international travel, suggesting undetected community transmission (Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain). Two cases (reported from Belgium and the United Kingdom) were related to travel within Europe and five cases to travel outside of Europe (East Africa, Uganda, United Arab Emirates), either to or from countries experiencing community transmission of clade Ib MPXV but also to or from countries where no community transmission has been reported, including Angola, the United Arab Emirates, and Viet Nam. Furthermore, at least 15 of the 27 cases, and 14 of the 18 locally acquired cases occurred among individuals who self-identified as men who have sex with men.",

          "Mpox is an infectious disease caused by the MPXV, divided into two clades, clade I (including subclades Ia and Ib), and clade II (including subclades IIa and IIb. Historically associated with zoonotic transmission in tropical rainforest regions of East, Central and West Africa, mpox has in recent years predominantly spread through human-to-human transmission and has rapidly emerged across all WHO regions. Subclades Ia and Ib have been following the emergence of clade Ib in South Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2023. Clade Ia is currently considered to encompass all other strains of Clade I that are not Ib. Clade IIb continues to circulate in all WHO regions since 2022.",
          "The virus is primarily transmitted through close physical contact with a person who has mpox, through sexual contact or other forms of direct skin-to-skin contact, for example from parent to child. Other documented routes include indirect contact with contaminated materials, occasionally non-physical contact such as close-range inhalation of infectious respiratory particles, and vertical transmission from mother-to-child during pregnancy or childbirth. In historically endemic areas transmission can also occur from animals to humans through contact with live animals or consumption of contaminated bushmeat. Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to MPXV can result from subclinical infection in another person and silent shedding of the virus, particularly in genital and anal secretions, which can facilitate further transmission during sexual contact.",
          "Mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within 3-7 days of exposure and can start as soon as one or rarely up to 21 days later. Symptoms typically last for two to four weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system, for example as a result of advanced untreated HIV infection. Fever, muscle aches and sore throat may appear first, followed by an evolving skin rash and/or mucosal lesions, or appearance of such lesions may precede systemic symptoms. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is also a typical feature of mpox, present in most cases. Transmission through sexual contact has been observed to lead to the appearance sometimes of only genital lesions. Children, pregnant women and people with weak immune systems, most commonly due to advanced HIV infection, are at risk of developing complications and dying of mpox.",
          "Laboratory testing is necessary to confirm mpox, particularly for the first cases in an outbreak or new geographic area. The primary diagnostic test for MPXV infection is polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from lesion material – on skin or mucosae, such as lesion fluid or crusts – collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin or mucosal lesions, testing can be done on oropharyngeal, anal or rectal swabs. However, while a positive result of oropharyngeal, anal or rectal sample confirms mpox, a negative result is not enough to rule out MPXV infection. Testing of blood is not recommended as any viremia is usually brief and individuals can test negative just a few days after infection. Serology does not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses and is therefore restricted to reference laboratories where antibody detection methods may be applied for retrospective case classification or in special studies.",
          "Treatment is based primarily on managing clinical symptoms, ensuring skin care, eye care, reducing pain, and preventing and managing secondary bacterial infections and other complications. Where available through clinical studies or emergency access protocols, specific antiviral medications may also be used in the treatment of mpox, particularly for severe cases or individuals at higher risk of complications.",
          "Vaccines for use to prevent mpox are available to all countries. WHO recommends use of MVA-BN (non-replicating) or LC16m8 (minimally replicating) vaccine as indicated, or ACAM2000 (replicating) vaccine based on an individual risk-benefit assessment when the others are not available. In the context of an outbreak, vaccination is recommended by WHO for individuals at high risk of exposure to mpox, such as sex workers; gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men; or other individuals with multiple sexual partners; health workers and frontline workers, contacts of known mpox cases, and other affected groups in a geographically defined area or community (based on local epidemiology)."

          "In light of the epidemiological developments presented above and confirmation of community transmission of clade Ib MPXV in all WHO regions, WHO assesses the public health risk posed by clade Ib MPXV as moderate for men who have sex with men with new and/or multiple partners, and the risk to the general population as low.",
          "The rationale for this assessment is outlined below.",
          "When timely and good quality care is available, mpox generally causes a mild to moderate disease characterized by systemic symptoms and localized skin and/or mucosal lesions. However, secondary bacterial infections and other complications can lead to severe illness and death. In most settings, the proportion of cases where death occurs (case fatality ratio) is below 1%. Risk factors for severe disease and death include immunosuppression from any cause, such as uncontrolled HIV, younger age (0-4 years) and pregnancy. In recent years, people living with untreated or uncontrolled HIV have experienced the highest burden of mpox-related mortality. In African countries, deaths have also occurred among young children, pregnant women and their unborn or newborn infants, and individuals with other immunocompromising conditions.",
          "WHO has twice declared a PHEIC for mpox in recent years. The first, in 2022, was linked to a multi-country outbreak of clade IIb MPXV spreading through sexual networks across all regions of the world, primarily among men who have sex with men who have more than one partner. Transmission beyond this group during the global outbreak remained very limited, and was brought under control in the second half of 2023, with low-level sporadic transmission persisting in the same population, likely due to mild, undetected or subclinical transmission through sexual contact.",
          "The second PHEIC for mpox was declared in 2024 due to the rising number of mpox cases reported in Africa and the spread of the newly identified clade Ib MPXV across several African countries, most of which were affected by mpox for the first time and noted both sexual and non-sexual contact transmission. These outbreaks have led to sustained community transmission of this strain in several countries primarily in Central and East Africa. In many settings, transmission was initially driven by heterosexual contact among people with multiple casual sexual partners in linked sexual networks which included but were not limited to sex workers, followed by secondary spread within households. In most of these settings, virus circulation persists through both recognized and cryptic (undetected or unreported) transmission.",
          "The locally acquired cases of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV described above in individuals in multiple countries and WHO regions suggest that undetected transmission of this subclade is occurring independently in these settings. This transmission is likely accelerated due to some infections with no or minimal symptoms (asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases), leading to further onward transmission, predominantly through sexual contact. This hypothesis is supported by the rising proportion of clade Ib MPXV cases among men who have sex with men. It is likely that clade Ib MPXV will continue to spread, and that community transmission will become established in more countries, primarily mediated by sexual contact in extended sexual networks. Men who have sex with men, particularly those with a high number of casual sexual contacts, remain at increased risk of mpox, including clade Ib MPXV infection. Currently, immunity to mpox in this population is a result of vaccination efforts since 2022 in some countries and immunity conferred by exposure to mpox during the clade IIb MPXV outbreak. However, many countries were not able to offer mpox vaccination, access was constrained in some countries where vaccine was available, and many individuals received an incomplete course of vaccination. In addition, since the peak of vaccination activities in late 2022, new cohorts of young individuals have entered the sexually active population. These individuals are more likely to be immunologically naïve having neither had previous infection nor been reached by vaccination activities. Furthermore, available data on vaccine effectiveness, uncertainty around the duration of protection against mpox following vaccination or prior infection, uncertainty regarding cross-clade protection of prior immunity during outbreaks with ongoing virus strain evolution, together with emerging data on waning humoral immunity over time, all limit confidence that those vaccinated or infected in 2022 and 2023 continue to retain protective immunity. Furthermore, of all cases reported by the countries noted here from 5 September to 24 November, only half were among men who have sex with men, suggesting continuing risk in other groups.",
          "All cases reported here are clinically stable and in isolation or recovered from the disease.  The known contacts for most of them were followed up for 21 days to ensure early recognition of symptoms and diagnosis. The clinical risk for these cases and their contacts is low, notably if they have been vaccinated and are not immunocompromised.",
          "Data from the global outbreak related to clade IIb, and the multiple importations of clade Ib MPXV in the last year, suggests that transmission of mpox outside sexual networks has been relatively limited in most high-income settings. In this context, the risk of community transmission of mpox across different population groups is still considered to be low. However, given the large outbreaks and extensive community transmission of clade Ib MPXV in Africa affecting different populations, including children, together with associated outbreaks in many countries, it remains critical to maintain vigilance in all regions, and most notably for population groups at higher risk of sexual transmission.",
          "While affected countries have developed the capacity to detect and respond effectively to mpox outbreaks, in-depth epidemiological investigation and contact tracing remain challenging. Individuals with mpox are often reluctant to disclose their exposure history or current sexual contacts, which hinders full mapping of transmission chains and raises the likelihood of undetected onward spread. Prompt isolation of cases, identification and monitoring of reported contacts, and timely administration of post‑exposure vaccination to at-risk contacts, ideally within four days of exposure, all help to reduce the immediate risk of secondary cases. However, given that sexual transmission of clade Ib is now occurring in many countries, the risk is high that clade Ib MPXV will continue to spread in newly affected countries and to other countries around the world.",
          "In light of these recent developments, WHO assesses the public health risk posed by clade Ib MPXV for men who have sex with men with new and/or multiple partners as moderate and to the general population as low. The risk for men is justified by the higher risk of exposure in this population, and the prevalence of advanced HIV infection in this group in many contexts compared to the general population. The higher risk is mitigated by residual protective benefit of previous natural infection and/or prophylactic vaccination in this group in some areas. The extent to which immunity in the group could indirectly benefit younger individuals or those not previously vaccinated or exposed is not known and will continue to diminish over time if access to vaccines is not sustained.",
          "All mpox outbreaks, including individual locally acquired cases, should be assessed in their local context to better understand the epidemiology, transmission patterns, risk factors for severe disease, viral reservoir and evolution, and relevance of strategic approaches and countermeasures for prevention and control. Regardless of geographic area, epidemiological context, gender identity or sexual behaviour, an individual’s risk largely depends on factors such as exposure risk and immune status."

WHO recommends vaccination against mpox in the context of an outbreak for people most at risk of exposure to mpox and for preventive use for laboratory personnel working with orthopoxviruses, in line with recommendations of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) and the WHO position paper on mpox vaccines. Two vaccines currently in use for mpox are recommended. MVA-BN (non-replicating vaccine) has been prequalified by WHO and broadly used in outbreak response and LC16m8 (minimally replicating vaccine) has received a WHO emergency use listing (EUL) and is used in Japan and the DRC and has also been used in Colombia. LC16 is contraindicated for use in pregnancy, immunocompromised individuals, and those suffering from a proliferative skin condition. WHO recommends a vaccination for people at risk or where relevant in geographic areas at risk to interrupt transmission. National authorities are encouraged, as a temporary outbreak response measure, to administer MVA-BN vaccine via intradermal injection at one fifth of the dose normally administered subcutaneously (also known as fractional dosing) to protect individuals at risk of exposure and facilitate reaching four to five times as many people. Intradermal vaccination with MVA-BN has been shown to be effective and safe. Anyone with a clinical or laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of mpox should follow the instructions of local health authorities, including isolation in a health facility or at home for the duration of the infectious period. Persons with mpox should avoid travel, including local and international travel, unless the reason for travel is to seek medical care, until they do not present any mpox symptoms and the scabs have fallen off and a fresh layer of skin has formed underneath.  Contacts of a confirmed case are asked to limit their movements (and to abstain from sexual relations) for 21 days, the maximum incubation and monitoring period for the appearance of possible symptoms. WHO strongly recommends implementation of optimized clinical care for patients with mpox, to reduce the risk of medical complications and long-term sequelae and improve health outcomes. Mpox disproportionally affects people living with HIV, with a higher risk of severe disease, hospitalization or death in people with advanced HIV disease. WHO strongly recommends early HIV testing for all patients with suspected or confirmed mpox and rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people living with untreated HIV who are diagnosed with mpox. Health authorities at all levels should provide travellers with information to protect themselves and others before, during and after travel to mpox-affected countries or attending events or gatherings where mpox may present a risk.  WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel to or trade with the countries named in this report.

Human infections are predominantly acquired through direct contact with infected animals or exposure to contaminated environments. Based on the original host species, influenza A viruses can be categorized such as avian influenza, swine influenza, and other animal-origin influenza subtypes.",
          "Human infection with avian influenza viruses may result in a spectrum of illness, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe, life-threatening conditions. Clinical manifestations may include conjunctivitis, respiratory, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis (brain swelling), and encephalopathy (brain damage). In some cases, asymptomatic infections with the virus have been reported in individuals with known exposure to infected animals and environments.",
          "A definitive diagnosis of human avian influenza infection requires laboratory confirmation. WHO regularly updates its technical guidance on the detection of zoonotic influenza, utilizing molecular diagnostic methods such as RT-PCR. Clinical evidence indicates that certain antiviral agents, particularly neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir), have been shown to shorten the duration of viral replication and improve patient outcomes in some cases. This antiviral agent should be administered within 48 hours of symptom onset.",

However, in rare cases, individuals exposed to infected animals or contaminated environments can become infected with A(H5) viruses.  Influenza A(H5N5) viruses are detected in birds, including wild birds and domestic poultry, and sometimes in non-human mammals. When avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry populations, there is an inherent risk of human infection through exposure to infected birds or contaminated environments. As such, sporadic human cases are expected. The case had underlying conditions and subsequently died. The investigation by health authorities in the United States of America is ongoing and included contact tracing which identified no further cases amongst contacts, and there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission.",

          "Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological (including genomics), epidemiological and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.",
          "When humans have been exposed to an influenza A virus outbreak in domestic poultry, wild birds, or other animals or when a human case of infection is identified, enhanced surveillance of potentially exposed human populations becomes necessary. This surveillance should consider the healthcare-seeking behaviour of the population and may include a range of active and passive approaches, such as enhanced surveillance in influenza-like illness (ILI)/severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) systems, active screening in hospitals, and among groups at higher occupational risk of exposure. It should also consider other sources, such as traditional healers, private practitioners, and private diagnostic laboratories.",
          "Given the observed widespread occurrence of avian influenza in poultry, wild birds and some wild and domestic mammals, the public should avoid contact with any sick or dead animals. Individuals should report deceased birds and mammals or request their removal by contacting local wildlife or veterinary authorities. Eggs, poultry meat, and other poultry products should be properly cooked and handled during food preparation. Due to potential health risks, consumption of raw milk should be avoided. WHO advises consuming pasteurized milk and if pasteurized milk is not available, heating raw milk until it boils makes it safer for consumption.",
          "In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus with pandemic potential, including avian influenza viruses, early clinical management, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of animal exposure history, travel, and contact tracing should be conducted even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results. The epidemiologic investigation should also include early identification of unusual events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from confirmed or suspected cases should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaborating Center [3] for further characterization. Additional samples should be collected from animals, the environment or any foods suspected to be sources of infection.",
          "WHO advises travelers to countries with known animal influenza outbreaks to avoid farms, live animal markets, areas where animals may be slaughtered and contact with any surfaces potentially contaminated by animal feces. Travelers should also wash their hands frequently with soap and water and should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. If infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected either during travel or upon arrival. However, further community level spread is considered unlikely, as this virus has not yet acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.",
          "Poultry workers should take additional health precautions as they are at higher risk of exposure to avian influenza and other zoonotic diseases due to their close contact with birds and potentially contaminated environments. Farm workers who have direct or close contact with animals or materials infected or contaminated with avian influenza A(H5) virus, should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to minimize their risk of exposure.",
          "All human infections caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR,2005) and State Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO within 24 hours of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus due to the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report. WHO has updated the influenza A(H5) confirmed case definition on the WHO website .",
          "Currently, there are no readily available vaccines against influenza A(H5) virus for humans. Candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness have been selected against several A(H5) clades. Existing seasonal influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide protection to against avian influenza A(H5) viruses, based on currently available data. Close monitoring of the epidemiological situation and serological investigations are essential for assessing risk and adjusting risk management measures as needed..",

The end was declared after two consecutive incubation periods (a total of 42 days) since the last person confirmed with EVD tested negative for the virus and was discharged on 19 October 2025. A total of 64 cases (53 confirmed, 11 probable), including 45 deaths (CFR 70.3%), were reported from six health areas in Bulape Health Zone, Kasai Province.  WHO and partners provided technical, operational and financial support to the government to contain the outbreak. This is the country’s 16th outbreak of Ebola. \r\nAlthough the outbreak has been declared over, health authorities are maintaining surveillance to rapidly identify and respond to any re-emergence. Risk communication and community engagement activities will continue to provide accurate information, monitor and address community feedback and rumours, and support efforts to reduce stigma toward individuals affected by the outbreak."

          "Ebola virus disease is a severe disease caused by the Ebola virus (EBOV). The virus is transmitted to humans through close contact with the blood or secretions of infected wildlife and then spreads through human-to-human transmission by direct contact with bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials.",
          "The incubation period, the time between infection with the virus and the onset of symptoms, ranges from 2 to 21 days, but typically is 7–11 days. People are not infectious during the incubation period; they become contagious with early symptoms; therefore, transmission risk begins at the onset of clinical signs and increases with disease severity.",
          "Case fatality ratios ranging from 25% to 90% have been reported in previous outbreaks. The disease is characterized by an acute onset of fever with non-specific symptoms/signs (e.g., abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, sore throat) usually followed several days later by nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and occasionally a variable rash. Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, and spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis, sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., central nervous system, eyes, testes). Family members, health and care providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk."

          "From 1 January to 2 November 2025, a total of 20 412 suspected diphtheria cases, including 1 252 deaths (an average case fatality ratio [CFR] - 6 %) have been reported across eight Member States in the WHO African Region (Algeria, Chad, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and South Africa). Several of these countries have been experiencing ongoing outbreaks since 2023. Children and young adults represent the majority of the cases, with females accounting for a slightly greater proportion. Case confirmation and management remain constrained. Laboratory confirmation remains low due to shortages of diagnostic supplies and limited testing capacity. At the same time, the global shortage of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT), and uneven clinical capacity to provide this essential treatment, pose significant challenges for effective case management. \r\n\r\nDiphtheria is a vaccine-preventable bacterial disease which can lead to severe systemic complications, including myocarditis, kidney failure, and neurological damage. Many of the affected countries are fragile, conflict-affected or have system vulnerabilities where health systems are overstretched, routine services are disrupted and access to essential services is limited. These settings are characterized by high population mobility, and crowded living conditions, especially among displaced populations. WHO continues to work across all levels of the organization to identify and implement the most appropriate mechanisms to support affected countries and mitigate the impact of the outbreaks. \r\n\r\nGiven this context, the regional public health risk is assessed as high due to the potential for further geographic expansion of outbreaks, high case fatality rates, insufficient resources for outbreak control, and limited surveillance and laboratory systems. At the global level, the public health risk is considered low, as most countries outside the African Region have established immunization programs and adequate surveillance systems."

          "Diphtheria is a severe infectious disease caused by the gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae or, less commonly, toxigenic strains of other Corynebacterium species. Infection may lead to respiratory disease, cutaneous disease, or an asymptomatic carrier state. The primary mode of transmission rests on close contact with infectious material from respiratory secretions or from skin lesions. The only known reservoir for C. diphtheriae are humans. As a result, asymptomatic carriers play a critical role in infection transmission. Immunity (either via natural infection or vaccine induced) provides protective immunity against the disease but does not prevent carriage. The disease can affect all age groups; however, unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals, including children, are most at risk.",
          "Respiratory diphtheria typically presents two to five days after exposure with sore throat, malaise, cervical lymphadenopathy, and low-grade fever. Oropharyngeal involvement is most common, but infection may extend to the nasopharynx, larynx, and tracheobronchial tree. Characteristic findings include adherent gray pseudomembranes on the respiratory tract mucosa that often bleed when removed. Severe cases can result in airway obstruction with neck swelling, hoarseness, stridor, or palatal paralysis. Toxin-mediated complications from toxigenic strains may include myocarditis, neurologic deficits, and kidney injury. Cutaneous diphtheria presents as chronic, nonhealing sores or shallow ulcers covered by a dirty gray membrane, though the appearance is non-specific.",
          "In addition to supportive care, treatment is based on the appropriate administration of DAT and antibiotics (azithromycin or penicillin).",
          "Full primary series and required booster doses. DAT administration against diphtheria has been effective in reducing the deaths and illness from diphtheria dramatically. Diphtheria is fatal in 5 to 10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. However, in settings with poor access to DAT, the CFR can be as high as 40%."

          "WHO, together with its partners, continues to support national authorities in responding to ongoing diphtheria outbreaks across affected countries. Assistance focuses on both technical and operational needs.",
          "At the country level, the scope of response operations varies according to available capacities, but core interventions remain consistent. These include enhanced surveillance through active case finding and timely reporting; adequate clinical management, including the appropriate use of antitoxin and antibiotics; risk communication and community engagement to improve public awareness and encourage care-seeking; and capacity-building efforts such as training and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines. Country-specific actions and priority needs differ, ranging from strengthening surveillance and coordination to scaling up vaccination, laboratory capacity, and medical supplies.",
          "Despite these efforts, multiple challenges continue to hinder the effectiveness of outbreak control. Competing health priorities have contributed to long-standing immunity gaps, reflected in persistently low vaccination coverage, especially in fragile settings. Similarly, case management capacity is also limited due to scarcity of diphtheria antitoxin and late presentation of patients, resulting in high case fatality rates, especially in vulnerable, marginalized and hard-to-reach populations. In some settings, surveillance systems remain fragile, resulting in delayed detection and incomplete reporting. Limited laboratory capacity further complicates the response, with shortages of diagnostic supplies, weak specimen transport systems, and restricted technical expertise leading to delayed confirmation and underestimation of outbreak magnitude."

Between 2000 and 2024, 75 789 diphtheria suspected cases were reported in the Region with the majority being reported from 2023 to 2024.  In 2023-2024, Algeria, Chad, Gabon, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and South Africa reported resurgence of diphtheria outbreaks with approximately 57 000 suspected cases and 2000 deaths (CFR of 3.5%) recorded. The countries most affected were Guinea, Niger and Nigeria. Most cases reported were children under fifteen years and female. Over 50% of suspected cases were non-vaccinated or with unknown vaccination status.",

These settings are characterized by low routine immunization coverage, high population mobility, and crowded living conditions, especially among displaced populations. The resurgence of diphtheria in these countries is further compounded by disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to significant declines in vaccine uptake and widened immunity gaps.",
          "At the regional level, the public health risk is assessed as high due to the potential for further geographic expansion of outbreaks, high fatality rates, insufficient resources for outbreak control, and weak surveillance and laboratory systems. The humanitarian context in several affected countries, including Chad, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria, increases the likelihood of sustained transmission and complicates response efforts.",
          "At the global level, the public health risk is considered low. Most countries outside the African Region have established immunization programs and adequate surveillance systems. However, the possibility of international spread through travel cannot be ruled out, particularly if susceptible individuals are exposed. Strengthened global surveillance and risk communication are therefore essential to mitigate this risk.",

          "Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable bacterial disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae . It primarily affects the upper respiratory tract and can produce a toxin that leads to severe systemic complications, including myocarditis, kidney failure, and neurological damage. The disease spreads via close contact with respiratory secretions or skin lesions. Areas with low immunization coverage, overcrowding and limited access to healthcare services are at higher risk of increased transmission and may experience outbreaks",
          "Considering the ongoing diphtheria outbreaks in the WHO African Region, WHO encourages Member States to strengthen preparedness and response capacities. This includes enhancing surveillance systems to improve case detection and reporting, expanding laboratory capacity for timely confirmation of cases, and improving clinical management and infection prevention and control. Supplementary immunization activities should be prioritized to close immunity gaps, particularly among children/adolescents and displaced populations. Community engagement and risk communication efforts must be intensified to raise awareness, promote health-seeking behavior, and ensure adherence to control measures.",
          "WHO also recommends the establishment of contingency stockpiles of diphtheria antitoxin, antibiotics, and laboratory supplies at regional hubs in Dakar and Nairobi. These stockpiles will enable rapid deployment of essential materials to the affected countries when needed.",
          "Regional and global advocacy efforts should be strengthened to mobilize funding and political support for outbreak response. WHO will continue to support Member States through technical assistance, resource mobilization, and coordination with partners.",
          "WHO will continue to work across all levels of the organization to identify and implement appropriate mechanisms to support affected countries and mitigate the impact of the outbreaks.",
          "WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel to or trade with the countries named in this report, based on the information available on the current event."

          "On 12 November 2025, WHO noted a press release from the Ethiopian Ministry of Health (MoH), and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI), announcing suspected viral hemorrhagic viral fever (VHF) in Jinka town, South Ethiopia Regional State, Ethiopia. \r\nOn 14 November 2025, the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia confirmed that the cases previously reported as suspected VHF were Marburg virus disease (MVD). Molecular testing conducted by the National Reference Laboratory at EPHI identified Marburg virus (MARV) in patient samples. As of 20 November 2025, 33 laboratory tests have been conducted, of which six confirmed cases, including three deaths, have been reported. Of the six confirmed cases, three are currently alive and on treatment. In addition to the lab-confirmed cases, a further three epidemiologically linked cases could not be tested; all three are deceased and recorded as probable cases. A total of 206 contacts have been identified, and contacts are under active follow-up. The number of contacts will continue to change as the response evolves.\r\nThe source of the infection has not yet been identified. This marks the first confirmed outbreak of MVD in the country. Initial investigation by the one health team in Ethiopia show the presence of the natural host of the virus, fruit bats, in the area. \r\n\r\nMVD is a severe, often fatal illness, transmitted from bats to humans, and clinically similar to Ebola virus diseases. The disease has a case fatality ratio of up to 88%, but it can be much lower with good and early patient care.\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of the MoH, WHO is working alongside the Ethiopian response teams to enhance coordination, surveillance (including outbreak investigation, contact tracing, and alert management), case management, infection prevention and control measures, laboratory capacity, risk communication and community engagement. \r\n\r\nWHO assesses the public health risk posed by the outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level. Ethiopia is facing concurrent emergencies and multiple disease outbreaks, including of cholera, measles, dengue, which results in stretched health capacity."

          "Marburg virus disease (MVD) is a severe hemorrhagic fever caused by either of two closely related viruses, Marburg virus and Ravn virus, which are closely related to the Ebola viruses. MVD has a high case fatality rate, ranging from 24% to 88% from previous outbreaks The case fatality rate can be lowered with good and early patient care. The virus is initially transmitted to humans from fruit bats ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ) and then spreads among people through direct contact with bodily fluids, contaminated surfaces, or infected materials. Healthcare workers, caregivers, and individuals involved in burial practices are particularly at risk when infection prevention and control measures are not in place.",
          "MVD symptoms typically begin abruptly after an incubation period of two to 21 days and include high fever, severe headache, malaise, muscle aches, and progressive gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting. In severe cases, patients may experience bleeding from multiple sites and die from shock and organ failure within a week of symptom onset.",

          "Between 20 September and 30 October 2025, a total of 404 confirmed human cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF), including 42 deaths, were reported by national health authorities in two West African countries: Mauritania and Senegal. \r\nRVF is a zoonotic disease, which mainly affects animals, but can also infect humans. The majority of human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals, but human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes. To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented. While RVF often leads to severe illness in animals, its impact in humans varies, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to severe hemorrhagic fever that can be fatal.\r\nRVF is endemic in both countries, where recurrent outbreaks have been previously reported in both livestock and humans. The risk of further spread remains high, especially with environmental conditions favorable to the proliferation of mosquitoes, periods of heavy rains and increased mosquito activity, as well as movements of livestock within country and towards Mali and Gambia for grazing and trade.\r\nThe response to RVF outbreaks requires a One Health approach, based on enhanced collaboration between the human health, animal health and environmental sectors, in both countries and at the regional level.\r\nWHO, in collaboration with the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), currently assesses the overall risk as high at the national levels, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level."

Out of a total of 190 samples tested, 46 were positive, i.e. a positivity rate of 24.2%.",

The first animal cases, involving goats and dromedaries, were reported in August 2025. A total of 235 animal cases, including 71 deaths (two in camels and 14 in goats), have been reported in Aioun (Hodh El Gharbi region) and Timbedra (Hodh Ech Chargui region), both located in the southeast near the border with Mali, as well as in Maghta Lahjar (Brakna region) in the center of the country. In the Brakna region, 46 animal cases and 55 deaths have been reported to WOAH. Affected species include sheep, goats, dromedaries and cattle.",
          "RVF is endemic in Mauritania. The last major outbreak occurred in 2022, with 47 confirmed human cases, including 23 deaths (case fatality ratio 49%), mainly affecting pastoralists in nine of the fifteen regions. During this outbreak, cattle, camels and small ruminants were also affected, with positivity rates in animals approaching 21.2%.",

The cases were recorded in 22 health districts from eight administrative regions, with the vast majority (78%) reported in the Saint-Louis region. Additional cases have been reported in Dakar (nine cases), Fatick (12 cases), Kaolack (13 cases), Louga (18 cases), Matam (23 cases), Thiès (2 cases) and Tambacounda (2 cases). The affected districts in the Saint-Louis region, namely Dagana (32 cases), Pete (9 cases), Podor (32 cases), Richard-Toll (133 cases) and Saint-Louis (73 cases), are all located along the northern border with Mauritania, close to the Senegal River.",
          "Animal cases: Animal infections have been detected in the same areas as human cases. On 23 September 2025, authorities collected 1122 blood samples and four abortion samples from small ruminant herds in the affected villages. Laboratory analyses confirmed 36 positive samples from six herds. As of 29 October 2025, a total of 160 confirmed animal cases of RVF have been reported in sheep, goats and cattle in seven regions of Senegal: Dakar, Fatick, Louga, Matam, Saint-Louis, Tambacounda and Thiès. In addition, 640 animal abortions were reported in three regions. As of 22 October 2025, the country has notified WOAH of 26 RVF outbreaks, affecting a total of 59 animals, including two deaths.",

Human infection may occur through bites from infected mosquitoes, however the majority of cases result from direct contact with the blood, tissues or organs of infected animals. Occupational groups at highest risk include livestock breeders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Humans can become infected by consuming unpasteurized or undercooked milk from infected animals. To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented.",

The majority of the infected individuals experience no symptoms or only mild illness, characterized by fever, general weakness, lower back pain and dizziness. However, a small percentage of patients (about 2%) progress to a severe form of the disease, which may manifest in one or more of the following three clinical presentations: ocular form (involving inflammation of the eye), meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and hemorrhagic form (bleeding)."

          "In 2025, a resurgence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease was noted in a number of countries, including some that had not reported substantial case numbers in recent years. Between 1 January and 30 September 2025, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CHIKV disease cases and 155 deaths were reported globally from 40 countries, including autochthonous and travel imported cases. Some WHO Regions are experiencing significant increases in case numbers compared to 2024, although others are currently reporting lower case numbers. This uneven distribution of cases across regions makes it challenging to characterize the situation as a global rise, however, given the ongoing outbreaks reported globally in 2025, the potential for further spread remains significant. CHIKV disease can be introduced into new areas by infected travelers and local transmission may be established if there is the presence of Aedes mosquito and a susceptible population. The risk is heightened by limited population immunity in previously unaffected areas, favorable environmental conditions for vector breeding, gaps in surveillance and diagnostic capacity, and increased human mobility and trade. Strengthening disease surveillance, enhancing vector surveillance and control, and improving public health preparedness are essential to mitigate the risk of further transmission.\r\n\r\nPrior to 2025, current or previous autochthonous transmission of CHIKV has been reported from 119 countries and territories. A total of 27 countries and territories across six WHO regions have established competent populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes but have not yet reported autochthonous CHIKV transmission. Additional countries have established populations of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can also transmit CHIKV, and in which transmission efficiency is enhanced for CHIKV lineages with the E1 226V mutation. The presence of these vectors poses a continuous threat of chikungunya introduction and spread in previously unaffected areas. Increased CHIKV transmission is driven by multiple factors that include the expanded geographic distribution of Aedes mosquitoes related to transportation in conveyances and climate change, unplanned urbanization, poor water management, and weakened vector surveillance and control.\r\n\r\nCHIKV disease typically causes high population attack rates. In smaller settings such as islands, the transmission dynamics can be temporarily interrupted once a proportion of the population becomes infected and subsequently immune. In larger populations however, where enough individuals remain immunologically susceptible, transmission can persist over time, leading to sustained outbreaks. These outbreaks often place a significant burden on healthcare systems due to the number of affected individuals. \r\n\r\nCountries differ in their ability to detect and report chikungunya and other vector-borne diseases, with many outbreaks identified only retrospectively, hindering effective public health responses. Early detection of cases, particularly in persons at risk for severe CHIKV disease, and timely access to appropriate medical care are essential for minimizing clinical complications and reducing mortality. \r\n\r\nThe variation in distribution of cases across regions highlights the importance of continued investment in surveillance, preparedness, and response capacities to address evolving regional dynamics. WHO continues to call on all countries to strengthen their healthcare and laboratory systems to enable rapid detection, timely reporting, and effective response to chikungunya outbreaks."

While certain WHO Regions are reporting lower case numbers compared to 2024, others are experiencing marked increases. This heterogeneity in regional trends complicates the interpretation of a global increase. Instead, the data suggest localized resurgence or emergence in specific geographic areas.

          "Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the CHIKV, an RNA virus in the alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae . CHIKV is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, most commonly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus , which can also transmit dengue and Zika viruses. These mosquitoes bite primarily during daylight hours and Aedes aegypti feeds both indoors and outdoors, whereas Aedes albopictus feeds primarily outdoors. They lay eggs in manmade and natural containers with standing water.",
          "When an uninfected mosquito feeds on a person who has CHIKV circulating in their bloodstream, the mosquito can ingest the virus. Over a period of about 10 days (range: 7-12 days), the virus replicates in the mosquito and enters its salivary glands. Once this occurs, the mosquito becomes capable of transmitting the virus to a new human host through a subsequent bite.  In the newly infected individual, the virus begins to replicate and reaches high concentrations in the blood, enabling further transmission to other mosquitos and perpetuating the transmission cycle.",
          "In symptomatic patients, CHIKV disease onset is typically 4–8 days (range 2–12 days) after the bite of an infected mosquito. Disease is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever, frequently accompanied by severe joint pain. The joint pain is often debilitating and usually lasts for a few days but may be prolonged, lasting for weeks, months or even years. Other common signs and symptoms include joint swelling, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Since these symptoms overlap with other infections, including those with dengue and Zika viruses, cases can be misdiagnosed. In the absence of significant joint pain, symptoms in infected individuals are usually mild and the infection may go unrecognized. Most patients recover fully from the infection; however, occasional cases of eye, heart, and neurological complications have been reported with CHIKV infections. Patients at extremes of the age spectrum are at higher risk for severe disease including newborns infected during delivery to infected mothers or bitten by infected mosquitoes in the weeks after birth, and older people, particularly those with underlying medical conditions. Patients with severe disease require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage and death. Once an individual is recovered, available evidence suggests they are likely to be immune from future chikungunya infections. CHIKV may be detected directly in blood samples collected during the first week of illness using molecular tests such as reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR), and after the first week of illness using serologic tests to detect antibodies produced in response to CHIKV infection.",
          "Clinical management includes managing fever and joint pain with anti-pyretic, analgesics, maintaining adequate hydration by consuming sufficient fluids  and ensuring general rest. There is no specific antiviral drug treatment for CHIKV infections. Paracetamol or acetaminophen are recommended for pain relief and reducing fever until dengue infections are ruled out, as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can increase the risk of bleeding.",
          "There are currently two chikungunya vaccines that have received regulatory approvals and/or have been recommended for use in populations at risk in several countries, but the vaccines are not yet widely available nor in widespread use. WHO and external expert advisors are reviewing vaccine trial and post-marketing data in the context of global chikungunya epidemiology to inform possible recommendations for use."

          "The public health impact of the outbreaks depends on several factors, including the ability to detect chikungunya transmission, overall capacities for a coordinated public health response and clinical management, and the proportion of the population immunologically susceptible to CHIKV infection (i.e., people not previously infected with CHIKV). Young children, elderly individuals, and those with pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases are at higher risk of developing severe disease. Additionally, people living in areas with high mosquito populations and inadequate vector control measures are at greater risk of being infected. Effective public health strategies such as vector surveillance and control, and community education, are crucial in reducing the risk infection for susceptible individuals and preventing outbreaks.",
          "In some areas, there is a lack of medical facilities with limited geographical access, making it difficult for people to access basic health care. Other challenges can be stockouts of several essential supplies for prevention and control, lack of reagents and consumables for laboratory diagnosis, and need for re-training field teams and health workers.",
          "Given the ongoing outbreaks reported globally in 2025, the potential for further spread remains significant. Although some WHO Regions are currently reporting lower case numbers compared to 2024, others are experiencing a resurgence with significant increases in case numbers, furthermore some countries are seeing an emergence of chikungunya in previously unaffected populations. This uneven distribution of cases across regions makes it challenging to characterize the situation as a global rise but rather substantial increases in particular geographical areas. Further, the potential for geographic spread remains substantial given that chikungunya can be introduced into new areas by infected travelers where local transmission may be established in the presence of Aedes mosquito and a susceptible population. The risk is heightened by limited population immunity in previously unaffected areas, favorable environmental conditions for vector breeding, gaps in surveillance and diagnostic capacity, and increased human mobility and trade. Strengthening surveillance, enhancing vector surveillance and control, and improving public health preparedness are essential to mitigate the risk of further transmission."

Targeted integrated vector surveillance and control measures are essential to reduce transmission rates.",

Early detection of severe disease progression and access to proper medical attention are key to addressing clinical complications and reducing mortality, particularly among people at higher risk of severe disease (associated factors include age >65 years and <1 year, comorbidities, pregnant women specially in the third trimester due to vertical transmission during birth, which leads to neonatal chikungunya, with several complications such as encephalitis, hepatitis, and myocarditis).",
          "Countries vary in their capacity to detect and report chikungunya and other vector-borne diseases, and outbreaks are often reported retrospectively, meaning real-time epidemiological data necessary for public health response is lacking. WHO reiterates to all countries the importance of strengthening their healthcare capacity to rapidly detect and report chikungunya and other vector-borne diseases to understand real-time epidemiological data necessary for public health response. It is important to include measures for appropriate clinical detection and management as well as preparing health services for surges in case counts.",
          "Strengthening surveillance:",
          "Enhanced surveillance and epidemiologic investigations are essential to more accurately determine the incidence and trends of CHIKV infection. Current surveillance systems often prioritize dengue over other Aedes- borne arboviruses, leading to frequent clinical misdiagnosis and misreporting of CHIKV as dengue. Strengthening surveillance capacity will support more effective risk communication and guide targeted vector control strategies. Ongoing, close monitoring of the regional situation is also critical, along with active cross-border coordination and information sharing, given the potential for transmission in neighboring countries.",

For protection against mosquito bites, clothing that minimizes skin exposure to mosquitoes indoors and outdoors is advised. Window and door screens should be used to prevent mosquitoes from entering homes. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions.",
          "Avoidance of mosquito bites offers the best protection against CHIKV infection. Patients suspected of having CHIKV infection should avoid getting mosquito bites during the first week of illness to prevent further transmission to mosquitoes, that may in turn infect other people.",

This requires mobilization of communities, who are critical in reducing mosquito breeding sites through emptying and cleaning containers that contain water on a weekly basis, disposing of waste, and supporting local mosquito control programmes.",

          "Between 1 January and 29 August 2025, the International Health Regulations National Focal Point (IHR NFP) for Bangladesh notified WHO of four confirmed fatal Nipah virus (NiV) infection cases, temporally unrelated, reported from four different districts across three separated geographical divisions (Barisal, Dhaka, and Rajshahi) in Bangladesh. \r\nNiV infection is a zoonotic disease transmitted to humans through infected animals (such as bats or pigs), or food contaminated with saliva, urine, and excreta of infected animals. It can also be transmitted directly from person to person through close contact with an infected person. Fruit bats or flying foxes (Pteropus species) are the natural hosts for the virus.\r\nHuman NiV infection is an epidemic-prone disease that can cause severe disease in humans and animals, with a high mortality rate, and outbreaks primarily occurring in South and South-East Asia. Since the first recognized outbreak in Bangladesh in 2001, human infections have been detected almost every year. To date, Bangladesh has documented 347 NiV cases through its Nipah surveillance system established to detect and respond to outbreaks promptly, with a case fatality rate of 71.7%\r\nThere are currently no specific drugs or vaccines for NiV infection; intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications. Public health efforts should focus on raising awareness of risk factors, promoting preventive measures to reduce exposure to the virus, and on early case detection supported by adequate intensive supportive care. \r\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in Bangladesh has implemented several public health measures with support from WHO.\r\nWHO assesses the overall public health risk posed by NiV at the national and regional levels to be moderate; the risk of international disease spread is considered low."

She was admitted to a community hospital on 26 January and referred to another hospital the next day. She died on 28 January, and laboratory confirmation of NiV was received on 29 January. A total of 96 contacts were reported to be identified, and all tested negative for NiV.",

He was transferred to another hospital the next day and died on 22 February. NiV infection was confirmed on 21 February. A total of 71 contacts were reportedly identified, and all tested negative for NiV.",

He was admitted to a hospital on 8 August and moved to the intensive care unit the following day. He died on 14 August. Samples collected on 10 August tested positive for NiV on 22 August. An outbreak investigation team was deployed the same day. A total of 72 contacts were identified, and samples from 11 symptomatic contacts were collected. Six tested negative, while the results for the remaining are awaited. This case was reported outside the typical season (December to April).",

However, the fourth case had no history of consuming raw palm sap, and the likely source/s of infection remain under investigation. None of the cases appears to be linked to each other. Fruit bats, the known reservoir for NiV, are present in the affected regions.",

          "Nipah virus (Henipavirus nipahense) is a zoonotic pathogen with a high CFR (40-75%) and no licensed vaccine or treatment. Its reservoirs are fruit bats or flying foxes (bats in the Pteropus genus), which are distributed in the coastal regions and on several islands in the Indian ocean, India, south-east Asia and Oceania. The virus can be transmitted to humans from wild and domestic animals. So far, outbreaks have only been reported in Asia; however, as the disease can be transmitted by domesticated animals and secondary human-to-human transmissions are also possible, it has considerable epidemic or pandemic potential. The disease is endemic in Bangladesh, with seasonal outbreaks linked to bat activities and cultural practices such as the consumption of raw date palm sap.  Seasonal outbreaks occur between December and May, coinciding with the harvesting of date palm sap.",
          "To date, Bangladesh has documented 347 NiV disease cases, with a case fatality rate of 71.7%. Nearly half of these cases (n=162) were primary cases with a confirmed history of consuming raw date palm sap (DPS) or tari (fermented date palm sap), while 29% resulted from direct person-to-person transmission. In 2025 to date, four fatal cases of NiV infection have been reported in Bangladesh; however, none of them appear to be linked to each other. While three of the cases presented a seasonal pattern, clustered during the first two months of 2025, the fourth case presented outside of the usual season, with no history of consuming raw date palm sap, and the possible source of infection remains unknown.",
          "Based on the current available information, WHO assesses the overall public health risk posed by NiV at the national level to be moderate , taking into consideration the high case fatality rate, no availability of specific drugs or vaccines for NiV infection and the difficulty of early diagnosis. Although sensitive and specific laboratory methods exist, the symptoms during the first phase are not specific and could potentially delay a timely diagnosis, outbreak detection and response. In addition, fruit bats ( Pteropus spp .) are the natural reservoir of NiV, and they are present in Bangladesh and repeated spillover of the virus from its reservoir to the human population has been demonstrated. Despite ongoing efforts at risk communication and community engagement to raise awareness, there is continued consumption of raw date palm sap in the community.",
          "People infected with NiV may remain asymptomatic. Although human-to-human transmission has been reported in previous outbreaks, it has been less frequent in recent years. The yearly number of NiV infection cases reported in Bangladesh has remained under 10 since 2016, except for 2023, when 13 cases were reported.  Strong public health measures are implemented in Bangladesh to detect and control outbreaks, including sentinel NiV surveillance, established since 2006, and the availability of Rapid Response Team (RRT) at both the central and district levels, along with the capacity to rapidly test samples.",
          "For neighbouring countries – India and Myanmar - WHO assesses the public health risk posed by NiV at the regional level to be moderate. While there has not been any report of previous cross-border transmission, the risk of spread still remains, given the shared ecological corridor of fruit bats and the occurrence among domestic animals and human cases previously reported in both countries. India has demonstrated capacity and experience in controlling previous NiV outbreaks.",
          "WHO assesses the public health risk posed by NiV at the global level to be low, as there have been no confirmed spread of cases outside Bangladesh."

          "On 1 September 2025, WHO received an alert from the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) regarding suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Bulape Health Zone, Kasai Province, DRC. The first known index case was a pregnant woman who presented at Bulape General Reference Hospital on 20 August 2025 with symptoms of high fever, bloody diarrhoea, haemorrhage and extreme weakness. She died on 25 August from multiple organ failure. \r\nOn 4 September 2025, following confirmatory laboratory testing, the Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of EVD. \r\nEbola virus disease is a serious, often fatal illness in humans. The virus is transmitted to humans through close contact with the blood or secretions of infected wildlife and then spreads through human-to-human transmission. As of 4 September 2025, 28 suspected cases, including 15 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR): 54%), have been reported from three areas of the Bulape health zone (Bulape, Bulape Com and Dikolo) and Mweka health zone. Among the deaths, four are health-care workers. About 80% of the suspected cases are aged 15 years and older. Six samples were collected from five suspected cases and one probable death from Bulape health zone and arrived on 3 September at the National Public Health Laboratory (INRB) in Kinshasa for confirmation testing. All five samples tested positive for Ebola virus (EBOV) through GeneXpert and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays on 3 September 2025.\r\nThe Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and partners, is implementing public health response measures to contain the outbreak. \r\nWHO assesses the overall public health risk posed by the current EVD outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level."

The virus is transmitted to humans through close contact with the blood or secretions of infected wildlife and then spreads through human-to-human transmission by direct contact with bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials.",
          "The incubation period, the time between infection with the virus and the onset of symptoms, ranges from 2 to 21 days, but typically is 7–11 days. People are not infectious during the incubation period; they become contagious with early symptoms, therefore, transmission risk begins at the onset of clinical signs and increases with disease severity.",
          "The average case fatality ratio is 50%; case fatality ratios ranging from 25% to 90% have been reported in previous outbreaks. The disease is characterised by an acute onset of fever with non-specific symptoms/signs (e.g., abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, sore throat) usually followed several days later by nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and occasionally a variable rash. Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, and spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis, sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., central nervous system, eyes, testes). Family members, health and care providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk."

The last EVD outbreak in the country was declared on 15 August 2022 in Beni city, North Kivu province, with one single case reported who later died, and the MoH declared the end of the outbreak on 27 September 2022. In the Bulape district, the epicentre of the current outbreak, the last EVD outbreak was recorded in 2007.",
          "This outbreak is occurring in a complex epidemiological and humanitarian context. The country is facing several outbreaks, including mpox, cholera, and measles. In addition, the country is experiencing a long-term economic and political crisis. The country's resources and capacity to effectively respond to the current outbreak are therefore limited.",
          "The epicentre of this outbreak is in the proximity of the Tshikapa city, the capital city of the Kasai province, and the Angolan border (approximately 100 to 200 kilometres, depending on the nearest border crossing point). Although the affected district is a hard-to-reach rural area relatively far from the two main urban centres of Mbuji Mayi and Kananga, population movements between different parts of the province are frequent, especially between Bulape and Tshikapa.",

          "Effective outbreak control relies on the application of a set of interventions, namely clinical management, IPC & Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), surveillance and contact tracing, good laboratory service, safe and dignified burials, community engagement, and social mobilization. The Ebola virus can persist in some body fluids of people who have recovered from EVD. In a limited number of cases, secondary transmissions resulting from exposure to the body fluids of people who have recovered from EVD have been documented. Therefore, maintaining collaborative relationships with survivor associations while monitoring survivors is a priority to mitigate any potential risks.",
          "Early diagnosis and initiation of optimized supportive clinical care can reduce mortality from EVD. In addition, monoclonal antibodies active against a 3-antibody combination of atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab [Inmazeb®] or a single antibody ansuvimab [Ebanga®].  Ebola treatment centres should be designed and managed to ensure safe care is provided with appropriate biosecurity and infection prevention and control intervention, and allow optimized care, allowing direct visualization of patients in the red zone as much as possible. WHO and partners have worked to develop these innovative solutions.",
          "There is a need to strengthen surveillance and other response activities, including at relevant points of entry and borders, to contain the possibility of exponential spread. Cases, contacts and individuals in affected areas who present signs and symptoms compatible with case definitions should be considered suspects and cared for and treated in designated treatment facilities with appropriate biosecurity, infection prevention and control and be offered testing in a timely fashion and advised not to travel. Collaboration with neighbouring countries should be enhanced to harmonize reporting mechanisms, conduct joint investigations, and share critical data in real time. Surrounding countries should enhance readiness activities to enable early case detection, isolation and treatment. Critical infection prevention and control measures should be implemented and/or strengthened in all health care facilities, per WHO's Infection prevention and control guideline for Ebola and Marburg disease .   Health workers caring for patients with confirmed or suspected Ebola should apply transmission-based precautions in addition to standard precautions , including appropriate use of PPE and hand hygiene according to the WHO 5 moments to avoid contact with patients’ blood and other body fluids, and with contaminated surfaces and objects. Waste generated in health-care facilities must be safely segregated, safely collected, transported, stored, treated and finally disposed. National guidelines should be followed on rules and regulations for safe waste disposal or WHO’s guidelines on safe waste management .",
          "Patient-care activities should be undertaken in a clean and hygienic environment that facilitates practices related to the prevention and control of health-care-associated infections, as outlined in Essential environmental health standards in health care . Safe water, adequate sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and services should be provided in healthcare facilities. For details on recommendations and improvement, follow the WASH FIT implementation Package .",

A global stockpile has been established and is being coordinated by the International Coordination Group for vaccine procurement.",

          "The global cholera situation continues to deteriorate, driven by conflict and poverty, posing a significant public health challenge across multiple WHO regions. Between 1 January and 17 August 2025, a total of 409 222 cholera/Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) cases and 4738 deaths were reported globally, from 31 countries, with six of the 31 countries reporting case fatality rates above 1%, indicating serious gaps in case management and delayed access to care. \r\nCholera is resurging in a number of countries, including some that had not reported substantial case numbers in years, like Chad and the Republic of Congo, while other countries, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and Sudan, are experiencing outbreaks that are continuing from 2024, with significant geographic expansion. This complicates containment efforts and strains fragile health systems. \r\n\r\nConflict, mass displacement, disasters from natural hazards, and climate change have intensified outbreaks, particularly in rural and flood-affected areas, where poor infrastructure and limited healthcare access delay treatment. These cross-border factors have made cholera outbreaks increasingly complex and harder to control.  Safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene are the only long-term and sustainable solutions to ending this cholera emergency and preventing future ones.  \r\n\r\nGiven the scale, severity, and interconnected nature of these outbreaks, the risk of further spread within and between countries is considered very high. Without urgent and coordinated public health measures, based on strengthened surveillance, improved case management, WASH interventions, vaccination campaigns, and cross-border collaboration, cholera transmission is likely to expand across countries.\r\n\r\nWHO collaborates with the Ministries of Health, partners and stakeholders in affected countries. WHO supports countries in all pillars of cholera control, including strengthening epidemiological surveillance, reinforcing laboratory capacity, improving access to and quality of treatment, implementing appropriate WASH and IPC practices, promoting community engagement in cholera prevention and control and facilitating OCV access and campaign implementation. On 26 August, the Africa CDC and WHO launched the Continental Cholera Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for Africa 1.0, alongside a joint Incident Management Team. This initiative follows the commitment of African Heads of State and Government, who have elevated cholera to a continental priority through their recent high-level Call to Action, pledging to control and eliminate outbreaks by 2030."

          "Between 1 January and 17 August 2025, a total of 409 222 cholera/AWD cases and 4738 deaths were reported globally, from 31 countries. [1] During the same period in 2024, 510 638 cases and 3248 deaths were reported from 28 countries, representing a 20% decrease in cases, but a 46% increase in deaths.",
          "In 2025, the Eastern Mediterranean Region recorded the highest number of cholera/AWD cases (230 991 cases, six countries), followed by the African Region (172 750 cases, 23 countries), the South-East Asia Region (2985 cholera/AWD cases, five countries), and the Region of the Americas (2496 cases, one country). Cholera-related deaths were highest in the African Region (3763 deaths, CFR 2.2 %), followed by the Eastern Mediterranean Region (943 deaths, CFR 0.4%), the Region of the Americas (31 deaths, CFR 1.2%), and the South-East Asia Region (One death, CFR 0.03%). Meanwhile, the European and Western Pacific regions have not reported any outbreaks.",
          "Cholera is resurging in a number of countries, with some that had not reported substantial case numbers in years, including Chad and the Republic of the Congo, while others, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), South Sudan, and Sudan, are experiencing outbreaks that are continuing from 2024, with significant geographic expansion. The spread into previously unaffected areas is complicating containment efforts and straining fragile health systems. These trends reveal deep systemic weaknesses in health systems, Water, Hygiene, and Sanitation (WASH), and disease surveillance systems, especially in countries facing humanitarian crises. Cross-border transmission is occurring, underscoring the urgent need for stronger surveillance, timely reporting, and coordinated response across international borders.",
          "The disease burden remains high, particularly in the following countries currently experiencing acute outbreaks:  Chad, DRC, the Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and Sudan. These countries continue to report high transmission rates, case fatality rates, and experience significant challenges in outbreak control and access to care.",
          "However, differences in case definitions and reporting systems have been observed across countries and regions, which may affect the comparability of data and the interpretation of trends. Therefore, given these complexities, the data presented here likely underestimates the true burden of cholera and should be interpreted with caution."

          "Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae . It is primarily associated with poor sanitation and limited access to safe water. The disease can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The speed of spread depends on exposure levels, population vulnerability, and environmental conditions. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal if left untreated.   However, cholera is easily treatable, with most cases successfully managed through prompt administration of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS).",
          "The incubation period ranges from 12 hours to five days after consuming contaminated food or water. While most infected individuals remain asymptomatic, they can still shed the bacteria in faeces for up to 10 days, potentially spreading the infection to others. Among symptomatic cases, most experience mild to moderate illness, while a smaller proportion develop severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which can lead to life-threatening dehydration.",
          "Humanitarian crises and disasters from natural hazards, such as floods, heighten the risk of cholera transmission by disrupting water and sanitation systems and forcing populations into overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. Controlling cholera outbreaks requires a multisectoral approach, combining surveillance, WASH interventions, adequate case management, social mobilization, community engagement and risk communication and oral cholera vaccination."

          "As of 17 August 2025, cholera outbreaks continue to escalate across multiple countries, with seven of the 31 countries now reporting case fatality rates above 1%, indicating serious gaps in case management and delayed access to care. Among these, four countries—Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), South Sudan, and Sudan—are currently classified as being in a major outbreak due to the severity and scale of their outbreaks.",
          "All countries highlighted in this report are facing multiple and similar challenges to control the ongoing outbreaks, underscoring the urgent need for public health interventions and international support.",
          "Cholera outbreaks have been recurrent in several areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan over the past years. In contrast, Chad and the Republic of the Congo have not reported large-scale outbreaks in recent years. This limited exposure has contributed to low levels of awareness regarding cholera prevention and treatment among both communities and health-care providers, which can contribute to late detection of cases and late care seeking.",
          "Access to affected populations continues to be severely constrained by challenging geography, including outbreaks occurring in remote and hard-to-reach areas such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo. In Chad, South Sudan, and Sudan, access is further impeded by seasonal flooding and poor road infrastructure, limiting the mobility of both national and international health workers and the timely delivery of essential medical supplies.",
          "These geographic and infrastructural barriers are also hindering the implementation of community programmes, including the decentralization of treatment services. As a result, delays in accessing care are contributing to elevated case fatality rates. The Republic of the Congo and Chad are currently reporting the highest CFRs at 7.7% and 6.8%, respectively. Nearly 50% of reported deaths occur within communities before patients reach health facilities.",
          "Insecurity, population displacement, and the ongoing refugee crisis—particularly in Chad, South Sudan, and Sudan—are compounding these challenges. In these settings, CFRs consistently exceed the 1% threshold, underscoring the impact of restricted access to care. In conflict-affected areas, including parts of Sudan and eastern DRC, insecurity and displacement continue to obstruct surveillance activities and limit the ability to accurately assess the scope of the outbreaks.",
          "Cross-border population movement, particularly in areas with porous borders and high mobility, further exacerbates the risk of regional spread. Many of these countries share borders and experience frequent migration due to trade, displacement, and conflict, increasing the likelihood of cholera transmission across national boundaries.",
          "Inadequate access to clean water and sanitation remains a common denominator across all affected countries, leaving communities highly vulnerable to cholera outbreaks. Seasonal factors such as heavy rains and flooding further amplify this risk by contaminating water sources and facilitating rapid transmission.",
          "These systemic barriers, coupled with overstretched response capacities, are contributing to high case fatality. There is an urgent need to decentralize treatment services, strengthen surveillance systems, and improve access to lifesaving care to reduce preventable deaths and mitigate the impact of ongoing outbreaks.",
          "Given the scale, severity, and interconnected nature of these outbreaks, the risk of further spread within and between countries is considered very high. Without urgent and coordinated public health measures, including improved case management, WASH interventions, vaccination campaigns, and cross-border collaboration, cholera transmission is likely to expand across countries."

No human cases of paralytic polio have been reported.\r\nIsrael discontinued routine use of the bivalent oral polio vaccine in March 2025 but continues using inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) as part of the country’s routine immunization schedule. \r\nWHO and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative are supporting national and subnational authorities.\r\nWHO assesses the risk of international spread of this cVDPV1 outbreak in Israel as low, due to strong overall immunity, surveillance, and response systems. However, the virus is circulating in under-vaccinated, vaccine-sceptic communities with ties to similar groups abroad, posing a potential risk for further spread."

Laboratory analyses and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) indicate that these viruses are genetically linked to each other and to multiple Sabin-like viruses isolated from environmental samples since October 2024. As of 8 August 2025, cVDPV1 has been detected only in environmental samples, with no paralytic cases reported at this stage. However current evidence supports classification of this event as an outbreak of cVDPV1 with sustained community transmission.",
          "Prior to this outbreak a Sabin-like type 1 virus (SL1), related to SL1 viruses detected in environmental surveillance, was the cause of an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case in an unvaccinated 17-year-old male from Jerusalem that was reported on 23 December 2024 and classified as vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP).",
          "Israel discontinued routine use of the bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) in March 2025 but continues to administer four doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) as part of the routine immunization schedule up to 12 months of age. The WHO/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage for three doses of IPV in 2024 was 98%. However, vaccination coverage in Jerusalem is notably lower and below WHO’s recommended coverage threshold, which is necessary to maintain sufficient population immunity and prevent poliovirus transmission."

          "Polio is a highly infectious disease that largely affects children under five years of age, causing permanent paralysis (approximately 1 in 200 infections) or death (2-10% of those paralyzed).",
          "The virus is transmitted from person-to-person, mainly through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by contaminated water or food. The virus multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis. The incubation period is usually 7-10 days but can range from 4-35 days. Up to 90% of those infected are either asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms and the disease usually goes unrecognized.",
          "Vaccine-derived poliovirus is a well-documented strain of poliovirus mutated from the strain originally contained in OPV. OPV contains a live, weakened form of poliovirus that replicates in the intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building up antibodies. On rare occasions, when replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, OPV strains can genetically change and may spread in communities that are not fully vaccinated against polio, especially in areas where there is poor hygiene, poor sanitation, or overcrowding. The lower the population's immunity, the longer vaccine-derived poliovirus survives and the more genetic changes it undergoes.",
          "In very rare instances, the vaccine-derived virus can genetically change into a form that can cause paralysis as does the wild poliovirus – this is what is known as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). The detection of VDPV in at least two different sources and at least two months apart, that are genetically linked, showing evidence of transmission in the community, is classified as cVDPV. Similar to wild poliovirus, cVDPVs can be of three types (1,2 or 3), the current outbreak in Israel is due to cVDPV1."

Israel discontinued the use of bOPV in March 2025. The routine immunization schedule includes four doses of IPV-containing vaccine until the age of 12 months and a fifth dose during the second year of primary school. In 2024, a total of 11 cVDPV1 cases were reported, ten in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and one in Mozambique. Despite no cVDPV1 case detection for the past 10 months, continued low routine immunization and IPV coverage in several countries and associated immunity gap, indicate continued risk of cVDPV1 emergence. WHO currently assesses the risk of international spread associated with this cVDPV1 detection as low due to high overall population immunity, robust poliovirus surveillance, and response capacity. However, the potential for spread exists, taking into account the fact that circulation is likely occurring in the vaccine-sceptic under vaccinated communities with known close ties to similar communities in other countries. An example of this being the 2022-2023 multi-country circulation of cVDPV2 in the UK, USA, Canada and Israel."

Since 1998 NiV outbreaks have been reported in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. In India, NiV infections have occurred multiple times since 2001 with outbreaks in West Bengal State in 2001 and 2007, and in Kerala State regularly since 2018.\r\nSince 2018, Kerala has reported a total of nine NiV outbreaks. While the state has a strong healthcare system and improved infection control measures since 2023, it is advisable to maintain strong preparedness and surveillance efforts while ensuring continued care for patients. At the same time, States that may be at risk should be encouraged to continue strengthen their detection systems and response capacities.\r\nWith no licensed vaccine or treatment available, public health efforts should focus on raising awareness of risk factors and promoting preventive measures to reduce exposure to the virus, and on early case detection supported by adequate intensive supportive care. Currently, the risk of international disease spread is considered low. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of NiV internationally in this event."

Of the four cases, two were reported from Malappuram and two from Palakkad district. This marks the first-ever outbreak in Palakkad District. Of the four cases, one case was reported in May (with symptom onset in April) and three in July with symptom onset June (two cases), and July (one case).",
          "The first patient was an adult woman from Malappuram district with symptom onset on 25 April.  The patient was admitted in critical condition to a local hospital in Malappuram with fever, cough, and respiratory distress due to worsening of symptoms. She was transferred to intensive care on 2 May due to acute encephalitis syndrome. Samples were collected and tested positive for NiV at Calicut Medical College on 6 May. Confirmatory testing was conducted by the National Institute of Virology, Pune, and results confirmed on 8 May.",
          "The second patient, also an adult woman from Malappuram district developed symptoms on 23 June and died on 1 July. She visited multiple healthcare facilities, before being transferred to a government medical facility, where clinical suspicion of NiV led to sample collection and laboratory testing.",
          "The third patient is an adult woman from Palakkad district who developed symptoms on 25 June. She sought care at several healthcare facilities, before being admitted to a multi-specialty hospital, where she remains in critical condition on ventilator support. This is the first confirmed NiV case in Palakkad district.",

He sought initial medical care on the same day, was admitted to a private hospital on 10 July, and transferred to a multi-specialty hospital on 11 July. On 12 July, he died and was confirmed with NiV infection. This is the second confirmed case in Palakkad district.",

Fruit bats or flying foxes (Pteropus species) are the natural hosts for the virus.",

Laboratory diagnosis of a patient with a clinical history of NiV infection can be made during the acute and convalescent phases of the disease by using a combination of tests. The main tests used are Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) from bodily fluids and antibody detection via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).",

          "On 17 May 2025, the Timor-Leste government reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a fatal human case of rabies from Ermera Municipality. Between May and mid-June 2025, Timor-Leste confirmed four human rabies deaths in the municipalities of Bobonaro (n=2), Ermera (n=1) and Oecusse (n=1). All cases involved individuals exposed to dogs' bites months prior to symptom onset, with rabies virus confirmed via Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Since March 2024, a total of 106 animal rabies cases—mostly in dogs—have been reported, and over 1400 dog bites or scratches have occurred, with a total of six fatalities. Access to and completion of post-exposure prophylaxis remains limited. The spread of rabies into non-border areas like Ermera signals a growing public health concern.\r\n\r\nThe public health response is ongoing and includes vaccination of dogs, risk communication, training of healthcare workers on Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) and case management, active surveillance, and ensuring the availability of rabies vaccines and human rabies immunoglobulin.\r\nBased on the current available information, the WHO assesses the risk posed by this event as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level."

          "On 17 May 2025, the Timor-Leste Ministry of Health (MoH) confirmed a fatal human case of rabies in an adult male from Ermera Municipality. The person was bitten by a dog in March 2025 and developed symptoms including hydrophobia, photophobia, aggressiveness, convulsions, and hallucinations. On 15 May, the individual sought medical care and was transferred to a national hospital. Rabies infection was confirmed the same day by RT-PCR testing at the National Health Laboratory (NHL) in Timor-Leste, using a saliva sample collected before death.",
          "On 30 May 2025, a second fatal case of rabies was confirmed in an adult male from Oecusse Municipality. The person had been bitten by a dog in June 2024 and developed symptoms including hydrophobia and photophobia. The individual presented to a regional hospital on 27 May 2025. Rabies infection was confirmed on 29 May by RT-PCR testing at the NHL.",
          "On 13 June 2025, a third fatal case was confirmed in an adult male from Bobonaro Municipality. The person had been bitten by a dog approximately 2–3 months prior to symptom onset and developed symptoms including hydrophobia and difficulty swallowing. On 12 June, the individual sought medical care and was transferred to a national hospital in Dili. A saliva sample collected before death tested positive for rabies by RT-PCR at the NHL.",
          "On 17 June 2025, a fourth fatal case was confirmed in a female child from Bobonaro Municipality. The child had been bitten  by a dog approximately two months prior to symptom onset and developed symptoms including hydrophobia, insomnia, hallucinations, hyperactivity, difficulty swallowing, and convulsions. On 12 June, the child was taken to medical care. A saliva sample tested positive for rabies by RT-PCR at the NHL on 13 June. On 14 June 2025, the child was transferred to a national hospital.",
          "Prior to this, two additional fatal human rabies cases were reported in 2024, bringing the total number of confirmed human rabies deaths since the emergence of the disease in 2024 to six.",
          "In March 2024, the first confirmed animal cases of rabies (in dogs) were reported in Oecusse Municipality. As of 1 June 2025, a total of 106 animal rabies cases have been confirmed in Timor-Leste. Of these, 103 (97%) were in dogs, two in goats (in Bobonaro and Oecusse), and one in swine (in Bobonaro).",
          "Oecusse Municipality is an enclave of Timor-Leste located within Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province (NTT), where rabies is endemic and human cases are frequently reported. Both fatal human rabies cases reported in 2024 occurred in Oecusse. However, in 2025, one human case was reported in Ermera, an inland municipality that does not border Indonesia. This suggests that rabies may be spreading beyond border areas, highlighting the need to expand surveillance, monitor the movement of infected dogs, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), dog vaccination, education and awareness raising, and address the risk of undetected transmission in the country’s interior regions.",
          "Between March 2024 and 15 June 2025, a total of 1445 dog scratches and bites were reported in Timor-Leste. Of these, 41% were classified as WHO category III exposures . Only 18% of category III exposures received rabies immunoglobulin. Although 66% of all bite victims began PEP, most did not complete the full course."

          "Rabies is a vaccine-preventable, zoonotic, viral disease affecting the central nervous system. Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is nearly 100% fatal. In up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for rabies virus transmission to humans. Yet rabies can affect both domestic and wild animals. It spreads to people and animals via saliva, usually through bites, scratches or direct contact with mucosa (e.g. eyes, mouth or open wounds). Children between the ages of 5 and 14 years are frequent victims. Direct human-to-human transmission has never been documented; however, it has occurred from infected organ/tissue donors to transplant recipients.",
          "The incubation period for rabies is typically 2–3 months but may vary from 1 week to 1 year, depending on factors such as the location of virus entry and the viral load. Initial symptoms of rabies include generic signs like fever, pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensations at the wound site. As the virus moves to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. Clinical rabies in people can be managed but very rarely cured, and not without severe neurological deficits. Rabies deaths occur mainly in those who cannot immediately access effective PEP. According to the Union Against Rabies Forum (launched by FAO, WHO and WOAH), globally, every nine minutes, one person dies from rabies. Almost half of them are children.",
          "People can be protected against rabies through a series of vaccines given to individuals as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Following an exposure, individuals still need a post-exposure booster vaccination, although with a shortened regimen compared to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP is the emergency response to a rabies exposure. This prevents the virus from entering the central nervous system, which would invariably result in death.",
          "Current diagnostic tools are not suitable for detecting rabies infection before the onset of clinical symptoms. Unless the rabies-specific signs of hydrophobia or aerophobia are present, or a reliable history of contact with a suspected or confirmed rabid animal is available, clinical diagnosis is difficult. Human rabies can be confirmed, both whilst alive and post-mortem, by various diagnostic techniques that detect whole viruses, viral antigens, or nucleic acids in infected tissues (brain, skin, or saliva)."

Recently, a dedicated rabies risk communication and community engagement      (RCCE) strategy for Timor-Leste has been developed with support from the      Australian government and public health communications specialists. Several RCCE      materials including flyers (for adults and children), magazine features,      animation videos, podcast recordings and social media content featuring      prominent and respected Timorese influencers have been developed jointly      by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Forestry (MALFF), MoH and WHO to raise      awareness about rabies, nationally.",

In up to 99% of cases of rabies in humans, domestic dogs (pets and stray dogs) are responsible for rabies virus transmission to humans. The transmission of rabies is through saliva, usually through bites and non-bites (scratches or licks on open skin/mucosa). The rabies virus is not transmitted through intact skin.",

As a zoonotic disease, it requires close cross-sectoral coordination at the national, regional and global levels. The key to implementing effective rabies elimination programs is to engage with local communities, start small, catalyze long-term investment through stimulus packages, ensure the ownership of governments, demonstrate success and cost-effectiveness, and scale up quickly.",

          "Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE)",
          "Raising awareness of rabies disease through engaging communities and empowering people is a cornerstone of response to rabies. RCCE activities should include an understanding of how to prevent rabies in animals, when to suspect rabies, and what to do in case of exposure. Individuals should adequately wash any wounds with soap and copious amounts of water for 15 minutes as a key important first aid measure and to seek early treatment whenever they are exposed to a rabid animal.",

PrEP might also be indicated for outdoor travellers and people living in remote, highly rabies-endemic areas with limited local access to rabies biologics. Exposed individuals with PrEP still need booster vaccination; however, abridged regimens apply, and human rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) is not needed.",

Vaccinating dogs, including puppies, is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people, and reduces the need for PEP. Mass dog vaccination with high quality and safe vaccines, aiming at 70% coverage over consecutive years in endemic areas interrupts rabies virus (RABV) transmission at its animal source and saves human lives.",

Seven of the 11 cases were reported in June, an unusual monthly increase.\r\n\r\nAvian influenza A(H5N1) was first detected in Cambodia, in December 2003, initially affecting wild birds. Since then, 83 cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1), including 49 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] of 59%), have been reported in the country. While the virus continued to circulate in avian species, no human cases were reported between 2014 and 2022, after which, the virus re-emerged in humans in February 2023. Since the re-emergence of human A(H5N1) infections in Cambodia in 2023, a total of 27 cases have been reported (six in 2023, 10 in 2024, and 11 to date in 2025), of which 12 were fatal (CFR 44%). Seventeen of the cases occurred in children under 18 years old.\r\nAvian influenza A(H5N1) is circulating in wild birds, poultry and some mammals around the world, and occasional human infections following exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments are expected to occur. In cases detected in Cambodia, exposure to sick poultry, often poultry kept in backyards, has been reported.\r\n\r\nAccording to the IHR, a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on currently available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low. For those occupationally exposed to the virus, such as farm workers, the risk is low to moderate, depending on the measures in place. WHO routinely reassesses this risk to factor in new information."

The epidemiologic investigation should also include early identification of unusual events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from confirmed or suspected cases should be tested and sent to a WHO collaborating centre (WHOCC) for further characterization. Additional samples should be collected from animals, the environment or any foods suspected to be sources of infection.",

One of the affected individuals died as a result of disease complications, while the remaining three cases were hospitalized and received appropriate medical care. All reported cases had direct contact with cattle suspected to be infected with anthrax. A rapid field investigation and response was conducted by the national health authorities. All potentially exposed individuals were identified, and all high-risk contacts received post-exposure prophylaxis. On 28 May, an additional case was announced who was associated with the slaughtering of cattle. Disease control measures, including animal quarantine, and vaccination campaign targeting cattle withing five km radius, public awareness campaigns, and enhanced surveillance, were implemented in the affected area.  \r\nAnthrax is a life-threatening zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Humans can get anthrax from infected animals or contaminated animal products. It generally does not spread between people. Currently, due to the robust public health measures implemented by Thailand, the risk of international disease spread through animal movement remains low."

          "Between 1 May and 4 May 2025, the Thailand IHR NFP notified WHO of four confirmed cases of cutaneous anthrax, including one death. The age range of the confirmed cases is 36 years to 58 years, comprising of three males and one female. The cases were identified in Mukdahan Province, located near the border with Lao People's Democratic Republic, separated by the Mekong River. All cases are epidemiologically linked to slaughtering of cows. The first cow was slaughtered on 12 April 2025, during a merit-making event, and its meat was distributed among villagers. A second cow was slaughtered on 28 April 2025. Exposure to meat or contact during the slaughtering process of these animals is believed to be the source of infection for all confirmed cases.",
          "The first case, presented with a skin rash on his right hand, which progressed to a clearly visible lesion by 24 April. Initially hospitalized, he was transferred to a referral hospital on 27 April due to worsening clinical symptoms, including a darkening lesion on the hand, swollen right axillary lymph nodes, dizziness, and convulsions. He subsequently died on the same day as a result of disease complications. The other three cases presented with pustular and vesicular lesions and were hospitalized. As of 28 May 2025, the three cases have completed a 10-day course of levofloxacin and doxycycline and have been discharged from hospital.",
          "Blood and wound samples from the four cases were collected between 28 April and 1 May and were sent to the Department of Medical Sciences (DMSC) and Bamrasnaradura Institute for laboratory testing. B. anthracis was confirmed by RT-PCR in all four patients.",
          "Screening of at-risk individuals was conducted across three villages, identifying two additional suspected cases who presented with diarrhea and fever. However, the samples tested negative for B. anthracis .  A total of 636 individuals were identified as at risk and monitored till 10 May 2025. Among them, 28 people were directly involved in the slaughter of cattle, while others consumed raw beef. Public health authorities initiated post-exposure prophylaxis for at-risk individuals by administering doxycycline for a duration of seven days.",
          "On 28 May, the Ministry of Public Health announced the fifth confirmed case in Mukdahan province, associated with the slaughtering of cows. The clinical status of the most recent reported fifth case is unknown at the time of reporting.",
          "This is the first reported anthrax-related death in Thailand since 1994. According to the Division of Epidemiology, the most recent anthrax cases prior to this event occurred in 2000 (15 cases and no deaths in Phichit and Phitsanulok provinces) and in 2017 (two cases and no deaths in Tak province linked to handling a goat carcass imported from Myanmar)."

Infection follows direct contact with infected animals, carcasses, animal tissues, parts (e.g., hides, wool, hair, bone) or products (e.g., drums, brushes, rugs). Invasion through the skin may occur via skin abrasions or hair follicles. Additionally, cutaneous anthrax may occur as a result of contact with contaminated soil or skin lesions of an infected individual. However, direct person-to-person transmission is very rare. Individuals with cutaneous disease present with an itchy, painless papule (most commonly on exposed areas), which evolves into a larger vesicle or blister and eventually progresses into a necrotic ulcer with a black, depressed central crust (eschar). Local oedema (swelling) and regional lymphadenopathy are usually prominent. Fever, headache and malaise may occur in a minority of cases.",

Gastrointestinal hemorrhage and ascites may occur in severe cases. Some individuals present with oropharyngeal involvement.",

Noticeably, airborne person-to-person transmission does not occur. Affected patients initially present with a flu-like illness, followed by severe respiratory distress and shock.",

This is the first human anthrax outbreak in 25 years to result in a fatality in the country. The most recent prior cases occurred in 2017 in Mae Sot district, Tak province, where two anthrax cases were reported, but no deaths. Anthrax was first reported in Thailand in 1947. Between 1992 and 2000, the incidence rate ranged from 0.02 to 0.17 per 100 000 population, with most cases occurring in provinces bordering the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Myanmar."

In the event of a suspected outbreak in livestock, key control measures include quarantining affected herds or flocks, proper disposal of carcasses, safe collection of specimens, decontamination of carcass sites and contaminated materials, vaccination of unexposed animal, and treatment of symptomatic animals. The general public and at-risk individuals should promptly report sick or unexpected deaths in animals to veterinary authorities.",

To reduce the risk of anthrax infection in these high-risk occupations, the following protective measures are recommended: use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), workplace hygiene and proper ventilation in workspaces, especially in industries where aerosols may be generated.",
          "In health-care settings, patients with suspected or confirmed zoonotic anthrax exposure may be cared for using standard precautions for infection prevention and control except where there is draining discharge of pus/blood/fluid at the site of a cutaneous anthrax lesion. When a patient has a suspected or confirmed cutaneous anthrax lesion, use soap and water handwashing during WHO’s 5 moments for hand hygiene instead of using alcohol-based handrub as sanitizers and antiseptics which are ineffective against anthrax spores.",

Use disposable consumable products when performing manual cleaning of the room of patients on contact precautions, including placing cloths and gloves used during cleaning in a leak-proof bag and sending this bag for incineration as infectious waste. Used linens and contaminated clothing with pus/blood/fluid discharge from cutaneous anthrax lesions should be placed in a leak-proof bag and either a) sent for incineration as infectious waste or b) sent for autoclaving (ensuring the autoclave function is verified using a spore strip) prior to normal laundry/linen management. Dressings and bandages used on cutaneous anthrax lesions should be placed in a leak proof bag and sent for incineration as infectious waste after use. When a patient no longer has discharge of pus/blood/fluid at the site of a cutaneous anthrax lesion; perform a terminal clean of the patient’s room and continue care on standard precautions with risk assessment for appropriate PPE unless otherwise indicated.",

The choice of antimicrobial regimens depends on the clinical form, severity, and resource availability. Individuals with documented or suspected gastrointestinal exposure may be offered a 10-day course of oral antibiotic prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible, ideally within 48 hours. Recommended antibiotics include doxycycline or ciprofloxacin.",

In comparison to the currently dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1 has the following additional spike mutations: T22N, F59S, G184S, A435S, V445H, and T478I. Spike mutations at position 445 have been shown to enhance binding affinity to hACE2 receptor, which could increase the variant’s transmissibility; mutations at position 435 have been shown to modestly reduce the neutralization potency of class 1 and class 1/4 antibodies; mutations at position 478 have been shown to enhance the evasion of Class 1/2 antibodies.

          "As of\r\n18 May 2025, 518 NB.1.8.1 sequences were submitted to GISAID from 22 countries,\r\nrepresenting 10.7% of the globally available sequences in epidemiological week (EW)\r\n17 of 2025 (21 to 27 April 2025). While the percentage remains low, this presents\r\na significant rise from 2.5% four weeks prior in EW14 of 2025 (31 March to 6\r\nApril 2025). Between EW14 and EW17 of 2025, increased circulation of NB.1.8.1\r\nwas detected in all three WHO regions that are consistently sharing SARS-CoV-2\r\nsequences, i.e. from 8.9% to 11.7% for the Western Pacific region, from 1.6% to\r\n4.9% for the region of the Americas, and from 1.0% to 6.0% for the European\r\nregion.

          "From the latest available global data covering the period between 1 January and 30 September 2024, overall COVID-19 vaccine uptake among high-risk groups remains low, with significant disparities across regions and income levels. Among older adults [3] , just 1.68% were reported as having received a dose so far in 2024 up to 30 September 2024 across 75 reporting Member States, and among health and care workers, uptake stood at 0.96% across 54 reporting Member States. An estimated 39.2 million individuals, across 90 reporting Member States covering 31% of the global population, had received a dose in 2024 through 30 September 2024, including 14.8 million in the third quarter. Uptake was notably higher in the Region of the Americas and the European Region, with older adult coverage reaching 5.1% in the European Region and 3.6% in the Region of the Americas compared to less than 0.5% in other regions. A similar disparity was observed when comparing countries by income level. High and upper middle-income countries (HIC/UMIC) reported higher vaccine uptake among older adults with 4.3% and 1.2% respectively, compared to less than 0.5% in low-income countries (LIC) and lower middle-income countries (LMIC). Similar patterns were seen among health and care workers, with uptake in the Region of the Americas (2.8%) far exceeding the less than 0.5% seen in other regions. Among income groups, UMICs reported 2.1% coverage, compared to just 0.3% in LICs and 0.1% in LMICs. Complete vaccination data for 2024 is being collected now and will be released in mid-July 2025.",
          "Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide protection against severe disease and death. To ensure approved vaccines remain effective, the WHO Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) continues to monitor and review the impact of SARS-CoV-2 evolution on the performance of available vaccines.  In May 2025, TAG-CO-VAC advised that monovalent vaccines targeting the JN.1 or KP.2 lineages remain appropriate . They also noted that vaccines targeting the LP.8.1 lineage can be considered as a suitable alternative. Vaccination should not be delayed. However, in anticipation of access to latest variant-containing vaccines, there is a greater benefit in ensuring that persons at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 receive a dose of any available vaccine as compared to delaying vaccination.",

The test positivity rate increased from 4% in EW13 to 17% in EW17 and then declined to 15% in EW19. Following lower circulation in the first ten weeks of 2025, a sharp upward trend surpassed the levels of last year (11% in EW17 2024). Across the region, recent reports of increases in circulation have been observed in five countries to date, including Egypt, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Pakistan.",

While some countries have integrated COVID-19 activities into existing respiratory disease programmes, others remain in transitional phases, maintaining targeted vertical interventions while adapting systems and structures for integrated management of infectious diseases. This variation reflects differing national contexts, resource availability, health system capacities and other national priorities.",
          "Routine public health measures for COVID-19 are increasingly being embedded within broader surveillance and response systems. Countries have been moving to operate integrated respiratory disease surveillance platforms – such as eGISRS and Coronavirus Network (CoViNet) – which include sentinel surveillance, virological characterization and wastewater monitoring, enabling the detection of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and providing insight into broader trends in viral respiratory illness. Clinical pathways developed during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic are being refined and sustained, supporting access to diagnosis, treatment, and care for individuals with COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 (long COVID) condition. Vaccination efforts remain a cornerstone of protection for high-risk groups, with updated vaccines being offered through routine or targeted immunization strategies, often alongside those for seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Risk communication and community engagement activities continue to inform and empower the public, adapted to local contexts and evolving levels of perceived risk.",
          "However, the long-term sustainability of these activities and the financing to support this remain a challenge in many countries. Health systems face an increasing number of competing priorities, including other infectious disease threats, the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, health workforce strain, and the persistent need to recover essential services disrupted during the pandemic. Beyond the health sector, broader societal and economic pressure, such as inflation, political instability, and humanitarian crises, further complicate efforts to maintain COVID-19 disease threat management at scale. WHO and partners continue to support countries in navigating these realities by promoting context-sensitive integration, prioritization, and long-term investment in respiratory disease threat management systems.",

There has been evidence of decreasing impact on human health throughout 2023 and 2024 compared to 2020-2023, driven mainly by: 1) high levels of population immunity, achieved through infection, vaccination, or both; 2) similar virulence of currently circulating JN.1 sublineages of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as compared with previously circulating Omicron sublineages; and 3) the availability of diagnostic tests and improved clinical case management. SARS-CoV-2 circulation nevertheless continues at considerable levels in many areas, as indicated in regional trends, without any established seasonality and with unpredictable evolutionary patterns. WHO produces global COVID-19 risk assessments every six months; the global risk assessment covering the period January-June 2025 is currently under development.",

The detection of wild poliovirus (WPV) or vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), including from samples taken from healthy children, is considered a serious public health event. \r\nGiven the country's suboptimal routine immunization coverage, especially at the subnational level, the risk of potential spread locally is considered high. WHO advises all countries—especially those with frequent travel and connections to polio-affected areas—should strengthen acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance while maintaining high level of immunization coverage to quickly detect and respond to virus importation and prevent further spread by closing immunity gaps."

Stool samples from 25 healthy children were collected on 10 April 2025 as part of an in-depth epidemiological investigation in the catchment area of the Environmental Surveillance (ES) site, which reported cVDPV2 on 4 April 2025. On 8 May, the WHO Polio Regional Reference Laboratory in Australia, the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) confirmed that two of these children tested positive for poliovirus type 2. The children who tested positive for the poliovirus are from two separate villages within the ES catchment area in Lae city and were asymptomatic at the time of sample collection.",
          "All isolates were classified as cVDPV2 and were genetically linked to the environmental sample detected on 4 April 2025. Genetic sequencing revealed 18-19 nucleotide differences from the Sabin 2 vaccine strain. All isolates are closely related to each other and genetically linked to the INO-PAP-2 emergence that previously caused an outbreak in Indonesia.",
          "The detection of circulating type 2 poliovirus is classified as a “polio outbreak”, in accordance with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Standard Operating Procedures for responding to a poliovirus Event or Outbreak .",
          "In Papua New Guinea, vaccination coverage is low, which may facilitate the spread of cVDPV2. As of 2024, national vaccination coverage for the third dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV3) was 44%. In Morobe province, where the virus is currently detected, coverage with bivalent OPV (bOPV) remained below 40% over the past five years, ranging from 28-37%. Coverage for the first dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV1) has remained between 52-54%. However, Lae city has higher coverage, with 73% for bOPV and 90% for IPV1."

          "Polio is a highly infectious disease that largely affects children under five years of age, causing permanent paralysis (approximately 1 in 200 infections) or death (2-10% of those paralyzed).",
          "The virus is transmitted from person-to-person, mainly through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by contaminated water or food. The virus multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis. The incubation period is usually 7-10 days but can range from 4-35 days. Up to 90% of those infected are either asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms and the disease usually goes unrecognized.",
          "Vaccine-derived poliovirus is a well-documented strain of poliovirus mutated from the strain originally contained in OPV. OPV contains a live, weakened form of poliovirus that replicates in the intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building up antibodies. On rare occasions, when replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, OPV strains can genetically change and may spread in communities that are not fully vaccinated against polio, especially in areas where there is poor hygiene, poor sanitation, or overcrowding. The lower the population's immunity, the longer vaccine-derived poliovirus survives and the more genetic changes it undergoes.",
          "In very rare instances, the vaccine-derived virus can genetically change into a form that can cause paralysis as does the wild poliovirus – this is what is known as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). The detection of VDPV in at least two different sources and at least two months apart, that are genetically linked, showing evidence of transmission in the community, is classified as ‘circulating’ vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). Similar to wild poliovirus, cVDPVs can be of three types (1,2 or 3), the current outbreak in Papua New Guinea is due to cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2).",
          "Poliovirus is a pathogen targeted for global eradication and Papua New Guinea was certified polio-free in 2000, along with the rest of the countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region, following the last reported case of wild poliovirus (WPV) in 1996.",
          "However, in 2018, an outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) was declared in Lae City, in Morobe province, the same city now considered to be experiencing a new poliovirus outbreak. The current detection of cVDPV2 in an environmental sample and in healthy children in Lae city is both unusual and unexpected, as it is not related to the previous cVDPV1 polio outbreak in 2018."

          "Following the global withdrawal of type 2 containing OPV from routine immunization programmes in April and May 2016, the risk of poliovirus transmission has increased due to declining mucosal immunity in children.",
          "In Papua New Guinea, the recent detection of cVDPV2 in both healthy children and in the environment has led to a classification of a poliovirus outbreak.  Given the country's suboptimal routine immunization coverage, especially at the subnational level, the risk of potential spread locally is considered high. While poliovirus has the potential to spread rapidly across large distances through human movement, the affected province does not share an international border. However it is a major commercial hub and a designated seaport of entry, which increases the risk of virus importation and exportation and spread especially in the case of VDPVs and in communities with low or incomplete vaccination coverage.",
          "It is important to note that the Western Pacific Region has been free of endemic poliomyelitis (polio) since 2000, and there are currently no other ongoing poliovirus outbreaks in the region. However, as long as any form of poliovirus continues to circulate anywhere in the world, there remains a risk of importation. Such importations can lead to new outbreaks if the virus is introduced into an area with low population immunity.",
          "Globally from 1 January to 12 May 2025, a total of 49 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) caused by cVDPV2 have been confirmed including 21 from Ethiopia, 14 from Nigeria, nine from Chad and one case each reported from Angola, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Niger and Sudan.  Environmental surveillance reported an additional 57 cVDPV2 isolates, mainly from Algeria, Chad, Djibouti, the occupied Palestinian territory including east Jerusalem, and Nigeria. In 2024, a total of 297 AFP cases were confirmed to be associated with cVDPV2, with majority of cases were reported from six countries: Nigeria 98 cases (33%), Ethiopia 43 cases (14. 5%), Chad 39 cases (13.1%), Yemen 37 cases (12.5%), Niger 16 cases (5.4%) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo 15 cases (5.1%). The occurrence of cVDPV outbreaks, which emerge and circulate due to a lack of polio immunity in the population, shows the potential risk for further international spread.

          "Yellow fever is an epidemic-prone, vaccine-preventable disease caused by an arbovirus transmitted to humans primarily through the bites of an infected Aedes spp. and Haemagogus spp. mosquitoes. The incubation period ranges from 3 to 6 days. Many infected people do not experience symptoms, but when they occur, the most common are fever, muscle pain with prominent back pain, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days. However, a small percentage of cases progress to a more severe, toxic phase characterized by systemic infection affecting the liver and kidneys. These individuals may have high-grade fever, abdominal pain with vomiting, jaundice and dark urine caused by acute liver and kidney failure. Bleeding may also occur from the mouth, nose, eyes, or gastrointestinal tract.  Among those who develop severe disease, approximately 50% may die within 7 to 10 days. Yellow fever is prevented by an effective vaccine, which is safe and affordable. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. The vaccine induces effective immunity in 80–100% of recipients within 10 days, and in more than 99% of people within 30 days."

          "From 1960 to 2022, a total of 9,397 confirmed cases of yellow fever, including 3,315 deaths, were reported in the Americas. The majority of these cases were reported by three countries: Bolivia 16% (1553 cases, including 516 deaths), Brazil 36% (3443 cases, including 1192 deaths), and Peru 35% (3281 cases, including 1343 deaths). In 2023, four countries in the Region of the Americas reported 41 confirmed cases of yellow fever, including 23 deaths: Bolivia (five cases, including two deaths), Brazil (six cases, including four deaths), Colombia (two cases including one death), and Peru (28 cases, including 16 deaths) (Figure 2).",
          "In 2024, 61 human cases of yellow fever were confirmed in the Americas, resulting in 30 fatalities, distributed across five countries. Bolivia reported eight cases, including four deaths; Brazil reported eight cases, including four deaths; Colombia reported 23 cases, including 13 deaths; Guyana reported three cases; and Peru reported 19 cases, including nine deaths.",
          "The public health risk in yellow fever-endemic countries in the Region of the Americas is considered \"high\" based on the WHO Rapid Risk Assessment conducted in February 2025, given the increase in yellow fever cases in the last quarter of 2024 and early 2025. Most cases reported during 2024 did not have a documented history of yellow fever vaccination. Even though regional yellow fever vaccine coverage levels were not optimal before the COVID-19 pandemic (61%), vaccination coverage declined significantly between 2020 and 2023, increasing the number of susceptible populations in all endemic countries. In 2023, Ecuador and Guyana achieved yellow fever vaccine coverage greater than or equal to 95%, and only two countries, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago, had coverage between 90% and 94%. In addition, six countries had yellow fever vaccine coverage of less than 80%: Argentina, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Brazil, Panama, Peru, and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.",
          "The occurrence of yellow fever cases outside of the Amazon basin in Colombia (Tolima) and Brazil (São Paulo) is concerning. In the newly affected areas of Colombia, populations are largely susceptible in the absence of prior large-scale preventive interventions.",
          "The risk of introduction into urban settings exists in the Americas whenever sylvatic transmission cycles are increased, with potential for international spread if urban contingency measures are inadequate.",
          "The increase in confirmed yellow fever cases in the Americas has highlighted the need to strengthen surveillance, vaccination of at-risk populations, and risk communication strategies for people moving to areas where vaccination is recommended. The systematic exposure of yellow fever cases to sylvatic-related activities, whether occupational or for leisure, stresses the need for approaches targeting individuals working in wild or forested areas, such as loggers, farmers, and ecotourism professionals. Best practices in clinical management, with an emphasis on early recognition and detection, timely referral, and treatment of severe cases, must be disseminated to healthcare workers in endemic areas. In addition, countries should have vaccine stockpiles, depending on vaccine availability, to ensure a rapid response to possible outbreaks. The overall risk of this event in the Region Americas, especially in endemic countries, is classified as high.",
          "Although endemic countries in the Americas have strengthened surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, and vaccination capacities, the global supply of yellow fever vaccines has been fluctuating in recent years, which can reduce access to vaccination for susceptible people and lead to a lack of response to yellow fever outbreaks. As of early 2025, the available yellow fever vaccine supply for the region is also severely constrained and insufficient to cover the routine regional demand for the year."

          "Yellow fever is an epidemic-prone, mosquito-borne vaccine-preventable disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes, primarily Aedes sp . and Haemagogu s species. The urban proliferation of Aedes spp. mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti, which are active during the day, can significantly amplify transmission, especially in densely populated areas.",
          "Surveillance: WHO emphasizes the importance of active surveillance, cross-border coordination, and information sharing. Investigating and testing suspected cases is crucial for controlling and preventing outbreaks. It is recommended that surveillance be enhanced with investigations and laboratory tests of suspected cases.",
          "Vaccination as a Primary Prevention Tool: Vaccination is the primary means for preventing and controlling yellow fever. The WHO's Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy prioritizes vaccination in countries reporting yellow fever, integrating it into routine immunization schedules for individuals aged 9 months and above. WHO supports the expansion of vaccination coverage through routine programs and mass vaccination campaigns to enhance communal immunity.",
          "Vector Control and Risk Communication: Effective vector control in urban settings, along with general mosquito bite avoidance strategies, is recommended to prevent disease transmission. WHO urges Member States to inform travellers about yellow fever risks, preventive measures, and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms arise. This approach helps prevent the establishment of local transmission cycles through infected travellers.",
          "International Travel and Trade: All international travellers aged 9 months and above heading to areas at risk of yellow fever transmission (i.e. areas with evidence of persistent or periodic yellow fever virus transmission), as determined by WHO, are advised to get vaccinated. The vaccine is deemed safe and effective, offering lifelong protection. However, vaccination recommendations for infants under 9 months, as well as for pregnant or breastfeeding women, are nuanced, advocating for vaccination in high-risk scenarios after weighing the benefits against potential risks.",
          "Under the IHR, it is a country’s prerogative to require proof of yellow fever vaccination from incoming and/or outgoing travellers. For international travel purposes, the administration of yellow fever vaccine shall be documented in the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP); and the documented administration of one single dose of WHO-approved yellow fever vaccine, conferring lifelong immunity, shall be accepted as valid.",
          "Given the evolving nature of yellow fever transmission, WHO advises Member States to remain updated with the latest information and guidelines available on the WHO International Travel and Health website. Local health authorities are encouraged to collaborate closely with WHO and other relevant stakeholders to implement effective yellow fever prevention and control measures, ensuring the safety and well-being of populations at risk.",
          "WHO advises against imposing travel or trade restrictions related to the current yellow fever outbreak in the Region of the Americas. Continuous efforts to educate travellers on preventive measures, including vaccination, are encouraged."

Cases have been recorded across all regions of the country, particularly among children and people who are unvaccinated.\r\nIn response, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MOHSP), in collaboration with relevant sectors, activated the National Center for Public Health Emergency Operations, launched urgent catch-up vaccination campaigns, and strengthened surveillance, case management, and risk communication and community engagement efforts.\r\nMeasles is a highly transmissible viral disease that can lead to severe complications and death. While Morocco has made significant progress toward measles elimination, the disease remains endemic in the country.\r\nThe overall risk is assessed as moderate at the national level and moderate at the regional level, particularly given the risk of cross-border transmission in areas with low vaccination coverage."

          "Since late 2023, Morocco has been experiencing a widespread measles outbreak. The first cases were reported in limited provinces of the Souss Massa region in central Morocco, before spreading to additional provinces within the region during the first quarter of 2024, and subsequently to other regions of the country.",
          "From 1 October 2023 through 13 April 2025, more than 25 000 suspected measles cases were reported from all 12 regions, 13 706 of which were laboratory-confirmed cases and 184 people died.",
          "During the week ending 27 April 2025, Morocco reported 995 suspected measles cases, representing an incidence rate of 2.7 per 100,000 population. While a national peak incidence was recorded in week 4 of 2025 (week ending 25 January), a declining trend in case numbers has been observed for ten consecutive weeks, starting from week 5 of 2025.",
          "The distribution of cases by gender has been nearly equal, with 50.7% of cases among males and 49.3% among females. From 1 January 2024 to 28 February 2025, 68% of cases occurred among individuals under the age of 18, and 49% of all cases were reported in unvaccinated individuals.",
          "Genomic characterization of measles virus specimens collected during the 2024–2025 outbreak revealed exclusive circulation of genotype B3, which is common in many parts of Africa and has been associated with outbreaks globally. One isolated case was associated with genotype D8 and likely indicates a sporadic importation, with no evidence of sustained local transmission.",
          "The measles vaccine was introduced into Morocco’s national immunization schedule in 1987 as a single dose, and a second dose was added in 2014. It is administered in two doses: the first at 9 months of age, and the second between 15 and 18 months. According to WHO/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage (WUENIC), Morocco has reported coverage with two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) above the 95% threshold required to achieve the elimination goal. However, this threshold was not achieved in the last three years."

          "Measles is a highly contagious, acute viral illness that affects people across all age groups and remains a leading cause of death among young children globally. Transmission occurs via airborne droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions from infected individuals.",
          "The incubation period typically ranges from 10 to 14 days. Prodromal symptoms include high fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by the appearance of Koplik spots (small white lesions on the buccal mucosa). A characteristic maculopapular rash emerges approximately 2–4 days after fever onset, beginning on the face and upper neck before progressing to the trunk and lower limbs. Individuals are considered infectious from approximately four days before until four days after the rash appears.",
          "While there is no specific antiviral therapy for measles, the majority of patients recover within 2–3 weeks with supportive care. However, the disease can result in severe complications, including pneumonia, diarrhea, otitis media, acute encephalitis, blindness, and death. Post-infectious encephalitis occurs in approximately 1 in 1000 cases. Measles also induces immune amnesia, a phenomenon in which the virus erases previously acquired immune memory, increasing susceptibility to other infections for months or even years after recovery.",

The measles-containing vaccine is among the most effective vaccines available, with a two-dose schedule providing approximately 97% lifelong protection. Immunization not only prevents measles but also significantly reduces the risk of its potentially life-threatening complications."

Two of these cases died. Among the nine cases, a cluster of seven cases were identified in Riyadh, including six health and care workers who acquired the infection from caring for a single infected patient. The cluster was identified through contact tracing and subsequent testing of all contacts, with four of the six health and care workers being asymptomatic and two showing only mild, nonspecific signs. The notification of these cases does not change the overall risk assessment, which remains moderate at both the global and regional levels. These cases show that the virus continues to pose a threat in countries where it is circulating in dromedary camels and spilling over into the human population.

The fatality rate among confirmed cases is around 36%, though this may be an overestimate since milder cases often go undetected. The CFR is calculated based solely on laboratory-confirmed infections, which may not reflect the correct mortality rate.",
          "Humans contract MERS-CoV through direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels, the virus’s natural host and zoonotic reservoir. Human-to-human transmission occurs via infectious respiratory particles mainly at close distances and also through contact transmission, it has mainly occurred in close-contact situations, particularly in health-care settings. Outside these environments, there has been limited documented human-to-human transmission to date.",
          "MERS can present with no symptoms, mild respiratory issues, or severe illness leading to acute respiratory distress and death. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing difficulties, with pneumonia frequently observed, though not always present. Some patients also experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea. Severe cases may require intensive care, including mechanical ventilation. Those at higher risk of severe outcomes include older adults, individuals with weakened immune systems, and those with chronic conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, or lung disorders.",
          "The number of MERS-CoV infections reported to WHO has substantially declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, this was likely the result of epidemiological surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 being prioritized. The similar clinical picture of both diseases may result in reduced testing and detection of MERS-CoV infections. However, the Ministry of Health of KSA has been working to improve testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV since the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic, with MERS-CoV included into sentinel surveillance testing algorithms since the second quarter of 2023, for samples that test negative for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, measures taken to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., IPC measures such as mask-wearing, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving the ventilation of indoor spaces, respiratory etiquette, stay-at-home orders, reduced mobility) also likely reduced opportunities for onward human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. Potential cross-protection conferred from infection with or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and any reduction in MERS-CoV infection or disease severity and vice versa has been hypothesized but requires further investigation.",
          "No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and therapeutics are in development. Treatment remains supportive, focusing on managing symptoms based on the severity of the illness."

Although chikungunya outbreaks and endemic transmission occur annually in several countries and territories around the world, the Indian Ocean islands have not experienced major outbreaks for nearly two decades. In La Réunion, over 47 500 cases and twelve associated deaths have been reported as of 4 May 2025, with sustained high transmission across the island. In Mayotte, the first locally transmitted cases since 2005–2006 have been detected, raising concern about similar large outbreaks. Public health response measures, including enhanced surveillance, vector control activities, and novel targeted vaccination efforts, have been implemented to contain the outbreaks, however further outbreak activity in the islands of the Indian Ocean can be expected."

Cumulatively, from the start of the outbreak in August 2024 through 4 May 2025, over 47 500 confirmed cases of chikungunya and more than 170 000 consultations for suspected chikungunya have been reported on the island. The surge in cases was observed from early 2025 with weekly case counts increasing from 30 at the end of 2024 to 4000 during the week of 10-16 March 2025 (epidemiological week 11), indicating more than a 100-fold increase.",
          "The overall clinical presentation of the illness was generally mild; however, from 1 January to 4 May, 340 hospitalizations have been reported. Almost half (43%) of hospitalized patients were adults over 65 years old and approximately 25% were children under six months old. Over 95% of hospitalized patients had at least one risk factor for severe disease including comorbidity, age-group (over 65 years and infants) or pregnancy. Additionally, 74 pregnant women and 48 infants under six months were hospitalized for short-term monitoring (2-3 days).",
          "To date, 66 severe cases (defined as those with at least one organ failure) have been reported. These included 36 adults over 65 years of age with comorbidities, 7 people under 65 years of age with comorbidities and 23 infants under 3 months of age.  Over the course of the outbreak, 12 deaths that occurred between 9 March and 27 April (Epi weeks 11-17) in people over 70 years of age with comorbidities were classified as linked to chikungunya, and additional twenty-eight deaths are currently under investigation for chikungunya, including one neonatal death.",
          "The cumulative number of cases continues to increase, with the southern municipalities being the most affected by the virus, particularly Le Tampon. To date, all the municipalities have reported cases.",
          "The previous large outbreak in La Reunion occurred in 2005-2006 with estimated total cases ranging between from 244 000 to over 300 000.",

The first imported case was identified on 5 March in the Northeast of the Island, followed by further cases reported across multiple communes. This marks the first locally transmitted chikungunya cases since the 2005–2006 outbreak, which had resulted in approximately 7300 cases.

          "Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease that causes fever and severe joint pain. It is caused by a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus that belongs to the alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae . Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted to humans via the bites of infected female mosquitoes, most commonly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. These two species can also transmit other viruses, including dengue and Zika viruses. They bite primarily during daylight hours, and there may be peaks of activity in the early morning and late afternoon.",
          "Symptoms of chikungunya appear between 4 and 8 days (range 2–12 days) after the bite of the infected mosquito. Most symptoms are generally self-limiting and last for 2-7 days. The disease is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever, which is frequently accompanied by severe joint pain. Other common signs and symptoms include stiffness, arthritis, headache, fatigue and rash. The joint pain is often debilitating and usually lasts for a few days but may be prolonged, lasting for weeks, months or even years. Because symptoms in infected individuals are similar to those seen in other arbovirus infections, chikungunya may be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue and other arboviruses also occur.",
          "Although most patients recover fully from the infection, occasional cases of eye, heart and neurological complications have been reported with CHIKV infections. Patients at extremes of the age spectrum are at higher risk for severe disease, including newborns infected during delivery to infected mothers or bitten by infected mosquitoes in the weeks after birth, and older people with underlying medical conditions. Patients with severe disease require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage that can be fatal.",
          "Once an individual has recovered, available evidence suggests they are likely to be immune from future chikungunya infections. Treatment is directed primarily at relieving the symptoms, including analgesics for joint pain and anti-pyretic drugs to reduce fever. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be administered until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. There is no specific antiviral drug treatment for chikungunya."

          "Chikungunya virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes and disease is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever frequently accompanied by severe joint pain and inflammation which is often very debilitating and may last for several months, or even years. Fatalities associated with infection can occur but are typically rare and occur in patients with severe chikungunya that is reported mostly in older adults with underlying medical conditions or infants infected during birth. Chikungunya virus can cause large epidemics, particularly when introduced in immunologically naive (not previously infected) human populations. These outbreaks have a high attack rate, placing a substantial demand on the public health system to conduct surveillance, case management, and differential laboratory diagnostic testing to differentiate chikungunya from illness due to co-circulating mosquito-borne viruses like dengue. Chikungunya virus can also be transmitted from viremic mothers to newborns during delivery, to laboratory workers handling chikungunya virus isolates or infected specimens, and possibly through transfusion of blood and blood products or through organ transplantation.",
          "Chikungunya outbreaks have been documented on islands within and countries bordering the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with large populations of Aedes spp. mosquitoes, mainly, Aedes aegypti. The large outbreaks in the Indian Ocean islands in 2005-2007, however, were characterized by increased transmission by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which were more abundant on La Réunion and Mauritius at that time and facilitated by a viral mutation that increased transmissibility in this vector.  La Réunion is once again experiencing a large chikungunya outbreak, and Mayotte has reported locally transmitted cases for the first time in almost 20 years, indicating reintroduction of the virus.",
          "Chikungunya can be introduced to new areas by infected travelers and may establish local transmission in the presence of vectors and a susceptible population.",
          "The impact of the current outbreaks depends on several factors, including the current capacities for a coordinated public health response and clinical management, and the proportion of susceptible population for arboviruses. This susceptible population includes people who do not have immunity due to no previous exposure to the virus as in this situation there has been the absence of transmission for the past 20 years. Young children, elderly individuals, and those with pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases are at higher risk of developing severe disease. Additionally, people living in areas with high mosquito populations and inadequate vector control measures are at greater risk of being infected. Effective public health strategies, including vaccination, vector control, and community education, are crucial in reducing the proportion of susceptible individuals and preventing outbreaks.",
          "In some areas, there is a lack of medical facilities with limited geographical access, making it difficult for people to access basic health care. Other challenges can be stockouts of several essential supplies for prevention and control, lack of reagents and consumables for laboratory diagnosis, and need for re-training field teams and health workers.",
          "La Réunion has reported the first large-scale outbreak in nearly two decades, and the onset of autochthonous transmission in Mayotte suggest that further outbreak activity in the Indian Ocean islands can be expected, with sufficient immunologically naïve humans and Aedes vector populations to sustain human-to-mosquito-to human transmission."

It is relevant to maintain close monitoring of the situation in the region with active cross-border coordination and information sharing because of the possibility of cases in neighbouring countries.",
          "WHO encourages countries to develop and maintain the capacity to detect and confirm cases, manage patients, and implement social communication strategies to gain community support to reduce the presence of the mosquito vectors. This includes training and alerting healthcare workers on case detection and potential complications, identifying risk groups for severe disease, ensuring appropriate clinical management, and following up on cases to prevent deaths. Targeted integrated vector surveillance and control measures are essential to reduce transmission rates.",
          "Chikungunya can cause large outbreaks with high attack rates, affecting one-third to three-quarters of naive populations with the potential to cause heavy burdens on healthcare systems. Early detection of severe disease progression and access to proper medical attention are key to addressing clinical complications and reducing mortality.",

For protection against mosquito bites, clothing that minimizes skin exposure to mosquitoes indoors and outdoors is advised. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions.",

          "As of 18 April 2025, a total of 2318 measles cases, including three deaths, have been confirmed in six countries in the WHO Region of the Americas, an 11-fold increase compared to the same period in 2024. The majority of cases have occurred among people between 1 to 29 years, who are either unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. Additionally, most cases are imported or linked to importation. Measles is a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can lead to severe complications and death. Although it is preventable with two doses of the vaccine, over 22 million children worldwide did not receive their first dose of the vaccine in 2023. This has contributed to a global rise in measles cases in 2024, which heightens the risk of imported infections, particularly from unvaccinated travellers arriving from areas where the virus is actively circulating.\r\nWHO is working closely with countries in the WHO Region of the Americas to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles. The regional risk is currently assessed as high, while the global risk remains moderate."

          "Argentina",
          "Between 1 January and 16 April 2025, Argentina reported 21 confirmed cases of measles; 10 in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and 11 in Buenos Aires Province. Of these, three cases were imported, 13 were identified as contacts linked to the imported cases, and five cases are still under investigation to determine their epidemiological link to the transmission chain.",
          "The index case was reported on 31 January 2025, in a child with a history of international travel. The second case, another child and a contact of the index case, was reported on 3 February 2025. Neither of the two cases had a history of measles vaccination, and both were laboratory-confirmed by RT-PCR. Following these initial cases, 19 additional cases were confirmed up to 16 April, with ages ranging from 5 months to 40 years. Two of these cases had a documented history of international travel. Only two cases required hospitalization due to pneumonia; the remaining cases were managed on an outpatient basis and are recovering well. Twelve of the cases were confirmed at the National Reference Laboratory of INEI-ANLIS \"Carlos G. Malbrán,\" with genotype B3 identified. One of the imported cases, associated with recent international travel to Thailand, was identified as genotype D8.",
          "Belize",
          "On 12 April 2025, the Belize Ministry of Health & Wellness confirmed two positive measles cases—Belize’s first since 1991. The cases involved 17-year-old males from the Corozal and Cayo districts with no vaccination history, who travelled to Chihuahua, México, from 5 January to 31 March 2025 to attend a religious gathering. The onset of symptoms occurred on 2 April and 3 April 2025. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for both cases and confirmed positive for measles on 12 April 2025. Thirteen close contacts who attended the religious gathering in Chihuahua were interviewed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) team and monitored daily for signs and symptoms. Despite significant efforts to increase vaccination coverage, Belize remains below the target range of 92-95%.  In 2024, Belize reported a country percentage of 83.9% for the second dose of the MMR vaccine.",
          "Brazil",
          "Between 1 January and 18 April 2025, Brazil reported five confirmed cases of measles across four locations: Federal District (1), Rio de Janeiro (2), Rio Grande do Sul (1), and São Paulo (1). The two cases in Rio de Janeiro are children under one year of age, both without a history of vaccination. The onset of symptoms was on 28 February and 2 March, 2025. The cases in the Federal District (symptom onset 1 March 2025) and Rio Grande do Sul (symptom onset 6 April 2025) are adults with a history of international travel. Additionally, an adult case reported in São Paulo who has a history of vaccination, and no history of international travel was reported with symptom onset on 4 April 2025. The source of infection for this case is currently under investigation.",
          "Canada",
          "Between 1 January and 12 April 2025, Canada reported 1069 confirmed and probable cases of measles from seven provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. These far exceed the 177 confirmed and probable cases reported in 2024, representing the highest annual case count since the country achieved measles elimination in 1998.",
          "The majority (83%) of the cases reported in 2025 are linked to a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak occurring among unvaccinated individuals in under-vaccinated communities that sometimes interact with one another.  Between 27 October 2024 and 12 April 2025, 971 cases have been reported in seven provinces. The outbreak was initiated by an internationally imported case that attended a large gathering in New Brunswick in October 2024, which included attendees from multiple provinces. Most cases associated with this outbreak are either unvaccinated (84%) or have unknown vaccination status (12%). To date, only a small number of outbreak-associated cases have occurred outside the initially affected under-vaccinated communities, with no evidence of significant further spread beyond these communities.",
          "Additionally, between 1 January and 12 April 2025, small numbers of localized outbreaks have been reported, consisting of two or more epidemiologically and/or virologically linked cases. These outbreaks are distinct from the multi-jurisdictional outbreak described above and have been directly related to internationally imported cases. During this same period, 16 measles cases in Canada have been attributed to international travel.",
          "Mexico",
          "Between 1 January and 16 April 2025, Mexico confirmed 421 measles cases: two imported, 35 import-related, and 384 under investigation. Cases were reported in Campeche (n= 4), Chihuahua (n= 403, including one death), Oaxaca (n= 4), Querétaro (n= 1), Sinaloa (n= 1), Sonora (n= 5), Tamaulipas (n= 2) and Zacatecas (n= 1).",
          "The first confirmed case is an unvaccinated child in Oaxaca with a history of international travel between October 2024 and January 2025. The child arrived in Mexico on 29 January and developed symptoms on 10 February. On 14 February, the Oaxaca State Public Health Laboratory reported positive RT-PCR and IgM results for measles with genotype B3 identified. Three related cases were later confirmed.",
          "On 20 February, the second confirmed case was reported in the State of Chihuahua in an unvaccinated child. The onset of symptoms was on 11 February, and measles was confirmed by the Chihuahua State Public Health Laboratory with positive RT-PCR and IgM results. The identified genotype was D8.  Following contact tracing and active case searches, 419 additional cases were identified.",
          "The majority of cases were among those aged 25–44 years, accounting for 34.4% (n= 145), followed by children aged 5–9 years (13,5%, n= 57). In terms of vaccination history, 92.4% (n= 389) had no vaccination history, while 3.8% (n=16) had received one dose of the MMR vaccine, and another 3.8% (n=16) had received two doses.",
          "United States of America",
          "As of 17 April 2025, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases were reported by 25 jurisdictions: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York State, New York City, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas (including two confirmed deaths), Vermont, and Washington. Of the total cases, 93% (n= 751) are associated with outbreaks (defined as three or more cases), with ten outbreaks identified so far this year. The outbreak in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma accounts for 82% of the reported cases.",
          "Children under the age of five accounted for 31% (n=249) of cases, individuals aged 5–19 for 38% (n=304), adults over 20 for 29% (n=231), and age was unknown for 2 % (n=16). The vast majority (96%) of the cases were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 1% had a single dose of the MMR vaccine, and 2% had received two doses. Hospitalization was required in 11% of total cases (n=85 of 800). Among children under five, 19% (47 of 249) required hospitalization. MMR vaccination coverage in children has decreased in recent years from 95.2% in 2019-2020 to 92.7% in 2023-2024."

          "Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease that affects individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children worldwide. The disease is airborne, transmitted through the air or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons.",
          "Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-14 days after infection, include high fever, rash usually accompanied by a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots inside the mouth. The rash appears 2-4 days after the onset of fever and spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities. A person is infectious about four days before and up to four days after the rash appears. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, most people recover within 2-3 weeks.",
          "Measles is usually a mild or moderately severe disease. However, measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, secondary ear infection, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), blindness, and death. Postinfectious encephalitis can occur approximately in about one in every 1000 infected persons. Measles also produces immune amnesia; a pathological process that makes the immune system forget how to protect against infections and leaves the infected individual more vulnerable to other infections.",
          "The measles vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines available. A two-dose schedule is 97% effective in preventing measles for life.",
          "Following the declaration of measles elimination in the Americas Region in 2016, there was an unusual and consistent increase in confirmed cases of the disease from 2017 to 2019. In 2019, the region recorded its highest incidence rate at 21.5 cases per million population. This increase was largely due to large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil, which led to the reestablishment of endemic measles transmission and the loss of elimination status in these countries.  Between 2018 and 2023, the Americas Region reported 49 187 confirmed cases in 18 countries, resulting from the importation of viruses from other regions of the world and the resurgence of endemic transmission in Venezuela and Brazil.  The last endemic case of measles in the Americas Region was reported by Brazil in June 2022. By 2024, 465 confirmed cases were registered, all either imported or related to importation. That same year, the elimination of the endemic disease in the Americas Region was reverified."

Although an improvement has been achieved in measles rubella surveillance indicators, there are still countries that do not meet the minimum notification rate of two suspected cases per 100 000 population, in addition to other indicators, in a homogeneous way. This could delay detection, notification, confirmation, and rapid response actions.",
          "Difficulty in maintaining adequate levels of vaccination in the migrant population, vaccine-hesitant groups and other at-risk populations within the Region are big challenges. Given that several countries in Europe, Central Asia and Africa have areas of circulation of the virus, the identification of imported cases from these areas is expected. Intense migration from areas where the disease is endemic to areas where it is not could increase the risk of new outbreaks and cases. Considering population movement, international travel and mass gathering events, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out. Travellers from regions with ongoing outbreaks can introduce the virus into countries with higher vaccination coverage, where there are still vulnerable populations, particularly infants who may not yet have received their first dose of the measles vaccine.",

These challenges have resulted in gaps in vaccination coverage, leading to widening pockets of the unvaccinated population and creating a pathway for measles to spread. This not only poses a public health concern for affected countries but also represents a potential risk for other regions due to international travel and population movement. The global risk of transmission remains a threat and particularly in areas with moderate or low vaccine coverage and could lead to new outbreaks in an unvaccinated population. This risk, coupled with gaps in laboratory systems and surveillance, outbreak detection and rapid response capacity, impedes progress towards global measles elimination goals and further exacerbates the threat of spread."

          "WHO recommends strengthening epidemiological surveillance and preparedness and rapid response capacities in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to suspected measles cases. Providing a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the re-establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose and by implementing rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with continuous and effective communication channels across all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management and infection prevention and control capacity to avoid health care-associated infection transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to airborne infection isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms.",
          "WHO recommends providing broad access to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) or measles and rubella (MR) vaccination to maintain high vaccination rates of the general population and to ensure individuals at high risk of exposure are up to date on this vaccination, such as health and care personnel and international travellers. Individuals living in outbreak areas should follow local public health guidance. Globally, between 2000 and 2023, vaccination successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths (6 million deaths in the Americas) and decreased an estimated measles death from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2023, which is an 87% decrease.",
          "WHO recommends maintaining a stock of the MR and/or MMR vaccines, and syringes/supplies for responding to imported cases. Facilitating access to vaccination services according to the national scheme to incoming and outgoing international travellers, including individuals due to perform activities, domestically or abroad, in areas with ongoing measles outbreaks, displaced populations, indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations.",
          "WHO advises international travellers to check and update their vaccination status against measles prior to departure. Unvaccinated individuals from areas experiencing measles outbreaks, with knowledge of exposure to measles cases and/or presenting signs and symptoms compatible with measles virus infection, should consult local health authorities before undertaking an international voyage. At present, no additional measures that significantly interfere with international traffic are warranted."

          "Sudan virus disease is a severe disease, caused by a virus, Sudan virus (SUDV), belonging to the same family as Ebola virus. It can result in high case fatality. It is typically characterized by acute onset of fever with non-specific symptoms/signs (e.g., abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, sore throat) usually followed several days later by nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and occasionally a variable rash. Hiccups may occur. Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, and spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., central nervous system, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with transmission risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, health and care providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days, but typically is 7–11 days."

              "Ring vaccination trial: Uganda’s Ministry of health, with support from WHO and its partners, launched a vaccine trial against the Ebola Sudan virus, the first to assess the clinical efficacy of a vaccine specific to the Ebola Sudan virus. The trial was initiated only four days following the outbreak declaration, reflecting the urgency of the response while maintaining rigorous ethical and regulatory standards. After the outbreak was confirmed on 30 January, researchers from the Uganda Makerere University and the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), with support from WHO, conducted the vaccination trial and rings of contacts of all confirmed cases were defined and randomized. The trial followed the ring vaccination protocol, in which contacts of confirmed cases are offered the vaccine in rings that are randomized to receive the vaccine immediately or later to assess vaccine efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. The protocols and research priorities were developed in an open collaborative approach via the Marburg virus vaccine (MARVAC) Consortium and via the Collaborative Open Research Consortium (CORC) for the Filoviridae Family. This was possible because of the dedication of Uganda’s health workers, the involvement of communities, the Ministry of Health of Uganda, Makerere Lung Institute and UVRI, and research efforts led by WHO involving hundreds of scientists through its research and development Filoviruses network. Vaccines were donated by International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), funding support was provided by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), European Union Health Emergency Preparedness and Response (EU HERA) and Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC), with further support from Africa CDC. Therapeutics trial : Several candidate therapeutics are currently advancing through clinical development, no licensed treatment is yet available to effectively address potential future outbreaks of Ebola disease caused by the Sudan virus species.

          "Risk communication and community engagement is crucial to successfully controlling SVD outbreaks. This includes raising awareness of symptoms, risk factors for infection, protective measures and the importance of seeking immediate care at a health facility. Sensitive and supportive information about safe and dignified burials is also crucial. Awareness should be built through targeted campaigns and direct work with affected and proximate communities, with special attention to engage with traditional healers, clergy, ‘boda boda’ drivers and community leaders, who are important sources of information for the community. Findings from rapid qualitative assessments should be implemented to collect socio-behavioural data, which can then be used to inform response pillars. Priority areas to strengthen, based on recent evidence are mortality surveillance, contact tracing and safe and dignified burials.  Misinformation and rumours should be addressed to foster trust and promote early symptom reporting.",
          "Early initiation of intensive supportive treatment increases the chances of survival. All above-mentioned interventions need to be thoroughly implemented in affected areas to stop chains of transmission and decrease disease mortality. Cases, contacts and individuals in affected areas who present signs and symptoms compatible with case definitions should be advised not to travel and to seek early care at designated facilities to improve their chances of survival and limit transmission.",

Since 2020, WHO has convened scientific deliberations and set up an independent process to review candidate medical countermeasures (MCMs) prioritization and clinical trial designs. One candidate vaccine and two candidate therapeutics (a monoclonal antibody and an antiviral) have been recommended and are available in country and are being assessed (clinical efficacy and safety) through randomized clinical trial protocols.",

There have been reports of A(H5N1) outbreaks in birds in Durango, although the exact source of infection in this case remains under investigation. To date, no further cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) linked to this case have been identified.\r\nIn accordance with the IHR (2005), any human infection caused by a new influenza A virus subtype is considered a potentially significant public health event and is subject to mandatory notification to WHO.\r\nBased on the information currently available on this and previous cases, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by A(H5N1) viruses as low. For individuals with occupational exposure to these viruses, the risk of infection is considered low to moderate. The situation may change as more information is gathered and so WHO continues to closely monitor these viruses and the global epidemiological situation."

          "The case is a child under the age of 10 years from the state of Durango who tested positive for influenza A(H5N1) at the Instituto de Diagnóstico y Referencia Epidemiológicos (InDRE, by its Spanish acronym). The case did not have any underlying medical conditions, had not received seasonal influenza vaccination, and had no history of travel.",
          "Symptoms began on 7 March 2025 with fever, malaise, and vomiting. On 13 March, the case was admitted to hospital due to respiratory failure and antiviral treatment was initiated the next day. The case was transferred to a tertiary care hospital on 16 March and died on 8 April due to respiratory complications.",
          "On 18 March, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected, and the sample was processed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The result was influenza A, non-subtypable. The sample was sent to the Centro de Investigación Biomédica del Noroeste (CIBIN, by its Spanish acronym), IMSS Monterrey, where the result was confirmed as influenza A, non-subtypeable, along with simultaneous detection of parainfluenza 3 virus. On 31 March, the sample was forwarded to the Laboratorio Central de Epidemiología (LCE, by its Spanish acronym) “La Raza,” where it was molecularly identified as influenza A(H5). On 1 April, the sample was received by InDRE, where the positive result for influenza A(H5N1) was confirmed by RT-PCR. The sample was further characterized as avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b genotype D1.1.",
          "The source of infection remains under investigation. During contact tracing, 91 individuals were identified, including 21 household contacts, 60 healthcare workers, and 10 individuals from a childcare center. Pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from 49 contacts tested negative for influenza A(H5N1). To date, no further cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) linked to this case have been identified.",
          "According to information from the National Service for Agrifood Health, Safety and Quality (SENASICA per its acronym in Spanish), between January 2022 and August 2024, 75 outbreaks of A(H5N1) in poultry were reported across various regions of Mexico including: Aguascalientes (5), Baja California (4), Chiapas (1), Chihuahua (3), Guanajuato (2), Jalisco (17), México City (7), Michoacán (1), Nuevo León (1), Oaxaca (2), Puebla (2),  Sonora (8), Tamaulipas (1), Veracruz (1), Yucatán (20). At the end of January 2025, SENASICA confirmed a new case of high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) in a sick vulture at the Sahuatoba Zoo in Durango, the state where the case lived. Following this, the death of a Canada goose with neurological and hemorrhagic symptoms was reported at the Peña del Aguila dam in Durango. A total of 25 sick birds were reported, and the presence of HPAI A(H5) was confirmed at a laboratory in Gómez Palacio, in Durango. A positive case of avian influenza A(H5) was also recorded in a bird at Las Auras Park."

Human infections are predominantly acquired through direct contact with infected animals or exposure to contaminated environments. Based on the original host species, influenza A viruses can be categorized into subtypes such as avian influenza, swine influenza, and other animal-origin influenza subtypes.",
          "Human infection with avian influenza viruses may result in a spectrum of illness, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe, life-threatening conditions. Clinical manifestations include conjunctivitis, respiratory, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis, and encephalopathy. In some cases, asymptomatic infections with the A(H5N1) virus have been detected in individuals with known exposure to infected animals and environments.",
          "A definitive diagnosis of human avian influenza infection requires laboratory confirmation. WHO regularly updates its technical guidance on the detection of zoonotic influenza, utilizing molecular diagnostic methods such as RT-PCR. Clinical evidence indicates that certain antiviral agents, particularly neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir), have been shown to shorten the duration of viral replication and improve patient outcomes in some cases.",
          "From 2003 to 10 April 2025, 972 cases of human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1), including 470 deaths (CFR 48.4%), have been reported to WHO from 24 countries. Almost all of these cases have been linked to close contact with infected live or dead birds, or contaminated environments."

Timely sharing of virus isolates remains essential to inform comprehensive risk assessments.",
          "In instances where humans are exposed to outbreaks of influenza A viruses in domestic poultry, wild birds, or other animal species—or when a human case is confirmed or suspected—enhanced surveillance of potentially exposed populations should be promptly initiated.",
          "Surveillance strategies should account for healthcare-seeking behaviors within the affected population and may include a combination of active and passive methods, such as intensified case finding through ILI/SARI sentinel systems, active hospital-based screening, and targeted surveillance among high-risk occupational groups. Additional data sources, including traditional healers, private healthcare providers, and non-governmental diagnostic laboratories, should also be integrated where applicable to enhance the comprehensiveness of surveillance.",
          "Considering the widespread detection of avian influenza viruses among poultry, wild birds, and select mammalian species, the general public is advised to avoid direct contact with sick or deceased animals. Any suspected dead birds or mammals, as well as any requests for their removal, should be reported to the appropriate local veterinary or wildlife authorities to ensure safe handling and testing.",
          "All poultry products, including eggs and meat, should be thoroughly cooked and handled with proper food safety precautions. Consumption of raw milk is discouraged due to potential health risks. WHO advises consuming pasteurized milk and if pasteurized milk is not available, heating raw milk until it boils to make it safer for consumption.",
          "In the event of a confirmed or suspected human infection with a novel influenza A virus of pandemic potential, including avian-origin strains, a comprehensive epidemiological investigation should be initiated. This should include detailed assessment of animal exposure history, travel history, and identification of close contacts, even prior to laboratory confirmation. The epidemiological investigation should also include early identification of unusual events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical specimens from confirmed or suspected cases should be tested and referred to a WHO Collaborating Centre for further virological characterization. Additional samples should be collected from animals, the environment or any foods suspected to be sources of infection.",
          "Individuals working in poultry production and processing environments should take additional health precautions as they are at higher risk of exposure to avian influenza and other zoonotic diseases due to their close contact with birds and potentially contaminated environments.",
          "Farm workers who have direct or close contact with animals or materials infected or contaminated with avian influenza A(H5) virus should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to minimize their risk of exposure.",
          "Currently, there are several vaccines licensed for preventing influenza A(H5) virus infection in humans, although their availability is limited. Candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness have been selected to protect against A(H5) disease in humans based on circulating strains. Existing seasonal influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against avian influenza A(H5) viruses, based on currently available data. However, it is important that individuals who may have frequent exposure to infected or potentially infected birds or other animals get a seasonal influenza vaccine, as it would contribute to decreasing the risk of co-infection and possible genomic recombination of avian and human viruses, which could result in new strains with pandemic potential. Close monitoring of the epidemiological, clinical and virological situation, further characterization of recent human, poultry, and other animal influenza viruses, and serological investigations remain essential for assessing risk and adjusting risk management measures as needed.",
          "WHO advises travelers to regions experiencing animal influenza outbreaks to avoid contact with live animal markets, farms, slaughter sites, or any environments with potential contamination from animal excreta. Adherence to hand hygiene and safe food handling practices is strongly recommended.

Additionally, between 11 February and 18 March 2025, the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional IHR contact point received reports of six isolated cases of IMD, either through notification or bilateral communication with IHR NFPs. These cases involve individuals who had recently returned from Umrah. \r\nMeningococcal disease remains a global public health concern, particularly in the context of mass gathering events such as Hajj and Umrah. \r\nThe government of Saudi Arabia regularly issues health requirements for Hajj and Umrah, including vaccination policies. As of 10 March 2025, KSA health authorities estimated that only 54% of international Umrah pilgrims had complied with the meningococcal vaccination requirements. The significant number of pilgrims traveling to KSA from countries with varying levels of meningococcal disease incidence presents a risk of international spread during these gatherings. Given the recent notification of these cases linked to Umrah, WHO strongly advises all individuals planning to attend mass gatherings such as Hajj and Umrah to receive vaccination against meningococcal disease at least 10 days prior to travel."

          "Among the 11 confirmed cases, four were reported from three countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, while the remaining cases are individuals with travel history from countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region. The median age of cases was 36 years (range 6 – 69 years) and 64% were male. The cases were diagnosed between 7 January and 2 March 2025, and none of the affected individuals had a history of vaccination against meningococcal disease. All cases received treatment in hospitals in KSA, fully recovered and were discharged. Serogrouping tests identified the causative strain as Neisseria meningitidis ( N. meningitidis) serogroup W135 .",
          "In addition, between 11 February and 18 March 2025, the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional IHR contact point received reports—either through notifications or bilateral communication with IHR NFPs —of six isolated cases of IMD among individuals who had recently returned from Umrah. Of these, three cases were reported from the WHO Europe Region and three cases were from the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. The median age of cases was 19 years (range 6 – 30 years).

          "Meningococcal disease occurs worldwide, and can present as a sporadic, clustered or epidemic-prone infection with varying degrees of endemicity across regions. Outbreaks are more likely to occur in settings that facilitate transmission of infection, such as areas with low vaccination coverage, overcrowded living conditions, limited or disrupted access to healthcare services, and mass gatherings, including religious pilgrimages like Hajj and Umrah.  In the KSA, public health authorities conduct regular risk assessments and continue to identify meningococcal disease as a significant public health threat during mass gatherings. Thus, the requirement of quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination (MenACWY), which protects against serogroups A, C, W, and Y, prior to traveling to KSA for Hajj and Umrah has been maintained in the previous years.  However, vaccination compliance for Umrah was declined over the past two years.",
          "The significant number of pilgrims arriving in KSA from countries with diverse meningococcal disease prevalence increases the risk of international spread. In 2024, 12 cases of meningococcal disease associated to Umrah and/or pilgrimage to KSA were reported from the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and France. Of these, nine patients were unvaccinated, and the vaccination status of remaining three was unknown.  Antimicrobial susceptibility data was available for 11 of the 12 cases, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains were identified in three cases. In 2025, to date, 17 cases associated with travel to KSA for religious pilgrimage have already been reported from multiple countries."

          "Umrah is a year-round pilgrimage to Mecca in KSA. The risk of meningococcal disease at mass gatherings like Hajj and Umrah is increased due to the high population influx, the person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets, and the presence of pilgrims from diverse geographical regions and prolonged close contact—resulting from shared accommodations and participation in rituals. In 2024, it was estimated that 24 million pilgrims performed Umrah, with 50% of those being international pilgrims. Mass gatherings such as those occurring during the Umrah pilgrimage can facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases, including IMD.",
          "Since 2001, strict preventative measures, including mandatory quadrivalent (MenACWY) meningococcal vaccination has mitigated the risk of pilgrimage-associated meningococcal outbreaks. While MenACWY vaccination is highly effective in reducing the risk of outbreaks during Hajj and preventing transmission to the home countries of pilgrims, there are challenges in ensuring the vaccination of the pilgrims in their countries of origin since the compliance with the public health advisory is voluntary. As of 10 March, it was estimated by KSA health authorities that only 54% of international Umrah pilgrims have complied with the meningococcal vaccination requirements.  As returning travelers may spread the disease to their local communities, this risk is further heightened when there is lower compliance with meningococcal vaccination among pilgrims.",
          "Preparedness and surveillance efforts must be maintained year-round, with particular emphasis during peak periods like Ramadan and school holidays that often see a sharp increase in pilgrim numbers. In addition, the risk of importation of meningococcal disease is increased during the epidemic season in the countries of the African meningitis belt (i.e. December through June), several of which are home to large Muslim populations. This potentially affects not only the pilgrims but also other travelers (including those traveling for non-religious purposes) and the wider community.",
          "Another risk factor is the emergence of antibiotic resistance for N. meningitidis strains to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin) and potentially third generation cephalosporins, which can complicate post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment options for individuals with IMD. The growing influx of tourists and relatively long incubation period may account for increased risk of international spread."

It is primarily associated with poor sanitation and limited access to safe water. The disease can cause severe acute watery diarrhea, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The speed of spread depends on exposure levels, population vulnerability, and environmental conditions. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal if left untreated.",

While most infected individuals remain asymptomatic, they can still shed the bacteria in feces for up to 10 days, potentially spreading the infection to others. Among symptomatic cases, most experience mild to moderate illness, while a smaller proportion develop severe diarrhea and vomiting, which can lead to life-threatening dehydration. However, cholera is highly treatable, with most cases successfully managed through prompt administration of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS).",

          "Angola is experiencing a substantial cholera outbreak with a significant proportion of deaths occurring in the community, exacerbating cholera transmission by delaying case detection and response, hindering timely public health interventions, and increasing environmental contamination through unsafe burials. The high CFR of 3.9% highlights critical challenges, including late case presentation, gaps in surveillance and early response, inadequate healthcare capacity, and barriers to accessing life-saving treatment, particularly in underserved areas. Inadequate access to clean water and sanitation continues to leave Angola highly vulnerable to cholera outbreaks, especially in densely populated urban centers and remote rural communities. The rainy season (October-April), with its associated heavy rainfall and flooding, directly amplifies this risk by contaminating water sources and facilitating rapid cholera transmission. Flood-prone provinces like Bengo face a heightened risk of further spread as the season progresses.",
          "Angola shares borders with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, both currently experiencing cholera outbreaks. Frequent population movement between Angola and surrounding countries heightens the risk of cross-border transmission, particularly in high-mobility areas like Luanda.",
          "Given the ongoing outbreak, the rainy season, and Angola’s proximity to cholera-affected countries, the risk of further spread within Angola and to neighboring countries is considered very high. Cholera transmission may escalate without effective public health measures, including WASH improvements, and vaccination campaigns. The risk remains elevated nationally and regionally due to the interconnectedness of populations and the seasonal conditions that facilitate the spread of waterborne diseases."

The key measures to address cholera include strengthening surveillance systems, improving water supply, sanitation, and hygiene, promoting risk communication and community engagement, providing effective treatment, and using OCV. Countries affected by cholera are encouraged to enhance their national preparedness and surveillance capabilities to rapidly detect and respond to potential outbreaks.",
          "WHO emphasizes the importance of timely and proper case management, ensuring access to safe drinking water, and improving sanitation infrastructure. Effective infection prevention and control measures are critical to reducing transmission of cholera and other pathogens that can cause health care-associated infections in facilities caring for patients with cholera. WHO recommends risk communication and community engagement interventions to build trust and empower communities with evidence-based information, enabling them to make informed decisions to protect their health.",
          "Promoting preventive hygiene practices and food safety in communities is one of the most effective strategies to control cholera. Public health risk communication is vital to ensure that communities understand the importance of hygiene, safe food practices, and the use of oral rehydration solutions (ORS). Rapid access to ORS is essential, especially in rural areas where larger health centers may not be easily accessible. Educating communities on how to prepare ORS at home, along with emphasizing the importance of staying hydrated while seeking medical care, can significantly reduce the risk of severe outcomes. With timely care, the case fatality rate can be kept below 1%.",
          "Long-term measures, such as improving water and sanitation infrastructure in cholera-prone areas, are critical for preventing cholera and other waterborne diseases. Sustainable solutions for clean water, sanitation, and hygiene are not only crucial for controlling cholera but also contribute to broader public health goals such as poverty reduction and education. Community involvement in planning and implementing these solutions is key to ensuring long-term success.",
          "OCV campaigns are an important tool for controlling cholera outbreaks. When used alongside improvements in water and sanitation, OCV can help prevent the spread of cholera, particularly in high-risk areas. Strong risk communication efforts are needed to manage vaccine demand, inform communities about vaccine schedules, and build trust regarding the vaccine’s safety and efficacy.",
          "WHO recommends that countries strengthen surveillance, particularly at the community level, for early detection of suspected cases and to prevent the spread of cholera. Cooperation between neighboring countries is crucial to control outbreaks, especially in regions with high cross-border movement. Strengthening these efforts will enable affected countries to effectively control and prevent cholera outbreaks, improving public health outcomes.",

          "On 13 March 2025, the Ministry of Health of the United Republic of Tanzania declared the end of the Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak. This declaration came after two consecutive incubation periods (a total of 42 days) since the last person confirmed with MVD died on 28 January 2025 and was given a safe and dignified burial, in accordance with WHO recommendations. No new confirmed cases were reported since then.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak was declared on 20 January 2025. As of 12 March 2025, two confirmed and eight probable cases were reported by the Ministry of Health from Biharamulo district in Kagera region. All 10 cases died (case fatality ratio 100%), including eight who died before the confirmation of the outbreak. \r\n\r\nA total of 272 contacts that were listed for monitoring completed their 21-day follow-up as of 10 February 2025.\r\n\r\nWHO, through its country office, and partners provided technical, operational and financial support to the government to contain this outbreak. The risk of re-emergence of MVD remains after the official declaration of the end of the outbreak, linked to the animal reservoir’s presence in the country. WHO encourages maintaining early case detection and care capacities in addition to sustaining the ability to quickly respond, and continued risk communication and community engagement."

          "MVD is a highly virulent disease that can cause severe disease and is clinically similar to Ebola disease (EBOD). EBOD and MVD are caused by orthoebolaviruses and orthomarburgviruses respectively; both are members of the Filoviridae family (filovirus). People become infected after prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by Rousettus fruit bat colonies, a type of fruit bat that can carry the Marburg virus.  Marburg virus then spreads between people via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. Health workers have previously been infected while treating patients with MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg virus.",
          "The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by the Marburg virus begins abruptly, with a high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea, and vomiting can begin on the third day. Although not all cases present with haemorrhagic signs, severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas of the body. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock. There is currently no approved treatment or vaccine for MVD. Some candidate vaccines and therapeutics are currently under investigation.",
          "Eighteen outbreaks of MVD have previously been reported globally. The most recent outbreak was reported in Rwanda between September and December 2024. Additional countries that previously reported outbreaks of MVD in the African Region include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda."

From 6 September 2024 to 28 February 2025, four laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including two deaths, were reported to WHO by the Ministry of Health of the KSA. One of the four cases was a secondary case exposed to the virus in a healthcare facility (nosocomial transmission). Close contacts of the four cases were followed up by the Ministry of Health. No additional secondary cases have been detected.\r\nThe notification of these four cases does not alter the overall risk assessment, which remains moderate at both the global and regional levels.\r\nThe reporting of these cases shows that the virus continues to pose a threat in countries where it is circulating in dromedary camels, particularly those in the Middle East."

          "Between 6 September 2024 and 28 February 2025, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) reported four cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including two deaths, with the last case being reported on 4 February 2025. The cases were reported from the Hail (2), Riyadh (1) and the Eastern (1) Provinces of the KSA (Figure 1). Laboratory confirmation of the cases was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between 8 November 2024 and 4 February 2025.",
          "All cases involved males aged between 27 and 78 years, and all presented with comorbidities. None were health workers, and from investigations only one was found to have indirect contact with dromedary camels (hosts of MERS-CoV) and their raw products (milk).",
          "Two cases, with symptoms onset in November 2024, were identified within the same hospital. The first case was confirmed on 11 November through RT-PCR testing, and follow-up on close contacts revealed a secondary case that shared the same hospital room and developed symptoms subsequently. Neither of the two patients had direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels, including consumption of raw camel milk in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.",
          "Since the first report of MERS-CoV in KSA in 2012, a total 2618 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, with 945 associated deaths (CFR 36%), have been reported to WHO from 27 countries, across all six WHO regions. The majority of cases (2209; 84%), have been reported from KSA, including these newly reported cases. Since 2019, no MERS-CoV infections have been reported from countries outside the Middle East."

          "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The fatality rate among confirmed cases is around 36%, though this may be an overestimate since milder cases often go undetected. The case fatality ratio (CFR) is calculated based solely on laboratory-confirmed infections, which may not reflect the correct mortality rate.",
          "Humans contract MERS-CoV through direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels, the virus’s natural host and zoonotic reservoir. While human-to-human transmission is possible, it has mainly occurred in close-contact situations, particularly in healthcare settings. Outside these environments, there has been limited human-to-human transmission to date.",
          "MERS can present with no symptoms, mild respiratory issues, or severe illness leading to acute respiratory distress and death. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing difficulties, with pneumonia frequently observed, though not always present. Some patients also experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea. Severe cases may require intensive care, including mechanical ventilation. Those at higher risk of severe outcomes include older adults, individuals with weakened immune systems, and those with chronic conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, or lung disorders.",
          "The number of MERS-CoV infections reported to WHO has substantially declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, this was likely the result of epidemiological surveillance activities for COVID-19 being prioritized. The similar clinical picture of both diseases may result in reduced testing and detection of MERS-CoV infections. In addition, measures taken to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., mask-wearing, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving the ventilation of indoor spaces, respiratory etiquette, stay-at-home orders, reduced mobility) also likely reduced opportunities for onward human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. Potential cross-protection conferred from infection with or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and any reduction in MERS-CoV infection or disease severity and vice versa has been hypothesized but requires further investigation.",
          "No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV-specific vaccines and therapeutics are in development. Treatment remains supportive, focusing on managing symptoms based on the severity of the illness."

          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections, including MERS-CoV, and to carefully review and investigate any unusual patterns.",
          "Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV in health care settings has been associated with delays in recognizing the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, delayed triage of suspected cases, and delays in implementing infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. IPC measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health care facilities. Health workers should consistently apply standard precautions, including risk assessment for any new onset of symptoms of respiratory infections, consistently with all patients, at every interaction in health-care settings.",
          "Contact and droplet precautions, which include patient placement in single rooms with dedicated care equipment, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as clean non-sterile gown, gloves, eye protection and a well-fitting medical mask, should be added to standard precautions when providing care to patients with MERS-CoV. Ventilation rates in patient care rooms should meet or exceed 60 litres per second per patient (or 6 air changes per hour). Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures or in settings where aerosol-generating procedures are conducted, including the use of procedure rooms with ventilation rates meeting or exceeding 160 litres per second (or 12 air changes per hour). Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate IPC measures in health-care settings and public health awareness can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.",
          "MERS-CoV infection appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and in immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus may be circulating. General hygiene measures should be adhered to, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals.",
          "Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk, contact with camel urine or eating camel meat that has not been thoroughly cooked. The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat, carries a high risk of infection from pathogens that may cause disease in humans. Animal products that are processed appropriately through cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption. Foods that have gone through these processes should be handled with care to avoid cross contamination with uncooked/unsafe foods. Camel meat and camel milk are nutritious products that can continue to be consumed after cooking, pasteurization or other thermal treatments.",
          "WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry regarding this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions."

The case was an under 5-year-old child identified at the Mulago Hospital where the patient presented with signs and symptoms meeting the suspect case definition. A laboratory sample was collected, and the child was confirmed with SVD on 26 February by PCR. Following investigations, two probable deaths linked to this case have been reported. This includes the child’s mother who was pregnant at the time of symptom onset on 22 January and died on 6 February. Her newborn child died on 12 February. The three deaths did not have a supervised burial.

          "Sudan virus disease is a severe disease, belonging to the same family as Ebola virus disease. It is caused by Sudan virus (SUDV) and can result in high case fatality. It is typically characterized by acute onset of fever with non-specific symptoms/signs (e.g., abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, sore throat) usually followed several days later by nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and occasionally a variable rash. Hiccups may occur. Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, and spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., central nervous system (CNS), eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, healthcare providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days, but typically is 7–11 days."

Since then, the virus has emerged periodically and up to now and prior to this current one, eight outbreaks caused by SUDV have been reported, five in Uganda and three in Sudan. The case fatality rates of SVD have varied from 41% to 70% in past outbreaks.",

Uganda reported five SVD outbreaks (one in 2000, one in 2011, two in 2012, and one in 2022).  The current outbreak is the sixth SVD outbreak in Uganda. Uganda also reported a Bundibugyo virus disease outbreak in 2007 and an Ebola virus disease outbreak exported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2019. The latest SVD outbreak in Uganda was declared over on 11 January 2023. A total of 164 cases with 55 deaths were reported in nine districts.",

The government, with support from partners is implementing several public health actions for effective control.",

Community deaths, care of patients in private facilities and hospitals and other community health services as well as at traditional healers with limited protection and infection prevention and control measures entail a high risk of many transmission chains. An investigation is ongoing to determine the source and the scope of the outbreak and the possibility of spread from the capital city, Kampala, to other districts. Exit screening has been set up at different points of entry to reduce the risk of potential exportation of cases to neighbouring countries."

          "Risk communication and community engagement is crucial to successfully controlling SVD outbreaks. This includes raising awareness of symptoms, risk factors for infection, protective measures and the importance of seeking immediate care at a health facility. Sensitive and supportive information about safe and dignified burials is also crucial. Awareness should be built through targeted campaigns and direct work with affected and proximate communities, with special attention to engage with traditional healers, clergy, ‘boda boda’ drivers and community leaders, who are important sources of information for the community. Findings from rapid qualitative assessments should continue to be implemented to collect socio-behavioural data, which can then be used to inform response pillars. Priority areas to strengthen, based on recent evidence are mortality surveillance, contact tracing and safe and dignified burials.  Misinformation and rumours should be addressed to foster trust and promote early symptom reporting.",
          "Early initiation of intensive supportive treatment increases the chances of survival. All above-mentioned interventions need to be thoroughly implemented in affected areas to stop chains of transmission and decrease disease mortality. Cases, contacts and individuals in affected areas who present signs and symptoms compatible with case definitions should be advised not to travel and seek early care at designated facilities to improve their chances of survival and limit transmission.",

Since 2020, WHO has convened scientific deliberations and set up an independent process to review candidate medical countermeasures (MCMs) prioritization and clinical trial designs. One candidate vaccine and two candidate therapeutics (a monoclonal antibody and an antiviral) have been recommended and are available in country and are being assessed (clinical efficacy and safety) through randomized clinical trial protocols.",

A therapeutics trial will start as soon as national authorities provide approval.",

          "On 9 February 2025, officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported to regional health authorities a cluster of 24 unexplained community deaths in a single village in Ekoto health area, Basankusu health zone, Equateur province. As of 25 February, a total of 53 deaths have been reported, with the last death occurring on 22 February. Deaths have occurred in all age groups, but adolescents and young adults, particularly males, appeared to be disproportionately affected in the initial cluster reported. Disease progression appeared to be fast, with a median time from onset of symptoms to death of one day. \r\n\r\nGiven the rapid decline in the incidence of reported deaths, their geographic clustering, the age profile of deaths and the rapid disease progression in the initial cluster, working hypotheses include chemical poisoning or a rapid onset bacterial meningitis cluster, on a background of malaria and other infectious illnesses endemic in the region. The definitive cause of illness remains undetermined, with initial samples testing negative for Ebola and Marburg viruses. Field investigations and additional laboratory testing are ongoing including but not limited to the cerebrospinal fluid testing and the toxicological analysis of environmental samples, including water and other samples to explore chemical causes. \r\n\r\nLocal authorities began surveillance with a broad case definition including any individual with fever and at least one other symptom, to better understand disease patterns. A total of 1318 patients had symptoms meeting the working suspected case definition as of 25 February 2025. Approximately 50% of malaria tests performed on these cases tested positive for malaria, the cases identified through this enhanced surveillance therefore likely reflect the various febrile illnesses in the area. With the available information, WHO assesses the local public health risk as moderate, and the national and global public health risk as low."

          "On 9 February 2025, an initial cluster of 24 community deaths of unknown origin were reported from a single village in Ekoto Health Area, Basankusu Health Zone, Equateur province, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This triggered an investigation by the Ministry of Health, supported by WHO.",
          "Enhanced surveillance was implemented shortly after, using a broad working case definition given the limited details on the clinical presentation, disease progression, demographic and other characteristics of the initial cluster. As of 25 February, a total of 53 deaths were reported (Figure 1). Deaths occurred across all age groups, but compared to the age and sex distribution of the population, appeared to disproportionately affect adolescents and young adult males, particularly in the initial cluster (Figure 2). This further pointed to an unusual event, as mortality from common causes in the area is usually highest among the elderly, and among young children (under five years) in a context of a high burden from infectious diseases, including malaria. The majority of deaths (50) occurred in the same village (Figure 3). Furthermore, the incidence of death rapidly declined following the initial cluster (Figure 1), suggesting this is not an event spreading in time or place.",
          "The preliminary findings of the in-depth analysis revealed that the median time from symptom onset to death in the initial cluster was one day, with a mean time of two days. Symptoms reported include fever, chills, headaches, muscle aches, abdominal pains, diarrhea, sweating, dizziness, shortness of breath, agitation, and others.",

          "Since the initiation of enhanced surveillance,1318 people reported symptoms meeting the working suspected case definition. However, given the broad nature of the case definition (fever and one other symptom from a range of general respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurological symptoms), the trends in cases are difficult to interpret, and most likely reflect the prevalence of a range of febrile illnesses in the community. This is further suggested by the age distribution broadly mirroring that of the population (Figure 2), and the high malaria positivity among cases that were tested (approximately 50% positive on rapid diagnostic tests), which is not deemed unusual in an area where malaria is hyperendemic.",
          "Figure 4: Epidemic curve showing suspected cases reported between 9 February to 25 February 2025, Basankusu health zone, Democratic Republic of the Congo. *",
          "Although the cases were initially identified using a broad (i.e. non-specific) case definition, given the localized nature of the cluster of deaths, the steady decline in incidence of deaths, the demographic profile of deaths, and the rapid disease progression in the initial cluster, working hypotheses are that of a contamination by a chemical poisoning–be it accidental or deliberate—or possibly a rapid onset bacterial meningitis cluster.",
          "Initial laboratory test results released on 13 February 2025 were negative for both Marburg and Ebola. Additional samples (blood, urine, oral, nasal) have been collected for further testing and investigations are ongoing. In addition, environmental samples–including water and other samples–are being collected to explore chemical causes, such as contamination by organophosphates.",
          "The definitive cause of illness remains undetermined. Further testing and field investigations are ongoing to better characterize the cases and deaths.",
          "Of note, this event in Basankusu follows a recent cluster of community deaths in the Bolomba Health Zone, which occurred from 10 to 27 January 2025. The epidemiological investigation documented 12 cases with eight deaths. Laboratory testing excluded Ebola and Marburg virus diseases and suggested that severe malaria could be the cause. While both Bolomba and Basankusu are located within Equateur Province, these health zones are separated by approximately 175 kilometers of difficult terrain including dense forests and poor road infrastructure; epidemiological investigation has found no evidence linking these distinct events."

          "Since the initial cluster of deaths was reported on 9 February 2025, there has been an overall downward trend in deaths. The most recent death was reported on 22 February 2025. Current epidemiological information suggests a localized event with a steady decline in incidence, not expanding in time and place. Given the clinical presentation of deaths and the speed from symptom onset to death in this unusual cluster, current differentials include a rapid onset bacterial meningitis cluster or a contamination by a chemical poisoning as key hypotheses in a context of high incidence of other common infectious diseases in the areas, particularly malaria.",
          "Operational challenges related to this event involve the isolation of Basankusu and resulting logistical barriers, as it is located in a forested region, approximately 450 kilometers from the nearest major city of Mbandaka and has poor infrastructure. The remoteness of Basankusu has hindered the timeliness of the initial investigation and response activities and poses challenges to laboratory testing. Samples must be collected, stored, and shipped long distances to a larger city with laboratory testing capacity (either Mbandaka or Kinshasa), introducing delays in diagnosis. Access to care is another key challenge, as the region lacks robust healthcare services, and the region’s poor infrastructure makes travel to neighboring health zones difficult, leading to delays in treatment.",
          "The province faces a severe urban water crisis with only 5% of its urban population having access to drinking water. The water network suffers frequent leaks and has never been rehabilitated. Many households rely on unregulated private water sources such as wells, springs and streams which pose contamination risks.",
          "With ongoing investigations and given that the causative agent of the cluster is not yet determined, there remains a level of risk attributed to the event. As such, the overall public health risk level to the affected communities is assessed as moderate.",
          "At the national level, however, the risk is considered low due to the localized nature of the event and apparent decreasing incidence. Similarly, at the regional and global levels, the risk is low at this time."

As of 20 February 2025, a total of nine confirmed cases, including one death have been reported with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 11%. Cases ages range from 1.5 to 49 years, with a mean age of 27 years and males accounted for 56% of the total cases. The cases were reported from four districts in the country which include Jinja, Kampala, Mbale, and Wakiso (Figure 1).",
          "The first reported case, who was a health worker, had symptom onset on 19 January in epidemiological week 3 (Figure 2). The case initially self-medicated with antimalarials and sought care in different health facilities located in Wakiso, Kampala and Mbale districts, as well as a traditional healer in Mbale, before being referred to Mulago referral hospital, where he died on 29 January 2025. Following the detection and confirmation of SVD on 29 January, the case was accorded a safe and dignified burial on 31 January in Mbale.",
          "Following the prompt declaration of the outbreak by the Ministry of Health on 30 January, a detailed case investigation was conducted on the first case including comprehensive contact listing in all the districts where the case travelled. Contacts were quarantined in a designated facility and monitored for 21 days. The other eight reported confirmed cases were among the listed contacts and include family members (five cases) and health workers (three) who had direct contact with the first case as they provided care during his illness.  The secondary cases had symptom onset between 29 January to 6 February. All were detected at early onset of their disease by contact tracing team while in quarantine. They were referred to Mulago National Referral Hospital (seven cases) and Mbale Regional Referral Hospital (one case) for optimized supportive care and received Remdesivir under the Monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI) protocol. All eight cases were discharged on 18 February 2025 after two negative tests carried out 72 hours apart.",

          "Based on the WHO criteria to declare the end of a filovirus outbreak , a countdown to the end of the human-to-human transmission can be started from the day after the last possible exposure, in this case, the day following negative tests. Should no additional cases be reported, the outbreak will be declared over in 42 days, that is two incubation periods. Several activities including heightened surveillance for a period of 42 days is recommended to ensure that there are no missed chains of transmission.",
          "As of 20 February, a cumulative of 299 contacts have been listed from affected districts in the country since the start of the outbreak. Over 75% of contacts have completed the 21-day follow-up period. However, 58 are still being monitored in institutional quarantine facilities to complete a 21-day since the last contact with a confirmed case.",
          "Alert levels both from the community and the health facilities have been low. Several activities, including training and active case search are ongoing during the 42-day countdown to strengthen surveillance with integrated approach and increase the number of alerts and suspected cases reported, investigated and tested. Mortality surveillance has also been set up since the declaration of the outbreak and will continue in Jinja, Kampala and Mbale.",
          "In addition, retrospective investigations are ongoing to find the source of the outbreak through active case search in and around the community and health facilities where the first case was residing and working.",
          "This is the sixth outbreak of SVD in Uganda, the most recent outbreak was reported in September 2022 with 164 cases and 55 deaths."

          "Sudan virus disease is a severe disease, belonging to the same family as Ebola virus disease. It is caused by Sudan virus (SUDV) and can result in high case fatality. It is typically characterized by acute onset of fever with non-specific symptoms/signs (e.g., abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, sore throat) usually followed several days later by nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and occasionally a variable rash. Hiccups may occur. Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, healthcare providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days, but typically is 7–11 days."

          "Sudan virus disease (SVD) is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans. Sudan virus (SUDV) was first identified in southern Sudan in June 1976. Since then, the virus has emerged periodically and up to now and prior to this current one, eight outbreaks caused by SUDV have been reported, five in Uganda and three in Sudan. The case fatality rates of SVD have varied from 41% to 70% in past outbreaks.",
          "SUDV is enzootic and present in animal reservoirs in the region. Uganda reported five SVD outbreaks (one in 2000, one in 2011, two in 2012, and one in 2022).  The current outbreak is the sixth SVD outbreak in Uganda. Uganda also reported a Bundibugyo virus disease outbreak in 2007 and an Ebola virus disease outbreak exported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2019. The latest SVD outbreak in Uganda was declared over on 11 January 2023. A total of 164 cases with 55 deaths were reported in nine districts.",

          "In the absence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of SVD, the risk of potential serious public health impact is high. Community deaths, care of patients in private facilities and hospitals and other community health services as well as at traditional healers with limited protection and infection prevention and control measures entail a high risk of many transmission chains. An investigation is ongoing to determine the source and the scope of the outbreak and the possibility of spread from the capital city, Kampala, to other districts. Exit screening has been set up at different points of entry to reduce the risk of potential exportation of cases to neighbouring countries."

          "Risk communication and community engagement is crucial to successfully controlling SVD outbreaks. This includes raising awareness of symptoms, risk factors for infection, protective measures and the importance of seeking immediate care at a health facility. Sensitive and supportive information about safe and dignified burials is also crucial. Awareness should be built through targeted campaigns and direct work with affected and proximate communities, with special attention to engage with traditional healers, clergy, and community leaders, who are important sources of information for the community. Rapid qualitative assessments should be implemented to collect socio-behavioural data, which can then be utilized to guide the response.  Misinformation and rumours should be addressed to foster trust and promote early symptom reporting. Early initiation of intensive supportive treatment increases the chances of survival. All above-mentioned interventions need to be thoroughly implemented in affected areas to stop chains of transmission and decrease disease mortality. Cases, contacts and individuals in affected areas who present signs and symptoms compatible with case definitions should be advised not to travel and seek early care at designated facilities to improve their chances of survival and limit transmission.",
          "WHO encourages countries to implement a comprehensive care programme to support people who recovered from Ebola disease with any subsequent sequelae and to enable them to access body fluid testing and to mitigate the risk of transmission through infected body fluids by adequate practices.",
          "Collaboration with neighbouring countries should be enhanced to harmonize reporting mechanisms, conduct joint investigations, and share critical data in real-time. Surrounding countries should enhance readiness activities to enable early case detection, isolation and treatment.",
          "A range of candidate vaccines and therapeutics are under different stage of development. Since 2020, WHO has convened scientific deliberations and set up an independent process to review candidate MCMS prioritization and clinical trial designs. One candidate vaccine and two candidate therapeutics (a monoclonal antibody and an antiviral) have been recommended and are available in country and are being assessed (clinical efficacy and safety) through randomized clinical trial protocols.",
          "Thanks to preparedness measures that the government took after the previous outbreak in 2022, and a global research collaboration led by WHO (first MARVAC now FILOVIRUS CORC), a trial of a candidate vaccine was launched just four days after the outbreak was declared. A therapeutics trial will start as soon as national authorities provide approval.",

          "MVD is a highly virulent disease that can cause severe disease and is clinically similar to Ebola disease (EBOD).  EBOD and MVD are caused by orthoebolaviruses and orthomarburgviruses respectively; both are members of the Filoviridae family (filovirus). People become infected after prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by Rousettus fruit bat colonies, a type of fruit bat, that can carry the Marburg virus.  Marburg virus then spreads between people via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. Health workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg virus.",
          "The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea and vomiting can begin on the third day. Although not all cases present with haemorrhagic signs, severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptoms onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas of the body. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock. There is currently no approved treatment or vaccine for MVD. Some candidate vaccines and therapeutics are currently under investigation.",
          "Eighteen outbreaks of MVD have previously been reported globally. The most recent outbreak was reported from Rwanda between September and December 2024. Additional countries that previously reported outbreaks of MVD in the African Region include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, South Africa, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda."

The outbreak thus far involves 10 cases (eight probable and two confirmed), including 10 deaths, resulting in a CFR of 100%. One case was a healthcare worker, highlighting the risk of nosocomial transmission. The source of the outbreak is still unknown. The delayed detection and isolation of cases could lead to a missed chain of transmission.",
          "The regional risk is considered high due to Kagera's strategic location as a transit hub, with significant cross-border movement of the population to Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This highlights the potential for spread into neighbouring countries.  MVD is not easily transmissible (i.e. in most instances, it requires contact with the body fluids of a sick patient presenting with symptoms or with surfaces contaminated with these fluids). However, it cannot be excluded that a person exposed to the virus may travel.",
          "The global risk is currently assessed as low . There is no confirmed international spread at this stage, although there are concerns about potential risks. Kagera region of Tanzania, while not close to the country’s capital or major international airports, is well-connected through transportation networks, and has an airport that connects to Dar es Salaam for onward travel outside Tanzania by air. This highlights the need for enhanced surveillance and case management capacities at relevant points of entry and along borders, as well as close coordination with neighbouring countries to strengthen readiness capacities."

          "Sudan virus disease is a viral hemorrhagic fever disease, belonging to the same family as Ebola virus disease. It is caused by Sudan virus (SUDV). It is a severe disease with high case fatality. It is typically characterized by acute onset of fever with non-specific symptoms/signs (e.g., abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, sore throat) usually followed several days later by nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and occasionally a variable rash. Hiccups may occur. Severe illness may include hemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, healthcare providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days, but typically is 7–11 days."

Since then, the virus has emerged periodically and up to now and prior to this current one, eight outbreaks caused by SUDV have been reported, five in Uganda and three in Sudan. The case fatality rates of SVD have varied from 41% to 70% in past outbreaks.",

Uganda reported five SVD outbreaks (one in 2000, one in 2011, two in 2012, and one in 2022).  The current outbreak is the sixth SVD outbreak in Uganda. Uganda also reported a Bundibugyo virus disease outbreak in 2007 and an Ebola virus disease outbreak exported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2019. The latest SVD outbreak in Uganda was declared over on 11 January 2023. A total of 164 cases with 77 deaths were reported in nine districts.",

Community deaths, care of patients in private facilities and hospitals and other community health services as well as at traditional healers with limited protection and infection prevention and control measures entail a high risk of many transmission chains. An investigation is ongoing to determine the scope of the outbreak and the possibility of spread to other districts and potential exportation of cases to neighbouring countries cannot be ruled out at this stage."

Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for infection and prevention measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission.",
          "Early initiation of intensive supportive treatment increases the chances of survival. All above-mentioned interventions need to be thoroughly implemented in affected areas to stop chains of transmission and decrease disease mortality. Cases, contacts and individuals in affected areas who present signs and symptoms compatible with case definitions should be advised not to travel and seek early care at designated facilities to improve their chances of survival and limit transmission.",

In 2022, WHO convened expert deliberations to review candidate products prioritization and trial designs. One candidate vaccine and two candidate therapeutics (a monoclonal antibody and an antiviral) are available in country and will be made available through clinical trial protocol.",

Although Zika virus is not unexpected in Maharashtra state, given the wide distribution of the vectors, Aedes aegypti, and Aedes albopictus , across India, the number of ZVD cases reported in Maharashtra state in 2024 is much higher than the numbers reported in previous years and is thus unusual.

It is important to eliminate these mosquito breeding sites by appropriate methods, including covering water storage containers, removing standing water in water-holding containers such as vases and flowerpots, and cleaning up trash, unused containers, and used tyres. Community initiatives are essential to support local health authorities and national public health programmes to reduce mosquito breeding sites. Health authorities may also advise the use of larvicides and insecticides to reduce mosquito populations and disease spread. Semi-urban areas should prevent the breeding of Aedes spp., in rubber plantations and other stagnant pools of water.",

On 30 December, he was transferred to the local Health Center of the municipality due to worsening symptoms, where he died the same day. Blood samples were collected on 30 December before his death and sent to the National Center of Tropical Diseases (CENETROP), which confirmed CHAPV detection through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR specific for CHAPV) testing on 2 January 2025.",

          "CHHF is a rare zoonotic disease caused by the CHAPV, a group of viruses belonging to the Mammarenavirus genus of the Arenaviridae family. These viruses are primarily transmitted to humans through infected rodents that serve as their natural hosts. Human transmission of Mammarenaviruses occurs mainly by inhalation of fine aerosol particles contaminated with virus-infected rodent excreta, such as urine, feces, or saliva.  Human-to-human transmission is uncommon but has been documented, particularly in healthcare settings where infection prevention and control (IPC) measures are inadequate. This mode of transmission occurs through contact with the blood or bodily fluids of infected individuals and can be amplified during aerosol-generating medical procedures.",
          "The incubation period ranges from 4 to 21 days, after which individuals may develop symptoms including fever, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, and in severe cases, haemorrhagic manifestations. Due to the nonspecific nature of early symptoms, CHHF can be challenging to diagnose, often requiring laboratory confirmation through methods like real-time polymerase chain reaction.",
          "Currently, there is no specific antiviral treatment for CHHF; management focuses on supportive care to alleviate symptoms and maintain vital organ function. Case fatality rates for CHAPV infections range from 15% to 30% in untreated patients, with rates as high as 67% reported during outbreaks. Preventive measures emphasize reducing human exposure to rodent populations and implementing stringent IPC practices in healthcare settings to mitigate the risk of transmission.",
          "CHHF is currently known to only occur in Bolivia. In the last 20 years, four outbreaks have been documented in the country. The first was reported in 2003 in Chapare Province, Cochabamba Department, involving a single fatal case. In 2019, a second outbreak occurred in La Paz Department, resulting in nine cases, including four deaths (case fatality rate: 60%). This second outbreak was caused by a different CHAPV strain than the one identified in 2003. The third outbreak took place in 2021 in La Paz Department, with three confirmed cases (two fatal). The most recent outbreak occurred in 2024 with one laboratory-confirmed case, also within La Paz Department."

          "One of the main challenges in detecting and responding to CHHF and other South American haemorrhagic fevers due to Mammarenavirus is the difficulty of making an early differential diagnosis due to the non-specificity of the initial clinical presentation. CHHF and other South American haemorrhagic fevers due to Mammarenavirus (e.g., Argentinian haemorrhagic fever, Bolivian haemorrhagic fever, and Sabia virus disease) should be considered for any patient presenting with suggestive symptoms originating from areas where Mammarenaviruses are known to circulate. These diseases should also be part of the differential diagnosis along with other endemic diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and bacterial infections. Environmental exposures, such as evidence of rodent activity in or around the home, contact with rodent excreta, or visiting or working in areas where rodents are prevalent, should be carefully considered as key epidemiological risk factors. Case ascertainment should involve asking about exposure to rodents or contact with patients suspected of having haemorrhagic fevers due to Mammarenavirus . For biosafety reasons, all samples from suspected cases in regions where CHHF has previously been reported should be managed as Mammarenavirus samples, even for differential diagnosis.",
          "In Bolivia, the geographical at-risk area is limited to rural areas in the northern part of the La Paz department, particularly along a jungle corridor from Caranavi to Teoponte municipalities, passing through the town of Palos Blancos, where the reservoir is found. Currently, CHHF is reported only in Bolivia. There is no significant risk of international spread of the disease, as person-to-person transmission of the Chapare virus is possible but remains rare in the general population. Continued surveillance, public awareness, and adherence to infection prevention and control measures are critical to preventing further spread and mitigating future outbreaks."

          "WHO recommends remaining vigilant and raising awareness among healthcare workers to detect, diagnose, and manage cases of haemorrhagic fever while ensuring strict compliance with infection prevention and control measures. Surveillance should focus on detecting suspected cases of haemorrhagic fever based on the clinical manifestations, travel history, and exposure history, tailored to the epidemiological context of the country or territory. Any individual who has had contact with the blood or bodily fluids of a suspected, probable, or confirmed haemorrhagic fever case during their illness is considered a contact. Contact monitoring should be performed for a maximum incubation period of 21 days following the last known exposure.",
          "Laboratory confirmation of Mammarenavirus infection can be performed using various methods, including virological and serological techniques. However, the dynamics of Mammarenavirus infections (e.g., the duration of viraemia versus the appearance of antibodies) are not yet fully understood, and no serological assays have yet been validated for CHAPV. All biological samples should be treated as potentially infectious, handled only by trained personnel, and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.",
          "Patients with suspected or confirmed CHHF should be isolated in a single room with a dedicated sink and toilet. Movement of patients with suspected or confirmed CHHF should be limited, however if patient ambulation outside of the room is necessary the patient should wear a medical mask during ambulation. All health and care workers in close contact with a patient with suspected or confirmed CHHF or who enter the isolation room should apply contact and droplet precautions, including the use of the following personal protective equipment: gown, examination gloves, medical mask, and eye protection (goggles or face shield). If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed on a patient with suspected or confirmed CHHF, the procedure should take place in a negative pressure airborne infection isolation room with the door closed. All health and care workers present in a room where an aerosol generating procedure is taking place should use airborne precautions in addition to contact and droplet precautions, including use of a fit-tested filtering facepiece respirator (e.g. N95).",
          "Routine cleaning and disinfection of the isolation room of a patient with suspected or confirmed CHHF should occur three times daily, and spot cleaning should occur immediately whenever there is a spill or material contamination of blood or body fluids. Cleaning may be performed with soap and water applied by cloth, followed by disinfection with a 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution; allowing the disinfectant to remain wet and untouched on the surface for a contact time of at least five minutes. All disposable waste that is generated in the patient room should be managed as infectious waste. Linens from isolation rooms are advised to be bagged and handled using contact precautions during transport to laundry areas and washed separately from other patient linens. Reusable medical equipment used on a patient with suspected or confirmed CHHF should be labelled as biohazardous and managed appropriately during transport and reprocessing in a medical device reprocessing department. Patients should be advised to place the lid down when flushing their dedicated toilet to avoid generating bioaerosols.",
          "Ribavirin has been described as a treatment option for haemorrhagic fevers caused by some Mammarenaviruses ; however, its efficacy and safety have not been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials. Supportive care, including hydration, rest, and treatment of complications, is recommended. Evaluation and management of co-infections such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, or bacterial infections should also be considered."

          "Introduction",
          "On 13 January 2025, WHO informed its Member States and IHR State Parties of an outbreak of suspected Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) in the Kagera region of the United Republic of Tanzania using our secure web-based platform—the Event Information Site (EIS). Under the International Health Regulations, the EIS is used to issue rapid alerts to Member States of acute and rapidly developing public health risks and events with possible international implications.",
          "Summary of the situation",
          "On 10 January 2025, WHO received reliable reports from in-country sources regarding suspected cases of MVD in the Kagera region of the United Republic of Tanzania. Six people were reported to have been affected, five of whom had died. The cases presented with similar symptoms of headache, high fever, back pain, diarrhoea, haematemesis (vomiting with blood), malaise (body weakness) and, at a later stage of disease, external haemorrhage (bleeding from orifices).",
          "As of 11 January 2025, nine suspected cases were reported including eight deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) of 89%) across two districts – Biharamulo and Muleba.  Samples from two patients have been collected and tested by the National Public Health Laboratory. Results are pending official confirmation. Contacts, including healthcare workers, are reported to have been identified and under follow-up in both districts.",
          "The Bukoba district in Kagera region experienced its first MVD outbreak in March 2023, and zoonotic reservoirs, such as fruit bats, remain endemic to the area. The outbreak in March 2023 lasted for nearly two months with nine cases including six deaths."

The suspected outbreak thus far involves at least nine suspected cases, including eight deaths, resulting in a high CFR of 89%. Healthcare workers are included among the suspected cases affected, highlighting the risk of nosocomial transmission. The source of the outbreak is currently unknown.",
          "The reporting of suspected MVD cases from two districts suggests geographic spread. The delayed detection and isolation of cases, coupled with ongoing contact tracing, indicates lack of a full information of the current outbreak. More cases are expected to be identified.",
          "The regional risk is considered high due to Kagera region's strategic location as a transit hub, with significant cross-border movement of the population to Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Reportedly, some of the suspected cases are in districts near international borders, highlighting the potential for spread into neighbouring countries.  MVD is not easily transmissible (i.e. in most instances, it requires contact with the body fluids of a sick patient presenting with symptoms or with surfaces contaminated with these fluids). However, it cannot be excluded that a person exposed to the virus may be travelling.",
          "The global risk is currently assessed as low . There is no confirmed international spread at this stage, although there are concerns about potential risks. Kagera region, while not close to Tanzania's capital or major international airports, is well-connected through transportation networks, and has an airport that connects to Dar es Salaam for onward travel outside Tanzania by air. This highlights the need for enhanced surveillance and case management capacities at relevant points of entry and borders, and close coordination with neighbouring countries to strengthen readiness capacities."

In addition, 25 suspected cases tested negative for MVD. Additional epidemiological information on the cases including the health status is not currently available. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing related to additional probable and suspected cases reported previously and a field mission, comprising of experts from the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners is being deployed.",

          "In many countries of the Northern Hemisphere, trends in acute respiratory infections increase at this time of year. These increases are typically caused by seasonal epidemics of respiratory pathogens such as seasonal influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other common respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), as well as mycoplasma pneumoniae. \r\nMany countries conduct routine surveillance for acute respiratory infections and common respiratory pathogens. Currently, in some countries in the temperate Northern hemisphere, influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) rates have increased in recent weeks and are above baseline levels, following usual seasonal trends. Seasonal influenza activity is elevated in many countries in the Northern hemisphere. Where surveillance data is available, trends in RSV detections currently vary by region with decreases reported in most regions except in North America.\r\nRecently, there has been interest in hMPV cases in China including suggestions of hospitals being overwhelmed. hMPV is a common respiratory virus found to circulate in many countries in winter through to spring, although not all countries routinely test and publish data on trends in hMPV . While some cases can be hospitalized with bronchitis or pneumonia, most people infected with hMPV have mild upper respiratory symptoms similar to the common cold and recover after a few days.\r\nBased on data published by China, covering the period up to 29 December 2024, acute respiratory infections have increased during recent weeks and detections of seasonal influenza, rhinovirus, RSV, and hMPV, particularly in northern provinces of China have also increased. The observed increase in respiratory pathogen detections is within the range expected for this time of year during the Northern hemisphere winter. In China, influenza is the most commonly detected respiratory pathogen currently affecting people with acute respiratory infections. WHO is in contact with Chinese health officials and has not received any reports of unusual outbreak patterns. Chinese authorities report that the health care system is not overwhelmed and there have been no emergency declarations or responses triggered.\r\nWHO continues to monitor respiratory illnesses at global, regional and country levels through collaborative surveillance systems, and provides updates as needed."

These increases are typically caused by seasonal epidemics of respiratory pathogens such as seasonal influenza, RSV, and other common respiratory viruses, including hMPV, as well as mycoplasma pneumoniae. The co-circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens during the winter season can sometimes cause an increased burden on health care systems treating sick persons.",
          "Currently, in some countries in the temperate Northern hemisphere, influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) rates have increased in recent weeks and are above baseline levels, following usual seasonal trends. Influenza activity is elevated in many countries in Europe, Central America and the Caribbean, Western Africa, Middle Africa, and many countries across Asia, with the predominant seasonal influenza type and subtype varying by location, typical for this time of year, except during most of 2020 and 2021, when there was little influenza activity during the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 1). SARS-CoV-2 activity as detected in sentinel surveillance and reported to Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), along with wastewater monitoring from the reporting countries, is currently low in countries in the Northern hemisphere following prolonged high level activity during summer months in the Northern hemisphere. Where surveillance data is available, trends in RSV activity are variable by region with downward trends observed in most subregions of the Americas, except in North America where RSV activity has increased, and decreases have been observed in the European region in recent weeks. Some countries conduct routine surveillance and report trends for other commonly circulating respiratory pathogens, such as hMPV, and report such information on a routine basis. Some countries in the Northern hemisphere have reported increased trends, varying by virus, in recent weeks, typical for this time of year.",

          "There has been international interest in a potential increase of respiratory virus transmission in China, particularly hMPV, including suggestions of hospitals being overwhelmed. China has an established sentinel surveillance system for ILI and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), including hMPV, and conducts routine virological surveillance for common respiratory pathogens with detailed reports published weekly on the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. [1] Surveillance and laboratory data for hMPV is not available routinely from all countries.",
          "According to the most recent surveillance data on acute respiratory infections shared by the China CDC with data up to 29 December 2024, there has been an upward trend of common acute respiratory infections, including those due to seasonal influenza viruses, RSV and hMPV – as expected for this time of year during the Northern Hemisphere winter. Influenza is currently the most reported cause of respiratory disease, with the highest positivity rate among all monitored pathogens for all age groups except children aged 5-14 years for whom mycoplasma pneumoniae had the highest positivity rate. SARS-CoV-2 activity remains low however with an increase in reported severe COVID-19 cases. The predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant in the country is XDV and its sublineages accounting for  59.1% detection among sequenced samples. ILI activity in China’s northern and southern provinces have been increasing since late 2024, following the previous year’s trends. Current ILI activity in the southern provinces remains below that of the previous two years, while current ILI activity in the northern provinces is similar to levels seen at this time in the previous two years.",
          "China’s reported levels of acute respiratory infections, including hMPV, are within the expected range for the winter season with no unusual outbreak patterns reported. Chinese authorities confirmed that the health care system is not overwhelmed, hospital utilization is currently lower than this time last year, and there have been no emergency declarations or responses triggered. Since the expected seasonal increase was observed, health messages have been provided to the public on how to prevent the spread of respiratory infections and reduce the impact of these diseases."
