Of the 95 suspected cases, 4 tested positive for dengue virus by RT-PCR. The first case of dengue was confirmed approximately two weeks prior to the confirmation of Zika virus infection. This indicates co-circulation of the two viruses in the same community. Of the remaining 91 suspected cases, 30 were negative for both dengue and chikungunya. Suspected cases are distributed across all ages, with the highest number concentrated in the age group 25-34. Women account for the majority of cases (66%)."

Laboratory confirmation that VDPV type 2 is circulating in Myanmar was received on 7 November 2015. The circulating VDPV2 was isolated from a 16-month-old boy who developed acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on 5 October. The child had not been previously vaccinated against polio. This strain is from the same VDPV2 strain isolated earlier this year from a polio case (a 28-month-old child) that had developed AFP on 16 April. The two cases are from the same township in Rakhine state. The genetic changes of the isolates detected in April and October suggest that the cVDPV2 may have been circulating for more than one year.",

As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern. WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions."

A training workshop was conducted for all health care workers to enhance their capacity for the early detection and prompt management of cases. Surveillance is ongoing in the surrounding villages and districts for early detection of cases. Entomological surveillance revealed the presence of Aedes aegypti larvae and adult mosquito at the sites where cases are living; consequently, entomological control measures for dengue vector were immediately set up. So far, these measures have resulted in a dramatic decline in the density of adult mosquito (from 23% to 0%) and larvae (from 25% to 0.5%). Entomological surveillance and vector control measures continue to be implemented in the affected villages and its surrounding areas."

The switch from trivalent to bivalent OPV, planned in April 2016, will reduce the risk of cVDPV substantially (as 90% of cVDPV is caused by type 2) and sets the stage to eventually stop using OPV altogether and transition to the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which cannot cause cVDPV.",

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice. Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials.

There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya.

Cholera is predictable and preventable, and can ultimately be eliminated where access to clean water and sanitation facilities, and satisfactory hygienic conditions are ensured and sustained for the whole population. Effective cholera prevention and control interventions rely primarily on the implementation of integrated multidisciplinary and comprehensive approaches that involve activities outside the health sector and that address several elements, including environmental living conditions, access to treatment and clinical management of cases, vaccination with Oral Cholera Vaccines, social mobilization of communities and epidemiological surveillance."

          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice. Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems."

          "Plague is a bacterial disease caused by Yersinia pestis, which primarily affects wild rodents. It is spread from one rodent to another by fleas. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which produces the characteristic plague bubo (a swelling of the lymph node). If the bacteria reach the lungs, the patient develops pneumonia (pneumonic plague), which is then transmissible from person to person through infected droplets spread by coughing. If diagnosed early, bubonic plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Pneumonic plague, on the other hand, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases; patients can die 24 hours after infection. The mortality rate depends on how soon treatment is started, but is always very high. The current outbreak follows another plague outbreak that occurred in Madagascar between 2014 and 2015, with a peak in November 2014 when over 335 cases and 79 deaths were reported."

          "Circulating VDPVs are rare but well-documented strains of poliovirus that can emerge in some populations which are inadequately immunized. A robust outbreak response can rapidly stop such events. Given substantial vaccination coverage gaps across the country and subnational surveillance deficits, the risk of further spread of this strain within the country is deemed to be high. The emergence of cVDPV strains underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage. WHO currently assesses the risk of international spread from Ukraine to be low, but notes that the infected oblast shares borders with four countries (Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland).",

Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.",

          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice. Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems."

          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice. Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems."

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed.

Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice. Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems. CORRIGENDUM * Updated on 29 July 2015.

Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed.

          "Suspected cases have been increasing very quickly, tripling over the last two weeks. This is the first large-scale meningitis outbreak caused by Neisseria meningitides serogroup C to hit any country in Africa’s meningitis belt.",
          "Eleven districts from the regions of Niger, including the capital city, have crossed the epidemic threshold. This comprises all five districts in Niamey, where 4,099 suspected cases, including 226 deaths, have been reported. The outbreak is of high concern because it affects a densely populated urban area of more one million people, creating a high risk of rapid spread and a large caseload.",
          "Laboratory tests have confirmed the predominance of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) serogroup C in the affected areas, with Nm serogroup W also being identified in several patient samples. Although serogroup C has been the predominant cause of meningitis in wealthy countries, it has never been of high concern in Africa.",
          "Over the past 40 years, serogroup C has caused only sporadic cases and a few localized outbreaks in Africa, generally of mixed serogroup A and C origin. These outbreaks occurred in Nigeria in 1975, in Niger in 1991, and in Nigeria in 2013–2014.",
          "Viewed against this historical pattern, the outbreak in Niger is an alarming development. Since this is the first large outbreak in Africa of meningitis caused by serogroup C, vaccines against this form of the disease are in short supply.",
          "A national epidemic committee has been activated to manage the outbreak. An international team, composed of staff from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was deployed to support the Ministry of Public Health’s investigation of the outbreak and reinforce the country’s surveillance capacity.",
          "WHO and partners are providing support to the government of Niger for the implementation of mass vaccination campaigns and other emergency control measures. Instrumental in this effort is the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control (ICG). ICG is a partnership uniting WHO, UNICEF, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and Médecins sans Frontières (MSF). It works closely with vaccine manufacturers. It was established in 1997 following exceptionally large and deadly meningitis outbreaks in Africa.",
          "To date, ICG has approved four vaccination requests. Vaccines released include 460,000 doses of the older polysaccharide vaccine (produced by Instituto Finlay and Bio-Manguinhos), which protects against the A, C and W serogroups, and 200,000 doses of the newer conjugate vaccine (produced by Sanofi-Pasteur), which protects against serogroups A,C, W, and Y.",
          "The conjugate vaccine, which is produced in small quantities for use in the US and European markets at prices that are unaffordable in Africa, was a result of the intervention of ICG and financial support from the GAVI Alliance. In addition, Niger’s government has obtained 200,000 doses of polysaccharide ACWY vaccine from the government of Mali.",
          "Since multivalent conjugate vaccines were licensed in the US and Europe, the production of polysaccharide vaccines has dropped considerably and is now largely limited to use by international travellers. No further polysaccharide multivalent vaccines are available outside the stockpile maintained by ICG.",
          "In response to this emergency situation, WHO, on behalf of ICG, has negotiated with public sector vaccine manufacturers and the pharmaceutical industry to start the urgent production of multivalent polysaccharide vaccines. An additional 640,000 doses will be dispatched to Niger in the coming weeks.",
          "Vaccine campaigns targeting children aged 2 to 15 years are ongoing in 8 of the 11 epidemic districts, including Niamey. MSF is supporting the Ministry of Public Health with teams of doctors and case management facilities; 18,500 vials of ceftriaxone, a highly effective antibiotic, have been made available with ICG support. Thanks to these interventions, case fatality from meningitis has dropped in the past few weeks from 11% to 6.8%. WHO and partners are supporting the Ministry of Health in the outbreaks surveillance, population sensitization and preventive measures.",
          "Outbreaks of meningitis pose an enormous burden to the populations of African countries. The area known as the African meningitis belt, which stretches across the continent from Senegal to Ethiopia, affecting 21 countries, is hyperendemic for this disease. Cases frequently recur, with periodic outbreaks during the dry season, which runs from December to June.",
          "Large-scale outbreaks in 1996–1997 caused more than 200,000 cases, including 20,000 deaths. The most recent large outbreak occurred in 2009, causing more than 80,000 cases, mainly in Nigeria and Niger. The vast majority of these outbreaks were caused by serogroup A.",
          "Since 2010, a new conjugate vaccine, MenAfriVac, which protects against serogroup A and costs less than $1 a dose, has been progressively introduced in preventive mass campaigns in countries of the African Belt. The new vaccine was developed especially for Africa by the Meningitis Vaccine Project, coordinated by WHO and PATH.",
          "Since introduction of the new vaccine, the number of meningitis A cases in Africa has decreased dramatically, with no outbreaks caused by this serotype occurring in vaccinated areas (see the Weekly Epidemiological Record published on 27 March 2015 – among the Related Links).",
          "The meningitis A conjugate vaccine is the only currently available and affordable vaccine that can be used to prevent meningitis outbreaks in Africa, as it confers long-lasting immunity. All other vaccines used in Africa for other serogroups are the older polysaccharide vaccines, which confer immunity lasting only 3 to 5 years. These vaccines are now used only in the emergency response to outbreaks, and are not suitable for the preferred objective of prevention.",
          "Following introduction of the meningitis A conjugate vaccine, the market for polysaccharide vaccines shrank considerably and is now largely limited to international travellers. The International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control, or ICG, which manages an emergency vaccine stockpile, has been instrumental in maintaining an adequate supply of these older polysaccharide vaccines for use in emergencies.",
          "To prepare for the 2015 epidemic season, WHO and its partners in ICG sent an advance request to vaccine manufacturers for 1.5 million doses of multivalent polysaccharide vaccines and 1.5 million doses of the new meningitis A conjugate vaccine.",
          "Due to production problems with one manufacturer, this request could not be fully met. To fill the gap in the stockpile supply, WHO asked two public sector manufacturers, the Instituto Finlay in Cuba and Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil, and one pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, to supply 600,000 and 500,000 doses of polysaccharide vaccine respectively.",
          "This vaccine shortage highlights the importance of accelerating the development of a multivalent conjugate vaccine affordable for the people and governments of Africa. For now, WHO continues to work with ICG and other partners to ensure that the stockpile of polysaccharide vaccines is maintained at a level sufficiently high to manage future outbreaks in Africa’s meningitis belt."

From the first epicentre in downtown Kampala, the outbreak has now spread to all divisions in the capital city and to neighbouring districts. The most affected groups are young males aged between 20 and 39 years. The majority of cases work in the business sector or as casual labourers. Food and juice vendors and cooks are also affected, hence the potential for wide spread of the disease. At the beginning of the outbreak Salmonella Typhi was laboratory-confirmed in 4 of 16 tested specimens. Further specimens have been tested during the outbreak identifying 5 isolates of Salmonella paratyphi group A. Contaminated drinking water and juices have been identified as the main sources of infection. The majority of water sources that have been tested were heavily contaminated with Escherichia coli and fecal matter."

Symptoms usually develop 1–3 weeks after exposure, and may be mild or severe. They include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhoea, rose-coloured spots on the chest, and enlarged spleen and liver. Healthy carrier state may follow acute illness. Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. However, resistance to common antimicrobials is widespread. Healthy carriers should be excluded from handling food."

          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions."
