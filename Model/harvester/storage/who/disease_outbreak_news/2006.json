          "From February 2006 to 10 October 2006, the WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia has reported 151 districts in 8 states/provinces of India affected by chikungunya fever (see below). The affected states are Andhra Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Delhi. More than 1.25 million suspected cases have been reported from the country, which 752,245 were from Karnataka and 258,998 from Maharashtra provinces. In some areas reported attack rates have reached 45%.",
          "A team from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, health officials from Kerala and staff from the WHO India Office and Regional Office for South-East Asia investigated the outbreak in Kerala. They carried out clinical and epidemiological examinations of suspected cases in hospitals and at home, and collected clinical samples. An entomological survey revealed high densities of Aedes albopictus in the affected areas as well as in areas not affected by the disease.",
          "For personal protection, individuals should take measures to protect themselves against the bites of the mosquitoes which transmit the virus (including Aedes aegypti ), which are active during the daytime. Elimination of breeding sites can contribute to the reduction of mosquito densities. As a result, a key recommendation from the investigation team is for urgent vector control measures coupled with an intensive awareness campaign in the community. Health care staff at all levels, government officials and nongovernmental organizations are called upon to assist in this information and health education campaign. The Communication-for-Behavioural Impact methodology has been successful in mobilizing affected populations for vector control activities.",

          "The first case occurred in a five-year-old male from East Bekasi, West Java Province. He developed symptoms on 4 March 2006, was admitted to hospital on 6 March, and died on 19 March. Test results, using two different assays, showed high antibody titer for H5N1 on consecutive serum samples taken on days 11 and 15 of his illness. These test results are consistent with new WHO criteria for laboratory confirmation. A field investigation at the time found that the case was exposed to diseased poultry in the vicinity of his home, where some birds tested positive for the H5 virus subtype.",
          "The second case is a 27-year-old male from Solok, West Sumatra Province. This case was identified during the tracing of contacts of the man’s sister, a 15-year-old female who developed symptoms on 17 May 2006 and was subsequently confirmed to be H5N1 infected. Her brother spent six days caring for her during her hospital stay. The brother developed mild symptoms of cough and abdominal discomfort, with no fever, on 28 May 2006; his symptoms remained mild and he recovered within a few days.",
          "Despite his mild and atypical symptoms, the brother was tested as part of the Ministry of Health’s protocol for contact tracing and the management of any contacts with symptoms. He was given a five-day course of oseltamivir beginning on 1 June and was placed in voluntary isolation pending recovery.",
          "Initial tests of samples collected from the 27-year-old male were negative for H5N1 infection. In August, follow-up testing of paired-serum samples found a fourfold rise in neutralization antibody titer for H5N1, a test result which meets the WHO criteria for laboratory confirmation.",
          "The 27-year-old male reported no contact with diseased or dead poultry in the days prior to symptom onset as he spent most of his time at the hospital. The investigation determined that he had exposure to his sister during her hospital stay, and that human-to-human transmission could not be ruled out as the source of his infection.",

          "A team of experts is presently in the Cikelet subdistrict investigating the outbreak and monitoring for further cases. Three hamlets are the focus of investigation.",
          "The Cikelet subdistrict consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with a population of around 200 to 400 persons, many living in large extended families. The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding paths best accessed by foot or horseback.",
          "In this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are scanty or non-existent.",
          "Prior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the area. At that time, live chickens were purchased from an outside market in preparation for a religious feast and were integrated into local flocks. Shortly thereafter, chickens began dying in large numbers in an outbreak that continued throughout July and the first week of August, gradually spreading from one hamlet to another.",
          "As the population had no experience with this disease, high-risk behaviours commonly occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption. These exposures are, at present, thought to be the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases.",
          "Deaths from respiratory illness are known to have occurred in late July and early August, but no samples were taken and medical records are generally poor. Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from birds to humans.",
          "The cooperation of residents is good, house-to-house surveillance for febrile illness is continuing, and specimens have been taken from symptomatic persons and sent for testing. The team is well-supplied with antiviral drugs, and these are being administered prophylactically to close contacts of cases and therapeutically to persons showing symptoms of influenza-like illness."

This 17-year-old male developed symptoms on 26 July and is now recovering. Another death from severe respiratory disease occurred on 5 August in a 20-year-old neighbour, who is also now known to be a cousin. As no samples were taken for testing, the cause of his illness remains uncertain. Based on epidemiological and clinical findings, however, infection with the H5N1 virus is strongly suspected.",
          "As both young men developed symptoms on the same day (26 July), epidemiologists assume that they acquired their infection from a shared environmental source. The currently recognized incubation period for H5N1 infection of 2 to 8 days makes human-human transmission between the two highly improbable.",
          "Teams from local health authorities, the Ministry of Health, and WHO are currently in the three hamlets investigating these cases and assessing the overall situation. Team members include experts in animal health. Recent die-offs of poultry are known to have occurred in the village, and all three cases described above had documented exposure to diseased chickens.",
          "Heightened awareness in the hamlets, supported by the presence of well-equipped teams, has led to the presentation of additional persons for medical evaluation. Specimens have been taken and tests are being conducted. Rumours of additional deaths from respiratory disease in the hamlets in late July and early August are also being investigated.",

          "The Ministry of Health in China has today retrospectively confirmed a human case of H5N1 infection dating back to November 2003. The case occurred in a 24-year-old member of the military service based in Beijing. The man developed symptoms on 25 November 2003 and was hospitalized with pneumonia in Beijing. His condition deteriorated rapidly and he died of severe respiratory disease on 3 December 2003.",
          "Confirmation of this case marks the earliest known instance of human H5N1 infection in mainland China, and is now the first confirmed case in the present outbreak. Previously, the first confirmed cases were thought to have occurred in Viet Nam in December 2003.",
          "The case was initially reported by several Chinese researchers, affiliated with the military services, in a June 2006 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. According to that communication, doctors initially suspected the man might have been infected with the SARS virus. Although WHO declared the SARS outbreak over in July 2003, suspicions were high that the virus might return during the cooler months.",
          "Specimens tested for SARS infection prior to the man’s death were negative, but the cause of death remained undetermined. As stated in the published letter, stored specimens from the man subsequently tested positive for H5N1 infection. Successful isolation of the virus from these specimens was also reported.",
          "As the man’s illness was initially thought to be SARS, no history of possible poultry exposure was taken. The source of his H5N1 infection remains uncertain, particularly as no poultry outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza have been reported in Beijing.",
          "The Ministry of Health informed WHO that it had been unaware of these tests and their results prior to publication of the research letter. In line with WHO recommendations, confirmatory testing in a laboratory affiliated with the Ministry of Health was arranged. Following an official request, WHO sent laboratory experts to consult with national experts performing the tests. That joint undertaking, conducted in late July, confirmed the man’s infection with the H5N1 virus. These findings were further reviewed by a panel of experts, which concluded that the man’s H5N1 infection was now laboratory confirmed.",
          "Prior to this announcement, the first official laboratory-confirmed H5N1 case on the Chinese mainland occurred in Hunan Province in October 2005 and was reported to WHO in mid-November 2005.",
          "The case has been added to the WHO cumulative table of confirmed cases. Retrospective confirmation of the case brings the cumulative total in China to 20. Of these cases, 13 have been fatal.",
          "The Ministry of Health has informed WHO of its intention to strengthen communication mechanisms, and to ensure that more of the country’s research institutes are integrated into the reporting system. WHO will be providing support and guidance in these activities, as officially requested."

          "Test results have now convincingly ruled out H5N1 infection in all four nurses.",
          "Two of the nurses cared for siblings, a 10-year-old girl and her 18-year-old brother, who were hospitalized in Bandung, West Java, on 22 May and died the following day. Test results for both nurses are negative for H5N1 infection. One nurse was shown to be infected with a seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus, which is now circulating widely throughout Indonesia. The second nurse experienced only mild and transient symptoms, but was tested urgently as a precautionary measure. Her test results were also negative for H5N1 infection.",
          "The two additional nurses, who work at a hospital in Medan, North Sumatra, were involved in the care of confirmed H5N1 cases among members of an extended family from the village of Kubu Simbelang in Karo District. One of the nurses, a 34-year-old woman, experienced only mild symptoms and has subsequently tested negative for H5N1 infection. The second nurse, a 42-year-old woman, developed influenza-like illness on 1 June. Test results received today are also negative for H5N1 infection.",
          "The speed and thoroughness with which influenza-like illness in these nurses was investigated are indicative of the heightened concern among Indonesian health authorities. The negative test results for all four nurses provide reassuring evidence that the virus is not spreading efficiently or sustainably among humans at present."

          "The H5N1 virus is considered firmly entrenched in poultry throughout much of Indonesia. Unless this situation is urgently and comprehensively addressed, sporadic human cases will continue to occur.",
          "The newly confirmed case is one of several where exposure occurred despite a clear signal of a high-risk situation arising from poultry deaths. Pending better control of the disease in animals, WHO and officials in the Ministry of Health see an urgent need to improve public awareness of this disease, the risk factors for infection, and the behaviours that should be avoided."

          "Situation update",
          "Indonesian health authorities and WHO have further strengthened their response to the family cluster of cases in Kubu Simbelang village, Karo District, North Sumatra. As of today, 54 surviving family members and other close contacts of cases have been identified and placed under voluntary home quarantine. All of these people, with the exception of pregnant women and infants, are receiving the antiviral drug, oseltamivir, for prophylactic purposes. Public health teams visit these people daily, checking for symptoms.",
          "In addition, active house-to-house surveillance for influenza-like illness is being conducted throughout the village, which has around 400 households. A command post for fever surveillance has been functioning in the village since last week.",
          "As of today, no new cases suggestive of H5N1 infection have been detected since 22 May. This finding is important as it indicates that the virus has not spread beyond the members of this single extended family . No hospital staff involved in the care of patients, in some instances without adequate personal protective equipment, have developed the disease. The last person in the cluster, who developed symptoms on 15 May and died on 22 May, refused hospitalization. He moved between two villages while ill, accompanied by his wife. The wife is under surveillance and has not developed symptoms.",
          "Despite multiple opportunities for the virus to spread to other family members, health care workers or into the general community, it has not, on present evidence, done so.",
          "Current level of pandemic alert",
          "Based on an assessment of present evidence, WHO has concluded that the current level of pandemic alert is appropriate and does not need to change. The level of pandemic alert remains at phase 3. This phase pertains to a situation in which occasional human infections with a novel influenza virus are occurring, but there is no evidence that the virus is spreading in an efficient and sustained manner from one person to another.",
          "WHO has recommended continued close monitoring of the situation in Kubu Simbelang for the two weeks following 22 May, the date when the last known case in the cluster died. As a precautionary measure, Indonesian authorities have decided to extend this recommended period to three weeks.",
          "Preliminary results of the investigation",
          "This information differs in some details from information released in previous updates, but is derived from extensive investigations by senior national and international epidemiologists, from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who have developed a clearer picture of the situation.",
          "The cluster involves an initial case and seven subsequent laboratory-confirmed cases. All cases are members of an extended family: sisters and brothers and their children. Family members resided in four households. Three households were next-door neighbours in the village of Kubu Simbelang, Karo District, North Sumatra. The fourth household was located about 10 kilometres away in the nearby village of Kabanjahe.",
          "The initial case in the cluster was a 37-year-old woman who sold fruits and chillies at a market in the village of Tigapanah. Her stand was located about 15 metres away from a stand where live chickens were sold. The investigation uncovered no reports of poultry die-offs in the market. However, the woman kept a small number of backyard chickens, allowed into the house at night. Three of her chickens reportedly died before she became ill. She is also known to have used chicken faeces from these household chickens as fertilizer in her garden.",
          "A parallel agricultural investigation has not, to date, detected H5N1 virus in PCR tests of approximately 80 samples from poultry, other livestock and domestic pets, and chicken fertilizer taken from the vicinity.",
          "The initial case developed symptoms on 24 April, was hospitalized on 2 May, and died on 4 May. No samples were collected for testing prior to her burial, but she is considered part of the cluster as her clinical course was compatible with H5N1 infection.",
          "The initial case had one sister and three brothers. The sister and two of the brothers subsequently developed infection. The remaining cases occurred among children in these families.",
          "The confirmed cases include five males and two females with an average age of 19 years (range from 1 to 32 years). Six out of the seven confirmed cases developed symptoms between 3 May and 5 May. These cases include two sons of the initial case, her brother from Kabanjahe, her sister, the sister’s baby, and the son of a second brother living in an adjacent house. This second brother, the last case in the cluster, developed symptoms on 15 May. Six out of the seven cases were fatal.",
          "Exposures",
          "On the night of 29 April, nine family members spent the night in a small room with the initial case at a time when she was severely ill, prostrate, and coughing heavily. These family members included the initial case and her three sons; the brother from Kabanjahe village, his wife, and their two children; the 21-year-old daughter of another brother (who did not become infected); and another young male visitor. Following this event, three family members – the woman’s two sons and the visiting brother from Kabanjahe – developed symptoms from 5 to 6 days later.",
          "The woman’s sister, who lived in an adjacent house, developed symptoms at the same time, as did her 18-month-old daughter. Prior to symptom onset, this sister, accompanied by her daughter, provided close personal care of the initial case.",
          "The last case in the cluster provided close care for his son throughout his hospital stay, from 9–13 May. The son was a frequent visitor in the home of the initial case and was present there on 29 April."

No further cases of influenza-like illness have been identified during the investigation and monitoring of his close contacts.",

Both children developed symptoms on 16 May, were hospitalized on 22 May, and died on 23 May. Both children had a history of close contact with sick and dying chickens at their home in the week before symptom onset.

The man is the seventh member of an extended family to become infected with the H5N1 virus and the sixth to die. An additional person, who was the first member of the family to fall ill, died of respiratory disease on 4 May. No specimens were taken prior to her burial and the cause of her death cannot be determined. However, as her clinical course was compatible with H5N1 infection, epidemiologists at the outbreak site include this woman as the initial case in the cluster.",
          "The newly confirmed case is a brother of the initial case. Specimens were taken on 21 May and flown the same day to Jakarta. Tests run overnight confirmed his infection. His 10-year-old son died of H5N1 infection on 13 May. The father was closely involved in caring for his son, and this contact is considered a possible source of infection.",
          "Although the investigation is continuing, preliminary findings indicate that three of the confirmed cases spent the night of 29 April in a small room together with the initial case at a time when she was symptomatic and coughing frequently. These cases include the woman’s two sons and a second brother, aged 25 years, who is the sole surviving case among infected members of this family. Other infected family members lived in adjacent homes.",
          "All confirmed cases in the cluster can be directly linked to close and prolonged exposure to a patient during a phase of severe illness. Although human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out, the search for a possible alternative source of exposure is continuing.",
          "Both the Ministry of Health and WHO are concerned about the situation in Kubu Sembelang and have intensified investigation and response activities. Priority is now being given to the search for additional cases of influenza-like illness in other family members, close contacts, and the general community. To date, the investigation has found no evidence of spread within the general community and no evidence that efficient human-to-human transmission has occurred.",

The viruses showed no mutations associated with resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir (Tamiflu).",

An additional person, who was the first member of the family to fall ill, died of respiratory disease on 4 May. No specimens were taken prior to her burial and the cause of her death cannot be determined. However, as her clinical course was compatible with H5N1 infection, epidemiologists at the outbreak site include this woman as the initial case in the cluster.",
          "The newly confirmed case is a brother of the initial case. Specimens were taken yesterday and flown to Jakarta. Tests run overnight confirmed his infection. His 10-year-old son died of H5N1 infection on 13 May. The father was closely involved in caring for his son, and this contact is considered a possible source of infection.",
          "Although the investigation is continuing, preliminary findings indicate that three of the confirmed cases spent the night of 29 April in a small room together with the initial case at a time when she was symptomatic and coughing frequently. These cases include the woman’s two sons and a second brother, aged 25 years, who is the sole surviving case in this family. Epidemiologists at the outbreak site believe this exposure may represent second-generation cases arising from limited human-to-human transmission. Other infected family members lived in adjacent homes.",
          "Based on exposure histories and what is known about the incubation period of this disease, the most recently confirmed case is being investigated as possibly representing a third-generation case arising from limited human-to-human transmission.",
          "Family members and village residents have not reported any recent large die-off of poultry or other livestock. No virus has been detected in samples taken from poultry, other animals, fertilizer, and other environmental sources in the village and neighbouring areas.",
          "Both the Ministry of Health and WHO are concerned about the situation in Kubu Sembelang and are rapidly intensifying investigation and response activities. At present, all known cases can be directly linked to close and prolonged exposure to a patient during a phase of severe illness. No evidence points to spread within the general community or suggests that efficient human-to-human transmission has occurred.",
          "Priority is now being given to the search for additional cases of influenza-like illness in other family members, close contacts, and the general community. The Ministry of Health has immediately strengthened its support to district health officials in the area. In collaboration with WHO, two operational hubs are being established to strengthen capacities in the areas of transportation, logistics, and communications and to support the deployment of more staff, should this be needed.",
          "Indonesia has great experience in the field investigation of human cases, a close working relationship with WHO in Jakarta, and a good record of prompt and transparent reporting. Since the first case was reported in July of last year, each human case has prompted an immediate and thorough field investigation, usually conducted by staff from both the agricultural and health sectors and often with WHO support. This activity is now being intensified.",
          "The challenges in North Sumatra are, however, great. The village is in an isolated mountainous area. Residents have been traumatized by the sudden deaths and mystified by the appearance of this disease despite the apparent health of poultry and other livestock. Bereaved family members have shown some reluctance to collaborate with authorities and many questions remain unanswered. Distrust of the authorities, investigators, and the diagnosis is widespread. Given the high mortality, hospitalization is associated with a fatal outcome. The most recently confirmed case refused hospital admission throughout most of his illness. He died this morning en route to a hospital."

No specimens were obtained before her burial, and the cause of her death cannot be confirmed. She is, however, considered the initial case in this family cluster.",

This sister had an 18-month-old girl, who died on 14 May. The fifth confirmed case, who is still alive, is the 25-year-old brother of the initial case. The sixth confirmed case is the 10-year-old nephew of the initial case. He died on 13 May.",
          "One additional family member, who had been hospitalized, has subsequently been ruled out based on both negative laboratory results and the absence of clinical symptoms compatible with H5N1 infection.",
          "This is the largest cluster of cases, closely related in time and place, reported to date in any country and is being carefully investigated by Indonesia’s ministries of health and agriculture and by WHO epidemiologists. The source of exposure for the initial case is still under investigation, with exposure to infected poultry or an environment contaminated by their faeces considered the most plausible source.",
          "The likely source of infection for the additional cases has not yet been determined. Multiple hypotheses are being investigated. Apart from living in close proximity to each other, the cases in this cluster are known to have participated in a family gathering around 29 April. The cases may have acquired their infection from a shared environmental exposure yet to be identified. The possibility of limited human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out at present.",

No influenza-like illness has been identified in health care workers or other persons in close contact with the patients.

All of the affected people had eaten pickled bamboo shoots prepared in a traditional manner, with symptoms developing and progressing over 24-48 hours following consumption. One hundred of the 152 people were hospitalized, and 40 have since required intubation and respirator support. To date, no deaths have been reported.",

A case control and cohort study is under way to describe the outbreak in detail.",

In this community, the defeathering of birds is a task usually undertaken by adolescent girls and young women. The WHO team is today investigating whether this practice may have been the source of infection in Daikyand, where the majority of cases have occurred in females between the ages of 15 and 20 years. Interviews with surviving family members have failed to uncover a history of direct exposure to dead or diseased poultry for several of the cases.",
          "Excellent collaboration between the Ministry of Health and the WHO team continues. WHO is confident that ongoing house-to-house surveillance for cases of influenza-like illness, undertaken by more than 90 local medical teams in Salyan and Tarter, will detect patients requiring further investigation. On-site diagnostic capacity continues to be provided by the US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3). A better understanding of the situation in animals is, however, urgently needed."

          "From 5 March 2005 - 17 March 2006, 3115 cases of chikungunya have been notified by 31 physicians from a sentinel network on La Réunion, including 196 cases reported during the week 27 February - 5 March 2006. Estimations from a mathematical model evaluate that 204 000 people may have been infected by chikungunya virus since March 2005 on La Réunion, including 13 000 persons during the week 27 February - 5 March 2006. Between 1 January 2006 - 5 March 2006, 25 patients with clinical symptoms consistent with dengue fever were laboratory confirmed. Five were isolated cases and 20 were suspected cases of co-infection chikungunya-dengue.",
          "Since the beginning of January 2006, other countries in the south west Indian Ocean have reported chikungunya cases: Mayotte (9 January - 10 March, 2833 suspected cases), Mauritius (1 January - 5 March c. 6000 suspected cases including 1200 confirmed cases), and the Seychelles (1 January - 26 February, 8818 suspected cases).",
          "Several European countries have reported imported cases in people returning from these islands: France (160 imported cases), Germany, Italy, Norway and Switzerland.",
          "A mixed outbreak of chikungunya, with sporadic cases of dengue has been reported in Andhra Pradesh state, India. Between 1 December 2005 - 17 February 2006, 5671 cases of fever with arthralgia were reported. High density of Aedes aegypti was observed in the area. From 1-15 March, over 2000 cases of chikungunya have been reported from Malegaon town in Nasik district, Maharashtra state, India. In Orissa state, India, 4904 cases of fever associated with myalgia and headache have been reported between 27 February - 5 March 2006. These signs are consistent with an arbovirus outbreak. Results of a biological investigation are awaited.",
          "Dengue in Madagascar and Maldives",
          "Madagascar has reported a dengue outbreak in the port city of Toamasina. The outbreak started mid-January 2006. Sporadic cases of chikungunya have been reported since mid-February.",
          "Maldives has experienced an outbreak of dengue since January 2006, with 602 suspected cases until 5 March 2006 (including 64 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever and 9 cases of dengue shock syndrome).",
          "Chikungunya and dengue viruses are transmitted to humans by the bites of infected mosquitoes. On La Réunion, Mauritius, the Seychelles and the east coast of Madagascar, Aedes aegypti is absent or scarce in the vicinity of houses. In contrast, Ae. albopictus is abundant and may be the only important vector of these viruses on the islands. In the Maldives Ae. aegypti is the presumed vector. Both species bite mainly during the daytime, particularly in the early hours after dawn and for 2-3 hours before darkness. Aedes albopictus is more active outdoors whereas Ae. aegypti typically feeds and rests more indoors.",
          "Mosquito control is the main outbreak control activity. Close to habitation, these two mosquito species multiply in collections of stagnant water, mostly in artificial containers. To control the mosquitoes, their breeding sites must be removed, destroyed, protected, frequently emptied and cleaned, or treated with insecticides. During epidemics, insecticides are also often applied as space sprays to kill the adult mosquitoes.",
          "Such measures require the mobilization of affected communities to carry out critical, well-identified healthy behaviours. The Communications for Behavioural Impact (COMBI) approach is a powerful strategy to support this mobilization process both in individuals and communities.",
          "Control measures",
          "A WHO team from the Regional Office for Africa and from headquarters was deployed to the south west Indian Ocean in February-March 2006 to assess the control measures under way in the islands and to discuss a sub-regional coordinated strategy for surveillance and control of arboviruses in the area with national authorities. ( see previous report ). Additional expertise in the COMBI approach has been sent to Madagascar and Mauritius for follow-up. Similarly, Maldives has received support for their social mobilization activities on dengue vector control.",
          "In India, a multidisciplinary national team was deployed from 13 -17 February 2006 to assist local health authorities in improving public health measures including strengthening of arbovirus surveillance, clinical management of cases, vector control and social mobilization.",
          "Although transmission of chikungunya and dengue is continuing in the affected areas, WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade to or from these areas. However, it is recommended that individuals take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites, e.g., by wearing clothes that minimize skin exposure and applying insect repellents to exposed skin or clothing in accordance with label instructions.",

She was reported to have suffered for more than a year from respiratory symptoms associated with a neoplastic condition. Her death is now thought to have been caused by this pre-existing disease. As a precaution, samples have been taken and will be sent for H5N1 testing at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom.",

          "Nigeria’s outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza, initially confirmed at a single farm on 8 February, has now spread to several parts of the country. To date, outbreaks have been detected on more than 130 farms in 11 of the country’s 37 states.",
          "By the end of February, local laboratory tests had detected the virus in 7 contiguous states in the northern and central parts of the country (Kaduna, Kano, Plateau, Katsina, Bauchi, Yobe, and Nasarawa) and in the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja. During the first week of March, the virus was detected in three additional states, Anambra, Benue, and Rivers, located in the southern part of the country.",
          "Control measures on farms have included culling, disinfection, and safe disposal of carcasses. Altogether, some 450,000 birds have either died or been destroyed since the start of the outbreak in early January.",
          "This week, the federal government officially launched its scheme for compensating farmers for lost birds. Payment has been made to farmers, initially in the state of Kano.",
          "Diagnostic capacity for testing animal and human samples within the country has now been strengthened with support from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 60 samples taken from patients under investigation have now been tested. All results to date are negative for H5N1 infection.",
          "In neighbouring Niger, where the virus was confirmed in poultry on 27 February, a WHO team has been deployed to assist authorities in their assessment of the situation. Additional suspected outbreaks in poultry have been reported in the initially affected Magaria area. As in Nigeria, no human cases have been reported to date in Niger.",
          "Staff at the WHO office in Nigeria have emphasized the demands a disease of this nature places on resources and capacities in a newly affected country, especially when late detection and delayed introduction of control measures allow the virus to spread widely. While an intense initial emergency response can be mounted, with external support, it is extremely challenging for any country in sub-Saharan Africa to sustain an adequate response beyond a few months.",
          "In parts of Asia, where the current poultry outbreaks began in mid-2003, experience has demonstrated the difficulty of eliminating the virus once it has become widely present in birds. This experience has also shown that continuing circulation of the virus in birds carries a continuing risk of sporadic human cases. Most human cases have occurred in rural or peri-urban areas where households keep small backyard flocks, allowing close and continuing human exposure to virus from infected birds.",
          "Continuing vigilance for human cases in Nigeria is essential. Virus isolated from poultry in Nigeria is genetically almost identical to viruses that recently caused fatal human cases in Turkey and Iraq."

          "Officials in Germany have today confirmed H5N1 infection in a second mammalian species, the stone marten. This finding marks the first documented infection of this species with an avian influenza virus. Previously, H5N1 infection was confirmed in Germany in three domestic cats.",
          "The marten was found alive, but showing signs of severe illness, on the Baltic island of Ruegen on 2 March. The animal was euthanized. Tests conducted at Germany’s Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut for Animal Health confirmed infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.",
          "The ill animal was found in the same heavily affected area of the island, near Schaprode, as three dead domestic cats. Tests conducted at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut subsequently confirmed that all three cats were infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. The stone marten is a predatory nocturnal mammal with feeding habits similar to those of domestic cats. As with the cats found on Ruegen island, the marten is presumed to have acquired its infection after feeding on an infected bird.",
          "Since 16 February, German authorities have confirmed H5N1 infection in 125 wild swans, ducks, geese, and birds of prey on Ruegen Island, pointing to considerable opportunities for exposures to occur in small mammals that feed on birds.",
          "As is the case with humans, infections in animal species other than birds are rare events. To date, only domestic poultry are known to have played a role in the transmission cycle of the virus from animals to humans.",
          "In July 2005, tests on three rare Owston’s palm civets that died in captivity in Viet Nam detected H5N1 infection, marking the first known infection in this mammalian species. Large cats, including tigers and leopards, kept in capacity and fed on infected poultry carcasses, have also been infected and developed severe disease. Ferrets are another mammalian species known to be susceptible to infection.",
          "Further investigation is needed to determine whether evidence of H5N1 infection in new mammalian species has any significance for the risk of human infection or the potential of this virus to adapt to mammals, including humans."

          "Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been confirmed in poultry in Niger, marking spread of the virus to a second country in sub-Saharan Africa.",
          "During February, significant mortality of chickens and ducks was observed in five outbreaks in two administrative districts near the border with Nigeria. Positive test results were reported yesterday on samples taken from dead ducks in Magaria and Dan Barde, located in one of the two districts. Investigation of the additional outbreaks is under way. Staff at the WHO country office in Niger reported today that no human cases are presently under investigation for possible H5N1 infection.",
          "In neighbouring Nigeria, an outbreak in the northern part of the country was officially confirmed on 8 February, but is now known to have begun almost a month earlier. Detection of the virus in Niger confirms fears that conditions in West Africa, including late detection of outbreaks, the fluid movement of birds across borders, and low population awareness of the disease, will favour spread to additional countries.",
          "Experience in all affected countries has shown how easily and rapidly the virus can become established in birds when detection is late and the introduction of control measures is delayed.",
          "In Nigeria’s northern province of Kano, near the border with Niger, some 51 farms are now known to have been affected. In that country, four persons have been investigated to date for possible H5N1 infection. Local tests have ruled out infection in three of these cases, including one which was fatal.",
          "Outbreaks in numerous other African countries are currently under investigation. Throughout most of Africa, rapid detection and investigation of outbreaks are hampered by the absence of an early warning system for avian influenza in animals or humans, inadequate diagnostic capacity, and difficulties in shipping specimens, both internally and abroad, for diagnostic confirmation.",
          "Concern that human cases may occur in affected parts of Africa is high, given the close contact between people and poultry. Laboratory studies have shown that the virus presently circulating in Nigeria is virtually identical to viruses that have caused human cases and deaths elsewhere since the start of this year.",
          "The continent has an estimated 1.1 billion chickens, mostly produced in backyard farming systems. Traditional practices, exacerbated by rural poverty, favour the home slaughter and consumption of birds when signs of illness appear in a flock. These behaviours carry a high risk of human exposures and infections. While most countries in Africa have a veterinary infrastructure that serves commercial farms, few have services extending to rural areas.",
          "WHO is concerned that spread of the virus to additional parts of Africa will broaden opportunities for human cases to occur under circumstances where capacities to find, diagnose, investigate, and manage cases are limited. Each additional human case gives the virus an opportunity to evolve towards a form that spreads easily from person to person."

          "Authorities in Germany have today announced detection of H5N1 avian influenza in a domestic cat. The cat was found dead over the weekend on the northern island of Ruegen. Since mid-February, more than 100 wild birds have died on the island, and tests have confirmed H5N1 infection in several.",
          "There is no present evidence that domestic cats play a role in the transmission cycle of H5N1 viruses. To date, no human case has been linked to exposure to a diseased cat. No outbreaks in domestic cats have been reported.",
          "Unlike the case in domestic and wild birds, there is no evidence that domestic cats are a reservoir of the virus. All available evidence indicates that cat infections occur in association with H5N1 outbreaks in domestic or wild birds.",
          "Experimental studies, published in September 2004, demonstrated that the H5N1 virus can infect domestic cats, and that cats can transmit the virus to other cats. In these experiments, the cats developed disease following direct inoculation of virus isolated from a fatal human case, and following the feeding of infected raw chicken.",
          "The current H5N1 panzootic in birds, which began in mid-2003 in parts of South-East Asia, has been accompanied by a few anecdotal reports of H5N1 infection in domestic cats. In all such reports, eating raw infected poultry was considered the most likely source of infection for the cats.",
          "Several published studies have demonstrated H5N1 infection in large cats kept in captivity. In December 2003, two tigers and two leopards, fed on fresh chicken carcasses, died unexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent investigation identified H5N1 in tissue samples.",
          "In February 2004, the virus was detected in a clouded leopard that died at a zoo near Bangkok. A white tiger died from infection with the virus at the same zoo in March 2004.",
          "In October 2004, captive tigers fed on fresh chicken carcasses began dying in large numbers at a zoo in Thailand. Altogether 147 tigers out of 441 died of infection or were euthanized. Subsequent investigation determined that at least some tiger-to-tiger transmission of the virus occurred."

No such cases have been identified to date.",

Little is known about the presence of the virus in small backyard flocks, where the greatest risk of human exposures and infections resides.",

As is the case in several affected parts of South-east Asia, around 60% of Nigeria’s poultry production takes place in small backyard flocks. Large-scale commercial farming of poultry occurs mainly in the northern states, where outbreaks have been confirmed.",

Borders are porous and restrictions on the movement of people and poultry are difficult to enforce.

India is one of 13 countries that have reported their first cases of H5N1 infection in birds since the beginning of February.

In Egypt, outbreaks in domestic poultry have now been confirmed in 10 governorates; deaths have also been reported in exotic zoo birds. In Iraq, presence of the virus in birds was found only after the country confirmed its first human case.",

          "All available evidence indicates that the virus does not spread easily from poultry to humans. To date, very few cases have been detected in poultry workers, cullers, or veterinarians. Almost all cases have been linked to close contact to diseased household flocks, often during slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, and preparation of poultry for consumption.",

          "Chikungunya, a viral disease, is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes, typically Aedes aegypti , although there may be other competent mosquito vectors. The name, chickungunya, comes from the Swahili for stooped walk, reflecting the physique of a person suffering from the disease. The disease has been described in Africa, South-East Asia, southern India and Pakistan. It occurs principally during the rainy season.",
          "Chikungunya is rarely fatal. Symptoms appear between 4 and 7 days after the patient has been bitten by the infected mosquito. A high fever and headache occur, with significant pains in the joints (ankles, wrists) and can persist for several weeks. The main preventive measure is to stop the proliferation of mosquitoes by reducing their breeding grounds.",

          "The confirmation of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in domestic birds in northern Nigeria marks the further geographical spread of this virus. Although all evidence to date indicates that the virus does not spread easily from birds to humans, careful monitoring of the situation is warranted.",
          "Experience in several other countries has shown how quickly the H5N1 virus can spread and become firmly established in poultry. The ability of this virus to cause rare but severe disease in humans is well documented.",
          "At present, the only confirmed H5N1 outbreak is thought to be confined to a large commercial farm, located in Kaduna State in the northern part of the country, where thousands of chickens were kept in battery cages. Investigations are urgently needed to determine whether the outbreak, which began almost a month ago, has spread from the farm to affect household flocks. Poultry deaths in the adjacent province of Kano have been reported, but the cause has not yet been determined.",
          "The most immediate public health need is to reduce opportunities for human infections to occur. Investigations of human cases in Asia and elsewhere have identified close contact with diseased or dead household poultry as the most important source of human exposure to the virus.",
          "In Nigeria, as in other parts of Africa, most village households maintain free-ranging flocks of poultry as a source of income and food. Close human contact with poultry is extensive.",
          "If the virus has spread to household flocks in Nigeria, public information campaigns will be needed to warn populations to avoid high-risk behaviours, including the slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, and preparation for consumption of diseased poultry.",
          "WHO is ready to respond to requests from Nigeria for support, including assessment teams and the provision of essential supplies and equipment. Infectious disease staff at WHO’s regional office in Harare, Zimbabwe held an emergency meeting today to assess the situation, plan a response, and evaluate the possible risk to other African countries. A team of experts experienced in the investigation of outbreaks has been placed on standby.",
          "No clear information about the source of the Nigerian outbreak is presently available, but the country is known to lie along a flight route for birds migrating from central Asia.",
          "Full sequence information about the virus in the Nigerian outbreak is expected later this week. This information will allow comparison with viruses that have caused human cases elsewhere and thus assist in the assessment of risks to human health. Sequence information may also shed some light on the origins of the outbreak."

Some improvements in isolation wards are planned. Intensive training courses are being organized for hospital staff to ensure that proper measures for personal protection and infection control are in place.",

Specimens from one of these, the 39-year-old uncle of the confirmed case, have tested positive for H5N1 infection in a local laboratory; his infection has not yet been confirmed by a WHO reference laboratory.",

The case, a 13-year-old boy from the Omara area, developed symptoms on 1 February, was hospitalized with severe pneumonia on 5 February, and died the same day. Although no poultry deaths have been reported in the area, pet birds kept by the family are said to have died near the time of symptom onset.",

The child is the brother of a previously confirmed case, a 20-year-old man who developed symptoms in late September and likewise fully recovered. Both the child and his brother had direct exposure to diseased chickens during slaughtering. As initial diagnostic tests produced inconclusive results, retrospective confirmation of the child’s infection relied on antibody levels in acute blood samples taken during his illness and convalescent samples taken following recovery.",

          "Specimens from Iraq’s first reported case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus have now been tested at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. The case was a 15-year-old girl from the northern part of the country who died of severe respiratory disease on 17 January. Test results have now confirmed her infection.",
          "Specimens from the girl’s 39-year-old uncle, who died on 27 January, and a 54-year-old woman under treatment for respiratory illness are being sent to the UK laboratory but have not yet arrived.",
          "A joint WHO/FAO/OIE team of international experts has been despatched to Iraq at the request of the Ministry of Health. The initial small team of epidemiologists and experts on animal disease will conduct a rapid assessment of the situation in the Sulaimaniyah area of northern Iraq. Because of the security situation, the team is not expected to arrive in the area until early next week.",
          "At present, an additional two people, showing symptoms suggestive of H5N1 infection, have been hospitalized for treatment in the Sulaimaniyah area. Health officials, with support from WHO staff, have set up an emergency operations room to respond to the outbreak, investigate rumours, and address public concerns.",
          "Rumours of possible human cases in other parts of the country have been systematically followed up. To date, no such rumours have been substantiated.",
          "The detection of the country’s first human case occurred despite the absence of confirmed outbreaks of the disease in poultry. Detection of the case indicates a high level of awareness of the clinical features of this disease and good vigilance on the part of clinicians. It also points to an urgent need to investigate the extent of bird outbreaks in northern Iraq and possibly elsewhere. Team members with veterinary expertise will assess animal health issues and support the government in its efforts to control the spread of the disease in poultry.",
          "Experiences with poultry outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in other countries have shown how quickly this virus can establish itself in poultry populations and spread widely when detection and control measures are delayed. Poultry culling is under way in northern Iraq and large numbers of birds have already been destroyed.",
          "WHO-led teams are currently conducting or completing field assessments in nine countries in the area: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Iran, Lebanon, Moldova, Syria, and Ukraine."

          "Specimens are on their way to a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom for diagnostic confirmation and further analysis.",
          "An international team, including representatives of other UN agencies, is being assembled to assist the Ministry of Health in its investigation of the situation and its planning of an appropriate public health response. WHO staff within Iraq have been directly supporting the government’s operational response, which was launched shortly after the girl’s death.",
          "Iraq is the seventh country to report human H5N1 infection in the current outbreak. The first human case occurred in Viet Nam in December 2003."

          "The case occurred in a 29-year-old woman from Chengdu City in the south-central province of Sichuan. She developed fever on 12 January and was hospitalized with symptoms of pneumonia. Authorities say her condition deteriorated rapidly, and she died on 23 January.",
          "Information provided to WHO indicates that she was self-employed in a shop selling dry goods. No information on possible exposure to diseased birds as the source of her infection is presently available, but an investigation is under way. Close contacts have been placed under medical observation.",
          "This is the second human case reported this year in China, both from Sichuan Province. The two Sichuan cases occurred in different prefectures located around 150 km apart. A confirmed outbreak of H5N1 in poultry began in late December in another part of the province. No outbreaks have been confirmed in the areas where the two human cases resided.",
          "During 2005, Chinese agricultural authorities reported 32 outbreaks in poultry in 12 provinces, resulting in the culling of more than 24 million birds. The appearance of human cases in areas without reported poultry outbreaks is a cause for concern. WHO recommends that, in China, testing for possible H5N1 infection should be undertaken in all cases of severe respiratory disease having no alternative diagnosis, even when no poultry outbreak has been reported in the patient’s area of residence.",
          "Of the ten cases confirmed in China, seven have been fatal. The cases have occurred in 7 provinces and regions: Anhui, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Sichuan. No poultry outbreaks have been officially reported in two of these provinces."

The case is a 4-year-old boy from the district of Dogubayazit in Agri Province in the eastern part of the country. An outbreak in poultry began in the district in December 2005. The child developed symptoms on 5 January and was hospitalized on 13 January. He is being treated at a hospital in Erzurum Province.",
          "Like the two cases confirmed on 16 January, also from Dogubayazit, exposure in this case occurred prior to the government’s launch of an intensive public education campaign. Rapid surveys conducted in the most severely affected eastern part of the country have found an almost universal awareness of the disease and of the risk factors for infection. This awareness has been accompanied by behavioural changes that are expected to reduce opportunities for human infections to occur.",
          "As the virus is now known to be present in birds in many parts of the country, some additional human cases should be anticipated in the immediate future. The number of these cases is, however, expected to decline as high-risk behaviours become less common and culling operations, which are presently under way, reduce the number of infected birds.",
          "The newly confirmed case brings the total in Turkey to 21. Of these cases, four were fatal. All four were residents of Dogubayazit.",
          "A second shipment of laboratory specimens arrived yesterday at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. Apart from providing diagnostic confirmation, the laboratory will undertake viral characterization and genetic and antigenic analyses of viruses. These studies help determine whether the virus is evolving. Antigenic analysis of the virus helps ensure that work on the development of a pandemic vaccine stays on track. Initial results are expected later this week."

          "12 January 2006",
          "Laboratory tests conducted in Turkey have confirmed detection of the H5 subtype of avian influenza virus in samples from an additional two patients. The patients are residents of Sanliurfa Province, near the southern border with Syria, and Siirt Province, which is adjacent to Van in the eastern part of the country. Human cases have now been reported from nine of the country’s 81 provinces.",
          "Both patients are young children, aged four and six years, and both have a documented history of direct contact with diseased birds. In Sanliurfa Province, outbreaks in backyard poultry are now thought to date back to late November 2005. Altogether, agricultural officials have confirmed poultry outbreaks in 11 provinces and are investigating possible outbreaks in an additional 14 provinces across the country.",
          "Laboratory tests completed today in Turkey have detected the H5 virus subtype in post-mortem specimens taken from a 12-year-old girl, from Agri Province, who died 7 January. The child was the sibling of two other patients who died earlier. Their infection with the H5N1 virus was subsequently confirmed by a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom.",
          "The Ministry of Health is now reporting 18 laboratory-confirmed cases, of which three, all from the same family, have been fatal.",
          "Arrangements have been made to send specimens from several patients to the UK collaborating laboratory for further analysis. Due to official holidays in Turkey, specimens are not expected to arrive in the UK before Monday. The head of the collaborating laboratory is now in Ankara to support diagnostic work at the country’s national influenza centre. Ways are being sought to expedite the testing of patient samples. High awareness of the disease in the Turkish population, combined with almost daily reports of poultry outbreaks in new areas, has resulted in a large number of people concerned about exposure and seeking reassurance.",
          "The rapid assessment of patients with a possible exposure history is providing a unique opportunity to learn more about the disease in humans. It is also generating data that can be used to assess the efficacy of antiviral drugs, as most people with an exposure history or respiratory symptoms are receiving oseltamivir either prophylactically or very early after the onset of symptoms.",
          "Members of the international teams, in Van Province and Ankara, are today working with local experts to plan relevant studies. These studies should deepen understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, including the possibility that any human-to-human transmission may have occurred, the vulnerability to infection of health care workers and other occupationally-exposed groups, and the possibility that milder forms of the disease might be occurring in the general population.",
          "All available evidence indicates that no sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred. As in Asia, contact with infected birds is the principal source of infection. The risk of infection for travellers to Turkey is negligible provided direct contact with dead or diseased domestic and wild birds is avoided.",
          "Gene sequencing information on human viruses",
          "The WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on influenza at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, London, has today completed genetic and antigenic analyses of viruses recovered from the first two fatal human cases in the Turkish outbreak.",
          "Information provided to WHO indicates that these viruses are very similar to current avian H5N1 viruses isolated from birds in Turkey. They are also closely related to viruses isolated from the large outbreak in migratory birds that occurred at the Qinghai Lake nature reserve in China, beginning in late April of last year.",
          "These analyses indicate that the Turkish viruses are sensitive to both classes of antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir and amantadine. WHO and collaborating experts will review the data on amantadine sensitivity. Oseltamivir remains the drug of first choice recommended by WHO.",
          "Virus from one of the patients shows mutations at the receptor-binding site. One of the mutations has been seen previously in viruses isolated from a small outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 (two cases, one of which was fatal) and from the 2005 outbreak in Viet Nam. Research has indicated that the Hong Kong 2003 viruses bind preferentially to human cell receptors more so than to avian cell receptors. Researchers at the Mill Hill laboratory anticipate that the Turkish virus will also have this characteristic.",
          "Interpretation of the significance of this finding for human health will depend on clinical and epidemiological data now being gathered in Turkey.",
          "All available evidence indicates that no sustained human-to-human transmission is occurring in any country experiencing human cases.",
          "The present WHO level of pandemic alert remains at phase 3: human infections with a new virus subtype are occurring, but the vast majority of these infections are acquired directly from animals."

          "Chinese authorities have also reported that two cases, previously announced, have subsequently died. The deaths occurred in a 10-year-old girl from the Guangxi region, reported on 7 December, and a 35-year-old man from Jiangxi Province, reported on 16 December.",
          "Of the eight confirmed cases in China, five have now died.",
          "Initial investigation of the newly confirmed case has identified recent poultry deaths in the family flock as the likely source of exposure, though no poultry outbreaks have been officially reported in the area. Close contacts have been placed under medical observation and none has shown symptoms of infection to date.",
          "This is the second confirmed case from Hunan Province. The earlier Hunan case, which was one of the first two reported in China in mid-November 2005, lived around 300 kilometres away from the present case.",
          "In addition to Hunan, provinces and regions reporting human cases of H5N1 infection include Anhui, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jiangxi, and Fujian."

The patient is a 37-year-old woman with a history of exposure to diseased chickens. She resides in the central province of Sivas, the seventh province to report cases. Although no poultry outbreaks have been officially reported in this province, it is located near areas with confirmed outbreaks in birds.",
          "The situation in birds continues to evolve, with several new outbreaks under investigation in new parts of the country. All evidence to date indicates that patients have acquired their infections following close contact with diseased birds.",
          "The Turkish government has launched an intensive public awareness campaign. Better public understanding of the disease, supported by more complete data on disease activity in birds, could help to reduce the risk of additional human cases, pending control of the disease in birds. As the majority of confirmed cases and persons under investigation are children, it is particularly important that messages about high-risk behaviours reach children.",
          "Some 100,000 treatment courses of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) arrived in Turkey Friday evening. This supply, which is being used for both the treatment of patients and prophylaxis of persons at risk, is considered by Turkish health officials to be adequate for responding to the current situation. WHO has organized additional support for laboratory diagnostic work, and this will be arriving within the next day or two.",
          "Dr Marc Danzon, the WHO Director for its European office, will be arriving in Ankara tomorrow to confer with the country’s Minster of Health. They will assess the situation together and review needs for further support."

          "Laboratory tests conducted in Turkey have confirmed detection of the H5 subtype of avian influenza virus in samples from an additional 10 patients. Five of these cases were announced by the Ministry of Health yesterday and an additional five were announced today. Most patients are children and all have been hospitalized for treatment and evaluation.",
          "Of the five patients announced on Sunday, three are from Ankara Province and include two brothers, aged five and two years, and a 65-year-old man. All three patients are hospitalized in Ankara. The additional two cases, a nine-year-old girl and her three-year-old brother, are from the Dogubeyazit district in Agri Province, and are hospitalized in the city of Van.",
          "The five cases announced today are from Kastamonu, Corum, and Samsun provinces, bordering the Black Sea in the north-central part of the country, and from Van Province.",
          "This brings the total number of cases in Turkey, confirmed by laboratory tests there, to 14. Of these patients, two have died. WHO will add these numbers to its cumulative total following further verification by an external H5 reference laboratory.",
          "The quality of laboratory testing at Turkey’s National Influenza Centre in Ankara is high. Results from tests conducted there last week were fully confirmed by a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. WHO considers it likely that test results on the newly announced cases will be confirmed by the UK laboratory, where samples are being sent for further analysis. H5N1 is the only strain within the H5 subtype known to infect humans. In the event of a confirmed H5N1 outbreak in birds, it is expected that human cases of avian influenza will be caused by the same virus strain.",
          "The initial WHO team, accompanied by the Turkish Minister of Health, arrived in Van Province yesterday evening. The team is now investigating the epidemiological situation, assessing risk factors and control measures, and discussing with local authorities the possible need for additional equipment and supplies. The team will also be assessing patients at the Van hospital where some 38 people are currently being treated and evaluated for possible H5N1 infection.",
          "The initial investigation has found no evidence that the virus has increased its transmissibility or is spreading from person to person. Most persons under investigation are children, often from the same family, and almost all have a documented link to dead or diseased poultry.",
          "Outbreaks in poultry are now known to be occurring in several parts of the country. In recent days, the Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in birds in 10 of the country’s 81 provinces. Extensive culling is under way, and several other possible outbreaks are under investigation.",
          "With the agreement of the Ministry of Health, two epidemiologists and two experts in laboratory diagnosis will join the initial WHO team in the next few days. Given the present high level of awareness of the disease and its presence in poultry in several parts of the country, the number of people concerned about possible exposure is expected to increase. This additional support should expedite understanding of the epidemiological situation and increase the capacity to rapidly confirm or rule out persons under investigation for possible infection."

Both cases are children, aged five and eight years, and both are hospitalized. This brings the total number of laboratory confirmed cases in Turkey to four. Two of these cases were fatal.",
          "A WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom has today confirmed detection of the H5N1 virus in samples taken from the two fatal cases.",
          "The Ministry of Health has also announced a third death, presumably caused by the H5N1 virus, in a 12-year-old girl. The girl, who died on 6 January, is a sibling of the two children who died. A fourth child in the family, a six-year-old boy, is also hospitalized. Tests on samples from these patients are ongoing; neither is laboratory confirmed at present.",
          "According to Turkish authorities, some 30 patients are being treated and evaluated for possible H5N1 infection at a hospital in Van Province. Most of the patients are children, and the majority come from the rural district of Dogubayazit.",
          "Plans for a team of international experts to travel today to Van Province have been deferred because of adverse weather conditions. Government officials are assisting the team in finding a rapid mode of transportation to the affected area in the eastern part of the country.",
          "To date, all evidence indicates that patients have acquired their infections following close contact with diseased poultry. Contact between people and poultry has likely increased during the present cold weather, when the custom among many rural households is to bring poultry into their homes. Tests have shown that the virus can survive in bird faeces for at least 35 days at low temperatures (4 o C).",
          "Based on experiences during the avian H5N1 outbreaks in Asia, behaviours that carry an especially high risk of infection include the slaughtering, defeathering, butchering, and preparation for consumption of diseased poultry. These behaviours tend to occur most frequently in rural areas where populations traditionally slaughter and consume birds once deaths or signs of illness are seen in poultry flocks.",
          "In recent days, vigilance for outbreaks of the disease in poultry has increased considerably. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza have now been confirmed in six provinces in the eastern and south-eastern part of the country. Outbreaks at additional sites in the area are under investigation.",
          "Avoidance of high-risk behaviours remains the most important way for local populations to protect themselves from infection."

He was hospitalized in Van Province on 1 January and died the same day. The second case was his 15-year-old sister, also hospitalized on 1 January. She died on 5 January.",

Subsequent tests of additional patient specimens taken from the lungs produced positive results. Patient samples were sent today to a WHO collaborating centre in the United Kingdom for further analysis. The samples have now arrived; results are expected within the next days.",
          "Turkish health authorities have informed WHO that, since 1 January, a total of 11 patients (including the two confirmed fatal cases) have been hospitalized in Van Province with symptoms suggesting infection with avian influenza. Most patients are children between the ages of six and fifteen years and all reside in the Dogubayazit district. Two of the children are siblings of the two confirmed cases.",

Deaths of chickens are known to have occurred in the Dogubayazit district near the end of last year. Although no poultry outbreak has been officially reported in the district, a confirmed outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in chickens and ducks was reported on 27 December in the adjacent province of Igdir.",
          "National authorities have informed WHO that Dogubayazit district has been placed under quarantine; no people or animals are allowed to move in or out of the district. Culling operations are currently under way.",
          "The two Turkish cases mark the first confirmed reports of human infection with avian influenza outside East Asia. Since January 2004, a total of 142 human cases of H5N1 infection have been reported in Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, and China. The cases in Turkey bring the number of affected countries to six, from which 144 cases have now been reported.",
          "Turkey reported its first outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in mid-October of last year. That outbreak, which occurred in the northwestern part of the country, was attributed to contact between domestic poultry and migratory waterfowl. The outbreak in Igdir and other suspected outbreaks in this part of the country are thought to have occurred following introduction of the virus by migratory birds. The region, which has several large lakes, is known to lie along migratory routes."
