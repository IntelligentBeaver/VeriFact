          "As of 31 October,\r\nthe Ministry of Health has confirmed 45 cases and 4 deaths of yellow fever. The outbreak has affected Touba, Mbacké and Bambey districts, Diourbel region; Gossas and Fatick districts, Fatick region and Tambacounda district in Tambacounda region ( see previous report ). Thirty-three cases were reported from Touba where urban transmission was occurring. The date of onset of illness for the 2 most recent confirmed cases was 20 October and these cases were detected in Fatick and Tambacounda district. Surveillance has been intensified in all districts in the country, including active surveillance in Dakar. To date, there has been no evidence of virus transmission in Dakar. The ongoing immunization campaigns in Diourbel region have achieved coverage rates of 94-99% (Touba = 99%) and no cases have been confirmed in this region since 14 October. An immunization campaign has begun in Gossas and Fatick districts, and one is planned for Tambacounda district, but additional vaccine and operational support are needed to begin the campaign. Laboratory testing is being performed by the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar (IPD). The Institut de Recherche pour le Développement and IPD are carrying out entomological investigations, and with WHO have been assisting the Ministry of Health with surveillance and epidemiological investigations. WHO is supporting the immunization campaign with both technical assistance and vaccine supplies. In response to an appeal for financial support for the outbreak response, WHO wishes to acknowledge the support of the Government of Norway and UNFPA."

          "The international team from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network assisting the Ministry of Health provided a preliminary report of their findings and recommendations to the Ministry of Health on 29 August.",
          "Summary: An epidemic of influenza was attributed to influenza A/Panama/2007/99–like (H3N2) viruses that impacted the populations of the highlands region of Fianarantsoa Province. This is the same strain that was associated with influenza epidemics worldwide during 2001-02. The most affected area of the province was Ikongo district. The observed increase in excess mortality compared to previous years appeared to be due to widespread transmission and not an especially virulent influenza strain. Most deaths occurred outside of health facilities and disproportionately affected young children. Seasonal epidemics of influenza that have been documented in Antananarivo most likely also affect the highlands region of Fianarantsoa Province each winter, resulting in morbidity and mortality.",
          "Among the recommendations are: expanding the influenza sentinel surveillance system and implementing a standard case definition for influenza-like illness; improving case management and training for health care providers; and providing health education activities to inform the public about influenza and the need for those at high risk (young children,the elderly and those with chronic illness) to seek medical care if experiencing acute respiratory illness."

The total number of reported cases is 22 646 with 671 deaths. The most affected province is Fianarantsoa with 18 808 cases and 556 deaths.  The increase in numbers may be due, in part to a standard case definition established by the Ministry of Health now being applied to all districts.",
          "The international team from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network is working with mobile teams from the Ministry of Health investigating these cases and collecting samples. To date, influenza A(H3N2) viruses have been isolated.",
          "Preliminary findings indicate that the high mortality rates may be attributable in part to the lack of access to health care and to very poor nutrition in the affected districts.  Along with the Ministry of Health, the WHO country office has been working with UNICEF and the World Food Programme to provide protein-enriched foods as soon as possible and to establish nutritional education centres."

          "Decades of civil war in Afghanistan have\r\nnot only destroyed much of the country's infrastructure. Neglected but treatable diseases\r\nhave taken hold throughout this long history of conflict and defeated\r\nthe efforts of doctors and clinics to bring them under control.",
          "One of the most serious examples is a\r\ndisfiguring disease known by various names including Kandahar sore (scientific name\r\ncutaneous leishmaniasis). This is a condition caused by a parasite transmitted by insect\r\nbites that leads to disfiguring facial injuries and long-term disability. As a result,\r\nthose affected are often stigmatized.",
          "Women and children are particularly\r\naffected and in some cases women may be treated as outcasts by their communities. In some\r\nareas, the disease is so widespread that it is known as \"Little Sister\" because\r\nit is almost a part of the family. But in Kabul today there is an opportunity to bring it\r\nunder control and end the suffering endured by so many people.",
          "Two hundred thousand people are believed to\r\nbe infected with this parasite in Kabul alone. Due to their lower levels of resistance to\r\nthe disease, returning refugees and other displaced persons in Kabul are at higher risk of\r\ninfection. International staff working in Afghanistan also face a substantially higher\r\nrisk.",
          "The World Health Organization, together\r\nwith the government of Afghanistan and a number of international NGOs, is launching an\r\nurgent appeal for funds to bring this serious outbreak under control. This is one case\r\nwhere a remarkably small amount of money could make an enormous difference.",
          "\"A little over one million dollars is\r\nall we need to fund a two-year programme that would have a huge, long-term impact on this\r\ndisfiguring disease once and for all,\" said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland,\r\nDirector-General of the WHO. \"But we need to act now: if this opportunity is missed,\r\nthere will be a severe increase in the number of cases next year.\"",
          "It is vital that this emergency response is\r\nlaunched as soon as possible. Because this form of leishmaniasis is passed from person to\r\nperson via the bite of a sandfly, the infection can spread rapidly in a concentrated\r\npopulation, particularly among the poor. The sandflies breed quickly in unsanitary\r\nconditions. After biting an infected person, the sandflies spread the disease each time\r\nthey bite.",
          "Transmission occurs from May to October,\r\nbut new cases may not emerge for another several months because of the long incubation\r\nperiod of the disease. However, it is vital to interrupt transmission in order to avoid a\r\nsharp increase in the number of cases over the next year. A rapid response now also allows\r\na long-term control plan to be put in place, to prevent this disease from taking an even\r\nstronger hold in Afghanistan.",
          "The WHO emergency plan involves a rapid\r\nintervention combining preventive and curative measures with drugs for mass treatment,\r\ninsecticide impregnated bednets for individual protection, social mobilization, and health\r\neducation to ensure that this disabling disease of poverty can be brought under control."

No new cases have been reported\r\nsince the last death on 6 June. The investigation has been hampered by the lack of\r\ncommunity cooperation and increased emphasis will be placed on social mobilization\r\nactivities. The epidemiological\r\npattern of this cluster and the clinical signs of the suspected cases were consistent with\r\nthe previous outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in\r\nthe area , but since no samples have been collected, there has been no laboratory\r\nconfirmation."
