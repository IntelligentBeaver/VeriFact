          "(Week 50, 7 December - 13 December 2003)",
          "Influenza activity associated with influenza A(H3N2) viruses continues to increase in Africa (Tunisia), Europe (Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Russia, Switzerland, Russia Federation and Ukraine) and North America (the United States), and persists in France and some parts of Canada. In other European countries (Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom) and most parts of Canada, activity has declined.",
          "Most influenza infections this season have been attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The majority of viruses antigenically characterized so far have been shown to be A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the rest have been A/Panama/2007/99-like. There have been few reports of influenza A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus detections from Asia. Influenza A(H1) and B viruses have also been detected in some countries. Both B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like and B/Sichuan/379/99-like viruses have been identified. The hemagglutinins of all influenza A(H1) viruses characterized so far have been A/New Caledonia/20/99-like.",
          "An avian influenza A(H5N1) outbreak in poultry in a chicken farm in the Republic of Korea was reported on Tuesday 16 December. The outbreak was recognized by the death of about 19 000 chickens. Surviving chickens in the affected farm were slaughtered. As of Monday 22 December 2003, nine poultry farms in 4 provinces were found to be infected by avian influenza. About one million chickens and ducks are to be culled. The A(H5N1) strain isolated is being examined to determine its relation to other influenza A(H5N1) viruses, which emerged in Asia recently. So far no human A(H5N1) cases have been reported.",
          "Additional investigation of a recent influenza A(H9N2) case in Hong Kong SAR China is on going to determine the source of infection. Virus isolates have been sent to the WHO Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Influenza for sequencing and antigenic makeup characterising to update the diagnostic reagents available for National Influenza Centers . So far all further results of investigation appear to confirm the initial findings that this is an isolated case.",
          "For previous update For more information: WHO Influenza web site",
          "Canada . During week 50, widespread activity of influenza was reported in British Columbia and Ontario, while localised or sporadic activity was reported in most of other parts of Canada. The influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate was 52 cases per 1000 consultations, which is below the baseline. During this week, 17% of 3983 laboratory tests were positive for influenza A and no influenza B virus was detected. Of the 294 influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory to date, 267 (91%) were A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 25 (8.5%) were A/Panama/2007/99-like, one was an A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus and one was A(H1N2).",
          "Czech Republic . An increase of influenza A(H3N2) activity was first noted in week 48. In week 50, localised activity of influenza was reported with 8 influenza A viruses detected.",
          "Denmark . Influenza activity continued to increase in week 50 and was reported as localised with 7 influenza A viruses detected. The ILI consultation rate was above the baseline level, but below the epidemic threshold for this time of the year. All viruses isolated so far have been confirmed to be A/Fujian/411/2002-like.",
          "France . Widespread activity of influenza A(H3N2) persisted in all regions in France except Languedoc-Roussillon.",
          "Italy . Sporadic cases of A(H3N2) were identified in week 50 with a slight increasing trend of increase in influenza activity.",
          "Norway . Widespread Iinfluenza activity was reported as widespread ofin week 50 for the fourth consecutive week. Overall incidence of ILI continued to increase with a large proportion in the 0-4 year age group. While influenza A(H3) activity was reported throughout the country, A(H1) activity was confined to south-east Norway. All influenza A(H3) viruses antigenically characterized so far were A/Fujian/411/2002-like.",
          "Portugal . A decrease in influenza activity, first observed in week 48, continued in week 50, although activity remained widespread. Of the influenza viruses characterized so far this season, the majority were A/Fujian/411/2002-like.",
          "Russian Federation . Regional influenza activity associated mainly with influenza A(H3N2) was observed to be increasing in week 50 with 25 influenza A(H3N2) viruses isolated. Sporadic cases of influenza A(H1N1) and B were also detected. Weekly morbidity was 0.69%-1.5% for the whole population.",
          "Spain . Influenza activity continued to decline in week 50 with an ILI consultation rate of 117 cases per 100000 population. Localised activity of influenza was reported in the Castilla y León autonomic community with 2 influenza A(H3) and 3 A non-subtyped viruses detected.",
          "Switzerland . In week 50 activity of influenza A(H3N2) continued to increase and was reported as widespread with 8 influenza A viruses detected. All influenza A(H3) viruses antigenically characterized so far are A/Fujian/411/2002-like.",
          "Ukraine . Localised influenza activity continued to increase in week 50. The overall weekly ILI incidence increased by 9% compared with week 49, while the incidence in children increased by 23% -35% in some cities.",
          "United Kingdom . In week 50, influenza activity declined in all countries in the UK. The ILI consultation rate was within the baseline activity range in England and Wales, while in Scotland, it was at the normal seasonal level. During week 50, 57 influenza A(H3) viruses were detected. Of the viruses antigenically characterized, 55 have been confirmed as A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 3 as A/Panama/2007/99-like and 2 as B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like.",
          "United States . Influenza activity continued to increase during week 50. The overall ILI consultation rate was 7.4%, which is above the national baseline of 2.5%. Widespread influenza activity was reported in 36 states and regional activity was reported in 12 states and New York City during week 50; 35.8% of the specimens tested were positive for influenza with 1342 influenza A viruses and 23 B viruses identified. Since week 40, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have antigenically characterized 2 influenza A(H1) viruses, 265 A(H3N2) viruses and 2 B viruses from the U.S.. Of the 265 A(H3N2) viruses characterized, 62 (23%) are A/Panama/2007/99-like and 203 (77%) are A/Fujian/411/2002-like. The 2 A(H1) viruses are antigenically similar to A/New Caledonia/20/99-like virus and the 2 B viruses are similar to B/Sichuan/379/99-like virus.",

          "10 December 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported Significant increases in influenza activity associated with influenza A(H3N2) viruses continue in some countries in Europe (Finland, France and Norway) and North America (United States); in other European countries (Portugal and Spain), widespread influenza A(H3N2) activity persists. In some parts of Canada and United Kingdom (UK), where influenza activity was first noted this season, the number of cases has started to decline, although it is too early to predict the trend. A rising trend has also been observed in a number of European countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, Latvia, Russian Federation and Switzerland), although influenza activity remains low at present. Influenza B viruses are most frequently reported from Asia (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Republic of Korea and Thailand); sporadic cases have been detected in Europe and North America. With the exception of an outbreak in Iceland between weeks 41 and 46, very few influenza A(H1) cases have been reported worldwide. This season, most influenza outbreaks are being attributed to influenza A(H3N2) virus and most viruses antigenically characterized so far have been confirmed to be A/Fujian/411/2002-like, with the rest being A/Panama/2007/99-like.",
          "For previous update For more information: WHO Influenza web site",
          "Austria (29 November 2003). Influenza A virus was first detected in week 48.",
          "Canada (29 November 2003). During week 48, influenza activity declined in Alberta and Saskatchewan but increased in other parts of Canada, particularly British Columbia, Ontario and Nunavut. Influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate was 42 cases per 1000 consultations, which is above the national baseline level for week 48. During the same week, 18% of 2567 laboratory tests were positive for influenza A and no influenza B virus was detected. Of the 155 influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory to date, 128 (83%) are A/Fujian/411/2002-like, 25 (16%) are A/Panama/2007/99-like and one is an A/New Caledonia/20/99-like virus.",
          "Denmark (29 November 2003).ILI activity started to increase in week 47. In week 48, the ILI consultation rate was above the national baseline, with one influenza A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus detected.",

          "Russian Federation (29 November 2002). The ILI incidence rate continued to rise in week 48 and exceeded the epidemic threshold in Moscow and St Petersburg. All three influenza virus subtypes – A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B – were detected. During the same week, five influenza A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized and confirmed as A/Panama/2007/99-like.",
          "Spain (29 November 2003). Influenza activity continued to be widespread during week 48. However, ILI incidence rate slowed down in the Castilla y León autonomic community.",
          "Switzerland (29 November 2003). Increased influenza activity was observed in week 48, particularly in the western part of the country where 9 influenza A viruses were detected.",
          "United Kingdom (29 November 2003). Influenza activity appears to have levelled off but the trend remains unclear. In week 48, ILI consultation rate remained almost the same as in week 47 in England, continued to decrease in Northern Ireland and Scotland, and kept rising in Wales (although it remained below the baseline level). During week 48, 44 influenza A(H3) viruses and one B virus were detected. Of the viruses antigenically characterized so far, 35 have been confirmed as A/Fujian/411/2002-like and 3 as A/Panama/2007/99-like. United States (29 November 2003). Influenza activity continued to increase during week 48. Overall ILI consultation rate was 5.1%, which is above the national baseline of 2.5%. Widespread influenza activity was reported in 13 states and regional activity was reported in 16 states during week 48; 39.1% of the specimens tested were positive for influenza with 1302 influenza A viruses and 7 B viruses identified. Since week 40, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have antigenically characterized 157 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, of which 45 (29%) are A/Panama/2007/99-like and 112 (71%) are A/Fujian/411/2002-like.",

Influenza activity has continued to increase during November in Canada, Finland, France, Israel, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA).",
          "In Europe (Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland), most H3N2 viruses that have been characterized antigenically so far this season were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; in the UK, 2/3 of isolates characterized so far were A/Fujian/411/2002-like and one third were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In Canada, more than a half of the A(H3N2) isolates characterized so far are A/Fujian/411/2002-like, while the rest were A/Panama/2007/99-like. In the US, more than ¾ of the A(H3N2) isolates were A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the rest are A/Panama/2007/99-like.",

          "For example, in laboratory tests of sera from recipients of influenza vaccines currently used in the northern hemisphere, there were on average 41% reductions in the post-immunization antibody titres to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains, when compared with the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine strain. However despite such reductions, the tests demonstrated that 76% of adult and 72% of the elderly vaccinees possessed protective levels of antibody(HI titres of >40) to A/Fujian/411/2002-like strains.",

          "This case, as well as cases reported in 2003 from Burkina Faso and Ghana, were found to be due to wild poliovirus type 1 that is genetically related to a lineage of wild poliovirus circulating in northern Nigeria and southern Niger.",
          "To date in 2003, 1 case of poliomyelitis following importation of wild poliovirus has been reported in Togo, 1 case in Burkina Faso, and 6 cases in Ghana.",
          "For Burkina Faso, Ghana and Togo, the appearance of cases in 2003 follow long periods without isolation of wild poliovirus, in the presence of high-quality surveillance. Burkina Faso has been polio-free since 2001 with the exception of one case following importation of wild poliovirus in 2002. Ghana has been polio-free since 2001. Togo has been polio-free since 2000.",

          "Ministries of Health in Burkina Faso, Ghana and Togo as well as those in Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon will conduct synchronized National Immunization Days (NIDs) targeting children aged < 5 yrs, starting 22 October. It is critical that every child is reached during these activities to ensure that population immunity is high enough to stop any transmission of wild poliovirus and to protect against further importations."

As of 21 September the total number of cases since the beginning of the year is 18 038 cases with 17 561 cases occurring since the beginning of the epidemic in June ( see previous report ). During 15-21 September, 2352 cases were reported by 12 of the 22 organizations participating in the emergency surveillance system developed by WHO. The case fatality rate is low (below 1% ) in the cholera treatment centres run by Médecins sans Frontières France and Belgium and by MERLIN. Many nongovernmental organizations have opened oral rehydration corners to increase the coverage of the population.",
          "The most affected places in Monrovia are Central Monrovia, Paynesville and Sinkor. The caseload seems to be decreasing in Paynesville and Sinkor, probably as the result of the widespread chlorination of wells undertaken during the last four weeks by WHO and UNICEF. In Central Monrovia, the low access to safe water and sanitation remains critical and limits the effectiveness of control measures. An increase in cholera cases has also occurred in Buchanan (Grand Bassa County).",
          "An additional concern is the increase in bloody diarrhoea cases (141 cases reported during 15-21 September mainly in Central Monrovia and Paynesville) which might be due to shigellosis. Laboratory tests are currently underway."

          "The Singapore Ministry of Health has released the full report of an international investigation of a recent SARS case. The investigation, which followed laboratory confirmation on 8 September of SARS in a 27-year-old researcher, concluded that the patient most likely acquired the infection in a laboratory as the result of accidental contamination. The investigation found no evidence of further transmission and no reason to regard this single isolated case as a concern for international public health.",
          "The case in Singapore marked the first case of SARS to be confirmed since the last known case in the world was detected and isolated in Taiwan, China, on 15 June. In addition to positive results in the laboratory tests for the SARS coronavirus, the SARS agent, subsequently confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Singapore patient showed clinical signs consistent with a diagnosis of SARS.",
          "The patient was conducting research on the West Nile virus in a laboratory that was also conducting research using active SARS coronavirus. The investigation concluded that cross-contamination of West Nile virus samples with the SARS virus in the laboratory was the source of infection. Both viruses were detected in a research specimen.",
          "The genetic sequence of the SARS coronavirus isolated from the infected patient was found to be closely related to the sequence of the laboratory strain, further supporting the likelihood that infection was the result of accidental laboratory contamination.",
          "The investigation was conducted by an 11-member panel including experts from Singapore, WHO Western Pacific Regional Office and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The investigation found no evidence that the patient was a carrier of the SARS virus, acquired during some past contact with a SARS patient, or that any other chain of person-to-person transmission was the cause of the infection. Research on the SARS virus in Singapore is conducted in biosafety level 3 facilities. However, the experts identified several inappropriate laboratory practices that contributed to the accident, and made a series of recommendations for their correction. The laboratory where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed. The panel viewed the incident as an opportunity for Singapore to improve biosafety in its laboratories by introducing uniform standards of safety and improving the training of staff.",
          "Biosafety level 3 facilities are designed for work with Risk Group 3 microorganisms, as defined in the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, Edition 2.5 . Biosafety level 3 containment requires special engineering and design features as well as heightened safety standards and practices.",
          "The possibility that a SARS outbreak could occur following a laboratory accident is a risk of considerable importance, given the relatively large number of laboratories currently conducting research using the SARS coronavirus or retaining specimens from SARS patients.",
          "The investigation found that the case in Singapore was rapidly detected by surveillance procedures in place at Singapore General Hospital and appropriate clinical management and infection control practices were implemented. The swift detection of this case illustrates the importance of continued global vigilance for SARS. This is especially needed in areas that were affected by SARS, and in all institutions that have retained virus isolates and/or diagnostic specimens from SARS patients. It also highlights the importance of strict adherence to appropriate laboratory biosafety procedures and practices for work with communicable agents, such as the SARS coronavirus.",

          "On the basis of the assessment team's visit and analysis of the data ( see previous report ), WHO has now reported a cumulative number of 6353 cases since the beginning of the outbreak in Monrovia in June until 17 August. Systematic reporting of deaths from cholera has not been undertaken in health centres. WHO has put an emergency surveillance system in place to fill this gap. The first peak reached 935 cases during 7-13 July. The weekly average decreased by end July -early August, although the worsening security situation prevented cholera patients from attending health care facilities. Since the ceasefire and the improvement in security, the number of registered cases has been rapidly increasing. According to figures collected at cholera treatment centres in Monrovia, there were 727 registered cases during 4-10 August and 1203 cases during11-17 August. More people are now returning to their homes or to refugee camps outside Monrovia; as a result, the cholera outbreak is spreading from central Monrovia to peripheral areas of the city and neighbouring districts. There are approximately 230 000 people in internally displaced persons camps in Monrovia living in very difficult conditions. The sanitation is poor and safe water is scarce with only 2 litres per day per person available. In order to reduce the risk of waterborne diseases and to limit cholera transmission, WHO, in collaboration with UNICEF and other partners, has launched a campaign for the chlorination of water in Monrovia. The chlorination of 5000 open wells in the city has begun and the process will be repeated regularly until the cholera risk has diminished. Nutrition screening carried out by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) found that 40 % of the children screened are suffering from acute malnutrition which may increase the rate of severe cholera cases. Médecins sans Frontières France and Belgium and MERLIN have opened cholera treatment centres near the most affected areas. The Cholera Coordination Committee has been reactivated to ensure the effectiveness of the efforts of partners (Ministry of Health, WHO, NGOs) operating in Liberia during this post-war phase. In particular, NGOs have been encouraged to better inform the population on cholera preventive measures."

          "Now, sequencing of a portion of the virus causing the outbreak has led to the finding that it was not the SARS coronavirus but another human coronavirus known as OC43. This virus, which is one of the causes of the common cold, has been associated with respiratory outbreaks in aged care facilities in other countries.",

          "WHO is today removing Taiwan from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. This achievement means that all known chains of person-to-person transmission of the SARS virus have now been broken.",
          "“With the last known chain of transmission interrupted in Taiwan, the whole world can breathe an initial sigh of relief,” said Dr David Heymann, the WHO Executive Director for communicable diseases. “At the same time, public health must not let down its guard, as more cases could still surface somewhere in the world. SARS has taught us that a single case is capable of igniting an outbreak.”",
          "“Taiwan was unlucky. A lapse in infection control in a single hospital allowed the outbreak, which had been under good control, to escalate. But the authorities reacted quickly and appropriately. In doing so, they have also strengthened capacity to deal with any future outbreaks.”",
          "The last reported probable case in Taiwan, and – for the moment – in the world, was detected and isolated on 15 June. Two consecutive 10-day incubation periods have now passed with no further cases detected.",
          "The achievement comes just slightly more than four months since the virus began moving around the world, in late February, along the routes of international air travel.",
          "Taiwan’s first case of SARS occurred in a 54-year-old businessman with a travel history, in late February, to Guangdong Province, China, where the earliest cases of SARS are now known to have occurred. The businessman was hospitalized on 8 March.",
          "Taiwan eventually had to cope with the third largest outbreak on record, including 674 cases and 84 deaths. The largest outbreaks occurred in mainland China (5327 cases and 348 deaths) and Hong Kong (1755 cases and 298 deaths).",
          "The outbreak in Taiwan initially grew slowly, with only 23 probable cases detected in the first month. Of these, a single health care worker, a doctor, became infected when he treated the wife of the businessman. All of the earliest cases could be directly linked to close contact with a SARS patient, or had a history of recent travel to an area where local transmission was known to be occurring. Only 4 of the early cases resulted from secondary spread within Taiwan.",
          "The outbreak began to escalate in mid-April following a lapse in infection control procedures, which allowed the disease to spread rapidly within the hospital setting and then into the wider community. In dealing with the emergency that followed, health authorities rapidly introduced a series of sweeping measures. The surveillance system was upgraded and began to deliver the kind of information needed for prompt and targeted action. Hospital procedures for infection control were tightened, and a logistics system was developed to ensure the efficient delivery of protective equipment and other supplies.",
          "Mass education campaigns persuaded the population to check frequently for fever and report promptly at fever clinics, which greatly reduced the time between onset of symptoms and isolation of patients. The establishment of a mechanism for coordinating the response of all relevant sectors was another key to Taiwan’s success.",
          "The global SARS outbreak developed quickly and dramatically, creating challenging and stressful demands on staff and health authorities at every outbreak site. The containment of SARS required heroic efforts and extraordinary measures that are difficult to sustain over time.",
          "“Interruption of the last known chain of person-to-person transmission has come just in time. Health systems at every major outbreak site were strained to the limits of their capacity.” said Dr Heymann.",
          "WHO continues to receive rumours of possible cases, which indicates that surveillance systems are working well. To date, all recently reported possible cases have been aggressively investigated and determined to have other causes. Failure to detect new cases over the next two weeks will greatly increase confidence that the SARS coronavirus has indeed been pushed out of its new human host, although a return of the disease cannot be ruled out completely on the basis of current knowledge."

          "As the global public health emergency caused by SARS appears close to an end, attention is focusing on the problems that are likely to arise during the next influenza season, when cases of influenza are likely to raise suspicions of SARS. The problems are of major concern, as a high level of suspicion is recommended by WHO at a time when vigilance for a possible seasonal return of SARS is particularly important.",
          "Although the behaviour of the SARS virus is impossible to predict on the basis of current knowledge, it is well known that many respiratory illnesses caused by a virus tend to die out when heat and humidity rise and then return when the weather turns cooler.",
          "Worldwide, influenza typically infects 10% to 20% of the total population during seasonal epidemics, resulting in from three to five million cases of severe illness and from 250 000 to 500 000 deaths.",
          "Like SARS, influenza is known to have its highest mortality in persons over the age of 65 and in those already ill with certain chronic diseases.",
          "The symptoms of influenza, which can include pneumonia in severe cases, are easily confused with those of SARS. The risk is therefore great that health systems around the world could be overburdened by suspected SARS cases, necessitating isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine of close contacts – all costly and socially disruptive measures.",
          "The burden is all the greater in the absence of a rapid and convenient diagnostic test capable of ruling out SARS early in the course of illness and thus obviating the need for such measures.",
          "For these reasons, WHO strongly recommends that all countries immunize at least health care workers, who are at greatest risk of both influenza and SARS, with the WHO-recommended influenza vaccine. If possible, the vaccine should also be given to elderly persons, especially when cared for in institutions, and other vulnerable populations, including persons with chronic cardiovascular disease.",
          "WHO maintains a network of 112 influenza centres that continuously gather information on circulating influenza strains and epidemiological trends. Besides guiding the annual composition of recommended vaccines, the network operates as an early warning system for the emergence of influenza variants and novel strains that could signal the start of the next influenza pandemic."

          "WHO has today removed Toronto, Canada, from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. The last probable case was detected on 12 June and immediately isolated. When 20 days, or twice the incubation period, have passed without detection of a new case, the chain of human-to-human transmission is considered broken.",
          "“This is a great achievement for public health in what we hope is the final phase of the global emergency,” said David Heymann, the WHO Executive Director for communicable diseases. “Toronto faced an especially challenging outbreak. As we have learned, SARS is a difficult disease that produces many surprises and setbacks.”",
          "“We should all pay tribute to the health workers and others in Canada who had their lives disrupted and threatened by this disease. When the virus returned to start a second outbreak, health workers continued the fight and have now won it. We also need to remember the commitment of Canada’s scientists, who rapidly provided information about the virus and its epidemiology that has benefited public health around the world.”",
          "Toronto was among the first areas affected after the virus moved out of southern China, in late February, and began to spread internationally. WHO advised travellers to avoid all but essential travel to Toronto on 23 April. The advice was lifted a week later. On 14 May, Toronto was removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission, only to return on 26 May after the virus surfaced in a second outbreak.",
          "All of the earliest and most severe SARS outbreaks have been traced to contact with an infected medical doctor from Guangdong Province, China, who spent a single night (21 February) on the 9th floor of the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong. At least 16 guests and visitors to the same floor became infected. One has been identified as the source case, at the Princes of Wales Hospital, for the Hong Kong outbreak. Others, who carried the virus with them when they returned home, seeded outbreaks in Toronto, Viet Nam, and Singapore.",
          "The mechanisms by which the virus spread from one infected person to so many guests and visitors are still not fully understood. No hotel staff were infected.",
          "Another mystery is why the SARS virus spreads more efficiently in sophisticated hospital settings – another factor that may have contributed to the severity of Toronto’s outbreak. Both epidemiological and anecdotal evidence suggests that certain procedures, such as difficult intubation and use of nebulizers, that are more common in sophisticated hospitals also increase the risk of infection.",
          "When the outbreak began in Toronto and, simultaneously, at the other initial sites, no one was yet aware that a new disease, capable of rapid spread within hospitals, had surfaced in China. Hospital staff, struggling to save lives, were unaware of the need to protect themselves. As a result, the SARS virus spread rapidly within hospitals and then out into the wider community as other patients, hospital visitors, and close contacts of staff became infected.",
          "After WHO issued the first global alert to SARS, on 12 March, all countries experiencing imported cases, with the notable exception of Taiwan, have been able to either prevent any further cases or keep the number of additional cases very small.",
          "With today’s change in the status of Toronto, Taiwan now remains the last area in the world to have experienced recent local transmission of SARS."

This achievement will mean that the SARS coronavirus is no longer thought to be circulating in the human population.",
          "From the outset, WHO’s objective in combating SARS has been to seal off opportunities for the disease to become established in its new human host. Interruption of human transmission will be a milestone on the way to achieving this goal.",
          "However, scientists cannot at present guarantee that SARS has been vanquished, as questions remain about the origins of the virus and its possible seasonal occurrence. In addition, transmission may be occurring somewhere in the world at such a low level as to defy detection.",
          "In line with the WHO objective, recommendations to postpone travel to designated areas were periodically issued. Evidence that SARS was being exported from areas with local transmission was of particular concern, as this contributed to further international spread and created a heavy burden in terms of isolation and infection control, contact tracing, and quarantine.",
          "The list of areas with recent local transmission was initially developed to support the case definitions of suspect and probable cases, as both definitions depend on a history of close contact with a SARS patient.

Subsequent investigations revealed that one infected passenger, on a 15 March flight from Hong Kong to Beijing, may have infected 22 fellow passengers and 2 flight attendants.",

          "As no new probable cases of SARS have been reported anywhere in the world since 15 June, WHO is moving from an emergency response to a research-based agenda aimed at protecting the world against any future resurgence of SARS.",
          "The world must be considered vulnerable to a return of SARS pending better understanding of the origins of the virus and the circumstances that allowed it to jump from an animal host or environmental source to infect humans. Without such an understanding, predictions of the future evolution of the outbreak – including its end – cannot be made with certainty.",
          "The SARS coronavirus was detected within a month by a “virtual” network of laboratories, working around the clock. The complete sequencing of the virus’ genome followed almost immediately.",
          "These breakthroughs have supported progress in the development of diagnostic tests and greatly facilitated the investigation of unusual outbreaks, such as the Amoy Gardens housing cluster that affected more than 320 persons in late March. They also facilitated initial efforts to link an animal species with the first human cases, which were detected in southern China in mid-November of last year.",
          "Further progress in the scientific understanding of SARS will depend on continued international collaboration. WHO is establishing an additional network to expedite much-needed animal studies.",
          "WHO also intends to monitor the effects of patents and patent applications on the speed with which SARS diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines are developed and made available for use, and on the manner in which prices are set for these technologies.",
          "At the moment, it is too early to know all the effects that the patenting of SARS-related discoveries will have. However, the filing of patent applications does not in itself erect any barriers to continued scientific collaboration on SARS.",
          "The “defensive” use of patents can be a legitimate part of a researcher’s efforts to make a discovery, and related discoveries in the future, widely available to other researchers, in the best collaborative tradition of biomedical science.",
          "In the longer term, the manner in which SARS patent rights are pursued could have a profound effect on the willingness of researchers and public health officials to collaborate during future outbreaks of new infections diseases.",
          "WHO will therefore examine whether the terms of reference for such collaborations need to be modified to ensure that the credit for any intellectual property developed is appropriately attributed, that revenues derived from licensing such property are devoted to suitable uses, and that legitimate rewards for innovative efforts do not impose undue burdens on efforts to make tests, therapies, and preventive measures available to all.",
          "As SARS has clearly demonstrated, the appearance of a new disease in a highly mobile, interconnected and interdependent world can have serious repercussions outside the health sector and far beyond the areas worst hit by the outbreak. This sense of shared vulnerability is considered a strong motivation for continued international collaboration."

          "Case in Japan The Japanese Ministry of Health has today informed WHO that the probable SARS case, reported on Wednesday, has now been discarded. Further laboratory testing has confirmed a diagnosis of influenza B as the cause of the patient's symptoms.",
          "The case involved a 33-year-old man from Taiwan, who arrived in Tokyo on 21 June and developed symptoms, including a high fever, two days later.",
          "Criteria for removal from the WHO list Questions have recently been raised about the criteria for removal of an area from the WHO list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. An area is removed when twenty days - or twice the incubation period - have passed since the last reported probable case was placed in effective isolation, left the area, or died. If no new cases are detected during this period, the chain of transmission is considered broken.",
          "Isolation of a probable SARS case removes the person from the community and thus reduces opportunities for the virus to spread to others. It does not, however, entirely eliminate the risk of further transmission. A twenty-day period with no new infections is considered essential to demonstrate that further transmission has not occurred. Effective isolation means that patients with SARS are managed according to strict procedures of infection control at the health care facility, including strict adherence to the use of personal protective equipment by staff.",
          "Removal from the list after 20 days applies only to the effective isolation of the last symptomatic case, not to contacts of a SARS case placed in home isolation as a precautionary measure. Experience to date indicates that transmission of SARS occurs when a person is ill. Asymptomatic contacts do not appear to pose an infectious risk to others.",
          "To declare that a chain of transmission has been broken 20 days after the isolation of a person who has no symptoms and therefore poses no risk of spreading the disease would give a false sense of security. It reduces the period of medical follow-up and isolation considered essential to determine that no further transmission is likely to occur.",
          "For this reason, WHO is maintaining its strict criteria - 20 days after a patient, following the onset of symptoms, was either placed in isolation, left the area, or died - for determining when a country can be safely removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission. As recent experiences have demonstrated, SARS is an especially resilient and unforgiving disease, ready to take advantage of any lapse in vigilance or control procedures.",
          "At present, only Toronto and Taiwan remain on the list. In Toronto, the most recently detected probable case began showing symptoms on 12 June and was immediately placed in isolation. The last reported probable case in Taiwan was detected and isolated on 15 June. The list of areas with recent local transmission was initially developed to assist in application of the WHO definitions of suspect and probable cases of SARS. Both case definitions require a history of close contact with a suspect or probable case. A list of countries where local transmission is occurring helps physicians determine whether contact with a case was possible and thus assists in reaching a diagnosis."

          "26 June",
          "Earlier this week, WHO removed Hong Kong and Beijing – the world’s two most severely affected cities – from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. Only Toronto and Taiwan continue to experience chains of local transmission, and these outbreaks are likewise being brought close to containment.",
          "After almost four months, the global public health emergency caused by the sudden appearance and rapid spread of SARS is coming to an end.",
          "The SARS virus, a new and unique member of the coronavirus family, first emerged in mid-November in southern China. One of the key questions now is whether SARS – pushed out of its new human host as chains of transmission are broken – will return.",
          "The question arises because of the behaviour of other comparatively new and poorly understood viruses, including those that cause the Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fevers. These viruses periodically surface to cause outbreaks, usually limited to a defined geographical area, and then fade away to hide in some animal or environmental reservoir until conditions again become ripe for spread to humans.",
          "The question of whether SARS will likewise resurface must remain open pending better understanding of the circumstances that allowed the new disease to emerge. The SARS virus is thought to have jumped to humans from some animal or environmental source.",
          "Many new viruses that jump from animals to humans, including the Nipah, Hendra, and hanta viruses, do not spread efficiently from one person to another and thus do not cause large and sustained outbreaks with a potential for rapid international spread. The SARS virus, however, spreads readily from person to person. Factors in the hospital environment have worked to amplify this efficient transmission considerably. In addition, though SARS has a high case fatality (around 15%), it allows enough of its victims to survive long enough to spread the disease to others – an effective survival strategy for a new virus.",
          "The WHO scientific coordinator for SARS, Dr Klaus Stöhr, is presently in China working together with scientists there to develop and prioritize a SARS research agenda. Research on the origins of the SARS virus is expected to top the agenda.",
          "In the meantime, WHO has good reason to believe that, should SARS resurface later this year, the global impact will be milder than experienced during the initial global emergency. Five reasons support this view.",
          "First, the world’s public health systems have demonstrated their capacity to move quickly into a phase of high alert. The prompt detection and isolation of imported cases in African and India are good examples of both the level of vigilance and its effectiveness in preventing further spread. Some of the former SARS hotspots, including Hong Kong and Singapore, plan to maintain a high level of vigilance, supported by measures for screening and detection, until at least the end of the year.",
          "Second, the world knows what to do. Control measures, though centuries old, have demonstrated their capacity to completely halt outbreaks, as most recently seen in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Beijing.",
          "Third, the intensive research effort currently under way can be expected to improve scientific understanding of SARS and yield better control tools, most notably a rapid and reliable point-of-care diagnostic test.",
          "Fourth, resolutions adopted during the May World Health Assembly have strengthened WHO’s capacity to respond to outbreaks in important ways. In effect, these resolutions allow WHO to move from a passive reliance on official government notifications to a proactive role in warning the world as soon as evidence indicates that an outbreak poses a threat to international public health.",
          "Finally and perhaps most importantly, SARS has underscored the importance of immediately and fully disclosing cases of any disease with the potential for international spread. In the present climate of opinion, influenced by the lessons learned from SARS, it appears unlikely that any country would choose to conceal cases, should SARS resurface. In addition, SARS is simply too big a disease to hide for long.",
          "For these reasons, WHO is optimistic that, should SARS return, it will not do so with a vengeance."

          "25 June",
          "WHO has today received reports of new probable cases of SARS in China and Japan.",
          "China The Chinese Ministry of Health has today reported a new probable case of SARS involving a 77-year-old woman who fell ill in Guangdong Province. The case had previously been classified as a suspect case and, according to WHO recommendations, was placed in isolation on 3 June.",
          "This is the first new case reported in Guangdong since 17 May. The last new case reported anywhere in mainland China was on 11 June.",
          "WHO is stressing that this is a reclassification of a suspect case as a probable case and, as such, should not be taken as an indication that local transmission has occurred. WHO is awaiting further details about the case and its relationship to documented chains of transmission that may point to the source of infection and the timing of exposure.",
          "The most likely explanation is that the case, with its onset in early June, will be linked to a chain of transmission that was subsequently broken.",
          "Meticulous records kept by Hong Kong authorities have revealed that the woman was hospitalized in Hong Kong and treated for other illnesses from 20 to 21 May. As her room was on the same ward as a SARS patient, she was placed under health surveillance until 1 June. No SARS symptoms developed during this period, which represents the maximum incubation period.",
          "However, a possible link with the Hong Kong hospital cannot be entirely ruled out at this time. As became apparent during last week’s global conference on SARS, the disease does not always follow a clinically predictable course in elderly patients, particularly when they have been treated for co-morbidity with other diseases.",
          "Guangdong, which saw the first cases of SARS in mid-November of last year, was removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission on 13 June. This retrospective reporting of a case newly classified as a “probable” case does not constitute a reason for any change in the status of Guangdong.",
          "Japan The Japanese Ministry of Health has today reported a probable case of SARS involving a 33-year-old man who arrived in Tokyo, for sightseeing, on 21 June and developed symptoms two days later. He was immediately hospitalized and managed according to WHO recommendations.",
          "Initial diagnostic tests have ruled out other common causes of severe respiratory disease. Further testing is under way and epidemiological investigations have been initiated. As the patient is a resident of Taiwan, health officials there are contributing to the investigation.",
          "Comment on new cases When an outbreak wanes while vigilance is still high, a few additional cases are almost always detected. Their prompt reporting provides further assurance that surveillance systems are alert. However, WHO anticipates that many reported cases during this phase of the outbreak will turn out, on further investigation, to be “background noise” – that is, cases of community-acquired pneumonia caused by agents other than the SARS virus.",
          "In areas that have experienced large outbreaks and therefore accumulated considerable skill in the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of cases, reports of newly detected probable cases are less likely to be discarded upon further investigation."

          "Effective today, the World Health Organization (WHO) is removing its recommendation that people should postpone all but essential travel to Beijing, China. Beijing was the last area in the world to which this advice still applied.",
          "The recommendation to consider postponing all but essential travel to Beijing was issued on 23 April in order to minimize the international spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). WHO is changing this recommendation as the situation in the Chinese capital has now improved significantly. The last new case in Beijing was isolated on May 29, since when a number of suspect cases have been considered but ruled out as SARS. No cases have recently been exported from Beijing and all recent cases have been traced to known chains of transmission.",
          "“We are changing the travel advice for Beijing effective Tuesday, June 24,” said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of the WHO. “Beijing is the last area to which WHO recommended that people should postpone all but essential travel. This is very good news and shows the great progress the world has made against SARS.\"",
          "Beijing, with a cumulative total of 2521 probable cases and 191 deaths, has had the largest outbreak of SARS anywhere in the world, followed by Hong Kong, with 1755 cumulative cases and 296 deaths, and Guangdong Province, China, with 1511 cumulative cases and 57 deaths.",
          "For reasons that are not yet fully understood, areas of mainland China have experienced a lower case fatality ratio than seen in most other outbreaks.",
          "China began daily reporting of SARS cases in early April, when Beijing reported 29 cases and 4 deaths. At the peak of the outbreak, towards the end of April, Beijing was reporting more than 100 new cases each day. Containment of an outbreak of such dimensions is a tribute to the effectiveness of centuries-old control measures, including isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, supported by government commitment at the highest levels.",
          "Recommendations to postpone travel have been issued following consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of probable SARS cases, the pattern of recent local transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.",
          "On 27 March, WHO recommended that all areas with recent local transmission should screen all international departing passengers to ensure that those who are showing symptoms of SARS or have had recent contact with a SARS patient do not travel. Since then, a number of recommendations have been made that people should postpone all but essential travel to areas with large outbreaks of SARS which posed a potential threat to travellers.",
          "More than 20 days have now passed since the last new case was isolated in Beijing. Therefore, Beijing has also been removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission."

          "WHO has today removed Hong Kong from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. Twenty days, which is twice the maximum incubation period, have passed since the last case was isolated on 2 June.",
          "When 20 days have passed since removal of the last case from the community at large, the chain of human-to-human transmission is considered broken, thus eliminating the risk of infection for both local residents and travellers.",
          "“This is a very significant achievement,” said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director of Communicable Diseases at WHO. “Hong Kong, with its dense population and fluid border with China, had one of the hardest outbreaks to control. This success means that the whole world can now feel safer from the SARS threat.”",
          "SARS was first carried out of southern China into Hong Kong, and then on to Hanoi, Toronto, and Singapore in late February. Some 16 visitors and guests to the ninth floor of a Hong Kong hotel became infected through contact, in ways that remain mysterious, with a symptomatic medical doctor from Guangdong Province, who stayed in the hotel’s room 911. The index case for Hong Kong’s first outbreak, in the Prince of Wales Hospital, visited an acquaintance staying on the same floor during the critical days in February. Additional clusters were also subsequently linked to the hotel.",
          "SARS had not yet been identified as a dangerous new disease when the outbreak hit Hong Kong’s hospitals. Doctors and nurses, unaware of the need to isolate patients and protect themselves, became the first victims as they struggled to save lives. In a particularly unfortunate incident, the index patient at Prince of Wales, admitted on 4 March, was treated four times daily with a jet nebulizer, which probably aerosolized the virus and greatly increased opportunities for spread.",
          "In late March, Hong Kong suffered a major setback when a large cluster, eventually numbering more than 300, of almost simultaneous new cases was traced to a single building in the Amoy Gardens housing state. That event, which raised the possibility of an environmental source of infection or even airborne spread of the virus, was investigated by teams of local specialists. The outbreak was attributed to an “unlucky” convergence of environmental conditions that allowed the contamination of vertically-linked apartments. This conclusion, subsequently confirmed by additional studies, calmed fears that the SARS virus might be airborne.",
          "From the day when the first cluster of cases was recognized, Hong Kong officials have provided open, honest, and abundant information about SARS to both the public and the media. Hong Kong also benefited from the contribution of its outstanding scientists, epidemiologists, and clinicians, who were at the forefront of efforts to track down source cases in the various clusters, identify the causative agent, develop diagnostic tests, and work out treatment protocols.",
          "Faced with the largest outbreak outside mainland China, Hong Kong also pioneered many of the control measures used to successfully contain smaller outbreaks elsewhere. It is gratifying that these measures have now brought Hong Kong to the point of victory over the virus, although continued vigilance remains vital.",
          "On 2 April, WHO advised the public to consider postponing all but essential travel to Hong Kong. That recommendation was removed more than 7 weeks later, on 23 May."

          "The WHO case definition takes a \"wide net\" approach, and is intended to assist in the identification and prompt isolation of any person who might have been exposed to the SARS virus. WHO continues to recommend that suspect cases be immediately isolated and remain so until either a probable diagnosis is made or another agent is determined to be the cause.",
          "While this definition has worked well to contain the outbreak in this initial emergency response, WHO is fully aware that a more precise definition is needed for longer-term surveillance.",
          "Pending the development of a reliable point-of-care diagnostic test, case definitions, based on an evaluation of symptoms and history of possible contact with a SARS patient, remain the only way to find possibly infected persons and reduce opportunities for further spread. WHO therefore welcomes the BMJ study, which suggests that additional symptoms might contribute to a more sensitive definition. However, this is a single study based on patients presenting at a single hospital. Moreover, by inclusion of symptoms such as diarrhoea, this definition risks picking up even more false-positive cases.",
          "During the Kuala Lumpur global conference on SARS, WHO established a working group specifically charged to develop better case definitions. The group will draw on data from all the main outbreak sites.",
          "\"WHO regards an improved diagnostic test as a top priority,\" said David Heymann, the WHO Executive Director for Communicable Diseases. \"The next influenza season will result in a large number of patients with symptoms easily confused with SARS. In addition to a good diagnostic test, a more precise and sensitive case definition is absolutely essential to keep health services from being overwhelmed. We will be producing this as an international collaborative effort, based on the best available evidence.\"",

          "Both WHO and health authorities in Hong Kong are taking a cautious approach to what would be a very significant achievement in the history of SARS control. WHO was given details today about a suspect SARS case who has been in isolation since 9 June. The results of 3 PCR tests have been negative. Serology tests, conducted 20 days after the onset of symptoms, have also been negative.",
          "Today's report on this case confers another layer of assurance that surveillance remains intense and that new cases continue to be quickly detected and isolated. As Hong Kong scientists and laboratories rank among the best in the world, WHO has full confidence that the case in question is not SARS.",
          "Removal from the list means that the chain of person-to-person transmission has been broken, thus eliminating the risk of infection for both local residents and travellers.",

          "19 June",
          "The first global conference on SARS, held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was convened by WHO to provide technical guidance for the ongoing and long-term response to SARS.",
          "As the number of new cases continues to dwindle, one of the most important questions for the future is whether SARS can be eliminated or eradicated from its new human host. Experience with many other infectious diseases, including smallpox and poliomyelitis, has demonstrated that complete eradication of an infectious disease is possible only when three precise requirements can be met.",
          "First, an effective intervention capable of interrupting transmission – ideally, a vaccine – must be available. Second, easy-to-use diagnostic tools are needed, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to detect levels of infection that can lead to transmission of the disease. Finally, infection of humans must be essential to the life-cycle of the causative agent – if the chain of human-to-human transmission is broken, the agent cannot survive. Existence of an animal reservoir greatly complicates eradication, but does not preclude it, provided interventions exist to break the chain of transmission in the animal species as well.",
          "To achieve eradication at the global level, the control intervention must be safe, simple, and affordable. Current control measures for SARS, including case detection and isolation, tracing and follow-up of contacts, and quarantine, are effective but extremely time-intensive, costly, and socially disruptive. Few if any countries can sustain such efforts over time.",
          "As noted during yesterday’s conference sessions, an adequate point-of-care diagnostic test is still not available for SARS and remains a top priority. Such a test would likewise need to be sufficiently simple and affordable to be used in countries having a range of different health systems and resources for health care.",
          "Researchers at the conference also confirmed that far too little is understood about the origins of the SARS virus and the possible role – if any – that animals play in the transmission cycle. Some studies have suggested that the earliest cases of SARS, in Guangdong Province, China, may have had contact, during slaughter or due to proximity to so-called “wet” markets, with certain wild animal species consumed as delicacies in southern China. In addition, a SARS-like virus has been detected in a few of these wild animal species. Additional studies are urgently needed before any firm conclusions can be reached. Answers to these questions will also greatly assist predictions of the future evolution of SARS.",
          "For the time being, WHO continues to stress the need to break the chain of human-to-human transmission through use of currently available control tools. In many of the most severely affected areas, these measures have already demonstrated their ability to eliminate SARS in a defined geographical area.",
          "However, the long-term response to SARS, which includes the prevention of importation or re-importation of cases into SARS-free areas, will clearly require different strategies for surveillance and response, as current measures cannot be sustained over time.",
          "Moreover, scientists cannot, on the basis of the very limited data available, rule out the possibility that SARS will resurface when environmental conditions or seasons again favour transmission among humans. Should this occur, countries will need to be ready with alert surveillance systems and good preparedness strategies."

          "June 18",
          "Tomorrow will mark the 100th day since WHO first alerted the world, on 12 March, to the SARS threat. From the 55 cases recognized on that day, alarmingly concentrated in hospitals in Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore, the outbreak exploded within a month to cause some 3000 cases and more than 100 deaths in 20 countries on all continents.",
          "By that time, too, the public face of SARS had come to be symbolized by a mask – an appropriate image for a disease still shrouded in mystery. Although the causative agent was conclusively identified on 17 April, the disease had no vaccine, no effective treatment, an overall case fatality of 15%, and many unexplained features. As the coming weeks would reveal, SARS was also full of surprises.",
          "SARS was carried out of southern China, where the first cases are now known to have occurred in late November 2002, by an infected medical doctor who spent a single night on the 9th floor of a Hong Kong hotel in late February. He infected at least 16 other persons staying on or visiting the same floor. From this single event, which is still not fully understood in terms of the dynamics of transmission, SARS spread internationally.",
          "The number of cases passed 4000 on 23 April and then rapidly soared to 5000 on 28 April, 6000 on 2 May, and 7000 on 8 May, when cases were reported from 30 countries. During the peak of the global outbreak, near the start of May, more than 200 new cases were being reported each day. Detection of new infections subsequently slowed, passing 8000 on 22 May.",
          "During June, the number of new cases has gradually dwindled to the present daily handful. WHO is confident that all countries that have experienced outbreaks are disclosing cases fully and promptly – SARS is too big a disease to hide for long. The global outbreak, at least in this initial phase, is clearly coming under control.",
          "The reduced number of cases is not a “natural phenomenon” that can be attributed to a change in the virulence or infectivity of the SARS virus, as often happens with new diseases that quickly “burn out”. Instead, the dramatic reduction in the number of SARS cases is the result of monumental efforts on the part of governments and health care staff, supported by a well-informed and cooperative public.",
          "The achievement is all the more impressive when viewed against the nature of SARS as an especially difficult and dangerous new disease.",
          "SARS is the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to strike a globalized society. As such, its history to date illustrates the favourable conditions, both for the devastating spread of a new disease and solidarity in its containment, that have come to characterize a closely interconnected, interdependent, and highly mobile world. On the negative side, the volume of international air travel allowed SARS to spread around the world with unprecedented speed. Also on the negative side, the close interdependence of economies and markets amplified the economic impact of SARS considerably, while instantaneous electronic communications elevated public concern – often to the point of panic – and further added to the social and economic disruption caused by SARS.",
          "Just as Ebola came to symbolize the fear inspired by a new disease, SARS has vividly depicted a truism of the infectious disease situation in a globalized world: an outbreak anywhere places every country at risk. The containment of SARS – or any other epidemic-prone disease – requires unprecedented solidarity and makes such an effort a matter of self-interest for every nation.",
          "The success to date clearly demonstrates that a spirit of international solidarity has been a driving force in the rapid containment of SARS.",
          "On the positive side, the power of electronic communications allowed the establishment of “virtual” networks of researchers, epidemiologists, and clinicians, who set aside competition and collaborated around the clock to identify the SARS causative agent, sequence its genome, define clinical features, and investigate modes of transmission in record time.",
          "The world’s electronic interconnectedness also contributed to the effectiveness of the first global alerts to SARS. The initial 12 March alert, followed three days later by a stronger and more specific warning, provided a clear line of demarcation in the early history of SARS. Areas with cases prior to the alert experienced the most devastating outbreaks. These occurred in Hong Kong, Hanoi, Singapore, Toronto, and China. Prior to 12 March, in all these cases, hospital staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and was spreading in health care settings, took no precautions to protect themselves as they fought to save the lives of patients. SARS spread rapidly in these hospitals, and then spilled over into the wider community, resulting in the exportation of cases elsewhere.",
          "With the notable exception of Taiwan, all other areas experiencing imported cases after the alerts were able to prevent further transmission altogether or hold the number of additional cases to a very small number. Most observers attribute this success to the high level of awareness and preparedness that followed the alerts, greatly aided by responsible reporting in the media.",
          "Key weapon: the thermometer One of the most important lessons learned to date is the decisive power of high-level political commitment to contain an outbreak even when sophisticated control tools are lacking. SARS has been brought close to defeat by the diligent and unrelenting application – on a monumental scale – of centuries-old control measures: isolation, contact tracing and follow-up, quarantine, and travel restrictions. Other successful measures include the designation of SARS-dedicated hospitals to minimize the risk of spread to other hospitals, mass media campaigns to educate the public and encourage prompt reporting of symptoms, and the establishment of fever clinics to relieve pressure on emergency rooms, which have also been the setting for many new infections. Screening at airports and other border points and, through fever checks, throughout selected population groups has also been effective.",
          "All of these measures contributed to the prompt detection and isolation of new sources of infection – a key step on the way to breaking the chain of transmission. Given the importance of supportive public attitudes and actions, the single most important control “tool” in bringing SARS under control may very well be the thermometer.",
          "Viet Nam broke the chain of transmission on 28 April, as did the Philippines on 20 May, and Singapore on 31 May. Recommendations to postpone all but essential travel have been removed for all areas except Beijing, China.",
          "In reaching these landmarks in the containment of SARS, the most severely affected countries and areas have identified and rapidly corrected long-standing weaknesses in their health systems in ways that will mean permanent improvements for the management of all diseases. In addition, systems of data collection and reporting, and new patterns of openly and frankly communicating information to the public will hold the world in good stead when the next new disease emerges and the next influenza pandemic breaks out.",
          "Continued surveillance and vigilance needed for a year SARS has repeatedly demonstrated its resilience, most recently with the resurgence of cases in Toronto. As underscored by researchers at this week’s meeting in Kuala Lumpur , SARS has features that can thwart even the best preparedness plans and slip past even the highest levels of awareness and suspicion. Under the right conditions, which remain poorly understood, single highly infectious persons have been known to set off trains of transmission that have led, in the worst cases, to almost 100 additional infections. In Singapore, five patients accounted for 103 of the total 206 cases in the outbreak.",
          "Another significant problem occurs when SARS symptoms are masked by other diseases. Many surprising clusters of cases have been fanned by such patients, as they do not arouse suspicion, are not isolated or managed according to strict procedures of infection control, have no restrictions on visitors, and are frequently transferred to other hospitals for further treatment or tests.",
          "Although SARS is clearly coming under control, the need for continued vigilance is now greater than ever. The world still has a chance to interrupt the chain of person-to-person transmission everywhere. However, because of the many unanswered scientific questions, particularly concerning the origins of the virus and the contribution of environmental contamination to overall transmission, WHO sees a need for at least a full year of surveillance to determine whether the disease has established endemicity and to ensure that no cases have spread, undetected, to countries with poor surveillance and reporting systems. If the disease has not become endemic, the next big hurdles will concern the questions of a possible animal reservoir and possible seasonal recurrence. Scientists cannot rule out the possibility that the SARS virus hides somewhere in nature, as the Ebola virus does, only to return when conditions are once again ripe for the efficient spread of infection to its new human host.",
          "Finally, as underscored in today’s conference sessions, the development of a reliable point-of-care diagnostic test must be given high priority. Pending the availability of such a test, and for a while yet to come, every case of atypical pneumonia has the potential to arouse suspicion and spark a panic. Any hospital-based cluster of febrile patients with respiratory symptoms will need extensive investigation. And any person with a fever or cough could be barred from international travel.",
          "As long as a single case of SARS exists or is suspected anywhere in the world, and as long as fundamental questions about the origins of the virus remain unanswered, all countries need to remain on guard."

          "WHO has today removed Taiwan, Province of China from its list of areas to which travellers are advised to avoid all but essential travel. The move follows vast improvements in case detection, infection control, and the tracing and follow-up of contacts that led to a steep drop in the daily number of new cases.",
          "“The SARS crisis in Taiwan has been taken very seriously at all levels,” said Dr Cathy Roth, a WHO virologist who was in Taiwan in May to assess the need for a strengthened response. “SARS stimulated vast and very rapid improvements in the health infrastructure, especially in the areas of hospital infection control procedures, systems for data collection and reporting, mobilization of the public, and coordination of all agencies contributing to the outbreak response. We hope these improvements are permanent.”",
          "WHO recommends that all areas which have experienced local transmission of SARS maintain a high level of vigilance, as a single imported case or lapse in infection control can reignite an outbreak.",
          "The decision to lift a travel advisory is based on consideration of several criteria, including the number of active cases, the number of new cases being reported daily, patterns of local transmission, and evidence that cases are no longer being exported elsewhere. The adequacy of surveillance measures, including screening for new cases and tracing and follow-up of contacts, is also considered. Together, these factors help determine whether travellers, as well as local residents, are at risk of acquiring infection outside confined settings, such as the health care environment.",
          "Taiwan, which has experienced the third largest outbreak on record, initially had only a few imported cases, all clearly linked together in chains of person-to-person transmission. Following lapses in infection control practices in a hospital, the outbreak escalated dramatically, with as many as 70 new cases per day being reported in mid-May. The large number of new cases reported daily was also partly due to a large backlog of cases pending investigation.",
          "WHO continues to recommend that persons planning to travel to Beijing, China consider postponing all but essential travel. No other travel-related recommendations are in place."

          "In organizing the conference, WHO aims to gather expert views about the effectiveness of the response to date and the likely evolution of SARS in both the near future and longer term. The identification of priority areas for further investigation is another objective.",
          "The meeting comes at a time when the intense around-the-clock emergency actions needed to contain the initial outbreaks have slowed, allowing time to assess the evidence that has accumulated and identify gaps in knowledge.",
          "From the outset, the response to SARS has been characterized by unprecedented high-level scientific collaboration, which led to the identification of the causative agent, a new coronavirus, within a month. However, many fundamental scientific questions remain, a reliable point-of-care diagnostic test is not yet available, and no effective cure has been identified. In the absence of better knowledge and control tools, the response to SARS has been forced to rely on centuries-old measures: isolation, quarantine, and travel restrictions.",
          "On the first day of the meeting, invited speakers will provide an overview of what is currently known about the clinical behaviour of SARS, its causative agent, modes of transmission, the effectiveness of control measures, and possible origins in an animal species. Debate is expected to centre on some of the disease’s many mysteries, including reasons for the rapid deterioration of some patients and spontaneous recovery of others, the comparatively mild form of illness seen in children, and the contribution of certain source cases to especially rapid spread of infection. Other unresolved issues include the possibility of an animal reservoir, and the significance of environmental sources of infection, as experienced during the outbreaks at the Metropole Hotel and in the Amoy Gardens housing estate.",
          "Presentations on blood safety and on possible animal sources of infection are indicative of the wide range of concerns raised by a new, severe, and poorly understood disease.",
          "The second day is organized around working sessions that are expected to answer questions important in the ongoing response to SARS and in gauging preparedness for other epidemic-prone diseases. Questions include the effectiveness of current control measures and the adequacy of the public health infrastructure for outbreak alert and response.",
          "Working sessions will also consider technical constraints that may make it impossible to eliminate SARS.",
          "By gathering the views of the world’s leading experts on these and other issues, WHO hopes to establish the scientific basis for recommending more precise control measures and setting out plans for the long-term SARS response that have the best chance of success."

          "Change in travel recommendations Effective today, the World Health Organization (WHO) is removing its recommendation that people should postpone all but essential travel to Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Tianjin regions in China.",
          "Recommendations to consider postponing all but essential travel to these regions of China were issued on 23 April and 8 May in order to minimize the international spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). WHO is changing this recommendation as the situation in these areas has now improved significantly. Information about the decline of the outbreaks in Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Tianjin has been carefully reviewed by WHO and suggests that SARS is no longer a potential threat to international travellers to these regions.",
          "Recommendations to postpone travel are issued following consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of current SARS cases, the pattern of recent local transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.",
          "In addition, WHO is removing Guangdong, Hebei, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Tianjin from the list of areas with recent local transmission. This follows confirmation that there have been no new cases isolated in any of these areas for more than twice the maximum incubation period, in other words more than 20 days.",
          "On 27 March, WHO recommended that areas with recent local transmission should screen all international departing passengers to ensure that those who are sick with SARS or are contacts of SARS cases do not travel. This recommendation is still valid for Beijing, Hong Kong and Taiwan in China, and Toronto, Canada. For a summary of travel recommendations, see the table below.",
          "During a recent trip to Beijing, Dr David Heymann, WHO’s Executive Director for Communicable Diseases, commented on the measures now in place in China to contain the spread of SARS. \"We’ve seen that there has been a massive effort to mobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country, encouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS cases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.\"",
          "\"China has made huge strides in its effort to contain the outbreak of SARS,\" said Dr Heymann. \"The key thing now is to maintain vigilance and build up China's disease surveillance system.

The most affected provinces are Sud Kivu ( 1387 cases including 26 deaths, case fatality rate, 1.87%), Katanga (7557 cases with 221 deaths, case fatality rate, 2.92 %), ) and Kasai Oriental (3098 cases and 89 deaths, case fatality rate, 2.87%), with most of the cases occurring in the Tsilingue area. The epidemic seems to be spreading in Kasai Oriental as three new health areas were affected during the week of 1-8 June. There is also a high risk of spread to the neighbouring province, Kasai Occidental.",

          "China’s Executive Vice Minister of Health, Mr Gao Qiang, and Dr David Heymann, WHO’s Executive Director for Communicable Diseases, briefed the press this morning on the situation of SARS control in China. Also in attendance were Dr Qi Ziaoqiu, Director-General of the Department of Disease Control in the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative to China.",
          "The briefing marked the first joint news conference between high-ranking Chinese and WHO officials since the SARS outbreak began.",
          "The briefing followed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed data and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and received frank and detailed answers.",
          "Dr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the Ministry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and prevent SARS as “excellent”. He cited the high level of commitment and determination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for the dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland China.",
          "One purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in bringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to share their experiences with the rest of the world.",
          "Indications of the effectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very short time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection and isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing. Such measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an infected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring control efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person transmission can be broken.",
          "Other effective measures include systems for both passive and active surveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports, a nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a very large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may have symptoms.",
          "“We’ve seen that there has been a massive effort to mobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country, encouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS cases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.”",
          "Specific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a sustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first hints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for further information, and wide variations in application of the national case definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems related to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from institutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the information flow from provinces to the central level.",
          "Another major concern is the large number of cases that have no known source of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of transmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a SARS patient has recently increased from 50% to more than 70%.",
          "In the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO officials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top priority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if highly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.",
          "“With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to strengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,” said Dr Bekedam. “The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has to be strengthened for the long run.” He expressed doubt that the present system would be strong enough “to hold back the tide” when confronted with a resurgence of the disease.",
          "In his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also stressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. “We still don’t know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the human population. We don’t know if this disease is seasonal and will decrease this year but come back next year.”",
          "Until proper research into the origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict when the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a suspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.",
          "WHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late April following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious concern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and criticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a public health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its control.",
          "Dr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied that these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to SARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese Ministry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS, its symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever checks.",
          "China is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was home to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year, and presently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide. The WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in this vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases and, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to detect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure that the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the largest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.",
          "The SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease surveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is neglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any epidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nation’s economy. In the view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more flexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any new infectious disease threat.",
          "During the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the country’s capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a background of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly complicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also increasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.",
          "The containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is not contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of atypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients with respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of SARS and spark widespread panic.",
          "In an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following conclusion: “If SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be no chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of SARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as China. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any strategy to do this.”"

          "11 June 2003 WHO is deeply concerned by the resurgence of SARS cases in Toronto, reported to WHO on 22 May, and is following the situation closely. Toronto, which had been removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission on 14 May, was again added to the list on 26 May following evidence that more than one generation of new cases had occurred. Since the disease first resurged in Toronto, over 90 new probable cases have been reported.",
          "Health authorities in Toronto are again on high alert, and are treating all hospital-associated clusters of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms as possible SARS cases until proven otherwise. Possible cases are immediately isolated. All contacts are being traced and, when warranted, placed in home quarantine. Infection control measures are being followed in all affected facilities. WHO welcomes these precautionary measures.",
          "Canadian authorities have most recently reported a possible cluster of SARS patients in a hospital east of Toronto. Although no clear epidemiological link has been established that could explain this new cluster, officials have adopted a cautious approach. Over the last 3 days, 15 dialysis patients at the Lakeridge Health Centre in Whitby exhibited respiratory and febrile illnesses. After clinical review and laboratory investigations to detect other causative agents, around half of these patients have now been excluded from consideration as possible SARS cases. The remaining patients are being closely monitored.",
          "These and other investigations are ongoing and many questions remain to be answered before firm conclusions can be reached.",
          "WHO is also awaiting further information on cases in other countries that may have been exported from Toronto. WHO is not yet convinced that such cases have been conclusively documented.",
          "One of the most dangerous stages in the evolution of any outbreak, and most especially one caused by a new and poorly understood disease, occurs when cases begin to decline and previous levels of high alert and precautionary measures likewise begin to level off. Much about the clinical behaviour of SARS and its mode of transmission requires further research. Until knowledge improves, precautionary measures such as those being followed in Toronto are the best approach from a public health perspective."

Other members of the team include Dr Guénaël Rodier, Director of Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response, and Dr Thomas Grein, who coordinates global response operations for SARS.",
          "The purpose of the visit is to take stock of the current SARS situation in China and exchange views on the next steps forward. In particular, WHO would like to develop, in collaboration with the Chinese government, a research agenda that fully exploits the many intriguing lines of evidence uniquely associated with the SARS experience in China. WHO officials also want to assess areas where Chinese authorities may require more support to ensure that the disease is securely contained and to protect against a future recrudescence of cases.",
          "“SARS is a serious disease with many puzzling features,” said Dr Heymann. “Long-term containment depends on finding answers to a long list of scientific questions. China has much to offer the rest of the world.”",
          "Some immediate issues for discussion concern case definitions, procedures for contact tracing, and the extent of local transmission in specific areas. The WHO team further seeks reassurance that hospital equipment and supplies for infection control are adequate, especially in the poorer provinces.",
          "Measures may need to be found for sustaining China’s present monumental effort to contain SARS, particularly as programmes for responding to other priority diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and TB, may suffer in the long run.",
          "Weaknesses in the health infrastructure, notably inadequate surveillance, reporting, and hospital facilities in some of China’s poorer provinces, have been of concern since the first report of a WHO assessment team was issued in early April. Both WHO and the Chinese Ministry of Health regard the emergency response to SARS as an excellent opportunity to strengthen, throughout the mainland, systems for detecting and responding to all emerging and epidemic-prone infectious diseases. Such long-term and comprehensive improvements will also strengthen China’s capacity to respond to the next influenza pandemic, which many experts now regard as imminent.",
          "WHO officials are also hoping to learn which measures taken by China have so rapidly brought the country’s SARS outbreak – the largest in the world – under control.",
          "The first cases of SARS were detected in Guangdong Province, China, in mid-November of last year. That outbreak has since been brought under control. Initial studies suggest a lower case fatality ratio than seen elsewhere, and high cure rates. In addition, a report on the epidemiology of the outbreak, issued in mid-May by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, provides evidence suggesting that close contact with wild game animals is linked to the first sporadic cases, supporting a hypothesis that the SARS virus may have jumped to humans from an animal reservoir. In addition, the outbreak in Guangdong Province shows some features, in terms of incubation period and groups at highest risk, that differ from the clinical picture seen in outbreaks elsewhere.",
          "Answers to these and other questions will help build a solid scientific basis for understanding SARS, predicting its future evolution, and knowing how to respond should cases surface in new areas or resurface in areas where the disease has been contained.",
          "Unlike many new diseases that have emerged in the past two decades, SARS shows no sign of burning out on its own. If the disease is pushed back out of its new human host, this will result from the persistent application of simple yet highly effective control tools – prompt detection and isolation of cases, strict infection control in hospitals, and tracing and appropriate follow-up of all contacts.",
          "Both Viet Nam and Singapore have successfully broken the chain of transmission and have since remained free of SARS. However, the risk of importation of cases remains as long as cases are occurring anywhere in the world.",
          "The visit to China is one in a series in which WHO officials, including the current Director-General, Dr Go Harlem Brundtland, and the Director-General elect, Dr J.W. Lee, confer with health authorities at SARS outbreak sites having the greatest experience to date.",
          "Dr. Brundtland will be visiting Hong Kong SAR later this month."

Because even a single new case could spark another outbreak, it is important for national authorities to remain vigilant even as current numbers of probable cases are diminishing.",

Officials from both countries agreed that travellers detected with fever at the land checkpoint would be isolated and subsequently sent back to their point of embarkation. The Singaporean and Malaysian delegations agreed to update each other on health screening measures introduced at land, air and sea checkpoints. Singapore has also announced that it will continue all current pre-departure screening measures until the regional SARS situation improves.",
          "In addition, since the start of the SARS outbreak, when it became apparent that travel was capable of spreading the disease globally, WHO has collaborated with non-governmental organizations such as the International Air Transport Association and the International Civil Aviation Organization to promote the adoption of measures aimed at preventing the spread of SARS via air travel.",

Changi was chosen as the test case partly due to Singapore’s rapid response to SARS; it was the first airport to introduce thermal scanners to screen passengers for fevers. Since then, Singapore has also provided such scanners on loan to Toronto for use in that city’s airport exit screening.",

The global aviation body is readying a scheme to evaluate how well airports enforce anti-SARS measures, which include specific procedures for screening passengers and airport workers. The measures also include distributing SARS information to passengers and guidance on handling suspected cases already on board aircraft and at their destinations."

          "The new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were reported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).",
          "Health authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe outbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of cases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to maintain current screening procedures at all border points for at least one year.",
          "The measures, which began at the end of March, include use of infrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health declarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred since these measures were introduced.",
          "Hong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases. Approximately 6% of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now thought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced 1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second more severely hit area, with mainland China at the top.",
          "Hong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease was first brought to Hong Kong in late February when an infected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at least 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel where he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they returned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore, and Toronto as well as Hong Kong.",
          "In these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital settings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and fighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the infectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial outbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary transmission outside the health care setting.",
          "At present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in Toronto and several parts of China. All other countries with imported cases have managed either to prevent transmission entirely or limit additional cases to very small numbers."

          "No new deaths were reported today. This marks the first day with no new SARS deaths since 28 March, when the cumulative totals stood at 1485 cases and 53 deaths.",

          "With outbreaks at all the initial “hot zones” either contained or coming under control, SARS is clearly in decline, indicating that recommended control measures are effective when combined with political commitment and determination.",
          "The fact that the chain of transmission has been broken in Viet Nam and Singapore underscores the WHO position that SARS can be contained, despite the absence of a vaccine, robust diagnostic test and specific treatment. Control currently depends on prompt detection and isolation of cases, good infection control in hospitals, and the tracing and quarantine of contacts.",
          "Viet Nam has remained free of new SARS cases since 8 April. In Singapore, the last locally acquired probable case was isolated on 11 May. No new cases have since been detected in either country despite a high level of alert and aggressive investigation of all rumoured cases.",
          "The experience in Toronto, where more than 70 new cases have been reported since 26 May, underscores the risk of a resurgence of cases and the constant need for vigilance. A single imported case can reignite an outbreak or bring cases to a new area, if preparedness measures are weak.",
          "The new case reported today in Germany, in a man recently returned from Taiwan, has resulted in the quarantine of around 50 contacts. The man has been hospitalized in isolation."

          "The daily number of reported new probable cases of SARS in mainland China has declined considerably in recent weeks, from an average of 166 cases during the first week of May, to 90 cases during the second week, 27 cases in the third week, and 16 in the fourth week. Over the past 6 days, the daily number of reported new cases has dropped to an average of 2.5.",
          "As in other areas with large and challenging SARS outbreaks, this progress over the past month demonstrates the decisive importance of high-level political commitment and determined application of control measures that have proven their effectiveness. At the same time, experiences elsewhere demonstrate the need for maintaining a vigilant and cautious approach to SARS, particularly in a country as large and diverse as China.",
          "The resurgence of cases in Toronto demonstrates how difficult it can be to maintain control over a new disease characterized by many puzzling epidemiological and clinical features. The continued alertness of Singapore, which has most recently broken the chain of SARS transmission, demonstrates the importance of staying on guard, with a high level of vigilance and preparedness, to ensure that a single imported case does not reignite an outbreak.",
          "Based on recent experiences and the many uncertainties about the behaviour of SARS, WHO sees a need for caution in interpreting the downward trend in the number of reported new cases in China.",
          "“SARS is still present in China, and WHO continues to regard China as the epicentre of SARS,” said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases at WHO. “It is our job, together with Chinese authorities, to try to prevent this disease from becoming permanently established in such a vast country.”",
          "The next few months will prove crucial in the attempt to contain SARS worldwide, which now greatly depends on whether the disease can be controlled in China. Otherwise, cases in China – with its long porous borders and large migrant populations – could seed outbreaks elsewhere and would thus make SARS a continuing threat for the rest of the world.",
          "Dr Heymann believes that the international community has much to learn from Chinese experiences in controlling SARS, initially in Guangdong Province and increasingly in other parts of China. “It is also our job to work with the government to determine the factors that have led to such a rapid fall in SARS cases compared to other sites where outbreaks have occurred.”",
          "WHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland has stressed the importance, for the security of all populations, of fully understanding the situation within any country experiencing an outbreak of a disease that can threaten neighbouring countries or be spread internationally by the travelling public. “This allows, within a country, for WHO to do what needs to be done to help the rest of the world,” she said, speaking on a SARS-related issue during last week’s World Health Assembly.",
          "Although great improvements in surveillance, reporting, infection control, and public awareness have occurred in China in recent weeks, WHO remains concerned about the sensitivity of case detection in some provinces, and about the capacity of the health infrastructure to cope with a challenge on the scale of SARS. A particular problem is the large number of new cases reported – approximately half – without information on the source or setting of exposure. The absence of this information makes it difficult for WHO to assess the extent of local transmission.",
          "Local transmission of SARS, especially when it occurs outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment, is one measure of the risk of infection for both residents and international travellers. The pattern of local transmission is also an important consideration when WHO issues travel advice designed to prevent further international spread of SARS."

          "Status of diagnostic tests The development of commercial diagnostic tests for SARS has progressed more slowly than initially hoped. Part of the problem arises from certain unusual features of SARS that make this disease an especially difficult scientific challenge.",
          "For many viral diseases, the greatest quantities of the causative agent are excreted during the initial phase of illness, usually in the first few days following the onset of symptoms. This is often the period during which patients pose the greatest risk of infecting others.",
          "SARS, however, follows a different pattern. During the initial phase of illness, virus shedding is comparatively low. Virus shedding peaks in respiratory specimens and in stools at around 10 days after onset of clinical illness. In effect, this unusual behaviour creates the need for tests having a particularly high sensitivity.",
          "Such tests do not yet exist. Because small quantities of the virus are initially shed, available tests, though developed with impressive speed, are unable reliably to detect SARS virus or its genetic material, during the earliest days of illness. The low sensitivity of current virus detection tests is a particular challenge for SARS control, as patients are capable of infecting others during the initial phase and therefore need to be reliably detected and quickly isolated.",
          "In SARS patients, detectable immune responses do not begin until day 5 or 6. Reliable antibody tests can detect virus only by around day 10 following the onset of symptoms.",
          "WHO continues to recommend use of its case definitions, based on clinical presentation, distinct chest X-rays, and history of possible contact with SARS patients, to detect suspect and probable cases and make management decisions.",
          "To expedite the development of better diagnostic tests, laboratories in the WHO collaborating network have made critical biological materials and reagents available to any laboratory having a sustained interest in the development of diagnostic tests, including the commercial sector. A comprehensive bank of clinical specimens, including respiratory specimens and samples of blood, urine, and faeces from SARS patients, has been established. The bank holds specimens representing all stages of the disease, ranging from the onset of symptoms to recovery.",
          "During the development of diagnostic tests, such specimens are needed to assess how well a test will perform with real patients specimens, as opposed to under the artificial conditions of a laboratory.",
          "Specimens from the bank, which was set up by the Hong Kong Department of Health and the Hospital Authority, are being supplied by a collaborating laboratory, at no charge, to developers of diagnostic tests. As a sample from a single specimen can be subdivided into 6 to 8 identical sub-samples, laboratories can work in parallel on identical specimens, which will further facilitate the assessment of comparative performance. Identical samples also support standardization of diagnostic tests to ensure consistent accuracy.",
          "Laboratories in the WHO network have also made available standardizing reagents for virus and antibody tests. These reagents, which include samples of the inactivated virus and blood from patients in both acute and convalescent stages of illness, will allow uniform assessment of diagnostic results around the world against a “gold standard”.",
          "Sera have been made available by collaborating laboratories in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. Inactivated virus was prepared by the Bernard-Nocht Institute in Germany. Distribution of these reagents will be the responsibility of the Robert-Koch Institute, also in Germany. In return for the supply of these exclusive materials, recipients of WHO support have agreed to offer test kits, once available, at preferential prices to developing countries.",
          "Training course in China WHO is currently coordinating a series of training courses in Beijing aimed at establishing an efficient laboratory infrastructure for SARS diagnosis in all provinces throughout China. Work of the WHO laboratory network has made it possible to support the training courses with test materials and reagents.",
          "Training in the use of currently available tests is being provided by representatives of the labs where they were developed – thus ensuring that Chinese professionals benefit from the best first-hand experience the world can offer. Trainers come from laboratories in China, Hong Kong, the UK and the USA.",
          "China has already developed a highly promising ELISA diagnostic test. For early detection of SARS virus, the PCR molecular test offers the greatest potential under average hospital conditions. The Singapore Genomic Institute has made its PCR test available, at no cost, to support SARS diagnosis in China.",
          "Although the number of new cases and deaths has declined considerably in mainland China, WHO and Chinese authorities remain concerned about the situation in some of the remote provinces which lack a sufficiently strong health infrastructure, including surveillance and reporting systems and hospital facilities, for responding to the magnitude of the SARS problem.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8384 probable cases and 770 deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 27 new cases and deaths compared with the last report on Saturday. The new deaths were reported in China (2) and Hong Kong (4)."

          "Effective Saturday 31 May, Singapore will be removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. The change in status comes 20 days after the last locally acquired case was placed in isolation, on 11 May.",
          "The 20-day period represents twice the maximum incubation period – a reliable indication, following established epidemiological principles, that a chain of transmission has been broken.",
          "In an outstanding example of prompt and open reporting, the 11 May case was reported to WHO on the very day when Singapore was initially scheduled to come off the list.",
          "“From the start, Singapore’s handling of its SARS outbreak has been exemplary,” said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases at WHO. “This is an inspiring victory that should make all of us optimistic that SARS can be contained everywhere.”",
          "Although continued vigilance, especially to prevent the importation of cases, is extremely important, WHO no longer recommends exit screening of international travellers departing from Singapore, effective tomorrow. The absence of local transmission for twice the incubation period means that neither residents nor travellers are at risk of acquiring SARS in Singapore.",
          "Management of the Singapore outbreak faced a number of especially difficult challenges. The first cases of an unusual form of pneumonia were reported on 9 March. At that time, SARS had not yet been recognized as a new disease easily spread in hospitals. As a result, hospital staff were unaware of the need to isolate patients and protect themselves.",
          "The virus initially spread rapidly among hospital staff, patients, visitors, and their close family contacts. Later on, spread of infection between hospitals occurred when patients with underlying disease – which masked the tell-tale symptoms of SARS – were transferred to other hospitals, placed in rooms with other patients, and managed without adequate protective equipment.",
          "The outbreak in Singapore was further amplified by several so-called “super-spreaders”. These are individuals who, for as yet unexplained reasons, are highly efficient in spreading the virus to others. For example, the disease was brought to Singapore by a young women who stayed on the same floor of Hong Kong’s Metropole Hotel at the same time, during late February, as a medical doctor from Guangdong Province, China. This person, who was the first to carry the SARS virus out of mainland China, infected at least 13 other hotel guests and visitors. Back home in Singapore, the young woman subsequently infected 23 others.",
          "When the SARS virus moved into the community, it did so through an infected vegetable hawker at a crowded wholesale market. Swift action by the government, including closing of the market, contact tracing, and quarantining of more than 400 persons, limited the spread of infection to only 15 other persons.",
          "Altogether, 144 of Singapore’s 206 probable cases have been linked to contact with only 5 individuals.",
          "In a few cases, SARS transmission occurred in situations, such as taxis, elevators, and hospital corridors, where exposure may have been through a route other than face-to-face contact with infected droplets. This unusual pattern necessitated an expanded policy for contact tracing and home quarantine.",
          "Health authorities responded to all these challenges with extraordinary measures, adjusting strategies as each new problem emerged.",
          "In an official communication from the Ministry of Health, sent on 29 May, WHO was informed that investigations had identified the source of infection for all but one of the country’s total number of cases.",
          "This is only one achievement in an outbreak response consistently characterized by extra precautions and extraordinary determination.",
          "Surveillance in Singapore uses a highly sensitive case definition that picks up for investigation and monitoring virtually every person with symptoms that might possibly indicate SARS, regardless of whether the person has been in contact with a SARS patient. An independent hospital-based surveillance system monitors for cases of pneumonia acquired outside the hospital setting. This “wide net” approach may help explain why so few cases have escaped detection and why the time between onset of symptoms and isolation has been so much shorter in Singapore, reducing opportunities for further spread.",
          "Local transmission is of greatest concern when a new case cannot be traced back to another case, or when a symptomatic case circulates in the community for several days prior to isolation",
          "Singapore used its military forces to assist in contact tracing and enforcement of home quarantine. All persons who were household, social, hospital, and occupational contacts during the 10 days before symptom onset were traced to identify the source of infection. Persons identified as having had contact with a SARS patient from onset of symptoms to date of isolation were placed in home quarantine.",
          "Other measures include screening of passengers at the airport and seaports, concentration of patients in a single SARS-designated hospital, imposition of a no-visitors rule for all public hospitals, and use of a dedicated private ambulance service to transport all possible cases to the SARS-designated hospital.",
          "In addition, management of the outbreak benefited from support from high-quality laboratory services, including the Virology Unit, Singapore General Hospital, which is a member of the WHO laboratory network.",
          "One indication of the effectiveness of these measures is the fact that 80% of Singapore’s SARS cases did not transmit the infection to others.",
          "Taken together, these efforts have made Singapore a place safe from the risk of SARS for both residents and visitors.",
          "Experiences elsewhere underscore the importance of maintaining a high level of vigilance. WHO is confident that vigilance and preparedness to act will continue in Singapore. On 6 June, the Ministry of Health will hold a border meeting with officials in Malaysia to discuss measures for keeping Singapore free of imported cases."

WHO has no evidence to date that air-conditioning could play a role in spreading the SARS virus. All evidence indicates that the predominant mode of spread is through close person-to-person contact with droplets expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes.",
          "For the purpose of infection control, and exclusively in hospital settings, WHO does recommend turning off air-conditioning and opening windows to provide ventilation. This option is recommended only when the preferred options of negative pressure rooms or an independent air supply and exhaust system cannot be met.",
          "A WHO expert who recently assessed the SARS situation in Shanghai reports that the city has taken many steps to stem the spread of SARS. While the screening of air passengers is progressing well, implementation of a similar level of screening at Shanghai’s bus and railway stations is proving logistically more difficult. Local authorities are also implementing numerous temperature checks; these may occasionally be performed at an excessive frequency.",

          "Taiwan has today reported 22 new probable cases of SARS and 5 new deaths, marking the continuation of a downward trend that became apparent earlier this week. Throughout last week, the large number of new cases reported daily was due, in part, to a change in reporting procedures, as hundreds of patients in a \"pending\" category were investigated and then either excluded or reclassified as suspect or probable cases. For this reason, many cases reported for the first time on a given day actually had dates of onset several days earlier. The record number of newly reported cases occurred last Thursday, when 65 probable cases were added to the list.",
          "With the backlog of pending cases now cleared, the low number of genuine new cases reported today (22) and yesterday (13) indicates that the outbreak in Taiwan has begun to decline.",
          "This welcome development can be attributed to improved infection control in hospitals, including better procedures in emergency rooms and use of protective equipment. A good level of screening, aimed at detecting and isolating patients promptly, is also working to make hospitals safe for patients and staff. These activities reinforce standardized infection control procedures in place throughout the island.",
          "To date, more than 90% of SARS cased in Taiwan have been linked to the hospital setting.",
          "High-profile public awareness campaigns were launched earlier to improve public understanding of SARS, with emphasis placed on good personal hygiene, frequent temperature checks, and prompt reporting of fevers. An island-wide telephone hotline and call centre, staffed by doctors and nurses, has been implemented.",
          "Taiwan has established around 100 fever clinics and will soon be opening more. These facilities ease overcrowding in emergency rooms as more and more concerned residents seek urgent medical attention. The clinics also reduce opportunities for contact with more severely ill persons who might be affected by SARS.",
          "A programme for monitoring and evaluation of all SARS-related control activities has been designed and will be implemented shortly. With these measures in place, WHO is confident that the number of cases in Taiwan will continue the present decline, as has been the experience at other outbreak sites.",
          "To date, Taiwan has reported a cumulative total of 610 probable cases and 81 deaths. The outbreak began to escalate near the end of April, when a lapse in infection control at a hospital is thought to have resulted in a large number of new exposures that spread to new sites as patients were transferred to other hospitals. The number of probable cases reached 100 on 2 May, grew to 207 on 13 May, and passed the 300 mark on 19 May. Two days later, Taiwan reported 418 cases, and on 23 May, 538 cases.",
          "This rapid growth in reported cases, partly caused by the clearing of hundreds of cases in the backlog, has now slowed. In this sense, Taiwanese health officials have \"caught up\" with the outbreak and are now much closer to bringing SARS under control.",
          "As of today, a cumulative total of 8240 probable cases with 745 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 30 new cases and 10 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SAR (1), and Taiwan (5)."

          "World Health Assembly adopts resolution on SARS Today in Geneva, more than 190 countries participating in the World Health Assembly – the supreme governing body of WHO – unanimously approved a resolution on SARS. The Assembly also considered a report (.pdf) on the emergence and spread of SARS and on the international response to date.",
          "The text of the resolution was based on a draft proposed by a group of Asian countries, and then fine-tuned during more than 7 hours of collaborative work by 37 nations. The group was chaired by Dr Viroj Tangcharoensathien, a senior member of Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health.",
          "The resolution, which recognizes SARS as “the first severe infectious disease to emerge in the twenty-first century”, calls for the full support of all countries to control SARS and other emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. It also urges countries “to report cases promptly and transparently and to provide requested information to WHO.” Countries are further asked to request WHO support when “control measures employed are ineffective in halting the spread of disease.”",
          "In the resolution and in the debate that preceded its adoption, SARS was clearly recognized as a serious threat to the stability and growth of economies, the livelihood of populations, and the functioning of health systems as well as a cause of great human suffering. Lessons learned in the ongoing response to SARS were considered relevant to improved preparedness for the next new disease, the next influenza pandemic, and a possible act of bioterrorism.",
          "While WHO was asked to continue to update the list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS, the resolution acknowledges the need to do so in a way that minimizes the socioeconomic consequences.",
          "A statement made by the Italian delegation, praising the dedication of all health care workers, including several who have lost their lives to SARS, met with a round of applause.",
          "In a related item, also considered today, delegates approved a resolution setting out procedures and a timetable for revision of the International Health Regulations. The Regulations, which are administered by WHO, provide the legal framework for global surveillance and reporting of infectious diseases. They also provide the only mechanism through which measures to prevent international spread can be enforced.",
          "Basically unchanged since 1969, the Regulations are considered grossly inadequate in protecting nations and the international community against the resurgence of the infectious disease threat, which has resulted in the emergence of around 30 new diseases during the past two decades. As many speakers noted, this threat, dramatically illustrated by SARS, is amplified by conditions in a highly mobile, interconnected, and closely interdependent world.",
          "As the revision process will not be completed before 2005, the resolution adopted by consensus today requests WHO, through its Director-General, to take into account information about epidemics from sources other than official government notifications, and to conduct on-the-spot studies within countries to ensure that control measures are adequate to prevent international spread. These newly authorized functions are expected to strengthen WHO’s capacity to respond to outbreaks and epidemics quickly and with sufficient force to prevent spread to neighbouring countries and others.",
          "Situation in Taiwan A WHO official in Taiwan has today reported important strides forward in strengthening hospital infection control and contact tracing. Health officials have launched a widespread information campaign, set up a major screening programme and established fever clinics to keep persons suspected of having SARS out of contact with others. In the assessment of WHO, these efforts are beginning to bear fruit. The situation in Taiwan is expected to improve gradually in the coming days and weeks.",
          "Thirteen new probable cases and 4 new deaths were reported today from Taiwan.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8221 probable SARS cases with 735 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 24 new cases and 10 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Taiwan (4)."

          "Situation in Toronto WHO has today added Toronto, Canada to the list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. The change in status follows information, communicated by Health Canada, about new clusters of 26 suspect and 8 probable cases of SARS linked to 4 Toronto hospitals.",
          "As a precautionary measure, all cases in the clusters are being treated as possibly representing SARS until proven otherwise. Actions being taken include immediate isolation of all cases, heightened infection control, intensive contact tracing, and voluntary home quarantine of contacts. These measures have proved highly effective in quickly containing outbreaks.",
          "An urgent alert was sent on Friday to all health and long-term care facilities and service providers in Toronto. Potential exposures include staff, patients, and visitors at the four hospitals.",
          "Although the results of laboratory and epidemiological investigations are pending, sufficient information is available to determine that the index, or first, case in the present outbreak has transmitted infection to others in more than one generation of local transmission. Toronto is therefore classified as having “pattern B” transmission. This is defined as more than one generation of local probable SARS cases.",
          "Inclusion of countries and areas in this list, which is stratified according to three patterns of transmission, does not mean that WHO recommends travel restrictions to the country or area.",
          "At present, WHO is not recommending any restrictions on travel to Toronto.",
          "Local transmission of SARS is of greatest concern, in terms of risks to both local populations and international travellers, when a new case cannot be traced back to contact with another case, or turns out to have been a contact of a case but was not placed in isolation. Both situations increase opportunities for local spread to others.",
          "The table listing areas with recent local transmission is updated daily to assist in the identification and reporting of SARS cases. Pending the development of robust and reliable diagnostic tests, a history of recent travel to an area with local transmission of SARS is part of the WHO case definitions for both suspect and probable cases.",
          "On 23 April, WHO advised persons planning to travel to Toronto to consider postponing all but essential travel. This recommendation was lifted on 30 April, following epidemiological evidence that the outbreak had been controlled to an extent that travellers were no longer at risk.",
          "On 14 May, Toronto was removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission and from the list of areas for which WHO has issued recommendations pertaining to international travel. Criteria for removal from the list include no new probable cases for 20 days, which is twice the incubation period. When no new cases occur over a 20-day period, the chain of transmission is considered broken and the outbreak controlled.",
          "Interpretation of “areas with recent local transmission” The list of areas with recent local transmission is issued by WHO to facilitate use of the SARS case definitions to detect and report suspect and probable cases. A recent history of travel to an area where local transmission outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment, is occurring can assist physicians in the interpretation of symptoms in international travellers.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8202 probable cases with 725 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 96 probable cases and 29 deaths compared with the most recent report on Saturday. The new deaths occurred in Canada (3), China (9), Hong Kong SAR (5), and Taiwan (12).",
          "Taiwan, reporting 62 probable cases over the past two days, continues to have the most rapidly growing outbreak. With a cumulative total of 585 probable cases, Taiwan now has more than twice the caseload of Singapore (206 probable cases), which was among the most severely affected initial outbreak sites."

          "Effective today, the World Health Organization (WHO) is removing its recommendation that people should postpone all but essential travel to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Guangdong province, China.",
          "The recommendation to consider postponing all but essential travel to Hong Kong and Guangdong was issued on 2 April in order to minimize the international spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). WHO is changing this recommendation as the situation in these areas has now improved significantly.",
          "Recommendations to postpone travel are issued following consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of probable SARS cases, the pattern of recent local transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.",
          "On 27 March, WHO recommended that all areas with recent local transmission1 should screen all international departing passengers to ensure that those who are sick with SARS or are contacts of SARS cases do not travel. This recommendation is still valid for both Hong Kong and Guangdong.",
          "“We are changing the travel advice for Hong Kong and Guangdong effective Friday, 23 May,” said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of the WHO. “Guangdong was the first place in the world to have cases of SARS but I am pleased to note that due to the efforts of the local and national health authorities, with support from WHO and partners, the outbreaks in Guangdong and in Hong Kong are being contained.\"",
          "In Hong Kong, the three-day average number of new cases has remained below five over the last six days and the pattern of the outbreak shows a sustained decline since the peak of new cases in late March. The total number of people who are still infectious (all of whom are in hospital) has fallen below 60, although there are other former SARS patients who are still convalescing or being treated for other conditions in hospital. All new cases in the past 20 days have occurred in people who were already identified as contacts of a person with SARS and under active surveillance by the local health authorities. There have been no recent reports of internationally exported cases from Hong Kong.",
          "In Guangdong province, the three-day average number of new cases has been below five for 11 days and the number of SARS patients in hospital fell below 60 on May 20. Due to the efforts of the provincial health authorities, the extent of local transmission has fallen to low levels over recent weeks. There have been no recent reports of internationally exported cases from Guangdong province.",
          "The WHO has also reviewed the travel recommendations for other areas of China, including Beijing, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Taiwan and Tianjin. The WHO recommendations to consider postponing non-essential travel to these areas remain in place. The WHO reviews travel recommendations regularly.",
          "The outbreak in many areas of China is ongoing, and will require continuing intensive efforts as well as a rapid injection of new resources to fully contain SARS.",
          "1 In Patterns B and C Pattern B: More than one generation of local probable SARS cases, but only among persons that have been previously identified and followed-up as known contacts of probable SARS cases. Pattern C: Local probable cases occurring among persons who have not been previously identified as known contacts of probable SARS cases."

As a precaution, the cluster is being managed as possibly representing cases of SARS until proven otherwise. Intensive laboratory and clinical investigations are under way. As of today, no links had been established between these five patients and recent probable cases of SARS, which are all well documented.",

The study detected several coronaviruses closely related genetically to the SARS coronavirus in two of the animal species tested (masked palm civet and racoon-dog). The study also found that one additional species (Chinese ferret badger) elicited antibodies against the SARS coronavirus. These and other wild animals are traditionally considered delicacies and are sold for human consumption in markets throughout southern China.",
          "All six of the civets included in the study were found to harbour SARS coronavirus isolated in cell culture or detected by a PCR molecular technique. The animals also seroconverted and their sera inhibited the growth of SARS coronavirus isolated from humans. Vice versa, human serum from SARS patients inhibited the growth of SARS isolates from these animals.",
          "Sequencing of viruses isolated from these animals demonstrated that, with the exception of a small additional sequence, the viruses are identical with the human SARS virus.",
          "Information on the potential role of animals in the transmission of SARS is important to overall understanding of SARS. Much more research is needed before any firm conclusions can be reached. At present, no evidence exists to suggest that these wild animal species play a significant role in the epidemiology of SARS outbreaks. However, it cannot be ruled out that these animals might have been a source of human infection.",
          "As a precautionary measure, persons who might come into contact with these species or their products, including body fluids and excretions, should be aware of the possible health risks, particularly during close contact such as handling and slaughtering and possibly food processing and consumption.",
          "The study provides a first indication that the SARS virus exists outside a human host. However, many fundamental questions remain. Samples were taken from one market only. Studies need to determine how widespread the SARS virus might be in animals in Guangdong and elsewhere, and if these animals can excrete virus in an amount sufficient to infect humans. Furthermore, the possibility of animal-to-animal transmission has to be investigated. For example, the presence of virus could result from consumption of an infected prey.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8117 probable cases with 689 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 77 new cases and 7 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (3), Hong Kong (2), and Singapore (2).",
          "Most of the new cases were reported in Taiwan, China. With 55 new cases reported today, Taiwan now has a cumulative total of 538 probable cases, making it the third most severe outbreak site to date."

          "22 May 2003 Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8046 probable SARS cases and 682 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. These figures represent an increase of 95 new cases and 16 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SA (3), Taiwan (8), and Singapore (1).",
          "The cumulative total of probable cases surpassed 5000 on 28 April, 6000 on 2 May, and 7000 on 8 May.",
          "Situation in Taiwan Taiwan authorities have today reported a record 60 new probable cases of SARS and 8 deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 483 cases and 60 deaths. However, the large daily increases in new cases seen over the past week are due to a backlog in the investigation of pending cases and determination of which fit the case definition for probable SARS.",
          "While the daily numbers of new cases indicate the size of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, which is worrisome, they do not suggest an explosive escalation in the number of cases, as both older and new cases are being reported together on a daily basis. At present, the daily increases reflect a change in the way records have been kept, with cases in a “pending” category now being classified as either suspect or probable cases. As the backlog of pending cases is now being rapidly cleared, the daily reports should begin within days to give a more accurate picture of the evolution of the outbreak in Taiwan.",
          "Since detection of its first suspect cases, Taiwan has promptly reported on the outbreak to WHO. The first two cases, who were hospitalized on 8 March, occurred in a man with a recent travel history to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong, and his wife, who had no recent travel history. The cases were officially recognized as suspect SARS cases on 14 March, two days after WHO issued a global alert about the emergence of a new disease with severe respiratory symptoms. A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, organized by WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, arrived in Taiwan on 16 March.",
          "Taiwan initially experienced a gradual increase in the number of cases. As of 18 April, 29 cases had been reported. All were identified, through contact tracing and investigation of travel history, as either imported cases, cases in persons with a recent travel history to areas with local transmission, and family members and other close contacts of patients. The number of cases began to climb at the end of April, when local transmission in hospitals became the source of the majority of new infections. The number of probable cases reached 100 on 2 May, grew to 207 on 13 May, and now stands at 483.",
          "Taiwan has now received supplementary protective equipment shipped urgently from Thailand yesterday. The problem of infection control in hospitals is being addressed as a top priority. Procedures were set up today to ensure rapid and efficient distribution of the new equipment.",
          "WHO will be sending an additional 2 staff from Geneva to Taiwan over the weekend.",
          "Data on in-flight transmission updated Following receipt of more complete data, WHO is updating its statistics on cases of in-flight transmission of SARS. The number of flights during which transmission of SARS may have occurred remains at four. The total number of cases resulting from exposure during these four flights has been revised to 27. One flight alone, CA112, which flew from Hong Kong to Beijing on 15 March, is now know to have accounted for 22 of the 27 cases.",
          "WHO is aware of an additional 31 flights with symptomatic probable SARS cases on board. No evidence indicates that in-flight transmission occurred on any of these flights. No flights have been implicated in the transmission of SARS after 23 March 2003.",
          "Complete data on seating information for all cases has not been obtained. However, it is now known that, on one flight, persons sitting seven rows in front and five row behind a person with symptomatic SARS developed the disease. WHO is aware of four flight attendants, of which two were on the CA112 flight, who have become infected.",
          "Report from the joint team in Henan Province, China “Community-based surveillance and control methods seem to be an important contributor to the apparently low levels of SARS infection in China’s rural countryside,” Dr. James Maguire says. Dr Maguire returned to Beijing three days ago from a six-day visit to China’s Henan Province. He travelled as part of a joint Ministry of Health-WHO team. The group visited hospitals, clinics and basic health facilities in five prefectures in Henan.",
          "A full report of the team’s findings is being prepared and will soon be released.",
          "Dr Maguire says that numerous checkpoints on roads and at train and bus stations, where identification cards are checked and body temperatures recorded, seem to be an effective way of controlling the spread of SARS. “The fear of the disease is widespread. Combined with community surveillance and social and legal pressure, people are cooperating,” he says.",
          "Henan officials told the investigators around 1.4 million workers had returned to the province during the long holiday period around May 1. Many came from areas with higher rates of SARS infection, like Beijing and Guangdong. During the period from 26 April to 15 May, the team was told that at the checkpoints 12,028 people were found to be feverish and 955 had a cough. They were referred to “fever clinics” – basic triage centers where they were put into single-room isolation for further assessment. “We were told that nine of these cases were confirmed as being infected with SARS and eight were suspected cases,” Dr Maguire says.",
          "Ministry of Health statistics show there were 15 probable cases, including one in a health worker, and six suspect cases of SARS reported from Henan province as of May 22.",
          "Usually, returning workers from affected areas must stay under house quarantine for 15 days, staying apart from their family in a single room. Dr Maguire says to help with farming work, some local governments are offering financial assistance to have hired workers perform the necessary fieldwork or grants to enable people to buy farm machinery to lower the demand for human farm labour.",
          "“The screening at checkpoints and quarantining may seem like hitting a fly with a hammer, but they seem to be working,” Dr Maguire says. “Combined with the extreme social pressure brought on by the fear of SARS, China might have hit on a way to fight the spread of the disease.”"

          "As a result of ongoing assessments as to the nature of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), WHO is now recommending, as a measure of precaution, that people planning to travel to Taiwan province, China, consider postponing all but essential travel. This is an extension of the advice issued on 8 May recommending the postponing of non-essential travel to Taipei, and is based on information received by the WHO detailing the spread of SARS beyond that city. This temporary travel advice will be reassessed regularly.",
          "Following global alerts about SARS, issued by WHO on 12 and 15 March, national authorities have heightened surveillance for suspect and probable cases. In many countries, prompt detection and isolation of initial cases have prevented further transmission altogether or held additional cases to a very small number. On 27 March, WHO recommended additional measures aimed at preventing the travel-related spread of SARS. These recommended measures, which include the screening of air passengers departing from areas with recent local transmission of SARS, continue to apply. (see SARS site )",
          "Information about the magnitude of the SARS outbreaks in Taiwan province, China, has been carefully reviewed by WHO. The travel advice is based on a consideration of the magnitude of the outbreaks in the area, including both the number of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases. The extent of local chains of transmission as well as the potential for spread beyond these areas were also major factors in the reasoning for this advice.",
          "WHO travel advice is issued to protect international public health and to reduce opportunities for further global spread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February, that has spread along the routes of international air travel. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS and contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage.",
          "The SARS situation is assessed on a regular basis to determine whether the status of areas listed for travel advice needs to be modified, whether other areas need to be added, and if additional precautionary measures are required. Current travel advice, whereby WHO recommends that people consider postponing all but essential travel, are now in effect for several areas of China, namely: Beijing, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Taiwan and Tianjin.",

          "WHO has today removed the Philippines from its list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS. The last probable case that was locally acquired was isolated on 30 April, meaning that opportunities for spread of the virus to others were significantly reduced. As 20 days have now passed with no further cases detected, WHO can safely conclude that local transmission has been interrupted. The twenty days represent twice the maximum incubation period – a reliable indication, following established epidemiological principles, that a chain of transmission has been broken.",
          "To date, the Philippines Department of Health has reported a total of 12 probable SARS cases to WHO. All have been promptly and extensively investigated by local officials, and all have been linked to source cases. Of the 12 SARS cases, 5 were imported. One of the imported cases, who carried the disease from Toronto, infected 7 other cases in the only chain of secondary transmission that has occurred in the Philippines. Of the 7 secondary cases, all have been identified as either family members of the index case or health care workers who treated the index case or her father, both of whom died. These are the only 2 SARS deaths reported in the Philippines.",
          "The SARS situation in the Philippines illustrates the scale of the emergency effort needed to respond effectively to an imported case and ensure that an outbreak is swiftly contained, keeping the number of secondary cases small. The imported case travelled to 5 provinces prior to hospitalization. Contract tracing identified 250 casual and close contacts who were closely followed up. Four of these developed fever and were quarantined until a diagnosis of SARS was excluded.",
          "The Department of Health has today reported to WHO that active surveillance has been ongoing since 17 March to detect and investigate any new SARS cases in 16 regions of the Philippines. All regions report daily on whether any suspect cases have been identified. A report of a suspect case initiates immediate contact tracing and, when necessary, quarantine measures.",
          "The efficient surveillance and reporting system in the Philippines, which reflects strong political commitment and a high level of awareness among health staff, confers an additional level of assurance that no local transmission is now occurring.",
          "WHO has never advised that travel to the Philippines be restricted.",
          "The list of areas with recent local transmission is issued by WHO to facilitate use of the SARS case definition to detect and report suspect and probable cases. A recent history of travel to an area where local transmission outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment, has been documented can help physicians assess symptoms of illness in international travellers.",
          "In the absence of a robust and reliable laboratory diagnostic test, WHO continues to recommend that these cases definitions be used to identify SARS cases and guide appropriate management decisions.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7919 probable cases with 662 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 60 new cases and 19 deaths when compared with yesterday.",
          "The new deaths occurred in China (5), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Taiwan (12). Taiwan, with 39 new probable cases reported today, also has the highest number of new cases"

          "Report on Guangxi (China) visit Guangxi Province appears to be responding well to its relatively small SARS outbreak, with the disease given high priority by both populations and health officials. This conclusion was reached by WHO experts following a joint field visit with Ministry of Health officials. To date, Guangxi has reported 22 probable SARS cases and 3 deaths.",
          "Some concern had been expressed that this “poverty province”, with its weak health infrastructure, would not be able to cope with a SARS outbreak. “We found the province well mobilized. There appears to be no major epidemic there,” said WHO team leader CK Lee. The team returned last Saturday to Beijing after a week-long visit in the province.",
          "Experts found an effective surveillance system set up to detect cases. Diagnostic procedures, treatment, and infection control at all hospitals visited was considered adequate. While no evidence of concealment of cases was found, the numbers of probable SARS cases could be higher due to problems with how cases are being defined.",
          "The team found that two separate clusters of SARS cases, dating from December and January, had recently been detected by local health officials following a review of hospital records.",
          "Guangxi’s surveillance system, which is similar to that of Hebei Province, relies on active, rigorous community-based surveillance, close checking of migrants returning home, and quarantine for two weeks in certain cases. An adequate case reporting system has been set up, with detailed reports sent daily from each city or prefecture to the provincial level.",
          "According to official records, some 260,000 migrant workers returned to Guangxi between April 1 and May 8, of whom 200,000 workers came from neighbouring Guangdong province. Surveillance checkpoints have been set up at main entry points into the province to register these workers. Screening teams staffed by township hospital doctors also visit villages to monitor returning workers.",
          "Hospital management appeared to be effective. Due to scrupulous infection control, no health care workers have been reported as infected. However, some measures taken may be unwarranted, unsustainable or even inappropriate. For example, health care workers are using three layers of hats, gowns, gloves and masks. Two of the three masks are made up of a 12-layer gauze material.",
          "Experts are also concerned that the numbers of reported cases may be low, due to how cases are being classified under the probable, suspect and “under observation” categories. WHO experts are further investigating this issue and working with the Ministry of Health to bring the national standard case definitions more in line with WHO case definitions.",
          "In a separate development, WHO has requested that joint research be undertaken to investigate the origins of the coronavirus to predict its possible reintroduction into the community.",
          "Situation in Taiwan Taiwan has today reported a cumulative total of 344 probable SARS cases with 40 deaths. On 17 May Taiwan reported 34 new cases, and 36 new cases were reported the following day, making Taiwan the most rapidly growing outbreak at present.",
          "As the SARS situation in Taiwan has evolved quickly, with cases now being reported in at least six hospitals, it is possible that the large number of cases being reported daily represents a backlog of cases that are only now being recognized as SARS.",
          "Lapses in infection control, particularly in emergency rooms, may have been one reason for the rapid increase in cases, particularly in hospitals.",
          "Local authorities are focusing on improving their infection control measures. Cases are now less likely to go unrecognized in emergency rooms, many of which have been reorganized to minimize the risk of further SARS transmission. A new monitoring system will also establish guidelines and procedures for the assignment of hospital beds in isolation wards.",
          "The department of health has established a 24-hour case reporting system to handle SARS reports made by physicians and hospitals. Delays in case reporting are punishable by law, and in the severest cases, subject to imprisonment.",
          "Taiwan authorities have adopted thorough contact tracing and quarantine measures to prevent further spread. The joint WHO-CDC team in Taiwan is working to ensure that detailed practical guidelines, developed by Hong Kong, Singapore, and other successful initial outbreak sites, are being made available to Taiwanese authorities. In particular, guidance on the safe screening of persons presenting with fever, and advice on policies for home quarantine and prevention of spread within schools are being shared by teams at other outbreak sites.",
          "Officials in Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s second largest city, have adopted contingency plans for the city, county and region. Should Kaohsiung exceed the simulated level of preparedness, the next level involves military intervention. The city’s level of preparedness in hospitals appears to be good",
          "WHO is confident that Taiwan will bring the outbreak under control using methods of case detection, isolation and good infection control in hospitals, vigorous contact tracing and follow-up surveillance, and public education and information that have proven their effectiveness in other areas. Additional WHO support staff will be sent to Taiwan soon.",
          "Risk of SARS transmission during air travel Globally, WHO has analysed information, as of 12 May, on 35 flights in which a probable symptomatic SARS case was among the passengers or crew. To date, symptomatic probable SARS cases on four of these flights have been associated with possible transmission of infection to fellow passengers or crew.",
          "The most recent flight during which SARS may have been transmitted from a probable symptomatic case to another fellow passenger, seated next to each other, occurred on 23 March during a flight from Bangkok to Beijing.",
          "On 27 March, WHO issued recommendations for the screening of air passengers departing from areas with recent local transmission. In some areas that have experienced severe SARS outbreaks, including Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, measures being applied at airports exceed those recommended by WHO. In these areas, prompt detection and isolation of cases, and rigorous tracing and home confinement or quarantine of all contacts have served as the first line of protection against the risk that an infectious person could board an aircraft. Stringent measures for export screening confer yet another level of protection.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7864 probable SARS cases with 643 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 116 new cases and 20 deaths when compared with the last global update on Saturday.",

          "First global consultation on SARS epidemiology The first global consultation on SARS epidemiology, held at WHO headquarters in Geneva from 16 to 17 May, concluded its work today. The meeting united face-to-face and via video and audio linkage more than 40 leading epidemiologists from 16 countries, including representatives from all areas experiencing significant outbreaks and from WHO teams at these sites.",
          "The meeting was convened to answer a series of fundamental questions important to understanding the dynamics of SARS transmission in populations and the appropriateness of currently recommended measures for control. As SARS is a new disease and outbreaks are evolving, such consultations are needed to ensure that WHO’s global recommendations reflect the latest and best scientific knowledge.",
          "Participants reviewed data from a number of recently completed and ongoing investigations, and exchanged first-hand experiences. Data were presented on the incubation period, the period during which patients are infectious, and case fatality ratios. Participants also exchanged views on routes of transmission and the question of whether subclinical infection contributes to SARS transmission. To date, no reports indicate that persons without symptoms have transmitted SARS to others. In addition, no reports indicate that SARS has an animal host or reservoir in the environment.",
          "The experts confirmed that control measures, currently recommended by WHO, are supported by the available evidence on key epidemiological determinants. The maximum incubation period used for control purposes has proven effective. Participants confirmed that the overall case fatality ratio is 14% to 15% but with wide variations in case fatality related to age, sex, the presence of other diseases, and treatment protocols, and pointed to the need for more research on the significance of infection in immunocompromised persons or persons with underlying cardiorespiratory disease. The experts further supported the current WHO recommendation that persons who have an acute febrile respiratory illness should not travel.",
          "Questions identified as requiring urgent attention include the vulnerability of children to infection, the proportion of contacts of SARS patients who develop asymptomatic infection, and the significance of contact with SARS cases in confined settings such as aircraft and hospitals.",
          "WHO was asked to review guidelines for hospital cleaning and disinfection, to conduct case studies of individuals who appear to make a special contribution to the spread of SARS, to establish the case fatality ratio for health care workers, and to coordinate international collaborative research on SARS in pregnancy.",
          "Participants from the main outbreak sites noted the striking similarity of the pattern of outbreaks in different countries and the consistent effectiveness of specific control measures, including early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts by home confinement or quarantine, and public information and education to encourage prompt reporting of symptoms. The effectiveness of these measures was observed in all outbreak sites under widely varying conditions, supporting the overall WHO view that SARS can be contained and driven back out of its new human host.",
          "The outcome of the meeting will be a consensus document that will serve as both the foundation for recommended control measures and a basis for national authorities in non-affected countries to develop preparedness and management plans. Such plans help ensure that infrastructure and mechanisms are in place to prevent an outbreak should importation of a case occur.",
          "The meeting was characterized by a spirit of frank and open exchange of data, experiences, and expert opinion. As several participants noted, global collaboration in an intense research effort is needed, as no single country can manage SARS on its own.",
          "Travel recommendations for Hebei Province (China) WHO is today recommending that persons planning to travel to Hebei Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. The temporary recommendation is based on the magnitude of the outbreak in Hebei, including the number of prevalent cases and the number of new cases reported daily, and evidence that local chains of transmission are occurring outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment. Together, these factors increase the risk that travellers to Hebei could become infected and subsequently export the disease elsewhere.",
          "Similar travel advice is currently in effect for Hong Kong SAR and Taipei and for several areas of mainland China, including Beijing, Guangdong, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Tianjin.",
          "To date, Hebei has reported a cumulative total of 202 probable cases and 10 deaths.",
          "Recommendations to international travellers are one of several measures being used by WHO to reduce opportunities for the further international spread of SARS.",
          "Situation in Singapore The Ministry of Health in Singapore has today determined that the cluster of patients and staff in the Institute of Mental Health who developed fever on 11 to 12 May does not represent cases of SARS. None of the patients, which included 34 inpatients and 20 staff at the Institute, has shown any signs of clinical progression characteristic of SARS. Alternative diagnoses, including influenza and other causes of upper respiratory tract infection, have further excluded suspicion of SARS. Of the 54 patients, 25 have been discharged and only 7 continue to have mild febrile illness.",
          "As a precautionary measure, the Ministry had previously decided to treat the cluster as suspect SARS cases until proven otherwise.",
          "In line with this view, Singapore immediately introduced a series of stringent measures, including transfer of all cases to a designated hospital, active contact tracing, recall for medical consultation of all patients recently discharged from the Institute, and home quarantine for selected individuals. In addition, special accommodations for staff at the Institute, who continued to care for patients, were arranged to minimize opportunities for further transmission to occur pending results of the investigation.",
          "The most recent probable SARS case in Singapore developed symptoms on 27 April and was isolated the following day.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7761 probable SARS cases with 623 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 33 cases and 12 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (7) and Hong Kong SAR (5)."

          "Situation in China China has today reported 39 new probable SARS cases and 4 new deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 5191 probable cases and 275 deaths.",
          "Beijing reported 28 probable SARS cases today in the sixth consecutive day that the city has reported less than 50 probable SARS. From the last week of April through 3 May, Beijing was reporting a daily average of more than 100 probable cases. The daily number of new deaths has also declined from a peak of 15, reported on 22 April, to an average of 4 during the past week. Beijing reported a single death today.",
          "WHO experts interpret the decrease in case numbers as encouraging, but have cautioned against concluding that the city’s SARS cases were on a downward trend. They warned that misdiagnosis of cases could have contributed to the lower numbers of probable cases in recent days. WHO officials fear that patients with milder symptoms of SARS are being excluded as probable cases.",
          "The number of wrongly diagnosed patients is not known, but WHO experts became concerned that this could be happening after recent visits to Beijing hospitals.",
          "“They fit the case definition but because they get better in a few days, they are not seen as probable cases,” explained Dr Daniel Chin, leader of WHO’s Beijing team of SARS experts. “Clinicians are making this decision because there’s an assumption that SARS patients must be very sick. But there’s a spectrum of severity for SARS.”",
          "Clinicians were also basing their decision to exclude patients as probable SARS cases simply because they had not had any known previous contact with a SARS case – a definition used in areas with few SARS cases. Given the relatively large number of SARS cases in Beijing, such a criterion cannot be used, Dr Chin said.",
          "He added that this was occurring due to confusion over the case definition, not because clinicians were trying to hide cases. WHO has asked the Beijing Government for a taskforce to be convened to address this issue.",
          "Dr Chin said patients with milder SARS symptoms must be treated with all the same precautions. “It is still possible that they are not SARS cases, but without a reliable test, we can’t confirm that,” he said.",
          "Patients with milder symptoms start off being isolated as suspect cases. But after their condition improves, they end up being sent to general medical wards, where they could infect other patients. Others may be sent home too early. “They may not need to be hospitalized but they could still be infectious,” Dr Chin said.",
          "A study of clinical progression in 75 SARS patients, published in today’s Lancet by a Hong Kong laboratory in the WHO network, describes three clinical stages in patients from the Amoy Gardens cluster. In the mostly uniform three-stage pattern, the first week of illness was characterized by fever, myalgia, and other symptoms that generally improved after a few days. In the second week of illness, when infectivity is greatest, patients frequently experienced recurrence of fever, diarrhoea, and oxygen desaturation. In this study, 20% of the patients progressed to a third phase, characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome necessitating ventilatory support.",
          "Health authorities and clinicians need to be aware of these three phases of illness. In terms of preventing further spread, including nosocomial transmission, it is dangerous to prematurely relax precautions, notably isolation and infection control, following clinical improvement during the first week of illness.",
          "Guidance for mass gatherings Guidance for mass gatherings was issued by WHO yesterday in response to concern that persons travelling to large events from areas with local transmission of SARS might pose a risk to other attendees in the host country. The recommendations, which are issued as global guidance and based on a risk-benefit analysis, are in line with WHO efforts to prevent the further international spread of SARS while also protecting the travelling public from unjustified restrictions. See Guidance for Mass Gatherings: hosting persons arriving from an area with recent local transmission of SARS",
          "The purpose of the recommendations is to help hosting governments and organizers of such events make decisions that protect domestic populations.",
          "Such decisions are left to the authority of individual countries based on their own assessment of the nature of the event, the potential for exposure of the general population should a case of SARS occur, and the capacity of the country’s public health infrastructure to cope. Capacity includes pre-existing arrangements for surveillance, contact tracing, and isolation – in other words, capacity for managing the situation should someone attending the event become ill with SARS.",
          "Stability of the SARS virus in the environment WHO has today published additional data on the stability of the SARS virus on different environmental surfaces. See First data on stability and resistance of SARS coronavirus compiled by members of WHO laboratory network",
          "The data, which come from studies conducted by laboratories in the WHO network, indicate that the SARS virus in sterilized stool can survive for 36 hours on a plastered wall or a formica surface, for 72 hours on a plastic surface or stainless steel, and for 96 hours on a glass slide.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7739 probable SARS cases and 611 deaths have been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 54 new cases and 13 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SAR (4), and Taiwan, China (5)."

WHO warned the national and international health community as soon as cholera was first identified by hospital staff in Basra last week in order to put in place immediate containment measures.",
          "Since last week, WHO, the Iraqi health authorities and their partners have set up a cholera taskforce to respond quickly to this outbreak and to minimize its consequences for the people of Basra. Cases of Cholera have been reported in Basra since 1989. In 2002, for example, 257 specimens were confirmed positive for cholera. The number of cases peaks each year during the warmest months of the year, between May and October. In recent years, diarrhoeal disease has been one of the three main killers of children in Iraq.",

We have detailed reports of sharp increases in diarrhoeal cases from Baghdad and Mosul, as well as anecdotal reports from elsewhere. WHO believes that the lack of access to clean, safe water and the problems with security combine to produce a particularly dangerous situation in which there could be a large number of cases of diarrhoeal disease - including, but not limited to, cholera."

The teleconference, which was requested by Health Canada, reviewed the adequacy of data on the SARS situation in Canada and summarized the criteria and procedures used by WHO when making decisions about which areas should be included in the list.",

If no further cases have occurred for 20 days, which is twice the maximum incubation period for SARS, the chain of transmission is considered broken.

Physicians are working in individual townships to record all people travelling to and from areas in China with local transmission. Individuals who are found to have fevers are sent to fever clinics for further monitoring. Workers from provinces with recent local transmission are placed in observation for as long as 3 weeks, during which their temperatures are checked numerous times each day. In some cases, entire villages where cases of SARS in farmers have been detected have been placed under quarantine.",

Experiences in a growing number of countries indicate that the disease can be contained, thus supporting WHO’s overall objective: to prevent SARS from becoming widely established as another new disease in humans.",
          "In the absence of a vaccine, the most effective way to control a new disease such as SAS is to break the chain of transmission from infected to healthy persons. In almost all documented cases, SARS is spread through close face-to-face contact with infected droplets when a patient sneezes or coughs.",
          "For SARS, three activities – case detection, patient isolation, and contact tracing – can reduce the number of people exposed to each infectious case and eventually break the chain of transmission.",
          "Case detection aims to identify SARS cases as soon after onset of illness as possible. Once cases are identified, the next step is to ensure their prompt isolation, in a properly equipped facility, and management according to strict procedures of infection control. The third activity – the detective work – involves the identification of all close contacts of each case and assurance of their careful follow-up, including daily health checks and possible voluntary home isolation.",
          "Together, these activities limit the daily number of contacts possible for each potentially infectious case. They also work to shorten the amount of time that lapses between onset of illness and isolation of the patient, thus reducing opportunities for the virus to spread to others.",
          "The effectiveness of these measures is reflected in an important indicator of disease transmission – the so-called “effective reproduction number”. This is the average number of new cases generated by each new case.",
          "If each new SARS patient infects more than one additional person, then the number of new cases will increase with time. If each new SARS patient infects one further person, then the number of new cases will remain static. However, if each new SARS patient infects, on average, less than one further person, then the number of new cases will fall and the outbreak will die out. This remains WHO’s overall objective, both in its support to individual countries and globally.",
          "The example of Singapore Singapore has instituted comprehensive procedures for contact tracing and isolation, and these measures appear to be working. WHO learned yesterday, during a videoconference with Singaporean officials, that the so-called “time to isolation” had been reduced from a high of three days in the early phase of the outbreak to 1.4 days by last week, thus reducing by half the amount of time infected persons can expose others to the SARS virus.",
          "These measures are being applied elsewhere, with SARS outbreaks coming under control in several areas. WHO is now collecting the data needed to systematically assess the effectiveness of these and other control measures being implemented around the world, and will strengthen its recommendations accordingly.",
          "Nonetheless, as SARS has clearly demonstrated, a single case admitted to an unprepared hospital can ignite a new outbreak. While trends are moving in an encouraging direction in many areas, even greater focus on control measures is needed if SARS is to be contained globally. WHO experiences with outbreaks of Ebola haemorrhagic fever have repeatedly shown that the initial stages of containment are the most dangerous time to start lowering the level of control.",
          "“We can’t become complacent,” says Michael J. Ryan, Coordinator of WHO’s Global Alert and Response Programme. “In fact, this is the time to intensify our efforts.”",
          "Dr Ryan has led international field responses to large outbreaks of Ebola and several other emerging infectious diseases.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7548 probable SARS cases with 573 deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 111 new cases and 21 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (10), Hong Kong SAR (7), and Taiwan, China (4).",
          "China has reported today 80 new probable cases and 10 deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 5086 probable cases and 262 deaths. New cases were concentrated in Beijing (48), Hebei (14), and Shanxi (13).",
          "Taiwan reported 23 new cases and 4 deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 207 cases and 24 deaths"

          "Situation in Singapore A panel of WHO experts conferred by videoconference today with Singaporean officials, led by Minister for Health and Second Minister for Finance Lim Hng Kiang and Minister of State for Health Dr Balaji Sadasivan, to assess progress in containing the SARS outbreak.",
          "Singapore has greatly increased its containment measures aimed at halting further transmission of SARS. A special effort has been made to raise the standards of infection control at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, which was converted into the country’s specialized hospital for managing SARS patients.",
          "Singapore has also introduced strict screening measures for all outbound air passengers. Selected incoming passengers from areas with recent local transmission of SARS are also screened. Nineteen thermal infrared scanners are in place at the airport, on loan from the military. The machines are capable of detecting a fever within a 0.2°C degree range of accuracy.",
          "Next week, 7 more scanners are expected to be added, ensuring that all inbound and outbound passengers can be checked. Last week, of the 70,000 passengers that were screened, 58 were found to have fever and taken to the SARS-designated hospital. Two were later admitted as suspect SARS cases, but neither has been reclassified as probable. All contacts of known SARS cases are being placed under supervised home quarantine for 10 days.",
          "Singapore’s actions to contain the SARS outbreak were described as “exemplary” by Dr David Heymann, Executive Director of communicable disease programmes at WHO. “Singapore has been one of the most successful countries in its response to SARS,” said Dr Heymann.",
          "Situation in Hong Kong Hong Kong today reported 5 new probable cases of SARS. The territory has seen a steady decline in the number of new cases, which has been in the single digits for the past eight days. WHO experts also held a videoconference with Hong Kong’s Secretary of Health, Welfare and Food, Dr Eng-kiong Yeoh and Director of Health Dr Margaret Chan today. WHO commended Hong Kong officials for their level of transparency in reporting on the SARS situation in the territory, a degree of cooperation that would be valuable from all countries.",
          "Hong Kong has introduced a rigorous contact tracing procedure. All close contacts of known SARS cases are quarantined at home. In addition, their Hong Kong Identity Card numbers are passed to the Immigration Department to ensure that these individuals cannot leave the territory.",
          "Contact tracing has established epidemiological links for the majority of Hong Kong’s SARS patients. Around 8.6% of patients have no identifiable exposure source. Detailed investigation is ongoing.",
          "The last known exportation of a SARS case from Hong Kong occurred on 18 April.",
          "Interpretation of “areas with recent local transmission” The list of areas with recent local transmission is issued by WHO to facilitate use of the SARS case definition to detect and report suspect and probable cases. A recent history of travel to an area where local transmission outside a confined setting, such as the health care environment, has been documented can assist physicians in the interpretation of symptoms in international travellers.",
          "Inclusion of countries and areas in this list, which is stratified, does not mean that WHO recommends travel restrictions to the country or area.",
          "Beginning today, WHO is posting on its website a new table indicating those areas with recent local transmission for which WHO has issued recommendations pertaining to international travel. Two recommended measures are specified: exit screening for international travellers departing the area, and traveller to consider postponing all but essential travel to the area. The table will be updated daily.",
          "No travel restrictions are recommended by WHO to any other areas.",
          "The previous list of “areas with recent local transmission” continues to be issued daily, but is now linked to the SARS case definitions. This change is introduced to reduce opportunities for misinterpretation of the purpose and significance of the list.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7447 probable cases with 552 deaths have been reported from 30 countries. This represents an increase of 168 new cases and 26 deaths since the last update was issued on Saturday. The new deaths were reported in China (17), Hong Kong SAR (6), Taiwan, China (2), and Singapore (1).",
          "China has today reported 144 new probable cases, bringing the cumulative total to 5013 cases, with 252 deaths. Most new cases were reported in Beijing (48) and Hebei (11).",
          "Taiwan reported 12 new cases, bringing the cumulative total to 184 cases, with 20 deaths."

          "Beijing remains the most severely affected area in mainland China, with a cumulative total of 2227 probable cases and 116 deaths. Since the beginning of this month, Beijing has reported 862 new probable cases and 41 deaths. The largest number of cases for this month occurred on 1 May, when Beijing reported 122 new cases and 7 deaths.",
          "Although today’s figures are lower, WHO officials in Beijing have cautioned against any clear conclusions that the SARS outbreak has begun to decline in the city. Many factors that influence the outbreak’s future evolution remain unknown. For example, half of all new probable cases in the city do not have any recorded previous contact with a SARS patient. Knowledge about the source of transmission for all SARS cases contributes to understanding of the dynamics of the outbreak and assists in its containment.",
          "WHO officials will be working with Beijing authorities to improve data analysis and develop policy options for responding to the outbreak. The lack of known contact to a SARS patient among the more recently reported cases could be related to either how cases are being reported or how and where the virus is being transmitted.",
          "Situation in the Philippines As of 10 May, the Philippines has reported a cumulative total of 10 probable SARS cases, with two deaths. Health authorities have determined that all 10 cases are part of a chain of transmission linked to a single imported case. All cases were placed in isolation in hospital.",
          "Contacts of the 10 cases have been traced, and authorities are confident that all contacts have been identified and placed in isolation. The last two cases that could have transmitted infection were isolated on 30 April. All contacts have completed their period of observation and none has developed SARS.",
          "The cluster of SARS cases in the Philippines began with the importation of a case who returned to the Philippines from Toronto, Canada. The imported case subsequently died from SARS, as did her father. Two of the remaining eight patients have been discharged. The others are recovering in hospital.",
          "WHO considers that the cluster of SARS cases has been well contained. There appears to be no increased transmission risk in the Philippines. For these reasons, WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel to the Philippines.",
          "Situation in Mongolia Yesterday Mongolia was removed from the list of countries with recent local transmission. Twenty days had passed since the only case resulting from local transmission was appropriately isolated.",
          "Earlier, WHO sent specialists to the country to investigate the cluster of cases and provide technical support. Isolation facilities were judged adequate and contact tracing was considered complete. WHO has therefore concluded that the cluster of cases in Mongolia has been well contained.",
          "The cumulative total of probable SARS cases in Mongolia is nine. No deaths have occurred. Six of the nine cases have recovered. The additional three cases remain in isolation in a SARS-designated hospital.",
          "WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel to Mongolia.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 7296 probable SARS cases with 526 deaths have been reported from 30 countries. This represents an increase of 119 cases and 12 deaths when compared with yesterday.",
          "Most of the new cases were reported in China (85) and Taiwan, China (23). The new deaths occurred in China (8), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Taiwan, China (5)."

This temporary advice will be reassessed regularly.",

In many countries, prompt detection and isolation of initial cases have prevented further transmission altogether or held additional cases to a very small number.",

          "Information about the magnitude of the SARS outbreaks in Tianjin and Inner Mongolia provinces of China, and Taipei in Taiwan province of China, has been carefully reviewed by WHO. The travel advice is based on a consideration of the magnitude of the outbreaks in these regions, including both the number of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases. The extent of local chains of transmission as well as the potential for spread beyond these areas were also major factors in the reasoning for this advice.",
          "WHO travel advice is issued to protect international public health and to reduce opportunities for further global spread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February, that has spread along the routes of international air travel. As of 7 May, a cumulative total of 6903 cases had been reported from 29 countries on five continents. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS and contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage.",

          "Disease Outbreak Reported",
          "Case fatality ratio WHO has today revised its initial estimates of the case fatality ratio of SARS. The revision is based on an analysis of the latest data from Canada, China, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, and Viet Nam.",
          "On the basis of more detailed and complete data, and more reliable methods, WHO now estimates that the case fatality ratio of SARS ranges from 0% to 50% depending on the age group affected, with an overall estimate of case fatality of 14% to 15%.",
          "The likelihood of dying from SARS in a given area has been shown to depend on the profile of the cases, including the age group most affected and the presence of underlying disease. Based on data received by WHO to date, the case fatality ratio is estimated to be less than 1% in persons aged 24 years or younger, 6% in persons aged 25 to 44 years, 15% in persons aged 45 to 64 years, and greater than 50% in persons aged 65 years and older.",
          "A case fatality ratio measures the proportion of all people with a disease who will die from the disease. In other words, it measures the likelihood that a disease will kill its host, and is thus an important indicator of the severity of a disease and its significance as a public health problem. The likelihood that a person will die of SARS could be influenced by factors related to the SARS virus, the route of exposure and dose (amount) of virus, personal factors such as age or the presence of another disease, and access to prompt medical care.",
          "Many factors complicate efforts to calculate a case fatality ratio while an outbreak is still evolving. Deaths from SARS typically occur after several weeks of illness. Full recovery may take even longer. While an epidemic is still evolving, only some of the individuals affected by the disease will have died or recovered. Only at the end of an epidemic can an absolute value be calculated, taking into account total deaths, total recoveries and people lost to follow-up. Calculating case fatality as the number of deaths reported divided by the number of cases reported irrespective of the time elapsed since they became ill gives an underestimate of the true case fatality ratio.",
          "One method of overcoming this difficulty is to calculate the case fatality ratio using only those cases whose final outcome – died or recovered – is known. However, this method, when applied before an outbreak is over, gives an overestimate because the average time from illness onset to death for SARS is shorter than the average time from illness onset to recovery.",
          "With these methods, estimates of the case fatality ratio range from 11% to 17% in Hong Kong, from 13% to 15% in Singapore, from 15% to 19% in Canada, and from 5% to 13% in China.",
          "A more accurate and unbiased estimation of case fatality for SARS can be obtained with a third method, survival analysis. This method relies on detailed individual data on the time from illness onset to death or full recovery, or time since illness onset for current cases. Using this method, WHO estimates that the case fatality ratio is 14% in Singapore and 15% in Hong Kong.",
          "In Viet Nam, where SARS has been contained and measurement is more straightforward, case fatality was comparatively low, at 8%. One explanation for this is the large number of total cases that occurred in younger, previously healthy health care workers.",
          "Incubation period WHO has also reviewed estimates of the incubation period of SARS, using individual case data. On the basis of this review, WHO continues to conclude that the current best estimate of the maximum incubation period is 10 days.",
          "The incubation period, which is the time from exposure to a causative agent to onset of disease, is particularly important as it forms the basis for many recommended control measures, including contact tracing and the duration of home isolation for contacts of probable SARS cases. Knowledge about the incubation period can also help physicians make diagnostic decisions about whether the presenting symptoms and clinical history of a patient point to SARS or to some other disease.",
          "The incubation period can vary from one case to another according to the route by which the person was exposed, the dose of virus received, and other factors, including immune status. Estimates of the incubation period are further complicated by the fact that some patients have had opportunities for multiple exposures to the virus. The particular exposure that caused disease may prove impossible to determine. For these reasons, the most reliable estimates of the incubation period are based on a study of cases having a single documented exposure to a known case.",
          "In today’s review, WHO has analysed the incubation periods of individuals with well-defined single-point exposures in Singapore, Canada, and Europe. Findings support the original estimate of 10 days as the maximum incubation period.",
          "However, one recently published analysis of data from Hong Kong estimates a longer maximum incubation period in a group of 57 patients. This analysis, which may be significant and important for disease control, will be studied in more detail. The longer incubation period could reflect differences in methodology, specificity of diagnosis, route of transmission, infectious dose, or other factors. Reliable diagnosis – determining that all cases diagnosed as SARS are true cases of the disease – has been particularly difficult to establish in this outbreak, as diagnosis is made based on a set of non-specific symptoms and clinical signs that are seen in several other diseases.",
          "Prompt isolation WHO continues to recommend the earliest possible isolation of all suspect and probable cases of SARS. A short time between onset of symptoms and isolation reduces opportunities for transmission to others. It also reduces the number of contacts requiring active follow-up, and thus helps relieve some of the burden on health services. In addition, prompt hospitalization gives patients the best chance of receiving possibly life-saving care should their condition take a critical course.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6903 probable SARS cases and 495 deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 186 new cases and 17 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (5), Hong Kong SAR (11) and Taiwan (1)."

          "6 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported A panel of WHO staff participated in a video teleconference with Hong Kong government officials earlier today to discuss the SARS situation in Hong Kong. Present at the meeting from Hong Kong were the Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food, Dr. Eng-kiong Yeoh, Director of Health, Dr. Margaret Chan, and the Health, Welfare and Food Bureau’s Head of Research, Dr. Lo Su Vui. WHO staff included Dr David Heymann, Executive Director for Communicable Diseases, and a panel with expertise in virology, epidemiology, and clinical medicine.",
          "Following a presentation by Dr Yeoh, Dr Heymann characterized the efforts taken in Hong Kong to stem the spread of SARS as “heroic.” “All of us have nothing but admiration for you and your team,” he added.",
          "Particularly impressive among the measures, which is some cases exceed those recommended by WHO, are exit screening procedures at border checkpoints, publication of information on all buildings where residents have developed SARS, procedures for isolation and quarantine, and aggressive contract tracing that relies on a system initially developed by the police force for use in criminal investigations.",
          "Hong Kong reported 9 new SARS cases today, including 2 health care workers and 7 contacts of patients known to have had SARS. To date, Hong Kong has reported a cumulative total of 1646 probable cases and 193 deaths.",
          "The number of new cases (in the single digits for the last several days) has steadily declined, suggesting that the outbreak has peaked. Epidemiological data submitted to WHO today indicate three apparent peaks of SARS in Hong Kong: the Prince of Wales Hospital outbreak (18 March), the Amoy Gardens outbreak (30 March), and a smaller outbreak in the outlying region of Tai Po (11 April).",
          "Since 29 March, Hong Kong has introduced medical posts, supported by infrared temperature scanners, at its border points. All incoming travellers are now required to sign health declarations. As of 14 April, the government has prohibited close contacts of SARS patients from leaving Hong Kong, by monitoring residents via their Hong Kong Identity Card numbers. As a result of these routine checks, 37 people have been referred to health authorities. Of these, two were later confirmed to be SARS cases.",
          "Hong Kong is also employing a strategic computer system to facilitate contact tracing and to identify addresses and names of close contacts of SARS patients. Geographic clusters of SARS cases, or so-called “hot spots” in certain buildings throughout the territory have been identified using this scheme. The government maintains data on cases and their contacts in a centralized, dedicated eSARS database.",
          "Dr Yeoh also announced today that no new cases associated with the Amoy Gardens outbreak have occurred for 20 days. Hong Kong has recently launched several public information and education campaigns to increase SARS awareness. These efforts have been successful in encouraging people experiencing symptoms to seek prompt medical care, thus reducing the time when people capable of spreading the virus are circulating in the community.",
          "China China reported 138 new probable SARS cases today, 70 of which were from Beijing, bringing the cumulative total in the country and capital to 4409 and 1960 respectively. There were also 8 deaths reported, half from Beijing, bringing the total number of SARS deaths to 214.",
          "New probable SARS cases were also reported in Guangdong (12), Hebei (6), Inner Mongolia (21), Jilin (2) and Tianjin (11). The number of cases in Jilin has increased in the last few days, with cases tripling tos 23 since April 30. There were also two new cases in Shanghai, bringing the city’s total number of cases to six.",
          "Cases continued to rise in the two most heavily affected provinces outside of the capital, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, with 11 and 21 probable cases reported, for a total of 369 and 251 respectively.",
          "WHO experts will visit Hebei province in China as part of a joint Ministry of Health-WHO team to assess the SARS situation and the capacity to cope with an outbreak.",
          "Four WHO experts will leave on 8 May with experts from China’s Ministry of Health for the province, which surrounds Beijing and is home to some of the capital’s “floating population” of migrant workers.",
          "The number of probable SARS cases in Hebei has risen sharply in the last few days to a total of 113, as of today. In just five days between April 30 and May 4, the numbers doubled to 98. There are also about 100 suspect SARS cases in the province.",
          "“We feel the team can make a difference here. It’s still early on in the epidemic. Our input at this stage could prevent the situation developing into a large outbreak. The level of development in the province is also above average, so any recommendations made can be quickly implemented, although resources will still be stretched,” said Alan Schnur, from WHO’s China office who will join the team.",
          "“There’s a lot of movement between the province and the capital so we are concerned about the potential for the disease to spread,” he added.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6727 probable SARS cases with 478 deaths have been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of 153 new cases and 17 new deaths compared with yesterday.",
          "Colombia reported its first probable case today. India also reported a probable case today."

          "5 May 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported",
          "Scientists in the WHO network of collaborating laboratories yesterday reported results of the first scientific studies designed to determine the survival time of the SARS virus in different environmental media. Results from studies of the effectiveness of different disinfectants commonly used in hospitals were also reported, confirming the validity of currently recommended measures for infection control.",
          "The new studies, conducted at network labs in Hong Kong, Japan, and Germany confirm, as anticipated, that the SARS virus can survive after drying on plastic surfaces for up to 48 hours. Ongoing studies are testing virus stability on additional surfaces, with initial results expected by Wednesday.",
          "Scientists have also tested virus survival times in faeces. Research conducted at one Hong Kong lab determined that the virus can survive in faeces for at least 2 days, and in urine for at least 24 hours. Studies conducted at a second Hong Kong lab found that virus in faeces taken from patients suffering from diarrhoea, which has a lower acidity than normal stools, could survive for 4 days. This raises the possibility that surfaces contaminated with faeces from patients suffering from diarrhoea might survive for as long as 4 days. However, the dose of virus needed to cause infection remains unknown. Further studies are needed before firm conclusions about the role of faecal-oral transmission can be made.",
          "Results of the new studies underscore the need for frequent handwashing, proper cleaning, and good disinfection control in hospitals managing SARS cases. Spread by infected droplets remains the most important mode of transmission. Good personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is important for everyone in areas with SARS cases, but most especially so for persons who have been in close contact with a probable case.",
          "Shedding of the SARS virus in faeces, respiratory secretions, and urine is now well-established. In Hong Kong in late March, a large and sudden cluster of more than 320 simultaneous cases occurred among residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The outbreak raised the possibility of an environmental source of infection. Subsequent investigations suggested that contamination with sewage might have played a role. Around 66% of Amoy Gardens SARS patients presented with diarrhoea as a symptom, compared with 2% to 7% of cases in other outbreaks. With the exception of the Amoy Gardens cluster and a previous event where cases were linked to visits to a single floor of a hotel, SARS is thought to spread in the majority of cases through close person-to-person exposure to infected droplets expelled during coughing or sneezing.",
          "All previous speculation about the environmental behaviour of the SARS virus was based on knowledge about other well-known human members of the Coronavirus family, which cause illnesses such as the common cold. WHO has been concerned that the SARS virus, which is unlike any other human or animal virus in its family, might behave differently. Studies now under way in the network laboratories will support the further development and implementation of virus-specific infection control measures. WHO remains concerned that the SARS virus continues to be transmitted to hospital staff in highly advanced settings where sophisticated infection control measures are in place.",
          "Situation in China Chinese authorities reported 160 new probable cases of SARS and 9 new deaths. The new figures bring the cumulative total in China to 4280 probable cases and 206 deaths. Of the new cases, 98 were reported in Beijing. The second highest number of new cases was reported in Shanxi. Three of the 9 deaths occurred in Beijing, 3 in Guangdong, 2 in Shanxi, and 1 in Tianjin.",
          "The new figures bring the cumulative total in China to 4280 probable cases and 206 deaths. China now accounts for 65% of the world’s total cumulative number of probable SARS cases and 44% of all reported deaths.",
          "In Beijing, some 16,000 residents remain under quarantine. In Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, where 360 probable SARS cases have been reported, all schools are to be closed indefinitely.",
          "WHO officials are particularly concerned about the SARS situation in China’s outer provinces, where surveillance and reporting systems may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect all suspect and probable cases. In resource-poor regions like Gansu and Jiangxi, serious questions remain about the capacity of the health systems to cope with a challenge on the scale of SARS.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 6583 probable SARS cases with 461 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 364 new cases and 26 new deaths since the last report was compiled on Saturday."

On 26 March, a Taiwanese resident of Hong Kong’s Amoy Gardens flew to Taiwan and took a train to Taichung to celebrate the traditional festival, Qing Ming. The man’s brother became Taiwan’s first SARS fatality, and a fellow passenger on the train also became a case. By 16 April, 27 probable cases had been detected in Taiwan. Investigation of cases determined that all either had a travel history to an affected area, or had been in close contact with patients.",

This represents an increase of 207 new cases and 26 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in Canada (2), China (11), Hong Kong SAR (8), and Taiwan (5).",
          "Taiwan, which has a rapidly evolving outbreak, reported today a cumulative total of 100 probable cases, with 11 new cases compared with yesterday. Eight SARS deaths have occurred in Taiwan. Canada reported 2 new probable cases today.",
          "Areas with recent local transmission As of today, WHO is now issuing daily lists of countries having areas where local transmission has occurred within the past 20 days. Local transmission occurs when one or more probable cases of SARS most likely acquired their infection locally, regardless of the setting, as opposed to cases in which infection was acquired in another country. The new list, which replaces the previous list of affected areas, also stratifies the extent of local transmission into low, medium, and high categories."

          "Situation in China The number of new SARS cases continues to increase steadily in China, particularly in Beijing. Today, China reported 187 new cases and 11 deaths, more than half of which were in the capital.",
          "WHO officials in China believe the development of a central database of operational SARS data would greatly aid in combating the disease. The next few months will prove crucial in the attempt to contain SARS worldwide, which now greatly depends on whether the disease can be controlled in China.",
          "WHO is studying how best to support hospitals in some of China’s poorer western and northern provinces. Concern continues that hospitals in these resource-poor regions may not have the necessary facilities to properly isolate and treat SARS patients. More front-line hospital staff with expertise in dealing with infectious diseases may be required. Guidelines are also needed for China’s national health care system on the kinds of infection control measures needed to prevent continuing transmission of the disease.",
          "Shanghai is to enforce stricter SARS preventive measures, including the enforcement of 14-day quarantine periods for travelers arriving from affected areas. These measures are even stricter than those currently recommended by WHO. Traffic checkpoints have already been set up to screen people coming into the city, where they are given temperature checks and asked to fill out health declaration forms.",
          "WHO revises SARS case definition WHO has today updated its case definition for SARS to take into account the appropriate use of results from laboratory tests. Several diagnostic tests have been developed by various laboratories for the detection of the SARS virus and antibodies to the virus. However, all presently available tests have specific strengths and weaknesses.",
          "For this reason, WHO continues to advise clinicians that patients should not have their case definition category downgraded while awaiting results of laboratory testing or on the basis of negative results.",
          "WHO is concerned that inappropriate use of laboratory results can have a negative impact on patient management and selection of an appropriate level of infection control. Therefore, negative test results for the SARS virus cannot be used to exclude infection in either suspect or probable cases. In contrast, positive results of quality-assured laboratory testing can add to the efficacy of SARS case management, provided tests are properly conducted and interpreted.",
          "Positive virus results from lab tests demonstrate that the patient is excreting virus, or its genetic material, and thus might pose a risk of disease transmission to others. Consequently, suspect SARS cases with a positive lab result (virus isolation or PCR) should be classified and reported as probable cases.",
          "Guidance for quality assurance, particularly for PCR tests, has been posted at the WHO website. See Recommendations for laboratories testing by PCR for presence of SARS coronavirus -RNA",
          "WHO supports calibration of diagnostic tests WHO, supported by members of its laboratory network for SARS diagnosis and the Robert-Koch Institute, Germany, is making standardized reagents available to improve reliability and support the quality assurance of diagnostic tests for SARS. Virological standards are being made available to ministries of health in countries with SARS outbreaks immediately, with shipment scheduled to begin on Monday 5 May. Serological kits will be made available by 12 May.",
          "Ministries of health are invited to designate national laboratories and communicate their needs to WHO at sars virus@who.int or fax 0041 22 791 48 78.",
          "The diagnostic standards will be made available to up to 3 laboratories in all countries. In China, however, the supply will be sufficient for all major laboratories in all provinces.",
          "WHO is now planning an external proficiency testing programme to assess the performance of diagnostic tests and establish the basis for quality control.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 5865 probable cases with 391 deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an increase of 212 additional cases and 19 deaths when compared with yesterday. The deaths occurred in China (11), Hong Kong (5), Taiwan (2), and Singapore (1). Poland reported its first case today.",
          "The United Kingdom and the United States of America have been removed from the list of areas with recent local transmission. In both countries, the last instance of local transmission occurred more than 20 days ago. Tianjin, China and Ulaanbaatar City, Mongolia, were added to the list."

          "Beijing reported the highest number of new cases (101) and deaths (9), for a cumulative total of 1440 probable cases and 75 deaths. Of these new cases, 31 were previously reported as suspect cases while 70 were reported for the first time.",
          "Nine hospitals in the Chinese capital now deal exclusively with SARS patients. Just outside Beijing, a 1000-bed complex has been built to accommodate incoming patients. Health authorities have expressed concern that the SARS outbreak could overwhelm Beijing’s already crowded hospitals.",
          "Xiong Ke Chest Hospital will open a new wing with 100 more beds for SARS patients tomorrow, hospital officials told a WHO expert during a visit to the hospital today. With 235 beds all occupied by SARS patients, the hospital already has the largest number of SARS patients in the country.",
          "Dr James Maguire, from the WHO team of experts, said that despite extremely difficult working conditions, hospital staff had risen to the occasion. “Their esprit de corps is excellent. They are taking great pride in what they are doing and working very hard,” he said, adding that some staff work 45 days without seeing their families. The rigorous infection control procedures included heavy and hot protective clothing.",
          "Dr Maguire, an epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, said there was a need for more specialized equipment such as masks, gloves, ventilatory equipment, layer protective gear, and ambulances to transport patients between hospitals. WHO staff are aware that other hospitals in the city may need more or better supplies.",
          "The disease continued to make its mark elsewhere in the country. Jiangsu Province, which borders Shanghai, reported its first case today. More cases were reported in western China, with 34 more probable cases from Shanxi and seven more from Inner Mongolia, giving a total of 299 and 127 probable cases respectively. One fifth of the cases (65) in Shanxi Province are among health workers.",
          "Hebei also continued to report more cases, with nine more probable cases, giving a total of 48. Tianjin reported five more probable cases for a total of 49 cases, while Guangdong reported six, for a total of 1405.",

This represents an increase of 211 new cases and 19 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in China (11), Hong Kong SAR (7), and China, Taiwan (1). This was the first death in Taiwan, where the number of probable SARS cases has more than doubled, from 37 to 78, over the past week. China, Macao SAR reported its first probable case today."

          "Travel advisories for Beijing, Hong Kong SAR, and Guangdong and Shanxi provinces, China, remain in effect.",
          "Travel advisories are issued following consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of probable SARS cases, the last dates of cases of community transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.",
          "Dr Brundtland cited three changes in Toronto over the last week. The magnitude of probable SARS cases has decreased. Twenty days have passed since the last cases of community transmission occurred. No new confirmed exportation of cases has occurred.",
          "WHO has also been assured by Canadian authorities that pro-active screening measures at airports will be implemented, as recommended by WHO.",
          "There is no change in Toronto’s status as an “affected area.” Viet Nam, which is the first country to have contained its SARS outbreak, was removed from the list of affected areas yesterday.",
          "SARS is the first major new infectious disease of the 21st century and is taking full advantage of the opportunities for rapid international spread afforded by a closely interconnected and highly mobile society. The purpose of travel advisories is to reduce opportunities for further international spread of what is a new, severe, and poorly understood infectious disease.",
          "Travel advisories are reviewed daily. Advice is issued on the basis of a set of epidemiological criteria. The risk to international public health, which is the principal concern for WHO, occurs when the magnitude and dynamics of an outbreak allow an infected person to slip past control measures and undertake international travel, possibly seeding an outbreak elsewhere.",
          "Situation in China A total of 202 new probable SARS cases were reported across China today, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 3303. Nine deaths were also reported today.",

          "China’s largest number of cumulative cases remains concentrated in Guangdong Province, where the SARS outbreak began in mid-November. Only 10% of these cases are current. As 1201 patients have been discharged and 51 have died, there are less than 150 SARS cases remaining in Guangdong’s health care system.",
          "In contrast, the rapidly growing number of new cases in Beijing imposes a heavy burden on the health care system and particularly its hospital capacity. In Beijing, 86% of cases (1198 cases) are current.",
          "The situation in western China continues to be of concern. New probable cases in Shanxi (23) and Inner Mongolia (7) increase the cumulative totals to 266 and 120 respectively.",
          "WHO is working with local health authorities in Beijing to review and improve the data needed to better monitor the SARS situation and assess the success of current control strategies.

The change in Viet Nam’s status follows 20 consecutive days (the duration of two incubation periods) since the last new case was detected. “It’s a big day for all of us in Viet Nam and also throughout the world,” said Pascale Brudon, the WHO representative in Hanoi. “WHO congratulates Viet Nam for being the first country to succeed in containing the SARS epidemic.”",
          "The Vietnamese government first made the announcement this morning, but added that the country needs to remain vigilant. The health ministry affirmed its determination to work with WHO to guard against the importation of the virus.",
          "Since SARS was first detected in Viet Nam on 26 February, WHO has collaborated closely with Vietnamese officials to bring the outbreak under control. Key actions have included early recognition of the outbreak, the consolidation of SARS patients in a single hospital, strict infection control, diligent contact tracing, and thorough investigation of all rumoured cases. “We have been capable of containing this epidemic, but the virus is still present in neighbouring countries,” said Brudon.",
          "WHO believes Viet Nam should still maintain a high level of alert since even a single new case of SARS could spark another outbreak. Last week, the Vietnamese health ministry asked the Prime Minister to authorize the closing of the country’s land borders with China. Viet Nam has currently heightened its border surveillance with China, but has stopped short of closing the border.",
          "More than 5000 cases worldwide As of today, a cumulative total of 5050 probable SARS cases with 321 deaths have been reported from 26 countries.

          "Among its activities, the team examined the SARS surveillance and reporting system, investigated rumours that the case burden might be higher than officially reported, and visited 10 health facilities, 3 district Centres for Disease Control, and the municipal Centre for Disease Control. The team was given free access to all requested data, patient registries, and facilities, which were visited on very short notice.",
          "The team found no evidence of systematic underreporting of cases, and concluded that the level of preparedness and response was good. Reporting of cases appeared to be open, frank, and accurate. Over the past 3–4 weeks, authorities designated two hospitals as dedicated to the treatment of SARS patients and set up cough and fever clinics. The team also found a very high level of government commitment to tackle the SARS problem.",
          "Many questions remain about why Shanghai has been spared a SARS outbreak on the scale of that seen in Beijing. Had a larger number of cases occurred, it is not certain whether the systems presently in place would have been able to cope.",
          "Situation in Hong Kong Health authorities announced 17 new cases, including 3 in health care workers, and 6 deaths, including the youngest SARS fatality in Hong Kong to date. This was a previously healthy 28-year-old man from the Amoy Gardens housing estate cluster. The other deaths occurred in men aged 38, 40, 61, and 70 years, and a 45-year-old woman. Only one of these patients, the 70-year-old man, had a history of chronic disease.",
          "Of the six deaths announced yesterday, three were from the Amoy Gardens cluster.",
          "Authorities are continuing to investigate a small cluster of cases in the Tung Tau housing estate, where six cases have occurred in vertically linked flats. Presently available epidemiological evidence gives no reason to anticipate an outbreak at the estate on the scale of Amoy Gardens cluster, which involved more than 320 residents of a single building.",
          "A WHO team of environmental and “sick building” experts arrived in Hong Kong to assist local experts in the investigation of possible environmental sources of the virus.",
          "No new cases in Viet Nam for 18 days The SARS situation in Viet Nam has remained stable, at 63 cases and 5 deaths, for 18 consecutive days. Active investigation of numerous rumours has failed to detect a new case of SARS throughout this period. If the trend continues, the country will be removed from the list of affected areas on Monday, making Viet Nam the first country to contain its SARS outbreak.",
          "WHO officials in Viet Nam cautioned against a lapse in the present high state of alert, as the risk persists that a single imported case could seed an outbreak, as happened in February. However, the government showed strong commitment at the highest level from the beginning of the outbreak. Task forces and provincial teams were established and have worked well. Good procedures of infection control were rapidly established and eventually proved effective in preventing further spread among hospital staff.",
          "Should the country experience an imported case, this newly established infrastructure would most likely be effective in preventing another large outbreak.",

          "Viet Nam may soon become the first country to contain SARS No new cases of SARS have been detected in Viet Nam for 17 days in a row, despite a high level of awareness and good surveillance. Although numerous rumours have been reported, all have been investigated by WHO and government officials, and all suspect cases have been determined to have other causes.",
          "The most recent probable case was detected on 8 April, bringing the cumulative total in Viet Nam to 63 cases. Detection of that case initially brought disappointment, as it occurred after no new cases had been reported over an 8-day period. Since the outbreak was first recognized in Hanoi in late February, 5 deaths have occurred. As of today, five patients remain hospitalized.",
          "Viet Nam was the second country to experience a SARS outbreak. The first was China, where an outbreak began in Guangdong Province in mid-November of last year.",
          "If no new cases are detected by 30 April (a date which marks the end of two incubation periods), Viet Nam could become the first country to be taken off the list of SARS-affected countries. This achievement would also make Viet Nam the first country to successfully contain its SARS outbreak.",
          "SARS was first identified by Dr Carlo Urbani, a WHO infectious disease specialist. Dr Urbani alerted the world to SARS when cases of an unusual and severe respiratory disease began appearing among health staff treating a Chinese-American businessman at the French Hospital in Hanoi. The patient, a 48-year-old resident of Hong Kong, was admitted to hospital on 26 February with fever and respiratory symptoms. His recent travel history included trips to Guangdong Province, Shanghai, and Macao SAR. By 20 March, at least 22 staff at the Hanoi hospital were ill with influenza-like symptoms. Twenty had signs of pneumonia, and two were in serious condition.",
          "The Chinese-American businessman died of SARS in Hong Kong on 13 March. Dr Urbani died of SARS in Thailand on 29 March.",
          "WHO country staff attribute Viet Nam’s success in combating SARS to the quick manner in which the country initially reacted. “After Carlo identified the disease, we were able to influence the hospital to take the right infection control measures very quickly,” said Pascale Brudon, the WHO representative in Viet Nam.",
          "The commitment of the Vietnamese government came soon thereafter, including high-level support for a WHO coordinated response in Hanoi. “The first priority was to contain the disease and monitor each case,” said Brudon. International collaboration to combat SARS came quickly via the Japanese government and Médecins Sans Frontières, who both worked under the umbrella of the WHO initiative in Viet Nam.",
          "Viet Nam was fortunate in that the country had only a single index case, who spent less than 3 days in Hanoi prior to hospitalization. This short time in the community effectively limited opportunities to transmit the SARS virus to a contained hospital environment.",
          "Viet Nam’s northern Quang Ninh province recently began barring Chinese tourists at its overland border with China in an effort to prevent importation of SARS. This move comes ahead of any decision by the Vietnamese national government to seal its border with China indefinitely, as has been recommended by the country’s ministry of health.",
          "Caution urged in the use of diagnostic tests WHO is currently working with four major laboratories to develop a clinically validated diagnostic test for SARS. Standard test reagents are being established to assess the quality of the test and ensure its reliability. When the test has been developed and clinically validated, it can be used reliably to confirm cases of SARS. However, test development and validation are expected to take at least another two weeks.",
          "In the meantime, laboratories in a growing number of countries have developed SARS diagnostic tests, often based on information made available at the WHO web site. It is extremely important for national authorities and medical and hospital staff to understand the limitations of currently available tests. Their use as the basis for treatment decisions may give a false sense of security that can allow persons carrying the SARS virus, and therefore capable of infecting others, to escape detection.",
          "PCR tests can detect genetic material of the SARS virus in various specimens, including blood, stool, respiratory secretions, and tissue samples. Primers, which are the key pieces for a PCR test, have been made publicly available on the WHO web site by laboratories in the WHO network. The primers have since been used by many countries around the world.",
          "These currently available PCR tests are very specific but lack sensitivity. This means that negative test results cannot be relied on as proof that a patient is not infected with the SARS virus.",
          "In the absence of a reliable diagnostic test, national authorities are strongly advised to continue to base decisions concerning what constitutes both a suspect and a probable case of SARS on the present clinical and epidemiological case definition, and not to rely on the results of diagnostic tests. WHO advises that all suspect and probable SARS cases be placed in isolation and managed according to strict procedures of infection control.",
          "All other currently available diagnostic tests also have important limitations. The ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay) test detects antibodies in the serum of SARS patients reliably, but only as from about day 21 after the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Immunofluorescence assay tests detect antibodies in serum of SARS patients, but only after about day 10 following the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Moreover, the test is demanding. Reliable results depend on the use of fixed SARS virus, an immunofluorescence microscope, and an experienced microscopist.",
          "Virus in specimens from SARS patients can also be detected by infecting cell cultures and growing the virus. Once isolated, the virus must be identified as the SARS virus with further tests. Cell culture, which is the only method of demonstrating the existence of a live virus, is a very demanding and time-consuming test.",
          "Update on cases and countries",
          "As of today, a cumulative total of 4649 cases with 274 deaths have been reported from 26 countries. This represents an additional 210 cases and 11 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in China (5) and Hong Kong SAR (6).",
          "In China, the Ministry of Health has today informed WHO of 180 newly reported probable cases. The breakdown by location is Beijing (103), Inner Mongolia (23), Guangdong (15), Tianjin (13), Hebei (12), Shanxi (11), and one case each in Henan, Guangxi, and Sichuan. These latest figures bring the cumulative number of probable cases reported in China to 2601. Among health workers, a total of 38 new probable cases were reported from Beijing (17), Tianjin (9), Hebei (5), Inner Mongolia (5), Shanxi (1), and Guangdong (1).",
          "Beijing reported 3 deaths, Shanxi 1, and Guangdong 1, bringing the cumulative number of deaths in China to 115. The fact that cases continue to occur in health workers underscores the need for better infection control in hospitals. In Beijing, WHO is still awaiting data giving dates of onset and the location of cases in order to fully assess the situation."

          "Outbreaks of a of highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza virus A (H7N7) have been reported in various poultry farms in the Netherlands since February 2003. Recent cases of the disease in poultry have also been reported in Belgium.",
          "While avian influenza strains normally infect exclusively poultry, Dutch authorities have reported that the H7N7 strain has now jumped the species barrier, causing one death and more than 80 cases of mild disease in humans.",
          "A 57-year-old veterinarian who visited a poultry farm affected by the (H7N7) strain died on 17 April of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the Netherlands. H7N7 influenza virus was isolated from the patient. No other respiratory pathogen was detected in a series of laboratory tests.",
          "The detection of the H7N7 avian influenza strain in humans is the most recent case in which an avian influenza virus has crossed species to affect humans. In Hong Kong in 1997, the H5N1 strain of avian influenza caused its first outbreak in humans, with 18 cases and 6 deaths. In mid-February 2003, again in Hong Kong, the H5N1 strain infected two persons, causing one death.",
          "Since the beginning of the H7N7 outbreak in the Netherlands in late February, there have been 83 confirmed cases of human H7N7. The majority of these cases (79) exhibited conjunctivitis, and 13 of them displayed mild influenza-like illness. Three family members of 2 poultry worker have also fallen ill with a minor respiratory disease, suggesting a possible chain of human-to-human transmission. Affected poultry in the Netherlands are being slaughtered as a control measures. Mass culling of poultry proved effective, in both Hong Kong outbreaks, in preventing further cases in humans.",
          "Close investigation, including tracing of the veterinarian’s contacts, has not revealed any transmission of the disease (in its severe form, as opposed to the much milder conjunctivitis) to other persons. Based on available evidence, WHO concludes that the death is an isolated case, as no efficient human-to-human transmission of the avian H7N7 influenza virus strain has been detected.",
          "In accordance with WHO’s pandemic preparedness plan for influenza, WHO recommends that in countries where initial cases of H7N7 were detected, surveillance and diagnosis of the avian H7N7 virus should be enhanced in humans and susceptible animals (including chickens, turkeys, and pigs).",
          "In addition, countries should initiate specific investigations to increase understanding of possible transmission patterns. Specific personal protection, such as prophylactic use of the antiviral drug oseltamivir for agricultural workers in contact with H7N7-affected poultry, has also been recommended by national authorities in the Netherlands and in Belgium.",
          "WHO advises that persons in contact with H7N7-affected poultry flocks should be on guard for any signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. If symptoms arise, they should consult a doctor, who will then initiate laboratory testing and reporting to health officials.",
          "WHO emphasizes that these heightened surveillance measures will help in the timely detection of any further transmission of H7N7 to humans and to prevent its possible spread.",
          "The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network is currently assembling a test kit for H7N7 that will be ready for use in three weeks. As a precautionary measure, the network is also working on the development of a vaccine for H7N7."

          "Twenty-one provinces have now reported probable cases, with another five provinces reporting suspected cases.",
          "Of the 125 new cases, 24 occurred among health workers, including 17 in Beijing. Altogether, China has reported 541 cases in health workers during the course of its SARS outbreak, which began in mid-November 2002.",

Data provided to date do not allow determination of whether newly reported cases are old SARS cases only now coming to light, or newly detected cases. Better interpretation of reports, and a more complete assessment of the underlying situation, require information on date of onset and location of cases. WHO has proposed to Beijing city government officials a meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, of WHO technical staff with Beijing disease experts in order to review reporting procedures.",

Schools have been asked to inform parents, teachers, and visitors about the symptoms of SARS. Persons with symptoms have been asked not to visit schools. School authorities have been asked to conduct close monitoring and to send home any students, teachers, other staff, and visitors showing symptoms suggestive of SARS.",

          "As a result of ongoing assessments as to the nature of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing and Shanxi Province, China, and in Toronto, Canada, WHO is now recommending, as a measure of precaution, that persons planning to travel to these destinations consider postponing all but essential travel. This temporary advice, which is an extension of travel advice previously issued for Guangdong Province and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China will be reassessed in three weeks time.",
          "Following global alerts about cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), issued by WHO on 12 and 15 March, national authorities have heightened surveillance for suspect and probable cases. In many countries, prompt detection and isolation of initial cases have prevented further transmission altogether or held additional cases to a very small number.",
          "On 27 March, WHO recommended additional measures aimed at preventing the travel-related spread of SARS. These recommended measures, which include screening of air passengers departing from certain areas, continue to apply.",
          "On 2 April, WHO recommended that persons travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Guangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. This temporary recommendation has been reassessed daily and remains in effect.",
          "Subsequent information from the Chinese government about the magnitude of the SARS outbreaks in Beijing and Shanxi Province has been carefully reviewed by WHO. This assessment has considered the magnitude of the outbreak, including both the number of prevalent cases and the daily number of new cases, the extent of local chains of transmission, and evidence that travellers are becoming infected while in one area and then subsequently exporting the disease elsewhere. On the basis of this assessment, WHO is extending its 2 April travel advice to include Beijing and Shanxi Province.",
          "Using the same criteria, WHO has assessed the SARS situation in Toronto, Canada. The outbreak in this area has continued to grow in magnitude and has affected groups outside the initial risk groups of hospital workers, their families and other close person-to-person contacts, although all the cases reported have identified links to known SARS cases. In addition, a small number of persons with SARS, now in other countries in the world, appear to have acquired the infection while in Toronto. On the basis of this information, WHO is also including Toronto in the extension of its SARS-related travel advice.",
          "This advice will be re-examined in three weeks time, which is twice the maximum incubation period of SARS.",
          "The WHO travel advice is issued in order to protect public health and reduce opportunities for further international spread. SARS is a new disease, first recognized in late February, that has spread along the routes of international air travel. As of 22 April, a cumulative total of 3947 cases had been reported from 25 countries on five continents. Precautionary measures aim to reduce the impact of SARS and contain the disease while it is still in a relatively early stage.",
          "The SARS situation is assessed on a daily basis to determine whether other areas need to be included in the travel advice and if additional precautionary measures are required.",

          "As probable SARS cases continue to be reported from a growing number of countries, WHO is taking stock of what is known about the new disease, particularly concerning its mode of spread, and what remains a puzzle.",
          "The agent that causes SARS has now been conclusively identified. The SARS virus is a new coronavirus unlike any other known human or animal virus in the Coronavirus family. Because the virus is new, much about its behaviour is poorly understood. Key questions, which are undergoing intense study, include stages in the course of infection when virus shedding may be highest, and the various concentrations of virus in different body fluids. Scientists are also working to determine the amount of time the virus can survive in the environment on both dry surfaces and in suspension, including in faecal matter.",
          "The vast majority of countries reporting probable SARS cases are dealing with a small number of imported cases. Experience has shown that when these cases are promptly detected, isolated, and managed according to strict procedures of infection control, further spread to hospital staff and family members either does not occur at all or results in a very small number of secondary infections. These experiences confirm abundant early evidence that the SARS virus spreads, in the vast majority of cases, through exposure to respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact.",
          "However, information now emerging from outbreaks in Hong Kong and Canada is raising some important new questions about SARS. In Hong Kong, a large and sudden cluster of almost simultaneous cases (321) seen in residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate has raised the possibility of transmission from an environmental source.",
          "In addition, reports from Hong Kong health authorities indicate that patients in this cluster depart in some ways from the previously established clinical picture. The disease appears to be more severe both in Amoy residents and in related cases among hospital staff. Around 20% of Amoy-related cases require intensive care, compared with 10% seen in non-Amoy cases. Some deaths are now occurring in younger, previously healthy persons as well as in the elderly and persons with underlying disease. Around 66% of Amoy Gardens patients present with diarrhoea as a symptom, compared with 2% to 7% of cases in other outbreaks.",
          "Speculation centres on whether these cases represent infection with high virus loads, as might occur following exposure to a concentrated environmental source, or whether the virus may have mutated into a more virulent form. Viruses in the Coronavirus family are known to mutate frequently.",
          "In Canada, concern has centred around a cluster of 31 suspect and probable cases in members of a charismatic religious group, the health care workers who have treated them, and close family and social contacts. The outbreak is particularly disturbing because of its potential to move into the wider community. Large meetings of the religious group at two events, on 28 and 29 March, may have led to multiple additional exposures, especially among the members of this close-knit religious group.",
          "Intense contact tracing, home quarantine, and close follow-up by health officials may work to prevent further spread of cases in the general community. The index case in this cluster has been traced to contact, in a hospital emergency room, with a subsequently fatal SARS case. The outbreak is regarded as a test case of whether rigorous contact tracing and other stringent public health measures can contain further spread even when very large numbers of persons may have been exposed.",
          "This index case has also been linked to three of four SARS cases concentrated in the same block of a 247-unit condominium in Toronto. As the fourth case could not be linked to direct contact with a SARS patient, some speculation arose concerning possible environmental contamination within the building as the source of the fourth infection. However, all four cases occurred in early April, with 4 April being the date of onset of the fourth case. The incubation period has now passed with no further cases detected. There appears to be little risk that the case arose from an environmental source.",
          "Viet Nam A week has passed since Viet Nam officials reported a new probable case of SARS. No new deaths have occurred during this period. The situation in Hanoi seems to have stabilized. Following the introduction of infection control measures in the French Hospital, the transmission of SARS appears to have been contained. Ten patients are now listed as recovering from SARS, none of whom is listed as in critical condition.",
          "The Vietnamese government is considering closing its land border with China in an attempt to prevent the importation of SARS cases. In a proposal submitted to the Prime Minister by the Ministry of Health, the 1,130 kilometre border with China would be sealed indefinitely to overland visitors.",
          "WHO officials in Viet Nam said earlier this week that while Viet Nam appears to have controlled the SARS outbreak within its borders, it still faces the threat of massive importation of the disease from China.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3547 cases with 182 deaths have been reported from 25 countries. Compared with yesterday, 12 new deaths, all in Hong Kong SAR, have been reported."

          "18 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported",
          "Hong Kong: investigation of Amoy Gardens cluster The Hong Kong Secretary for Environment, Transport and Works, in collaboration with eight other government agencies, has released the results of an extensive investigation of an unusual cluster of SARS cases concentrated in the Amoy Gardens housing estate.",
          "The investigation, which drew on epidemiological, environmental, and laboratory studies, has identified sewage contaminated with the SARS virus as the probable point source of exposure. Epidemiological investigation has focused on the role of a 33-year-old man who developed symptoms of SARS on 14 March and visited a relative in Block E, Amoy Gardens on 14 and 19 March. His symptoms at that time included diarrhoea.",
          "Based on the epidemiology of the outbreak, officials believe that this patient, who is linked to the infection of two relatives and two nurses, was the source of the outbreak. Subsequent rapid spread to other residents (321 cases of as 15 April) is thought to have involved defective U-traps in bathrooms, an amplifying effect of bathroom exhaust fans, a cracked sewer vent pipe serving Block E, and an aerodynamic effect in a lightwell to which bathroom windows opened.",
          "Laboratory investigations confirmed the presence of the SARS virus in a swab from the toilet bowl in the bathroom of a SARS patient, but not in numerous other environmental samples.",
          "“This is a plausible hypothesis,” says David Heymann, Executive Director of communicable diseases at WHO. “This is the kind of study that is needed to find what it is in the environment that is transmitting this disease.”",
          "Further work will be needed to reach firm conclusions about the source of the outbreak and the unusual way in which infection has spread.",
          "The study found no epidemiological or laboratory evidence that the SARS virus was transmitted by air, water, or infected dust aerosols. “It is reassuring that speculations about a possible airborne transmission have not been borne out by the evidence available to date,” says Heymann.",
          "The transmission of SARS within the Amoy Gardens estate is the first known instance involving a possible environmental spread of the virus. Thorough multi-disciplinary investigation of this unusual outbreak, as is now under way, is fully warranted. Once the outbreak is fully understood, the next important step will be to develop measures that can prevent other instances of environmental spread occurring under similar circumstances.",
          "China advises officials on SARS China’s top leaders cautioned officials this morning not to cover up the spread of SARS. Yesterday, during an urgent meeting of China’s highest ruling body presided over by President Hu Jintao, Beijing explicitly warned against the covering up of SARS cases and demanded the “accurate, timely and honest reporting of the SARS situation,” according to Xinhua, the country’s official news agency. China’s leaders called SARS a serious threat to the nation’s reform, development and stability, adding that party and government leaders would be held accountable for the situations in their respective jurisdictions.",
          "Earlier this week, the WHO Beijing team estimated that Beijing may have as many as 200 cases of SARS, rather than the 37 officially reported. The team recommended that Beijing improve its reporting system, possibly using as a model procedures followed in Guangdong Province, where the daily SARS reports are considered reliable and transparent. WHO experts also recommended that Beijing revise its definition of what constitutes a “suspect” SARS case.",
          "At present, many patients reported by Beijing as “suspect” would be classified as “probable” according to the case definition set out by WHO and used in official notifications of cases to WHO. As WHO reports only probable cases in its daily cumulative totals, such a change on the part of Beijing would result in a large increase in the number of cases notified to WHO.",
          "First SARS case reported in India India reported its first case of SARS yesterday. The National Institute of Virology in the western coastal state of Goa confirmed the presence of the new coronavirus which causes SARS, in samples from the patient. He is said to have recovered, and is still being kept in isolation after visiting Singapore, Hong Kong, and briefly stopping over in Mumbai.",
          "There have been fears that if the SARS virus reached India, it could spread rapidly in the subcontinent’s crowded cities and health facilities. WHO officials believe it is good news that the one case has been detected and reported, as this indicates that the surveillance system is on high alert and working well. As has been demonstrated in many countries, prompt detection of new cases, proper management, and efficient contact tracing can prevent isolated cases from infecting others.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3461 cases with 170 deaths have been reported from 25 countries on five continents. This represents an increase of 72 new cases and 5 deaths since the last WHO update. The deaths occurred in Hong Kong SAR (4) and Singapore (1)."

          "China Chinese authorities have today reported 12 new cases of SARS. Nine new cases were reported from Guangdong Province, and one each in Inner Mongolia and Sichuan Province. Ningxia, a poor province in the remote western part of the country, announced its first case today.",
          "Beijing reported no new cases and no new deaths.",
          "Today’s figures do not include cases in Beijing’s military hospitals. The military hospitals, which are not obliged by Chinese law to report cases to health authorities, have been the focus of considerable rumours over the past several days. A WHO team began visits to Beijing’s military hospitals yesterday.",
          "The recent decision of military hospitals in Guangdong Province to report SARS cases to the authorities may set an important precedent. WHO staff in China have been further encouraged by the presence of national surveillance and reporting teams in provinces that are now reporting cases. The presence of national SARS teams actively searching for cases is a welcome sign that the severity of the SARS threat is being taken seriously by the government.",
          "An additional WHO team will be travelling to Shanghai next week.",
          "Hong Kong: investigation of the Amoy Gardens cluster The Hong Kong Department of Health, together with the Department of Environment, Transport and Works, has today released the results of an extensive investigation into the possible cause of a large cluster of SARS cases among residents in the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The report draws on findings from numerous studies designed to determine whether an environmental source of the SARS virus might explain the large and unusual cluster of SARS cases.",
          "As of 15 April, health authorities had reported a total of 321 individuals affected by SARS who are residents in Amoy Gardens. A large proportion of cases are concentrated in vertically linked flats in a single building, Block E.",
          "Attention has focused on possible transmission via the sewage system. Among several unusual features, the Amoy cluster includes a high proportion of cases presenting with diarrhoea, estimated at about 60%. In most other clusters of cases, diarrhoea has typically been seen in only 2% to 7% of cases.",
          "WHO epidemiologists are now studying the report, which was submitted to WHO earlier today by Hong Kong’s Department of Health.",
          "Status of diagnostic tests Scientists in the WHO network of collaborating laboratories met in Geneva yesterday to map out research priorities for the coming month. The network also announced conclusive proof, from animal trials, that a new coronavirus, discovered by the group last month, is the agent that causes SARS.",
          "With the cause of SARS now proven, network scientists are giving top priority to the development of better diagnostic tests. The first step is the development of a data bank of specimens from a range of SARS patients in different countries. The scientists are also building a bank of specimens taken from individual patients at different stages of disease, including recovery.",
          "Such a time-series of specimens will be vital in developing a test that is capable of detecting virus at the first stage when people become capable of infecting others. It will also help determine the stage in the course of the illness when recovered patients can safely return to their jobs and families with no risk of infecting others.",
          "Other plans for the coming weeks include the development of a genetic library of specimens from SARS patients from different parts of the world. It is not yet known whether genetic differences in the coronavirus, which has now been fully sequenced by several network laboratories, will have significance for work on drug and vaccine research and development.",
          "Existing PCR diagnostic tests are insufficiently powerful to rule out, with confidence, the presence of the virus in suspect or probable SARS cases early in the course of the disease.",
          "WHO has been concerned that use of the current PCR test kit, which is being made available by a German biotechnology company initially at no cost, may produce test results that give a false sense of security, allowing persons carrying the virus to slip past undetected.",
          "Without a more reliable diagnostic tool, hospital staff confronted with a suspect SARS case have no option other than to isolate patients and manage them according to strict infection control practices as precautionary measures. Such measures are stressful for patients and place a considerable strain on health services.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3389 cases with 165 deaths have been reported from twenty five countries. Countries reporting their first probable cases on today’s list include Australia (3) and Mongolia (3).",
          "A large number of suspect SARS cases turn out, on further investigation, to have other, common causes."

          "Unprecedented collaboration identifies new pathogen in record time",
          "16 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported",
          "GENEVA -- Today, the World Health Organization announced that a new pathogen, a member of the coronavirus family never before seen in humans, is the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The speed at which this virus was identified is the result of the close international collaboration of 13 laboratories from 10 countries. While many lines of evidence have found strong associations between this virus and the disease over the last weeks, final confirmation came today.",
          "“The pace of SARS research has been astounding,” said Dr. David Heymann, Executive Director, WHO Communicable Diseases programmes. “Because of an extraordinary collaboration among laboratories from countries around the world, we now know with certainty what causes SARS.”",
          "The successful identification of the coronavirus means that scientists can now confidently turn to other SARS challenges. For example, various laboratories continue to work to unravel the genetic information of the SARS virus and compare the sequences obtained from viruses in different parts of the world. Experts are gathering at WHO this week to map future work on SARS.",
          "“Today, the collaboration continues as top laboratory researchers have come to WHO to design the next steps, a strategy for transforming these basic research discoveries into diagnostic tools which will help us to successfully control this disease,” said Heymann. “Now we can move away from methods like isolation and quarantines and move aggressively towards modern intervention strategies including specific treatments and eventually vaccination. With the establishment of the causative agent, we are a crucial step closer.”",
          "This collaboration has brought together leading scientific expertise, and was established after WHO issued a global alert on SARS on 12 March 2003. The priority has been to find the cause and to develop diagnostic tests. Two laboratories in China recently joined this network of laboratories from Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.",
          "“Today, the first part of the mission of our network has been fulfilled, as researchers have both detected a hitherto unknown virus and established it as the cause of SARS. The new coronavirus has been named by WHO and member laboratories as “SARS virus, ” said Dr Albert Osterhaus, the Director of Virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. Erasmus completed the work to definitely prove that the new coronavirus causes SARS.",
          "Over the past three weeks, due to the urgency surrounding the worldwide threat to health of SARS and early indications this was a new member of the coronavirus family, research has proceeded under the assumption that SARS was caused by a new coronavirus.",
          "The 13 laboratories have been working on meeting Koch’s postulates, necessary to prove disease causation. These postulates stipulate that to be the causal agent, a pathogen must meet four conditions: it must be found in all cases of the disease, it must be isolated from the host and grown in pure culture, it must reproduce the original disease when introduced into a susceptible host, and it must be found in the experimental host so infected.",
          "Credit for the coronavirus findings, which definitively pinpoints the cause of SARS, is attributed to the 13 laboratories, working in conjunction with WHO.",
          "“The people in this network have put aside profit and prestige to work together to find the cause of this new disease and to find way new ways of fighting it,” said Dr Klaus Stöhr, WHO virologist and the coordinator of the collaborative research network. “In this globalized world, such collaboration is the only way forward in tackling emerging diseases.”",
          "WHO and the network of laboratories dedicate their detection and characterization of the SARS virus to Dr Carlo Urbani, the WHO scientist who first alerted the world to the existence of SARS in Hanoi, Vietnam, and who died from the disease in Bangkok on 29 March 2003.",

          "15 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported",
          "SARS diagnostic test kit made available to members of WHO network Scientists participating in the WHO collaborative network of laboratories have developed several diagnostic tests for SARS. These include a so-called “PCR” test, which allows detection of the distinctive genetic information of a virus.",
          "Primers, which are the key pieces for a PCR test, were made publicly available by network laboratories on the open WHO web site ( http://www.who.int/csr/sars/primers/en/ ) on 4 April. The primers have since been used by numerous countries around the world.",
          "WHO scientists are now increasingly optimistic that the current PCR diagnostic test for SARS can rapidly be fine-tuned to a stage ready for roll out. Fine-tuning is needed because of important limitations in the ability of the current test to rule out the presence of coronavirus in SARS cases.",
          "Yesterday, the Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany informed WHO that primers developed there are being made available, in the form of a ready-to-use kit, by a Hamburg-based biotechnology firm. Apart from ease of use, the test kit has the advantage of built-in quality control. WHO was further informed by the Hamburg Institute that the test will be offered at no cost to laboratories participating in the WHO collaborative network.",
          "The network, which includes leading laboratories from ten countries, was set up last month to expedite identification of the SARS causative agent and, in parallel, to rapidly develop a diagnostic test.",
          "Initial testing of the kit by network members is expected to quickly yield the data needed to assess the test’s performance, in comparison with primers developed by other WHO network laboratories. The ability to detect persons infected with the SARS virus at an early stage is a key measure of performance. WHO has been concerned that weaknesses in earlier experimental tests for SARS would allow too many virus carriers to slip past undetected.",
          "Existing PCR tests are very specific but may not detect all patients who are excreting coronavirus. Early and reliable detection of the SARS virus in samples will be of great assistance in helping health care staff determine which persons presenting with fever and other suspicion-arousing symptoms should be immediately isolated and managed according to strict procedures of infection control. Such procedures will, in turn, greatly reduce the likelihood that infection will spread to others.",
          "Various WHO network laboratories are endeavouring to improve their PCR testing protocols and primers to increase their reliability.",
          "The Bernhard-Nocht Institute is a member of the WHO network of collaborating laboratories. The rapid development of the test kit is one example of how scientific knowledge, being generated by dedicated scientists, can be rapidly translated into a practical control tool.",
          "Explanation of so-called SARS “super-spreaders” “Super-spreader” is a term that has been used to describe certain individuals with atypical pneumonia, now recognized as cases of SARS, who have been implicated in spreading the disease to numerous other individuals.",
          "The phenomenon of a “super-spreader”, which is not a recognized medical condition, dates back to the early days of the outbreak. At that time, when SARS was just becoming known as a severe new disease, many patients were thought to be suffering from atypical pneumonia having another cause, and were therefore not treated as special cases requiring special precautions of isolation and infection control.",
          "As a result, stringent infection control measures were not in place. In the absence of protective measures, many health care workers, relatives, and hospital visitors were exposed to the SARS virus and subsequently developed SARS.",
          "Since infection control measures have been put in place, the number of new cases of SARS arising from a single SARS source case has been significantly reduced.",
          "When investigating current chains of continuing transmission, it is important to look for points in the history of case detection and patient management when procedures for infection control may have broken down.",
          "China The WHO team of experts in Beijing was today granted permission to visit military hospitals. The situation of SARS cases in certain military hospitals has been the source of numerous rumours concerning the magnitude of the SARS outbreak. The WHO team has so far visited one such hospital but hopes to visit others soon.",
          "The decision by Beijing authorities is a welcome indication of China’s willingness to come to terms with the SARS outbreak on the mainland. Yesterday, China’s president Hu Jintao said on state television that he was “very worried” by SARS.",
          "The WHO Beijing team is expected to finish its preliminary investigation on the status of SARS in China tomorrow. Additional WHO teams will travel soon to other parts of China.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3235 cases of SARS, with 154 deaths, have been reported from 22 countries. This represents an increase of 66 new cases and ten deaths compared with the previous day. Nine of the ten deaths occurred in Hong Kong SAR. One death was reported in Singapore."

          "Situation in China China has today reported 109 new probable cases of SARS and 6 deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 1418 cases and 64 deaths. The largest number of cases occurred in Shanxi Province, where 47 new cases were reported. In addition, two provinces reported SARS cases for the first time – 10 in Inner Mongolia and 3 in Fujian.",
          "The reports indicate that the nationwide surveillance system, recently introduced by Chinese authorities, is working to detect and report cases. However, questions remain about the capacity of some provinces to cope with the challenge of SARS.",
          "Last week, the interim report of the WHO investigative team concluded that the health system in Guangdong Province, where the first recognized cases of SARS occurred in mid-November, had responded well to the outbreak. However, the report noted many concerns about the ability of other provinces, that lack Guangdong’s strong health system, to respond promptly and effectively to SARS.",
          "While Beijing authorities appear to have contained transmission in some hospitals, they have not yet granted WHO experts permission to visit military hospitals, which have been the focus of numerous rumours. WHO staff in Beijing have expressed particular concern about the official response to rumours and the apparent absence of rigorous contact tracing.",
          "WHO is currently exploring ways to strengthen its support to China. Shanghai has requested a visit from a WHO team. Teams to meet this request and follow up on other needs in China are now being assembled by WHO and will soon travel to China.",
          "Status of scientific knowledge Canadian scientists working around the clock have completed full sequencing of the genome of the SARS virus. This is a major step forward that will boost the development of better diagnostic tests and underpin work on a vaccine.",
          "The rapid sequencing of the SARS virus genome was facilitated by collaboration with numerous other scientists, also working non-stop, at laboratories in a WHO network set up in mid-March.",
          "A PCR test, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been shown to be ten times more sensitive than previous PCR tests for SARS. WHO experts hope that the test will be ready for roll out by the end of this week.",
          "Status of clinical knowledge Data available to WHO indicate that 96% of persons developing SARS recover spontaneously. The focus now is on the roughly 4% who are dying. WHO will hold a clinical teleconference on Wednesday to gather international experiences in the management of SARS patients and pool data on the results of various therapeutic regimens.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3169 cases of SARS, with 144 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 21 countries. This represents an increase of 213 cases and 25 deaths since the last update on Saturday.",
          "Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sweden report their first probable cases (1 in each country) today. Japan, which had previously reported four probable cases, was removed from the list as these cases were determined to have other causes.",
          "China, with 1418 cases and 64 deaths, remains the most seriously affected area. Hong Kong SAR, with 1190 cases and 47 deaths, is the second most seriously affected area. Three of the deaths in Hong Kong over the weekend occurred in persons under the age of 50, marking a departure from a previously pattern in which SARS caused deaths primarily in the elderly or in persons with pre-existing disease."

          "Affected areas On Friday, WHO added Beijing, China to its list of SARS-affected areas. Areas are added to the list following indication that chains of local transmission are occurring. The greatest concern arises when cases occur outside the established risk groups of health care workers and persons in close face-to-face contact with patients, such as household contacts and hospital visitors.",
          "In addition to Beijing, other affected areas in China include Guangdong Province, Hong Kong SAR, Shanxi Province, and Taiwan Province. Toronto, Singapore, and Hanoi are also listed as affected.",
          "In most other countries reporting SARS cases, the disease remains confined to a few imported cases, with no or very little spread of infection to others.",
          "China A WHO team of five experts has been invited by the Beijing Health Bureau to visit health facilities and review the SARS situation in Beijing. The invitation followed WHO concern about management of the SARS situation by health authorities, particularly in relation to case reporting and contact tracing.",
          "The meetings, which began on Friday, will continue throughout next week. Specific objectives are to support the strengthening of surveillance and reporting, clinical management, infection control, and laboratory evaluation of cases.",

          "Hong Kong Hong Kong has today reported a cumulative total of 1108 cases with 35 deaths. This represents an increase of 49 new cases admitted to hospital with symptoms of SARS, and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday. Of the cases newly admitted to hospital, 3 are in health care workers, and 11 are from the Amoy Gardens housing estate.",
          "The majority of Hong Kong’s cases are clustered in hospitals and in the densely populated Amoy Gardens housing estate. Health authorities are continuing to investigate a possible environmental factor that may explain the concentration of cases in a single wing of a single building, Block E. Health officials are also investigating whether an outbreak in a second housing estate may be related to the Amoy Gardens outbreak.",
          "The Department of Health has today posted on its web site a detailed list of buildings where residents have developed SARS.",
          "Singapore Singapore has today reported a cumulative total of 147 SARS cases of which 60 remain hospitalized, with 15 in intensive care. Recent concern has centered on clusters of SARS cases seen in health workers, inpatients, and visitors at Singapore General Hospital and Ton Tock Seng Hospital.",
          "WHO has collaborated with health authorities in investigations and contact tracing that have linked most cases in the hospital outbreaks to a single “super-spreader.” This patient was treated at Ton Tock Seng Hospital from 5 to 20 March, where he is thought to have become infected. He was subsequently admitted to Singapore General Hospital on 24 March. The patient showed a very atypical clinical course before being isolated on 2 April. This late isolation is thought to explain, in part, the large number of exposed and infected individuals linked to the single patient.",
          "Ongoing investigations have linked the outbreaks at Singapore General Hospital, Ton Tock Seng Hospital, and other hospitals in Singapore to clear trains of transmission",
          "Viet Nam In Viet Nam, one new case was reported and one case was removed from the list. The cumulative number of reported cases (62) remains the same as yesterday. High vigilance, excellent contact tracing, and good infection control are in place and are expected to keep the number of new cases, associated with the initial outbreak, small.",
          "Canada Health Canada is today reporting 101 probable SARS cases. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. Ontario is reporting 98 probable cases. Three probable cases are reported in British Columbia.",

He gives a chronology of key events and explains some of the actions taken to curb further spread. He also explains why SARS poses a particularly serious threat to health, and looks at the many puzzles this unusual disease presents.

          "Status of the global SARS outbreak and lessons for the immediate future David L. Heymann Executive Director, Communicable Diseases, WHO",
          "Current status of the SARS outbreak At this moment, public health authorities, physicians and scientists around the world are struggling to cope with a severe and rapidly spreading new disease in humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. This appears to be the first severe and easily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Though much about the disease remains poorly understood, including the exact identity of the causative virus, we do know that it has features that allow it to spread rapidly along international air travel routes.",
          "As of 10 April, 2781 SARS cases, with 111 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 17 countries on three continents. Some outbreaks have reassuring features. A high awareness of SARS symptoms among travellers and the medical and nursing professions has often resulted in good management of imported cases – prompt isolation of patients and management according to strict procedures of infection control. As a result, many countries having only a single or a few imported cases have experienced no further spread to hospital staff, families of patients and hospital visitors, or the community at large.",
          "The list of countries and continents reporting suspect or probable SARS cases will no doubt continue to grow due to heightened global vigilance, knowledge about symptoms and exposures, and awareness of the need for immediate isolation of cases and strict infection control. So long as these measures are followed, the detection of first cases in countries need not be interpreted as evidence that SARS is continuing to spread. Tabular information on countries reporting SARS and the cumulative total of cases and deaths is published each day on the WHO SARS web site.",
          "“Hot zones” of concern Despite some positive signs that imported cases are not spreading further, outbreaks in China, Canada, Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore have taken root in hospitals and beyond, and give rise to considerable concern. One of the most alarming features of SARS in these areas is its rapid spread in hospitals, where it has affected a large number of previously healthy health care workers. Many require intensive care, placing a huge strain on hospital facilities and staff. In countries, such as Canada, where cases occurred before WHO issued its global alert, SARS is continuing to spread despite the introduction of strict patient isolation and excellent infection control.",
          "China On 9 April, a WHO investigative team, which had conducted interviews and studies in Guangdong Province since 3 April, presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak to Chinese authorities. The team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to the outbreak, but that health systems in all other provinces had less capacity to cope with the severity of the challenge posed by SARS. Several recommendations for improvements were made in the report.",
          "The team also found evidence of “super-spreaders” in Guangdong, including one who is thought to have infected as many as 100 other persons. The outbreak is now thought to date back to at least 16 November, when an initial case was reported in Foshan City.",
          "Particular concern centres on the situation in Beijing. Yesterday, WHO deepened discussions with Beijing health authorities, particularly concerning the efficiency of systems for case reporting and contact tracing.",
          "Canada To date, Canada has reported 114 probable cases and 10 deaths. All cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had close contact with SARS cases in households or health care facilities. Health Canada has taken several steps to protect the health of Canadians and the travelling public, and to reduce opportunities of transmitting the virus to others. Several Canadian schools and hospitals are closed.",
          "Hong Kong Hong Kong, with 998 cases and 30 deaths, is presently the hardest hit area. Health care workers continue to become infected in a growing number of hospitals. WHO learned this week that the chief executive of the Prince of Wales Hospital – the initial epicentre of the Hong Kong outbreak – is hospitalized with atypical pneumonia. Hospitals are becoming overwhelmed. A decision to suspend all primary, secondary, special schools and kindergartens until 6 April has been extended up to 21 April.",
          "Most disturbing is a large cluster of 268 SARS cases linked to the Amoy Gardens estate of high-rise apartment buildings. The vast majority of Amoy Gardens cases have been traced to vertically linked apartments in a single building, Block E. This pattern of transmission indicates that the disease has moved out of the health care setting and is now occurring within the community as secondary cases. Epidemiologists investigating the Amoy Gardens outbreak are considering the hypothesis that some form of environmental contamination, perhaps linked to a sewage or ventilation system, is the source of the large cluster of cases. Although transmission through the faecal-oral route is being considered as one possibility, no evidence of airborne transmission has been demonstrated to date. Virus has not been detected in animals, including cockroaches and rodents.",
          "Yesterday, health authorities in Hong Kong announced that all household contacts of confirmed SARS patients will be required to confine themselves at home for up to 10 days with immediate effect. Household contacts can choose between confinement in their homes and confinement in holiday camps. No visitors are allowed during the confinement period, and permission to leave homes or camps will be granted only on exceptional grounds. During the confinement period, the Hong Kong Department of Health will conduct medical checks to monitor health, and the police force will conduct compliance checks.",
          "Viet Nam In Viet Nam, an epidemiologist from the Hanoi WHO office recognized the first case of SARS on 28 February at a French hospital in Hanoi. The number of cases increased rapidly but then stabilized on 24 March at 58 cases and remained stable for 8 consecutive days. As the maximum incubation period for SARS is thought to be 10 days, the stable number of cases over this period raised hope that Viet Nam’s outbreak had been brought under control. However, on 3 April a probable SARS case was detected in a provincial hospital. Though the case could be linked back to the French hospital, the absence of isolation and rigorous infection control at the provincial hospital suggests that many hospital staff, patients, and visitors may have been exposed, thus possibly seeding further waves of cases. An additional three probable cases, both known to have had close contacts with cases, have been reported since 3 April.",
          "Singapore In Singapore, another of the earliest and hardest hit areas, 126 persons, including several children under the age of 18 years, have been diagnosed with SARS. Most disturbing are new and large clusters of suspected SARS cases among health workers, inpatients, and visitors in two interlinked wards at Singapore General Hospital and in a second hospital, Tan Tok Seng Hospital.",
          "Intense contact tracing and investigation of these clusters increasingly points to contact with a single Chinese man in his 60s who was treated at Singapore General Hospital from 5 to 20 March for chronic kidney disease and diabetes at Singapore General Hospital. WHO epidemiologists, in collaboration with national authorities, are finding increasing evidence that the Chinese patient might have been a so-called “super-spreader.”",
          "In SARS outbreaks, a “super-spreader” is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons, infected a large number of persons. It remains unknown whether such “super-spreaders” are persons secreting an exceptionally high amount of infectious material or whether some other factor, perhaps in the environment, is working to amplify transmission at some key phase of virus shedding.",
          "New coronavirus discovered Through new mechanisms set up by WHO, progress on the research front has been unprecedented, particularly in the rapid discovery of a new coronavirus and the rapid development of diagnostic tests. The best scientists from around the world are working on these problems around the clock, and in an unprecedented spirit of collaboration against a threat of, as yet, unknown dimensions. Nonetheless, we still do not have conclusive proof that the new virus is indeed the cause of SARS. The results of animal experiments, which are currently being conducted by a laboratory in a WHO network , will be available soon and may provide the last pieces of evidence needed for definitive proof that SARS is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus. Furthermore, the findings will provide additional evidence to understand the role of metapneumovirus as a possible “helper virus” in persons co-infected with the new coronavirus.",
          "Diagnostic tests The development of a diagnostic test has proved more problematic than hoped. Three tests are now available and are helping to improve understanding of how the virus causes disease in humans. However, all three tests have limitations as tools for bringing the SARS outbreak quickly under control.",
          "The ELISA detects antibodies reliably but only from about day 20 after the onset of clinical symptoms. It therefore cannot be used to detect cases at an early stage before they have a chance to spread the infection to others.",
          "The second test, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), detects antibodies reliably as of day 10 of infection, but is a comparatively slow test that requires the growth of virus in cell culture.",
          "The presently available PCR molecular test for detection of SARS virus genetic material is useful in the early stages of infection but produces many false-negatives. This means that many persons who actually carry the virus may not be detected – creating a dangerous sense of false security for a virus that is known to spread easily in close person-to-person contact.",
          "Present role of tests in diagnosis A positive test results indicates that a person is, or recently was, infected with the coronavirus. However, a negative test result does not guarantee that the person is not infected with the virus.",
          "At present, reporting to WHO of probable SARS cases is based on an assessment of clinical symptoms, history – including travel history – of possible exposure to an infected person, and distinctive chest X-rays. The nine countries in the WHO laboratory network, namely Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong SAR, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, are beginning to conduct routine laboratory testing of suspect and probable SARS cases. WHO has posted on its web site details about the test methodology that allows other countries to perform tests. However, more work is needed to produce a robust test that is capable rapidly and reliably detecting cases at an early stage of infection.",
          "SARS response: a roll out for other emergencies caused by infectious diseases Apart from the dimensions of the SARS outbreak apparent at this date, the sections below explain why this disease poses a particularly severe threat to international health, outline the chronology of events as SARS spread around the world, and discuss lessons, based on strengths and weaknesses of the global response, for the immediate future. These lessons are of great importance.",
          "The SARS response is the roll out of a global alert and response activity under the revision of the International Health Regulations, which provide the legal framework for the surveillance and reporting of infectious disease and for the use of measures to prevent their international spread. SARS is showing how the alert and response activity works in practice for a newly identified disease. It also indicates how the system now in operation could apply to other highly significant infectious disease events, including the next influenza pandemic, the next emerging infection, and the deliberate release of a biological agent in an act of warfare or terrorism. The scientific community is now contending with an outbreak caused by a new virus. This creates an extra step in the containment response: identification and characterization of the causative agent, which then allows development of a diagnostic test, treatment protocols, and a scientifically sound basis for recommending control measures. This is a step that would not be needed should a biological attack occur using a well-known pathogen such as anthrax or smallpox. The response to an influenza pandemic would likewise not be dealing with an entirely new and poorly understood virus.",
          "SARS: a particularly serious threat to international health Although the last decades of the previous century witnessed the emergence of several new diseases, SARS needs to be regarded as a particularly serious threat for several reasons. If the SARS virus maintains its present pathogenicity and transmissibility, SARS could become the first severe new disease of the 21st century with global epidemic potential. As such, its clinical and epidemiological features, though poorly understood, give cause for particular alarm. With the notable exception of AIDS, most new diseases that emerged during the last two decades of the previous century or established endemicity in new geographical areas have features that limit their capacity to pose a major threat to international public health. Many (avian influenza, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Haanta virus) failed to establish efficient human-to-human transmission. Others (Escherichia coli O157:H7, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) depend on food as a vehicle of transmission. Diseases such as West Nile Fever and Rift Valley Fever that have spread to new geographical areas require a vector as part of the transmission cycle and are associated with low mortality, often in high-risk groups, such as the elderly, the immunocompromised, or persons with co-morbidity. Still others (Neisseria meningitidis W135, and the Ebola, Marburg, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fevers) have strong geographical foci. Although outbreaks of Ebola haemorrhagic fever have been associated with case-fatality rates in the range of 53% (Uganda) to 88% (Democratic Republic of the Congo), person-to-person transmission requires close physical exposure to infected blood and other bodily fluids. Moreover, patients suffering from this disease during the period of high infectivity are visibly very ill and too unwell to travel.",
          "In contrast, SARS is emerging in ways that suggest great potential for rapid international spread under the favourable conditions created by a highly mobile, closely interconnected world. Anecdotal data indicate an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (average 2 to 7 days), allowing the infectious agent to be transported, unsuspected and undetected, in a symptomless air traveller from one city in the world to any other city having an international airport. Person-to-person transmission through close contact with respiratory secretions has been demonstrated. The initial symptoms are non-specific and common. The concentration of cases in previously healthy hospital staff and the proportion of patients requiring intensive care are particularly alarming. This “21st century” disease could have other consequences as well. Should SARS continue to spread, the global economic consequences – alreadyestimated at around US$ 30 billion – could be great in a closely interconnected and interdependent world.",
          "Chronology of events leading to an unprecedented emergency travel advisory Severe Acute Pulmonary Syndrome (SARS) was first identified in Viet Nam on 28 February, 2003, when Dr Carlo Urbani, an epidemiologist from the Hanoi WHO office examined a patient with a severe form of pneumonia for which no etiology could be found. On 10 March 2003, 22 hospital workers in Hanoi French Hospital were ill with a similar acute respiratory syndrome, and by 11 March similar outbreaks had been reported among hospital workers in Hong Kong.",
          "SARS occurred at a time of heightened surveillance for atypical respiratory disease. From 10 February the WHO office in Beijing, which reinforced its staff with two epidemiologists, had been working with the government of China to learn more about an outbreak of atypical respiratory disease that affected health workers, their families and contacts in Guandong Province, with 305 cases and 5 deaths reported from 16 November 2002 to 7 February 2003. Around 30% of cases were reported to occur in health care workers. Surveillance was heightened further when a 33-year-old man who had travelled with his family to Fujian Province in China died in Hong Kong on 17 February. The next day, Hong Kong authorities announced that avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, the cause of “bird flu”, had been isolated from both the man and his nine-year-old hospitalized son. Another member of the family, an eight-year-old daughter, died while in Fujian and was buried there.",
          "On 12 March, after an assessment of the situation in Asia with WHO teams in Hanoi, Hong Kong and Beijing, a global alert was issued about cases of severe atypical pneumonia with unknown etiology that appeared to place health workers at high risk.",
          "Two days later, on 14 March, WHO received a report from the government of Canada that health authorities had taken steps to alert hospital workers, ambulance services, and public health units across the provinces that there were four cases of atypical pneumonia within a single family in Toronto that had resulted in 2 deaths. At 02h00 Geneva time on the following day, 15 March, the government of Singapore notified WHO, by urgent telecommunication, of a similar illness in a 32-year-old physician who had treated hospital workers with a severe respiratory syndrome in Singapore, including one from the French Hanoi hospital who had self-evacuated to Singapore. This Singapore physician had travelled to the United States for a medical conference, and at the end of the conference boarded a return flight to Singapore in New York. Before departure he had indicated to a colleague in Singapore by telephone that he had symptoms similar to the patients he had treated in Singapore. The colleague notified health authorities. WHO identified the airline and flight, and the physician and his accompanying family members were removed from the flight at a stopover in Frankfurt, Germany, where he was immediately isolated and placed under hospital care, as were his two accompanying family members when they developed fever and respiratory symptoms several days later. As a result of this prompt action, Germany experienced no further spread linked to the three imported cases.",
          "Later in the morning of 15 March, with this background and chronology of events, a decision was made by WHO to increase the level of the global alert issued on 12 March. The decision was based on five different but related factors. First, the etiology, and therefore the potential for continued spread, of this new disease were not yet known. Second, the outbreaks appeared to pose a great risk to health workers who managed patients, and to the family members and other close contacts of patients. Third, many different antibiotics and antivirals had been tried empirically and did not seem to have an effect. Fourth, though the numbers were initially small, a significant percentage of patients (25 of 26 hospital staff in Hanoi, and 24 of 39 hospital staff in Hong Kong) had rapidly progressed to respiratory failure, requiring intensive care and causing some deaths in previously healthy persons. Finally, the disease had moved out of its initial focus in Asia and appeared to have spread to North America and Europe.",
          "At this time, the epidemiology of SARS was poorly understood. A virulent strain of influenza had not been ruled out as a possible cause, even though transmission patterns were not characteristic for influenza. There was also some hope that the new disease, like many other new diseases of the recent past, would fail to maintain efficient person-to-person transmission, or that it might attenuate with passage and eventually self-contain. Despite the lack of understanding about the disease, its cause, and future evolution, the need was great to introduce a series of emergency measures to contain SARS outbreaks in the affected areas and prevent further international spread, thus reducing opportunities for the new disease to establish endemicity. WHO thus decided, on 15 March, to issue a rare emergency travel advisory as a global alert to international travellers, health care professionals, and health authorities.",
          "The global alert called for increased attention to patients with atypical pneumonia who fit the following case definition:",
          "– High fever (>38 C) – One or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing AND One or more of the following: – Close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with SARS – Recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS.",
          "At the same time the global alert recommended no change in patterns of international travel, but that passengers notify their health authority if they should develop signs and symptoms as described above and have a history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS. Following this alert, awareness increased immediately, and many potential new outbreaks were prevented by the prompt isolation and strict management of suspected cases.",
          "By 27 March, however, it was evident that international spread of SARS had continued after the 15 March advisory at two of the earliest outbreak sites, namely Viet Nam and Hong Kong, and that persons on the same aeroplanes as persons with symptoms consistent with SARS, and sitting in close proximity to them, had developed signs and symptoms compatible with SARS. On this date it was decided to recommend new measures related to international travel, still with the intent of preventing the international spread of the infectious agent. These recommendations were that SARS-affected areas, where transmission was known to be occurring in chains of human-to-human transmission, institute measures to identify international passengers who had signs, symptoms and history compatible with SARS, and to recommend that such persons postpone international travel and seek medical advice. These recommendations were instituted in most of the affected areas shortly after 27 March",
          "However, concern continued to mount. An urgent investigation of the Amoy Gardens outbreak in Hong Kong began on 29 March, and the following day, health officials announced that 213 Amoy residents were probable cases of SARS. This followed an unusual cluster of cases, closely linked in time and place, among guests and visitors who had stayed on the same floor of a hotel located in the same district (Kowloon) as Amoy Gardens. By this same date, 9 business travellers and tourists had returned to Singapore, Beijing and Taiwan from Hong Kong, either sick or in the incubation period of SARS.",
          "Outbreaks in the hotel and housing estate indicated that SARS was showing an unusual pattern of transmission in Hong Kong, probably involving an environmental component, that would place persons at risk outside the confined health care settings associated with outbreaks in most other countries. The 9 cases of probable SARS that occurred in Singapore, Beijing, and Taiwan, and that were associated with travel in Hong Kong, indicated that the risk of international spread was continuing. Consultations were made with WHO teams and travel experts. On 2 April a recommendation for voluntary postponement of all but essential travel was issued for travellers considering travel to Hong Kong. At the same time, because the WHO team and government of China had confirmed that the 4-month long outbreak in Guangdong continued, and that cases fit the case definition being applied in Viet Nam and Hong Kong; and because transmission patterns in Guangdong were not yet available, these same recommendations were made for Guangdong as maximum security against spread of SARS outside of Guangdong in the absence of complete understanding of transmission patterns of the outbreak there.",
          "Cases of possible transmission in aeroplanes continue to be reported and investigated. As recently as 5 April, notification of a SARS patient travelling internationally by sea from Hong Kong to Vladivostak (Russian Federation) was received, opening a possible second route of international travel for the virus.",
          "WHO travel recommendations are kept under constant review and will be amended as more data about the evolution of SARS become available.",
          "Lessons: the value of innovation and international collaboration The knowledge obtained in the three-week period since 15 March has been remarkable. It demonstrates the value of international cooperation on emerging infections and the importance of early detection and rapid introduction of emergency measures to prevent further international spread and help ensure that imported cases are not allowed to cause disease in others.",
          "When WHO began to set up emergency plans on 15 March, identification of the SARS causative agent and the development of a diagnostic test were given paramount importance in the overall containment strategy. Detection of the disease in its early stage, confirmation of cases, understanding modes of transmission, development of protocols for targeted treatment, vaccine research and development, and implementation of disease-specific preventive measures would all depend upon swift progress and results in etiological and diagnostic research. Sound public health measures would also require understanding of the presence and concentration of the pathogen in different tissues and secretions, and patterns of excretion throughout the course of illness and convalescence. So long as the aetiological agent remained unknown, specialists in infectious disease control would be forced to resort to control tools dating back to the “Middle Ages” of microbiology: isolation and quarantine.",
          "On 17 March, a network of 11 leading laboratories around the world was set up as a mechanism for expediting identification of the SARS causative agent. Laboratories were selected on the basis of three criteria: outstanding scientific expertise, facilities at biosafety level III, and capacity to contribute to the battery of tests and experiments that would be needed to fulfill Koch's four postulates for the identification of an infectious agent as the cause of a specific disease. The network was set up on the model of the influenza network and provides another important lesson: models and systems set up for one health emergency can be rapidly adapted to serve others.",
          "Collaboration is virtual. Members of the network confer in daily teleconferences coordinated by WHO, and use a secure web site to post electron microscopic pictures of candidate viruses, sequences of genetic material for virus identification and characterization, descriptions of experiments, and results. The well-guarded secret techniques that give each laboratory its competitive edge have been immediately and openly shared with others. Laboratories also quickly exchange various samples from patients and postmortem tissues. These arrangements have allowed the analysis of samples from the same patient simultaneously in several laboratories specialized in different approaches, with the results shared in real time. This collaboration has resulted in the identification of the suspected causative agent, and the development of three diagnostic tests, with unprecedented speed.",
          "Virus isolation continues from patients with SARS, and at the same time virus has been isolated from tears and faeces. Publications on these various findings are being prepared by members of this collaborating group, but the need remains for a highly sensitive and specific PCR test to diagnose acute infections.",
          "A similar collaborative group on epidemiology, made up of investigators from all sites with local transmission of SARS, continues to confirm person-to-person transmission as the major route of transmission. Today, the group exchanged information about the Hong Kong investigations to identify a possible environmental source, which might prove useful in understanding the unusual new cluster of cases in Singapore. Key questions include the exact points during the course of incubation and infection when transmission occurs and whether asymptotic cases are also capable of spreading SARS. These questions must be answered to better evaluate the extent of spread of SARS, and the success of containment activities.",
          "A third clinical group, which unites 80 clinicians from 13 countries having SARS cases, has consistently provided anecdotal information about the lack of efficacy of treatment with specific antibiotics and antivirals, and has begun to develop systematic clinical trials of Ribaviran at two sites. Their discussions have shed light on features of the disease at presentation, treatment and progression of the disease, prognostic indicators, and discharge criteria. No therapy has been shown to demonstrate any particular effectiveness. The clinicians agreed that a subset of SARS patients, perhaps 10%, decline, usually around day 7, and need mechanical assistance to breathe. The care of these people is often complicated by the presence of other diseases. In this group, mortality is high. Age over 40 years also appears to be associated with a more severe form of disease. Countries have made travel recommendations for their citizens, using the guidance provided by WHO and other considerations such as feasibility of medical evacuation of their citizens and their insurance coverage should they become infected.",
          "On 28 March, at the end of the second week of the global response, China, an initially reluctant partner in the global alert and response at the start, became a full partner in the three working groups that were studying SARS, and concluded that the outbreaks of SARS elsewhere in Asia were related to the outbreak in Guangdong Province. The Chinese government has announced that SARS is being given top priority. A system of alert and response for all emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is being developed. Daily electronic reporting of new cases and deaths, by province, has begun. Equally important, health officials have begun daily televised press conferences, thus taking the important step of increasing the awareness of the population and hospital staff of the characteristic symptoms, the need to seek prompt medical attention, and the need to manage patients according to the principles of isolation and strict infection control.",
          "The next weeks and months will tell whether the global alert and response will contain the current SARS outbreaks, preventing SARS from becoming yet another endemic infectious disease in human populations, or whether SARS will remain confined to its origins in nature, to re-emerge at yet another time and place. It is clear that the responsibility for containing the emergence of any new infectious disease showing international spread lies on all countries. In a world where all national borders are porous when confronted by a microbial threat, it is in the interest of all populations for countries to share the information they may have as soon as it is available. In so doing, they will allow both near and distant countries – all neighbours in our globalized world – to benefit from the understanding they have gained."

          "China WHO is now planning to deepen discussions with health authorities in Beijing. This action follows concerns, connected with yesterday’s report from a WHO investigative team, about SARS cases in Beijing and systems of case reporting and contact tracing.",
          "China is today reporting 10 new SARS cases, with 2 new deaths, compared with yesterday.",
          "In a separate development, two laboratories in China have announced detection of a coronavirus in specimens taken from SARS patients. The new virus, which is unlike any known human or animal virus in the coronavirus family, was isolated by a WHO virtual network of 11 laboratories set up to expedite identification of the etiological agent and development of a diagnostic test. Detection of the coronavirus adds further evidence that the outbreak that began in Guangdong Province in mid-November 2002 was caused by the SARS virus.",
          "Hong Kong Health authorities in Hong Kong have today announced that all household contacts of confirmed SARS patients will be required to confine themselves at home for up to 10 days with immediate effect. The new measure is intended to facilitate early detection and treatment of SARS cases and to reduce to the absolute minimum the risk of further spread. With a cumulative total of 998 cases and 28 deaths, Hong Kong ranks just below China in the severity of the SARS outbreak.",
          "Household contacts can choose between confinement in their homes and confinement in holiday camps. No visitors are allowed during the confinement period, and permission to leave homes or camps will be granted only on exceptional grounds.",
          "During the confinement period, the Hong Kong Department of Health will conduct medical checks to monitor health, and the police force will conduct compliance checks.",
          "Officials in the Department of Health estimate that an initial 70 to 80 households, representing around 150 persons, will be subject to the new requirement.",
          "In a separate development, ongoing investigations of the source of infection in the unusual cluster of cases in Amoy Gardens have failed to detect the virus in animals. The findings refute previous hypotheses that the SARS might have been spread by cockroaches or rodents, possibly through some common system serving vertically connected flats. Most Amoy Gardens cases have been residents in a single wing of a single building, Block E.",
          "Singapore In Singapore, particular concern has centered on a cluster of suspect and probable SARS cases first noted on 5 April in 21 staff at the Singapore General Hospital. Intensive investigation by WHO staff and Ministry of Health officials have traced most cases to a single Chinese man in his 60s was had been treated for chronic kidney disease and diabetes at another hospital (Tan Tock Hospital) from 5 to 20 March. The hospital subsequently experienced a cluster of 19 probable and 33 suspected SARS cases in staff, visitors, and inpatients. Most have been linked to the Chinese patient.",
          "The second hospital-related cluster of SARS cases has now been linked to a decision to transfer all patients at Singapore General Hospital to two wards at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It is strongly suspected that the second cluster arose from contact with the Chinese patient. The investigation is providing some reassurance about the cause of these cases, which increasingly appear to fit the known pattern of exposure during close contact with patients.",
          "Viet Nam The number of cases in Viet Nam remains stable at 62. WHO staff and Ministry of Health officials anticipate that additional cases, associated with a case in a provincial hospital, may emerge in the next few days. However, vigilance is high, contact tracing is intense, and good infection control procedures are in place.",
          "Canada Health Canada has reported a cumulative total of 97 cases, with 10 deaths. The represents an increase of only 3 new cases for the second consecutive day. Ontario has reported 94 probable cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. British Columbia has reported 3 probable cases.",
          "Malaysia: history of third probable case WHO staff are collaborating with health authorities in Malaysia to conduct in-depth investigations, including history of recent travel and visits to health facilities, of the country’s three probable SARS cases in an effort to prevent a wider outbreak. Two new cases were reported today. Investigation of the country’s third case has revealed a history of travel to Beijing, China and Bangkok, Thailand. Onset of illness occurred in Bangkok. Upon return to Penang, Malaysia, the patient visited two private hospitals over a two-day period. Possible contacts are now being traced.",
          "Active contact tracing is a sound and essential public health measure for detecting persons who may have been exposed and alerting them to the steps to take should symptoms develop. Contact tracing can also establish whether all probable patients and suspect cases are linked together, through close face-to-face contact, and thus determine whether any instance of secondary transmission in the general community has occurred.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2781 cases and 111 deaths have been reported from 17 countries. Increases occurred in Brazil (1), Canada (3), China (10), Hong Kong SAR (28), Germany (1), Malaysia (2), Singapore (8), and the United States (5). Deaths were reported in China (2) and Hong Kong SAR (3)."

          "9 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported China The WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak in Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and Vice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in Guangdong on 3 April.",
          "The team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to the outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at every level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore concluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a hospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.",
          "However, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the countryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further concerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a particular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the adequacy of contact tracing.",
          "In addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of other provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in Guangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.",
          "In Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of SARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not appear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact tracing will allow the disease to spread.",
          "The team observed that many of China’s poorer provinces may not have adequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of SARS, and underscored that Guangdong’s capacity was exceptional among China’s provinces.",
          "In Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health care system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8 People’s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily during the second week of February. The team noted that the response of the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication and bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.",
          "Microbiological findings Large banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases, from case contacts as well as from “normal controls” exist at the institutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed information about the numbers and types of these specimens are available and were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on each of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the very detailed epidemiological and clinical informations held elsewhere in Guangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.",
          "These specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from which the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as paired acute and convalescent sera (i.e. the first sample obtained during the acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery) which will allow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that once a causative agent for SARS was identified these banks should be tested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however, less sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was already sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed elsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested assistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer sequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental tests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.",
          "Main recommendations The interim report made several major recommendations, including the following: - The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model that all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures that all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing this system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for evaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by technical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent standards are achieved and maintained. - The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards throughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care facilities. - Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak under control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by trained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but potential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport needs to be routinely carried out Contacts of cases should be provided with detailed preventive advice verbally and in writing. - Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is required, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens and reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a national SARS laboratory network within China: · National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing · Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing · Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou · Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou Laboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be included. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided to ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance activities as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease. Chinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within China to speed up the exchange of results, specimens and reagents.",
          "- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the world and their experience should be shared with the international community through publications, meetings and in drafting guidelines for the management of SARS patients.",
          "Priority actions Priority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include: - early recognition and treatment of cases - stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics - prompt reporting of suspected cases - meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public awareness campaigns and education.",
          "Hong Kong: heavy burden on the health system With today’s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong continues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on health services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of infection control may be needed.",
          "The isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at midnight, April 9. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that residents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats have been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.",
          "Singapore: role of “super-spreaders” Singapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals following an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include mandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and isolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital outbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses and doctors. Only seven have been diagnosed as “probable” SARS cases. The distribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker considered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth “super-spreader” identified in Singapore.",
          "A “super-spreader” is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons, infected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS remain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such “super-spreaders” may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks around the world.",
          "Until recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links to their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links for the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show that transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic, and usually very ill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers continue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation of the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community spread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients. However, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.",
          "Viet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission Vietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. Four of these cases have been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58 cases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope that the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained. However, a 59th case was reported on 31 March.",
          "This male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient at the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam’s index case. This contact continued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter’s husband, who attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile illness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously. It is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his father-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists maintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur. Nor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently assumed (2–7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is being taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for case 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi. Cases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who provided considerable care for case 59.",
          "WHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the contacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will be linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.",
          "Of the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died and 14 remain in hospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although slightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.",
          "Canada: one new probable case reported Health Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10 deaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in British Columbia (3).",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been reported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3 deaths when compared with yesterday.",
          "New cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42), Singapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case reported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported in Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1)."

          "8 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported",
          "The WHO expert team in Guangdong Province, China will be issuing its official interim report and recommendations on the local SARS situation early tomorrow. The four-person team, headed by John MacKenzie of Australia, has been in Guangdong since Thursday 3 April. The team was charged to assess the local situation and to support the strengthening of surveillance, clinical management, infection control, and laboratory evaluation of SARS cases.",
          "The team has visited Foshan City, where the earliest case is thought to have occurred in mid-November 2002, and Guangzhou City, the provincial capital. In a wide ranging collaborative investigation, the team has met with authorities, health and veterinary professionals, and technical experts in the provincial Centers for Disease Control laboratories and the virology laboratories of Zongshan Medical University. The team has conferred with staff at all levels and been granted full access to all sites, institutes, and hospitals requested.",
          "The team will be reporting on the provincial surveillance system, measures for community infection control, patient management and hospital infection control. It will also give a detailed review of microbiological findings.",
          "The SARS outbreak in Guangdong Province is presently the largest and oldest known outbreak of SARS and may hold important clues about both the origins or the virus and measures for clinical management. In one of its earliest reports about cases of atypical pneumonia to WHO, the Chinese Ministry of Health reported 305 cases and 5 deaths, from mid-November to 9 February, in 6 municipalities: Foshan, Guangzhou, Heyuan, Jiangmen, Shenzhen, and Zhongshan.",
          "Guangzhou was the home of a 64-year old professor of nephrology, at Zhongshan University, who is thought to be the index case who sparked the outbreak in Hong Kong. During late February, he stayed in room 911 on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel. Guests staying on the hotel’s ninth floor sparked outbreaks in other countries when they returned to their homes in Toronto and Singapore. A 48-year-old American businessman, who also stayed on the 9th floor, is believed to have originated the outbreaks in Hanoi and in Hong Kong’s Princess Margaret Hotel, where he was transferred. One local Hong Kong resident, who visited an acquaintance on the ninth floor, subsequently sparked an outbreak in a second Hong Kong hospital.",
          "Elsewhere in China, Shanghai, which has reported its first SARS case, has requested a visit from the WHO team to discuss SARS and be advised on how best to deal with the disease.",
          "In Beijing, the death on Sunday of a 53-year-old staff member of the International Labour Organization continued to cause considerable anxiety, particularly at embassies and among staff of international organizations. Epidemiologists at the WHO Office in Beijing have conducted contact tracing and other investigations to determine the source of the staff member’s exposure and to assess whether close contacts may have been exposed. To date, no SARS cases or suspicious symptoms related to this death have been observed. The investigations are continuing.",
          "Update on cases and countries",
          "As of today, 2671 SARS cases with 103 deaths have been reported from 17 countries. This represents an increase of 70 cases and 5 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in Canada (1), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Singapore (2). The additional cases were reported in Canada (1), China (11), Hong Kong SAR (45), France (1), Singapore (7), and the United States (7). Taiwan, China removed 2 cases from the list."

          "7 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported",
          "China The Chinese Ministry of Health is now providing daily updates on numbers of cases and deaths, nationwide by province. On 3 April, a total of 17 new cases, including two deaths, were reported. Two previously reported cases were excluded. Eleven new cases and one death occurred in Guangdong Province. One case was reported from Shanghai, four from Beijing, and one case (fatal) from Sichuan Province.",
          "On April 4, 12 new cases, with no deaths, were reported, 11 from Guangdong and 1 from Shanxi. For April 5 and 6, 21 new cases and 2 new deaths were reported. The breakdown by province is awaiting translation from Chinese. This brings the total number of reported cases in China to 1268, with 53 deaths.",
          "Chinese officials have announced that SARS is being made a high priority for the government. A system of alert and response for early detection and reporting of all emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is being put in place. The government has also begun holding daily press conferences. WHO welcomes this move, which is an important way to increase awareness of the population and health care staff of the characteristic symptoms, the need to seek prompt medical attention, and the need to manage patients according to the principles of isolation and strict infection control.",
          "The WHO office in China has reported considerable anxiety among the international community following the death in Beijing on Sunday of a 53-year-old Finnish staff member of the International Labor Organization. The ILO staff members was in Beijing to attend an international conference. At present it is unclear how the staff member contracted SARS. He had travelled to Beijing via Thailand, where no local transmission has been reported.",
          "Hong Kong Hong Kong SAR continues to report the largest number of new cases, placing some hospitals under considerable strain. Today’s report from the Department of Health indicates that the unusual outbreak among residents in the Amoy Gardens estate, which has caused 268 cases, is coming to an end. Investigation of environmental samples continues at a rapid pace with support from several government departments. Evidence that the causative agent is excreted in faeces has focused attention on the possibility of an oral-faecal route of transmission, though no conclusions have been reached. Good data from the investigations are expected by the end of the week. The investigations have found no evidence of airborne spread.",
          "Singapore The Singapore Ministry of Health has reported an unusual cluster of 29 suspected SARS cases in hospital staff from two wards of a single hospital. Of these 4 are probable SARS cases. The onset of the clustering is believed to be 29 March. Officials investigating the cause of the outbreak are considering a possible point source in the environment, as it would be unusual for so many cases to begin on the same day if caused by contact with a patient",
          "Viet Nam The outbreak in Viet Nam began at a French hospital in Hanoi, where the index case, a 48-year old Chinese-American businessman who worked for an import-export company in Hong Kong, was admitted on 26 February. The number of cases increased rapidly but then stabilized on 24 March at 58 cases and remained stable for 10 consecutive days. As the maximum incubation period for SARS is thought to be 10 days, the stable number of cases over this period raised hope that Viet Nam’s outbreak had been brought under control. However, on 3 April a probable SARS case was detected in a provincial hospital. Though the case could be linked back to the French hospital, the absence of isolation and rigorous infection control at the provincial hospital suggests that many hospital staff, patients, and visitors could have been exposed, thus possibly seeding further waves of cases. An additional three probable cases have been reported over the past two days.",
          "Canada Health Canada has received reports of 217 probable or suspect cases of SARS. There have been 9 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The largest outbreak has occurred in Ontario, where 87 probable and 92 suspect cases have been reported. British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 23 suspect cases, New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases, Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case, Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases, and Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.",
          "These reports account for the 90 probable cases included in the WHO cumulative table of cases and deaths for today.",
          "Status of diagnostic tests The development of a diagnostic test, which is being pursued around the clock by the WHO collaborating network of 11 laboratories, has proved more problematic than hoped. Three diagnostic tests are now available and all have limitations as tools for bringing the SARS outbreak quickly under control.",
          "The ELISA detects antibodies reliably but only from about day 20 after the onset of clinical symptoms. It therefore cannot be used to detect cases at an early stage before they have a chance to spread the infection to others. The second test, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), detects antibodies reliably as of day 10 of infection, but is a demanding and comparatively slow test that requires the growth of virus in cell culture. The presently available PCR molecular test for detection of SARS virus genetic material is useful in the early stages of infection but produces many false-negatives, meaning that many persons who actually carry the virus may not be detected – creating a dangerous sense of false security for a virus that is known to spread easily in close person-to-person contact.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 2601 cases of SARS, with 98 deaths, have been reported from 17 countries. This represents an increase of 85 cases and 9 deaths compared with the last update of 5 April. The deaths occurred in Canada (2), China (4), and Hong Kong SAR (3).",

Health authorities are current investigating sewage samples at a construction site adjacent to Block E apartment building in Amoy Gardens, which has been the source of a large cluster of new SARS cases. New cases have been associated with vertically linked apartments. A second line of investigation is concentrating on a burst sewage pipe in block E that may have epidemiological links with a visitor to Amoy Gardens which was subsequently admitted to Hong Kong’s Prince of Wales Hospital in early March and was said to have been symptomatic at the time of his visit."

For instance the outbreak in Hanoi has passed its peak and no new cases have been identified for the last week. Last week WHO issued recommendations aimed at further limiting the spread of SARS and protecting international air passengers. These recommendations still apply (see WHO recommends new measures to prevent travel-related spread of SARS.)",

Despite the implementation of strict measures to control the outbreak, there have continued to be a small number of visitors to Hong Kong who have been identified as SARS cases after their return from Hong Kong. The epidemic in Guangdong Province of China, situated adjacent to Hong Kong, is the largest outbreak of SARS reported and has also shown evidence of spread in the wider community. As a measure of precaution WHO is now recommending that persons travelling to Hong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing non-essential travel.

These 9 cases of probable SARS, related to travel in Hong Kong, occurred in Taiwan, Province of China, and Singapore. The data on these cases, and what is known about the incubation period of SARS, indicate that travel to Hong Kong can contribute to the international spread of SARS.",
          "15 March is the date when WHO issued its first SARS-related emergency travel advisory, which increased global awareness of this new disease, made travellers and health staff alert to symptoms, and initiated prompt reporting of cases.",
          "The SARS outbreak in Hong Kong SAR has developed an unusual pattern of transmission. This pattern is different from what is being seen in the vast majority of other SARS outbreaks, and is not yet fully understood. The number of cases is continuing to increase significantly, and there is evidence that the disease has spread beyond the initial focus in hospitals.",
          "These developments raise questions related to other routes of transmission, in addition to well-documented face-to-face exposure to droplets released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Epidemiologists are considering whether SARS is being transmitted in Hong Kong by some environmental means for which no satisfactory explanation has been found.",
          "Particular concern centres on a large cluster of cases linked to residential buildings in the Amoy Garden housing estate in the Kowloon district of Hong Kong.",
          "Historical perspective This is the first time in the history of WHO that such travel advice has been issued for specific geographical areas because of an outbreak of an infectious disease.",
          "Since 1958, WHO has issued weekly lists of areas infected with quarantinable diseases so that national authorities can decide whether to apply public health measures to arriving travellers. During the last years of the smallpox eradication campaign cases spread internationally by land. Controls at borders between neighbouring countries were relied on to prevent international spread. No global recommendations were necessary."

          "PRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY WHO 2 April 2003",
          "The World Health Organization (WHO) today said that the Government of China had announced the WHO expert team currently in Beijing will travel to Guangdong Province to investigate the SARS outbreak there.",
          "“These are very positive steps taken today by China,” said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director of Communicable Diseases at WHO. “As a result we’ll be able to gather even more evidence about the nature of the SARS outbreak in China.”",
          "In addition, WHO began recommending that persons travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Guangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. This updated travel advice comes as a result of new developments, particularly in Hong Kong, in the multi-country outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).",
          "This temporary recommendation will be reassessed daily as the epidemic evolves. The recommendation does not apply to passengers simply transiting through airports in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or Guangdong Province, China.",
          "The new travel advisory is intended to limit the spread of SARS by reducing travel to high risk areas. All other elements ofSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) WHO previous travel guidance still stand. See Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).",
          "The SARS situation in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China has developed unique features. There is a continuing and significant increase in cases* with indications that SARS has spread beyond the initial focus in hospitals. These developments raise questions related to other possible routes of transmission of SARS. These may involve transport of the virus from one person to another via some type of environmental means. To date, no satisfactory explanation has been found regarding this possibility. Also, since March 19, nine travellers have been identified as SARS cases on returning from a visit to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.",
          "Many questions about the state of the outbreak in Guangdong Province, China which borders Hong Kong have yet to be answered. The Guangdong outbreak is the largest reported and has also shown evidence of spread in the wider community. New information provided today by provincial authorities of more than 300 new cases in March alone indicates the outbreak there continues.",
          "Unprecedented global cooperation helps advance knowledge and containment of SARS",
          "In the four weeks that WHO has been tracking SARS much has been learned. This is largely because scientists, clinicians, laboratory chiefs and public health officials everywhere have collaborated closely.",
          "As a result of WHO's global alert issued on 15 March, national authorities have implemented heightened surveillance for cases of SARS. While an increasing number of countries are reporting new cases, these cases are quickly identified, patients are isolated and local transmission is stopped in most countries.",
          "It is now known that infection control methods work to contain the spread of SARS in hospitals, even in countries which do not have the most modern equipment.",
          "WHO and a network of 11 of the world's top laboratories are zeroing in on the cause of SARS and a diagnostic test is being developed. This test will help distinguish between those who are infected and those who are free of the SARS virus.",
          "The laboratory network is continuing its investigations. So far, the agent causing SARS has not been fully characterized and there is no certain treatment, vaccine or known other preventative measure.",
          "\"There will be other new diseases that will emerge in the future, and we will respond just as we have with SARS — with maximum efforts to contain its spread,\" stated Dr Guénaël Rodier, Director, Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response, WHO.",
          "* Cases of SARS and the countries in which they appear are posted on the WHO web site every evening in Geneva."

          "As of today, a cumulative total of 1804 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 62 deaths have been reported from 15 countries. This represents an increase of 182 cases and 4 deaths compared with the previous day.",
          "The largest increase occurred in Hong Kong, where 155 new cases were reported. This brings the cumulative total of cases in Hong Kong to 685 cases with 16 deaths.",
          "Of the four new SARS deaths, three occurred in Hong Kong. The fourth death was reported in Singapore.",
          "China remains the country with the largest number of cases. According to official reports, 806 cases with 34 deaths have occurred. The majority of these cases and deaths were associated with an outbreak in Guangdong Province. During that outbreak, authorities recorded 792 cases and 31 deaths from 16 November 2002 through 28 February.",
          "Other countries reporting additional cases include Canada (9), Taiwan, China (3), Italy (1) Singapore (1), Thailand (1), and the United States of America (10). Australia and Belgium reported their first probable cases today.",
          "In Viet Nam, where hospitals in Hanoi were among the earliest to experience a rapid burst of cases within a health care setting, the number of cases (58) and deaths (4) remained stable for the eighth day in a row. The incubation period for SARS is currently believed to range from two to 10 days. WHO epidemiologists regard an eight-day period with no newly detected cases as an encouraging sign that the outbreak in Hanoi has been controlled and that no further spread is occurring beyond the initial hospital foci.",
          "Singapore, another country that was hard hit at the beginning of the epidemic, is likewise showing a stable pattern, with cases confined to well-documented risk groups and few new cases being detected.",
          "An evolving epidemic SARS is a newly identified disease with transmission patterns that are only beginning to emerge and thus difficult to interpret. Much about the disease remains poorly understood, despite great progress in characterization of the causative virus and development of a robust diagnostic test.",
          "Particularly puzzling are the great differences between areas where outbreaks appear to have been fairly rapidly contained and confined to health care settings and persons in close face-to-face contact with patients, and other areas, such as Hong Kong and Toronto, where transmission is continuing despite the prompt isolation of patients and introduction of strict barrier nursing practices.",
          "WHO has established a set of priority issues requiring urgent scientific investigation. More studies are needed about how the disease is spread, the stages of the disease when virus is shed, which bodily secretions carry the virus, and whether certain secretions are more infectious than others. Researchers also need to understand whether persons infected with SARS become more infectious at a certain stage in the course of the disease, and whether factors such as age or underlying disease influence severity and prognosis.",
          "Some of the world’s foremost scientists and clinicians are now collaborating around the clock, through three WHO networks of “virtual” labs and clinics, to find answers to these questions. Evidence can then form the basis for more precise public health advice on how to prevent further spread both internationally and within those countries where cases have occurred. Based on more than five decades of experience, WHO maintains the position that good surveillance and response will contain any infectious diseases."

          "Disease Outbreak Reported 31 March 2003",
          "Situation in Hong Kong The Hong Kong Department of Health has today issued an unprecedented isolation order to prevent the further spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The isolation order requires residents of Block E of Amoy Garden to remain in their flats until midnight on 9 April.",
          "The decision to issue the isolation order was made following a continued steep rise in the number of SARS cases detected in the building over the past few days. Concern about a possible outbreak in Amoy Garden mounted on Saturday, when 22 of Hong Kong’s 45 new SAR cases hospitalized that day were determined to be residents of the estate. On Sunday, 36 of the 60 new patients admitted to hospital with probable SARS were Amoy Garden residents.",
          "Hong Kong health authorities today informed the public that a cumulative total of 213 residents of Amoy Garden had been admitted to hospital with suspected SARS since reporting on the disease began. Hong Kong’s outbreak began on 12 March when health officials first recognized a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia in the Prince of Wales Hospital.",
          "Of the 213 Amoy residents affected in the outbreak, 107 patients resided in Block E. In addition, most of these 107 patients from Block E lived in flats that were vertically arranged.",
          "This suggests that SARS may be spreading in Hong Kong according to a different pattern, still involving close person-to-person contact with bodily secretions from an infected person. WHO epidemiologists are considering the possibility that bodily secretions containing the causative virus might somehow enter common systems that link rooms or flats together. This pattern of spread would be in addition to the well-documented face-to-face contact that has been seen in the majority of cases reported so far.",
          "Earlier this month, Hong Kong epidemiologists detected an unusual pattern of transmission among guests and visitors at the Metropole Hotel during the critical period of 15 to 23 February. Guests and visitors at a single floor of the hotel are thought to have spread SARS to Toronto and Singapore and to have started the outbreak in Hong Kong’s Prince of Wales Hospital. No staff at the hotel developed symptoms.",
          "Amoy Garden is a large housing estate consisting of ten 35-storey blocks, where around 15,000 persons reside. It is located in Kowloon District.",
          "WHO has been informed that environmental samples have been taken from the affected flats in Block E and that investigations are under way to determine a possible explanation for this apparent vertical spread of the disease.",
          "Although the investigation is complex, results from testing of the environmental samples should be available within days and will help determine the source of infection in Block E and the mechanisms by which the pathogen has spread.",
          "Hong Kong epidemiologists have identified a possible “index” case in the Amoy Garden outbreak. This is a patient, now hospitalized in Prince of Wales Hospital, who visited his brother, a resident of Block E, several times before hospital admission.",
          "The WHO team in China The expert team spent the day in the Beijing Municipality Center for Disease Control and Prevention reviewing case records for all 10 cases reported in Beijing Municipality. Following the cases in Guangdong province in late January and early February 2003, Beijing Municipality CDC officials said an enhanced local surveillance system was established by adding 11 sentinel hospitals (out of 50 total hospitals) to report cases of atypical pneumonia.",
          "The laboratory service was also geared up to receive specimens and carry out tests in secure conditions. Other preparation included stockpiling of drugs, setting up a public hotline and holding two news conferences. In addition, CDC and hospital staff were trained in prompt reporting of atypical pneumonia and infection control. An isolation unit was established. CDC Beijing said that antibiotics and Ribovirin are being used routinely as treatment and prophylaxis.",
          "The team were told that contact tracing had begun as soon as the first cases of atypical pneumonia had been recognized in Beijing and had been carried out for all subsequent cases. Eight of the cases were imported (from Hong Kong and Taiyuan city, Shanxi province) and two were health care workers who became infected trying to revive a 72 year old man believed to have become ill after visiting a relative with SARS in a Hong Kong hospital. Besides the two health care workers, no other cases have been infected in Beijing.",
          "Discussions concerning a visit by the expert team to Guangdong Province are continuing with the Ministry of Health.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 1622 cases, with 58 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 72 cases and 4 deaths since the last figures were compiled on Saturday.",
          "The greatest increase in cases occurred in Hong Kong SAR. The additional deaths were reported in Canada (1) and Hong Kong (3). Germany reported its fifth case, and Switzerland its third."

          "At a press briefing held today in Beijing, the head of the WHO investigative team in China, John MacKenzie of Australia, announced several steps forward in the government’s commitment to join international efforts to contain a newly emerging infectious disease. (see Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Press briefing, Beijing, China )",
          "The WHO team of five experts arrived in Beijing last Sunday to investigate an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in Guangdong Province on 16 November 2002.",
          "Experts have strongly suspected a link between the southern China outbreak and current cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that first surfaced in mid-February in Asia. The disease has since spread to 13 countries on three continents.",
          "The WHO investigation is being conducted in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Health, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control, and officials from Guangdong Province.",
          "In the initial stage of the investigation, the WHO team compared case definitions used in China with those used by WHO to identify SARS and concluded that most cases of atypical pneumonia reported in China from mid-November until 28 February were “indeed cases of SARS.”",
          "As reported by the WHO team, Chinese authorities have now agreed to join the WHO collaborative effort to contain the SARS outbreak and prevent its further international spread. Chinese institutes will be selected within days to participate in three global electronic networks set up by WHO to facilitate rapid international collaboration on SARS-related scientific and medical problems. Networks of experts are working to further identify and characterize the SARS virus, develop better tools for diagnosis and management, and understand how the disease is transmitted and what works best to prevent its spread.",
          "WHO authorities have also been given access to meticulous records kept on Chinese SARS cases. As China, according to statistics released earlier this week, has experienced the largest number of SARS cases of any country in the world, these data are expected to take understanding of the new disease, and particularly its origins, a major step forward.",
          "One of the greatest challenges in containing new diseases is the lack of understanding of their behaviour as they emerge. The Chinese data, which also cover the longest time frame, are further expected to improve understanding of how the disease spreads from person to person and why some outbreaks appear to have much milder cases than others.",
          "Progress in identifying the causative agent, now being reported by members in a WHO global network of collaborating laboratories, indicates that the causative agent is a new virus in humans that may have jumped the species barrier from its animal host or mutated in ways that have given it more lethal properties. Chinese data may help solve the riddle of how the new virus first began to cause disease in humans.",
          "China released new figures on the Guangdong outbreak on Wednesday, significantly increasing the global cumulative total. On Thursday, officials issued the first reports of cases and deaths in ongoing outbreaks in Beijing province and in the northern province of Shanxi.",
          "China has further agreed today to begin providing up-to-date electronic reports of SARS cases throughout China. These reports will be submitted electronically as official reports to WHO from the Ministry of Health.",
          "According to members of the WHO team in China, the government may need a few days to get the new nationwide system of daily electronic reports in operation.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 1485 cases and 53 deaths have been reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 77 cases. No new deaths have occurred.",
          "No reports were received from China today due to the decision to introduce a new system of nationwide daily electronic reporting to WHO.",
          "With 58 new cases, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China remains the most severely affected area. Other countries reporting new cases include Canada (1), China, Taiwan (4), Singapore (8), and the United States of America (6).",
          "Viet Nam reported no new cases and no new deaths for the fifth day in a row. WHO experts believe that rapid detection of the outbreak and immediate introduction of stringent infection control procedures may have held further transmission at bay.",
          "Some patients recovering To date, 19 SARS patients have been discharged from hospitals in Hong Kong, 17 from Viet Nam, and 25 from Singapore."

The affected areas, where transmission of the SARS infectious agent is known to be spreading in a human-to-human chain, are kept under constant review and posted each day on the WHO web site. At present, only four countries are concerned. ( see affected areas )",
          "No additional precautions for the screening of departing passengers at airports in any other parts of the world are called for in today’s recommendations.",
          "The screening measures, recommended for consideration by national health officials and port authorities, involve an interview with passengers, departing from a limited number of areas, to detect illness with symptoms that give reason to suspect that a passenger may be infected with SARS.",
          "National authorities may wish to advise travellers with fever, departing on international flights from the few areas where SARS transmission has been documented, to postpone travel until they feel better. All international travellers should be aware of the symptoms of SARS and seek immediate medical attention should symptoms occur. Clinicians hold virtual conference on management of SARS patients",
          "Since global surveillance of SARS began at the end of February, some evidence suggests that a small number of suspected and probable cases of SARS have departed from the small number of affected countries on flights to other countries.",
          "Most cases continue to occur in persons in close face-to-face contact with SARS patients. Close face-to-face contact could conceivably occur in an aircraft among persons seated close to a person infected with SARS and coughing or sneezing.",
          "WHO has also issued detailed recommendations to airlines on steps to take should a suspected case of SARS be detected in flight. The WHO recommendations include advice on step-by-step procedures for following up fellow passengers on the flight who may have had close contact with the possible case and the specific advice that should be given to these travellers and their families.",
          "WHO recommends that contacts of a person be allowed to continue to travel so long as they do not have symptoms compatible with SARS.",
          "The WHO case definition, which is being widely used for surveillance purposes, is posted at the WHO web site and is kept under constant review. Case Definitions for Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)",
          "Many national health authorities have also issued SARS-related advice to international travellers."

          "Disease Outbreak Reported 27 March 2003",
          "On 17 March, WHO established a global network of leading laboratories to collaborate in the identification of the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",
          "Early on, labs in the network narrowed the search to members of the paramyxovirus and coronavirus families. Findings shared by network labs earlier this week began pointing, with increasing consistency, to coronaviruses.",
          "“Data from many network laboratories indicate that a coronavirus is the primary cause of the disease,” said WHO virologist and epidemiologist Klaus Stöhr. “This virus is unlike any known human or animal member of this virus family. It is consistently found in specimens from SARS patients from many countries. It has been isolated in cell-culture. We are very close to knowing for sure.”",
          "Conclusive identification of a causative must meet all criteria in the so-called “Koch’s postulate.” The additional experiments needed to fulfil these criteria are currently under way at a laboratory in the Netherlands.",
          "Scientists at Hong Kong University had previously announced, on 21 March, the isolation of a new virus that was strongly suspected to be the causative agent of SARS. The virus was detected in cell culture and by electron microscopy. The identity of the virus was not known at the time.",
          "Earlier this week, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) produced strong evidence implicating a coronavirus as the agent that causes SARS. Many labs of the WHO network have since been using molecular tests provided by CDC to confirm the presence of a coronavirus in specimens from patients in various countries.",
          "Rapid progress was also facilitated by the sharing of samples, taken from SARS patients in areas with large numbers of confirmed cases, among participants in the laboratory.",
          "Hong Kong, with 367 patients, many of whom are in intensive care, and 10 deaths remains the most severely affected area.",
          "Sequencing of the virus is ongoing in four laboratories. Results will help classify the virus and refine molecular diagnostic tools. Results will also guide the development of specific interventions.",
          "At present, no treatment beyond good intensive and supportive care has been consistently shown to improve prognosis in persons with SARS.",
          "Scientists in the network suspect that the virus will prove to be an entirely new, or until now undetected, member of the coronavirus family.",
          "Progress in the development of a diagnostic test Efforts to develop a reliable and easy to use diagnostic test are also moving forward quickly. Hong Kong University, Chinese University, and Public Virus Labs, all located in Hong Kong and all members of the WHO network, have devised a basic diagnostic test. In studies using confirmed SARS patients and healthy controls, results to date have been consistently positive in confirmed cases and consistently negative in the healthy controls. Further testing will begin tomorrow.",
          "The Hong Kong diagnostic test is a molecular test based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. Hong Kong scientists have also developed a diagnostic tool using the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) technique. Validation of the test is being facilitated by gene sequences of the PCR primers electronically by laboratories collaborating in the network. The WHO network is offering to make these test materials immediately available to labs in other countries throughout the world",
          "Over the next few days, samples from hundreds of confirmed and suspected SARS cases will be tested using these new diagnostic tools. In so doing, the tools will be further refined and streamlined to upgrade their capacity for daily screening of large numbers of samples.",
          "The PCR test is already showing good reliability in detecting SARS cases in the early days of infection. The IFA test is being used to detect infection in convalescent sera at about three weeks after infection begins. Together, the two tests should help to quickly and safely reassure the many patients the world over who are concerned about suspicious symptoms and yet may be suffering from common illnesses safely treated at home.",
          "Procedures of isolation and strict barrier nursing, recommended by WHO for the management of suspected SARS cases, have placed a heavy burden on health care services in several affected areas.",
          "Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 1408 cases and 53 deaths have been reported from 13 countries. Romania is reporting its first 3 probable cases today. This represents an increase of 85 cases and 4 deaths compared with the previous day.",
          "New data from China The Chinese Ministry of Health has today officially reported 792 cases and 31 deaths, up to 28 February, in Guangdong Province. Approximately 30% of these cases occurred in health workers.",
          "The Chinese Ministry of Health has further reported on SARS cases in other parts of China. In Beijing, 10 cases and 3 deaths have occurred as of 26 March. Two of these cases are in health workers. In the northern province of Shanxi, four cases, with no deaths, have occurred as of 26 March. Two cases are in health workers."

          "26 March 2003",
          "China updates data on cases and deaths Chinese authorities have today officially reported a total of 792 cases and 31 deaths in an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in southern China, in Guangdong Province on 16 November 2002. Cases were reported to have occurred in 7 cities of Guangdong Province.",
          "Chinese authorities had previously reported to WHO, on 14 February, a total of 305 cases and 5 deaths from 16 November to 9 February 2003.",
          "The new figures cover the period of 16 November to 28 February.",
          "A WHO team of 5 international experts, which arrived in China on the weekend, has today reviewed the case definition used in reporting cases of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province. The WHO team compared this definition with the WHO definition used to identify probable cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and concluded that the two definitions are compatible.",
          "Following in-depth discussion with central-level authorities and health officials in Guangdong Province on the details of several clusters of cases, the WHO expert team reached the conclusion that the atypical pneumonia cases which began occurring in southern China in November 2002 are likely cases of the same disease, now referred to as SARS, that began appearing in other Asian countries on 26 February and has since spread widely to several cities throughout the world.",
          "Chinese authorities further informed the WHO team of a new reporting system that will rely on regular provincial updates. WHO is expecting further information on reported cases in China for March as these data become available.",
          "Case management guidelines being used in China are in line with WHO recommendations for minimizing further transmission.",
          "China is also beginning a collaborative programme in which sera from infected Chinese patients will be exchanged with the WHO network of collaborating laboratories who are working to identify the SARS causative agent.",
          "Update on reported cases The new data from China bring the total number of reported probable cases worldwide, dating back to 16 November, to 1323 cases and 49 deaths. When the data from China are excluded, today’s figures represent an increase of 41 cases, largely concentrated in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, and one death, in Singapore, compared with yesterday. Full details are available on the WHO web site. Cumulative Number of Reported Cases (SARS).",
          "National measures to contain further spread Several countries are introducing maximum measures, including quarantine, to prevent the further spread of SARS.",
          "New diseases such as SARS are poorly understood as they emerge. At the beginning of an outbreak, it is sound public health policy to institute maximum control measures needed to prevent further spread.",
          "Maximum measures are justified when, in the view of national health authorities, they can be expected to protect populations against infection, keep the disease from spreading into the general population, and help prevent international spread to other countries, particularly through air travel.",
          "As the epidemiology of SARS becomes more fully understood, such measures can be adjusted and reduced in line with what is known about how the disease is transmitted and what works best to stop its spread, both nationally and internationally.",
          "First clinical “grand rounds” on SARS held today The first global “grand rounds” on SARS clinical features and treatment were held today by WHO. The electronic meeting united 80 clinicians from 13 countries. A summary of their discussions and conclusions has been posted today at the WHO web site. Clinicians hold virtual conference on management of SARS patients.",
          "Progress towards identification of the virus Research attention is increasingly focusing on the Coronavirus family, though viruses from the Paramyxovirus and other families are also being considered as scientists cast the widest possible net in their search for the cause of SARS. Many are of the opinion that a diagnostic test could rapidly follow conclusive identification of the pathogen. Experts in the network are also considering the theory that SARS is caused by co-infection with two new viruses that somehow need each other in order to cause severe disease in humans. Evidence is strongly pointing to a new virus, or possibly two new viruses, that have not previously been known to infect humans or cause severe disease.",
          "Hypotheses include a virus known to cause disease in an animal host that has jumped the species barrier to infect humans, or a known human virus that has mutated to acquire properties that are causing much more severe disease in humans. It is increasingly certain, however, that SARS is a serious new disease caused by a newly recognized pathogen."

          "WHO also receives detailed bulletins from ministries of health in the most heavily affected areas reporting on any SARS-related events that might alter understanding of the behaviour of this new disease.",
          "Today’s communications included a report, from the Hong Kong department of health, providing detailed preliminary data on the detection of nine atypical pneumonia cases among members of a Beijing tour organized by a Hong Kong travel agent. Investigation of these cases, including tentative identification of the index case, has progressed rapidly. The Hong Kong department of health is tracing, for surveillance purposes, the crew members and passengers who had taken two flights. The general public has been informed and a hot-line has been set up.",
          "WHO epidemiologists in Geneva, together with experts tracking outbreaks in affected countries, have decided today that, based on the information available at present, there is no need to change previous WHO advice.",

These include high fever, respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing, and should report these symptoms promptly.",
          "As of today, 487 SARS cases have been reported from 12 countries.",
          "A number of persons with SARS have taken long distance flights after becoming ill. Thousands of passengers who travelled in the same flights have been traced in Germany, Canada, Singapore and the United States. No cases have been discovered among these contacts. Today's report of a possible transmission of SARS on board a flight is undergoing investigation. As “close” contact is possible during a flight, in passengers sitting close to an infected person, such transmission cannot be ruled out. The evidence to date indicates that in-flight transmission is very unusual.",
          "Health authorities and hospital staff the world over are now alert to the symptoms of SARS. Suspect cases are being quickly detected and promptly reported. Proper isolation and management of cases has greatly reduced the risk of transmission of newly detected cases to others.",
          "WHO advice to travellers is being kept under constant review. SARS is an emerging disease. Knowledge about is clinical behaviour, response to treatment, and modes and risks of transmission are continually evolving.",
          "WHO is confident that, in the present climate of heightened awareness and rapid and detailed reporting, data useful in understanding SARS and issuing sound public health advice are being rapidly collected and rapidly made available."

          "Travel advice Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first recognized as a new disease in Asia in mid-February. Since then, more than 450 cases, with 17 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries on three continents.",
          "On 15 March, WHO issued an emergency travel advisory, based on information available at that time, and a preliminary case definition of SARS. The travel advisory was intended to alert national authorities and clinicians to potential cases of SARS and to urge travellers, including airline crew, with symptoms suggestive of SARS to seek medical attention.",
          "WHO continues to recommend, on the basis of currently available data, no travel restrictions to any destination. Guidance to governments, airlines, physicians and travellers issued on 15 March remains valid. WHO issues emergency travel advisory.",
          "Advice for health authorities and clinicians A more detailed clinical picture of SARS has been posted at the WHO Web site: Preliminary Clinical Description of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.",
          "WHO has further recommended that suspect cases be placed in isolation and managed using strict barrier nursing practices: Management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)",
          "Drawing on partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, WHO and its partner institutes and collaborating centres have placed field teams in Hanoi, Viet Nam, Hong Kong SAR, and Taiwan, China to assist health authorities. Last week, WHO flew 300 kilos of protective equipment and medical supplies to Hanoi.",
          "Health authorities and hospital staff the world over are now alert to the symptoms of SARS. Suspect cases are being quickly detected and promptly reported. Proper isolation and management of cases has greatly reduced the risk of transmission of newly detected cases to others.",
          "As of data available today, the vast majority of cases continue to occur in health care workers managing patients in hospital environments, and in the families and other close contacts of patients. Cumulative total of reported cases, 24 March.",
          "Update on cases and countries affected Reports from health authorities in 13 countries, compiled today, indicate a cumulative total of 456 cases of SARS and 17 deaths. This compares with reports a week ago (17 March) of 150 cases in 7 countries. Cumulative total of reported cases, 24 March.",
          "For most of the affected countries, cases reported today are for probable cases. Previous reports included both probable and suspected cases. As case definitions of SARS differ in some countries, the United States of America is today reporting 37 suspect cases under investigation.",
          "Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China remains the most severely affected area, reporting 260 cases and 10 deaths. Other severely affected areas included Singapore, with 65 cases and no deaths, and Vietnam, with 58 cases and 4 deaths. Canada has reported 11 cases and 3 deaths.",
          "Chest X-rays showing distinctive features of SARS are presently the main tool for distinguishing suspected from probable cases. A “hand-made” diagnostic test, developed by Hong Kong scientists, began producing reliable results on Saturday and will be made available to key laboratories in a matter of days. A more sophisticated test is expected to be available for widespread use in diagnosing SARS cases within weeks.",
          "Work towards the definitive identification of the causative agent, now strongly expected to be a virus of the Paramyxovirus or Coronavirus families, is continuing at breakneck speed. Researchers in a network of 11 leading laboratories, set up on Monday 17 March, exchange data on a restricted web site and compare virological and clinical information during daily teleconferences.",
          "A second network of clinicians was set up on 20 March to expedite work on diagnosis and treatment.",
          "WHO team of experts in China A WHO international team of experts in epidemiology, microbiology, virology, and respiratory diseases arrived in Beijing, China on Sunday 23 March. The multinational team was assembled in response to a request from the Chinese Ministry of Health to investigate possible links between the current SARS outbreak, which began in Asia in mid-February, and an outbreak of atypical pneumonia which began in Guangdong Province in China in mid-November.",
          "The WHO team, which includes experts from 5 countries, will review available epidemiological and laboratory data on cases in the southern China outbreak. It will also propose what additional investigations should be carried out, and which additional reagents, antibodies, tests, equipment and expertise might be required to continue the laboratory and virological work. This additional expertise and equipment is expected to bolster efforts to trace the source of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province.",
          "Concern over international spread The first concern WHO has regarding travel is the possibility that the disease will spread rapidly and become established in many countries around the world. The extent to which this is happening is being monitored by heightened surveillance for SARS symptoms around the world and rapid reporting of suspected cases.",
          "The worldwide awareness of the disease has been demonstrated by the number of countries reporting to WHO. Recommended isolation procedures appear to be working. Since these measures were introduced, no onward transmission of the disease, beyond those initially identified, has been reported.",
          "In these circumstances, where the rapid identification and isolation of cases appears to be containing international spread, WHO does not consider that any additional restrictions on travel or trade are required.",
          "Concerns over travel to affected areas As countries around the world have increased surveillance activities they have discovered a small number of cases in persons who have traveled to the affected areas. The small number of such cases, at present, is an indication that SARS poses little risk to travellers visiting the affected areas.",
          "Based on available information, WHO does not consider that the small health risk attributable to SARS significantly increases the health risk associated with travel to any destination. WHO therefore maintains its advice that no SARS-related restrictions on travel to any destination are necessary.",
          "WHO is aware that a number of countries have advised their nationals to consider postponing unnecessary or elective travel to the areas where local transmission of the disease has been demonstrated. Such advice does not amount to a restriction of travel, and is the responsibility of the concerned national authorities.",
          "Concern about air travel The public is also concerned about the safety of air travel. Cases that have been identified in countries outside the initially affected areas have arrived by air transport.",
          "It is important to note that there is no evidence to date to indicate that the disease is transmitted during air travel, or that travelling in an aeroplane with an infected person has resulted in illness to other passengers or crew. In case of concern that passengers have been exposed to an infected person during a flight, a protocol exists for the follow up of passengers and crew. When an airline wishes to disinfect an aeroplane after carrying a suspected SARS case there is good reason to believe that the procedures described in the WHO Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation will be fully effective."

          "A team of scientists in the department of microbiology, University of Hong Kong, has announced today success in culturing the viral agent that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Further progress in the development of a reliable diagnostic test was simultaneously announced by the same team.",
          "Using a special cell line, the Hong Kong scientists isolated the virus from the lung tissue of a patient who developed pneumonia following contact with a professor from Guangdong Province in southern China. Both the professor and the contact have died.",
          "Isolation of the virus now lays the solid foundation for very rapid development of a diagnostic test.",
          "The Hong Kong scientists have devised a basic test, relying on the technique of neutralizing antibodies. In today’s experiments designed to determine the accuracy of the test, scientists found that it was able to detect tell-tale antibodies in sera taken from eight SARS patients. The consistency of these findings indicates that the test is reliably identifying cases of SARS infection.",
          "This “hand-made” test will now be further developed into a more sophisticated diagnostic test. A rapid and reliable diagnostic test for SARS is urgently needed to assist the many clinicians who need a tool for rapid confirmation of genuine cases. Such a test can also help reassure the many “worried well” who are flooding health facilities as international concern about this disease and its rapid spread to new areas continues to increase.",
          "Many common and usually self-healing illnesses mimic the symptoms of SARS in its early stage.",
          "With the virus now isolated, scientists in Hong Kong and elsewhere can move forward quickly to characterize the agent, determine its relationship with known viruses, and establish a definitive identity. Results will be shared among 11 leading laboratories in a network set up on Monday 17 March by WHO.",
          "Exceptionally rapid progress Close collaboration, with findings shared daily in teleconferences and by email, has allowed advances that normally need months to take place in a matter of days.",
          "“This spectacular achievement is an example of what the world can do when the intellectual resources of nations around the world are focused on a single problem,” says Klaus Stöhr, a WHO virologist who is coordinating the global laboratory network.",
          "“Scientists who are by default academic competitors are now working virtually shoulder to shoulder. In less than a week, they have produced results which, in other circumstances, would likely have taken months or more. This rapid advance is fuelling the hope that SARS can and will be contained.” The virus responsible for SARS is considered by some research groups to be a member of the well-known Paramyxoviridae family. Yesterday, Canadian researchers released findings suggesting that the metapneumovirus, which belongs to this family, may be the cause.",
          "The metapneumovirus was first discovered by Dutch scientists in June 2001 at a laboratory that is also included in the new WHO network. At the time of its discovery, the virus was known to cause respiratory disease in humans, including some cases of pneumonia, but showed a different transmission pattern and was much less severe than the SARS agent.",
          "At this point, it cannot be ruled out that an entirely different virus from another family may be responsible for the SARS outbreak.",
          "Identity of virus remains elusive WHO cautions that the race to identify the SARS causative agent is by no means over. Although the virus has now been isolated, its identity remains elusive. Other research groups in the network of collaborating labs are producing hints that the causative agent may belong to another virus family.",
          "SARS is an emerging disease, first recognized in Asia in mid-February, that has sickened over 380 persons on three continents and caused severe pneumonia in a large proportion of patients. A cumulative list of affected countries and numbers of cases and deaths is released each day on the WHO web site. Today’s data indicate that the vast majority of reported cases continue to occur in health care workers, family members and close contacts of patients.",
          "Investigative team travelling to China A WHO team of five experts is now en route to China to investigate the possibility that an outbreak of a disease having similar symptoms and affecting similar groups – health care workers and close contacts of patients – may be linked to the current SARS outbreak.",
          "As of today, Hong Kong remains the most seriously affected area. Authorities there have reported a total of 222 cases in health care workers, medical students, and family members and hospital visitors who have been in close contact with patients. Of these, 217 have developed symptoms of pneumonia, and many are in serious condition."

          "Serum from patients infected by a virus usually contains neutralizing antibodies that stop the growth of the virus – whatever its identity – when added to a cell culture in which the virus has been successfully grown.",
          "When the researchers added serum from SARS patients to the cell culture, virus growth was halted. Serum from uninfected healthy controls had no effect on the virus.",
          "“This is not just some light at the end of the tunnel,” said WHO virologist Dr Klaus Stöhr, who is coordinating the collaborative laboratory efforts. “This is a real ray of sunshine.”",
          "WHO cautions, however, that the number of patients in the test was small and more work needs to be done. The scientific community is excited by the news, which could be regarded as the first important step towards the development of a diagnostic test.",
          "The infectious agent resembles the morphology of a Paramyxovirus. Scientists cannot, however, be certain about the identity of the virus, which may indeed be a new Paramyxovirus or another virus with a similar morphology.",
          "The laboratory is one of 11 leading labs participating in an international multicentre research project. The project was set up by WHO on Monday to expedite identification of the causative agent – considered by several research groups to be a member of the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses – and rapidly develop a diagnostic test.",
          "WHO team of experts travelling to China",
          "A WHO team of five infectious disease experts will be travelling over the weekend to China to support investigations there of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in Guangdong Province in mid-November.",
          "The multinational team was assembled in response to a request from the Chinese Ministry of Health for epidemiological and laboratory support to aid ongoing investigation of the outbreak. The team will also assist in laboratory work that might lead to identification of the causative agent.",
          "The team includes experts in virology, laboratory techniques, epidemiological investigation, and the control of unusual infectious diseases. Team members, of American, Australian, British, and German nationality, have been drawn from institutes participating in the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.",
          "The outbreak in southern China is linked geographically and by timing to the current outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which first surfaced in Asia in mid-February and caused its first known death on 13 March. Cases of this new disease have now been detected in 13 countries on three continents. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, which as of today accounts for 203 of the 350 suspected or probable cases reported worldwide, remains the most severely affected area.",
          "Apart from searching for the causative agent, the WHO team is expected to help Chinese scientists determine whether the Guangdong outbreak included cases that fit the current definition of SARS.",
          "Conclusive identification of the causative agent, which is thought to be a virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, would greatly aid the investigation by Chinese scientists and the WHO team, which is expected to begin on Monday.",
          "Research on the identity of the SARS pathogen is progressing rapidly within a network of 11 leading laboratories set up by WHO earlier this week. WHO remains optimistic that a definitive announcement of the cause of SARS can be made soon.",
          "History of the Guangdong outbreak",
          "WHO was first officially informed of the outbreak on 11 February, when the Chinese Ministry of Health reported that 305 cases of acute respiratory syndrome of unknown cause had occurred in six municipalities in Guangdong Province in southern China. Five deaths were reported. Transmission of the disease was largely confined to health care workers (105 doctors, nurses, and other medical workers) and household contacts of patients.",
          "On 14 February, WHO was informed by the Chinese Ministry of Health that the outbreak was clinically consistent with atypical pneumonia. Reported symptoms included fever, dizziness, muscle soreness, and bouts of coughing. Patients had acute symptoms, included high fever, dry cough, muscle pain, and weakness, and required hospitalization. The Chinese authorities also provided information that cases had been detected in the province as far back as 16 November 2002.",
          "In mid-February, some Chinese experts concluded that the outbreak was caused by chlamydial organisms. Others speculated that a virus might be the cause.",
          "It is hoped that the WHO team can help authorities quickly resolve these and other outstanding questions about the Guangdong outbreak.",
          "Update on cases and affected countries As of 21 March, 350 suspected and probable cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries. These figures represent an additional 44 cases and two new countries compared with the previous day. The number of deaths remains unchanged.",
          "Countries reported their first suspected cases are Italy and the Republic of Ireland, each reporting one case. New cases were reported in Hong Kong (30), Singapore (5), Taiwan, China (2), Thailand (3), and the United States of America (2).",
          "New guidelines for health authorities WHO has today posted on its web site two documents to assist national authorities in the investigation and management of cases. The first gives a more complete, though still preliminary, clinical picture of SARS, pooled from findings provided by clinicians treating SARS patients in seven countries. It is anticipated that the clinical description will help health authorities recognize cases with greater precision.",
          "The second document provides advice, including recommended laboratory tests and radiological findings, that can guide the safe discharge and follow-up of convalescent cases. The policy advice aims to ensure that the release of recovered patients carries no risks for family members and other close contacts. Until more is known about the etiological agent, and the potential for continued carriage, WHO is recommending a cautious approach."

          "Investigation of causative agent gains momentum Highly specialized testing of specimens from patients ill with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) continues at top speed in top labs, expedited by electronic sharing of results. WHO is increasingly optimistic that conclusive identification of the causative agent can be announced soon. The development of a precise diagnostic test could follow quickly. Collaboration in the race to find the causative agent is taking place within the framework of a network of labs set up on Monday. Research is now focused on the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses. This family includes several well-known viruses, such as those causing mumps, measles and common respiratory ailments. It also includes a subfamily of viruses capable of infecting multiple animal species, including humans. This subfamily was implicated in the emergence during the 1990s of new and severe diseases in humans caused by Hendra and Nipah viruses. The virus jumped directly from animal hosts (horses and pigs) to humans. No person-to-person transmission was documented in outbreaks caused by either virus. New treatment network WHO has today established a cooperative network of clinicians for SARS diagnosis and treatment. The network brings together, via two daily teleconferences, clinicians in the most heavily affected Asian countries and in Europe and North America. Clinicians participate on the basis of either first-hand experience in the management of SARS cases or leading expertise in the diagnosis and management of unusual infectious diseases. Participants are pooling data on cases and sharing X-ray pictures. Chest X-rays are, at present, one of the main tools for distinguishing between suspected and probable cases. Treatment guidelines, including criteria for safe discharge of patients from hospitals, are also being established on the basis of shared experiences. Pending definitive identification of the causative agent, a combination of treatments are being tried to cure cases. WHO is providing support, in the form of protective equipment and supplies, to help the most heavily affected hospitals prevent further spread within hospital settings, where the overwhelming majority of new infections have occurred. If a paramyxovirus is confirmed to be the cause, WHO will be in a much better position to recommend a treatment. The antiviral drug, ribavirin, may be responsible for some degree of clinical improvement observed in critically ill patients in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China. Intensive and good supportive care have also been associated with improved prospects of recovery. Update on cases and affected countries As of 20 March, 306 suspected and probable cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported from eleven countries. These figures represent an additional 42 cases and one death compared with the previous day. Increases were reported in Canada (1), Hong Kong (23), Singapore (3), Taiwan, China (1), the United Kingdom (1), and Viet Nam (6). Switzerland, reporting 7 suspected cases, was added to the list. Possible cases in airline passengers and crew member ruled out Press reports have referred to 2 suspected cases of SARS, one in an airline crew member and a second in a passenger, travelling on separate flights from Hong Kong and Taipei to Viet Nam. Both suspected cases have been investigated and are now ruled out as cases of SARS. Index case in Hong Kong outbreak WHO has welcomed a report from the Hong Kong Department of Health, released yesterday, that may have identified the “index” case in the outbreak in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. In an outstanding example of detective work, epidemiologists have determined that 7 people who contracted SARS recently stayed in or visited the Metropole hotel in Kowloon last month. The 7 persons investigated include 3 visitors from Singapore, 2 from Canada, one China Mainland visitor, and a local Hong Kong resident. The investigation revealed that all 7 stayed in or visited the same floor of the hotel between 12 February and 2 March. The local Hong Kong resident is believed to be the index case, who subsequently infected other early cases in the outbreak. He had visited an acquaintance staying at the hotel from 15 to 23 February. The visitor from Mainland China, who became sick a week before staying at the hotel, is considered the original source of the infection. No further cases have been linked to the hotel. Absolute need for continued vigilance WHO is underscoring the need for continued vigilance. Experience with other emerging diseases makes it clear that, should the causative agent turn out to be a virus, the new disease could establish endemicity, especially in light of abundantly documented human-to-human transmission. The world must protect itself against the widespread establishment of another new infectious disease. WHO concern is now increasingly focused on preparation to assist vulnerable countries in the likely event that cases continue to spread. Up to now, all imported cases have occurred in countries well-equipped and well-prepared to institute WHO-recommended precautions, including isolation and barrier nursing practices, for preventing spread to others, whether health care workers or family members. In view of the rapid spread of this disease to new countries via exposed air travellers, any country with an international airport is potentially at risk. This focus on preparedness underscores the need for a concerted effort to defend global public health security. In an era of close interconnectedness and rapid air travel, an outbreak anywhere in the world is a potential threat to health everywhere. International collaboration – on the part of the medical and research communities, multinational teams in the field, and health authorities around the world – in the reporting, investigation, and management of this outbreak has been outstanding."

          "Disease Outbreak Reported 19 March 2003",
          "Preliminary findings suggest a viral cause Research teams at two laboratories, in Germany and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, have detected particles of a virus from the Paramyxoviridae family in samples taken from patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This is the first major step forward in efforts to pinpoint the causative agent. Previous tests conducted in a number of top laboratories failed to detect the presence of any known bacteria or viruses, including the influenza viruses, recognized as causes of pneumonia or respiratory symptoms, or known to be widespread in the most affected geographical areas. The failure of all previous efforts to detect the presence of bacteria and viruses known to cause respiratory disease strongly suggests that the causative agent may be a novel pathogen. Firm conclusions about the identity of the causative agent are premature. All teams have stressed that these are preliminary results only. Further studies are needed before it can be concluded, with confidence, that the causative agent has been identified. Collaborative efforts continue. All research teams are participants in the international multicentre SARS research project, linking together 11 leading laboratories, that was set up on Monday 17 March. Coordinated research is expected to expedite definitive identification of the causative agent. The detection of paramyxovirus particles in samples from infected patients is the first lead to a possible cause of SARS and will be extremely important in focusing ongoing research. Definitive identification of the causative agent will help physicians move from the current “hit-or-miss” approach to treatment to a more precise selection of drugs with a greater prospect of cure. Knowledge of the causative agent will also speed development of a diagnostic test and thus give physicians and national health authorities a powerful tool for the identification of cases. It will also reassure the many “worried well” now presenting at health facilities, and reduce the number of false alarms. Update on countries and cases As of Wednesday 19 March, a cumulative total of 264 suspected or probable cases and 9 deaths have been reported from 10 countries (Canada, China, Germany Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Viet Nam). Hong Kong SAR, Hanoi (Viet Nam), and Singapore continue to be the most affected areas. Full details are provided in tabular form. Awareness of the disease is now very high throughout the world. Surveillance is proving to be sensitive, with suspected cases rapidly detected, reported to national authorities and WHO, and investigated according to the standard case definition. The Paramyxoviridae family Viruses in the Paramyxoviridae family include many common, well-known agents associated with respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus, and childhood illnesses, including the viruses that cause mumps and measles. Some of these viruses are widespread, particularly during the winter season. Screening of specimens could therefore be expected to detect particles of these common viruses. At this point, it cannot be ruled out entirely that tests for the SARS agent are detecting such “background” viruses rather than the true causative agent. The Paramyxoviridae family also includes two recently recognized pathogens, Hendra virus and Nipah virus. These related viruses are unusual in the family in that they can infect and cause potentially fatal disease in a number of animal hosts, including humans. Most other viruses in the family tend to infect a single animal species only. Nipah virus first began to cause deaths in humans in Peninsular Malaysia in 1998 in persons in close contact with pigs. The outbreak caused 265 cases of human encephalitis, including 105 deaths. Two separate outbreaks of Hendra virus, associated with severe respiratory disease in horses, caused two human deaths in Australia in 1994 and 1995. No human-to-human transmission was documented in either outbreak. No treatment was available for cases caused by either of these two viruses. Human-to-human transmission did not occur."

The number of cases without such close contact remains few, and no data indicate that this number is rapidly increasing. Based on current knowledge, WHO considers that the emergency travel advice issued on Saturday 15th March remains valid.",

          "In areas where person-to-person transmission has been documented, cases have occurred almost exclusively in health care workers or in persons in very close contact with patients, such as family members. Currently available data indicate that transmission of the infectious agent requires direct and close contact. There is no evidence of transmission following casual contact.",
          "Due to heightened awareness, cases are now being quickly identified and immediately isolated. No cases of secondary transmission are occurring following the detection and proper management of imported cases.",
          "Protective measures and strict barrier nursing procedures are now in place in hospitals in all areas where cases have been reported. In areas where person-to-person transmission has occurred, these measures are expected to decrease transmission to health staff and families of patients. Strict protective measures in countries managing imported cases are likewise expected to reduce the risk that the disease will spread to others within these countries.",

          "17 March 2003 -- WHO has today stepped up several activities aimed at strengthening the international response to the recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS is an infectious disease of unknown etiology characterized by atypical pneumonia (see WHO press release of 15 March and additional information at www.who.int.)",
          "The disease is spread from person to person but only through close contact with a case. To date, almost all reported cases have occurred in health workers involved in the direct care of reported cases or in close contacts, such as family members. There is no evidence to date that the disease spreads though casual contact.",
          "The WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network is coordinating an international multicenter effort to identify the causative agent. The project unites 11 laboratories in 10 countries. Participating laboratories have the most experience to date in diagnosis of cases, or are known for their high-level facilities and expertise. The collaborative effort will also improve diagnostic precision and move work forward on the development of a diagnostic test. WHO is also working with health authorities to identify an effective treatment for SARS.",

          "Through its regional office in Manila, Philippines, WHO is establishing logistics bases and supply chains to ensure rapid provision of protective equipment and medicines needed for outbreak response.",
          "Chinese authorities have now issued a summary report on an outbreak of what may be the same or a related disease that began in Guangdong province in southern China in November and peaked in mid-February. The Chinese report, which includes data on the diagnosis and management of more than 300 cases, is presently undergoing analysis and is expected to further contribute to understanding about the syndrome and possible links among the various outbreaks. The Chinese report, which covers the largest number of cases to date, may also boost international efforts to establish effective treatment guidelines, should a relationship between the outbreaks be established.",
          "The Ministry of Health of China has requested support from an international team. A WHO team is now being assembled.",
          "Health authorities around the world are now alert to the risk of SARS. Tracking of the course of the epidemic shows that surveillance systems are sensitive, communication channels are open, and reporting is rapid. Information on cases compiled over the past three weeks is expected to shed new light on the behaviour of this disease.",
          "The speed of international travel creates a risk of rapid spread to additional areas. Because the clinical course and epidemiological behaviour of this disease are poorly understood, WHO is calling upon national health authorities to maintain close vigilance for suspected cases. There is no current justification for any restriction in travel or trade.",

          "12 March 2003 | GENEVA -- Since mid February, WHO has been actively working to confirm reports of outbreaks of a severe form of pneumonia in Viet Nam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), China, and Guangdong province in China.",
          "In Viet Nam the outbreak began with a single initial case who was hospitalized for treatment of severe, acute respiratory syndrome of unknown origin. He felt unwell during his journey and fell ill shortly after arrival in Hanoi from Shanghai and Hong Kong SAR, China. Following his admission to the hospital, approximately 20 hospital staff became sick with similar symptoms.",
          "The signs and symptoms of the disease in Hanoi include initial flu-like illness (rapid onset of high fever followed by muscle aches, headache and sore throat). These are the most common symptoms. Early laboratory findings may include thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and leucopenia (low white blood cell count). In some, but not all cases, this is followed by bilateral pneumonia, in some cases progressing to acute respiratory distress requiring assisted breathing on a respirator. Some patients are recovering but some patients remain critically ill.",
          "Today, the Department of Health Hong Kong SAR has reported on an outbreak of respiratory illness in one of its public hospitals. As of midnight 11 March, 50 health care workers had been screened and 23 of them were found to have febrile illness. They were admitted to the hospital for observation as a precautionary measure. In this group, eight have developed early chest x-ray signs of pneumonia. Their conditions are stable. Three other health care workers self-presented to hospitals with febrile illness and two of them have chest x-ray signs of pneumonia.",
          "Investigation by Hong Kong SAR public health authorities is on-going. The Hospital Authority has increased infection control measures to prevent the spread of the disease in the hospital. So far, no link has been found between these cases and the outbreak in Hanoi.",
          "In mid February, the Government of China reported that 305 cases of atypical pneumonia, with five deaths, had occurred in Guangdong province. In two cases that died, chlamydia infection was found. Further investigations of the cause of the outbreak is ongoing. Overall the outbreaks in Hanoi and Hong Kong SAR appear to be confined to the hospital environment. Those at highest risk appear to be staff caring for the patients.",
          "No link has so far been made between these outbreaks of acute respiratory illness in Hanoi and Hong Kong and the outbreak of `bird flu,` A(H5N1) in Hong Kong SAR reported on 19 February. Further investigations continue and laboratory tests on specimens from Viet Nam and Hong Kong SAR are being studied by WHO collaborating centres in Japan and the United States.",
          "Until more is known about the cause of these outbreaks, WHO recommends patients with atypical pneumonia who may be related to these outbreaks be isolated with barrier nursing techniques. At the same time, WHO recommends that any suspect cases be reported to national health authorities.",

          "As of 27 February no further cases of human influenza A(H5N1) have been reported in Hong Kong SAR ( see previous report ). To date the current outbreak of influenza A(H5N1) in Hong Kong SAR has been limited to two cases, one of whom has died. Both cases were members of the same family who returned to their home in Hong Kong SAR on 8 February after travelling to Fujian province, China. The mother and children were in mainland China for 14 days; the father for 9 days. The father of the family (a 33 year old man) developed respiratory symptoms on 7 February whilst in Fujian Province, China. He was admitted to hospital in Hong Kong SAR on 11 February with pneumonia but died on 17 February. Influenza A (H5N1) was isolated from post-mortum specimens on 20 February. The man´s 9 year old son also became unwell whilst in Fujian province. He was admitted to hospital in Hong Kong SAR on 12 February with pneumonia. Influenza A (H5N1) was isolated from two nasopharageal aspirates taken from the boy on 19 February. The boy is in a stable condition. Additional family members have also had respiratory symptoms. The boy’s 8 year old sister died on 4 February whilst the family was in Fujian Province, China. The cause of her death is under investigation. The mother has now recovered from what was thought to have been a parainfluenza infection. An outbreak of atypical pneumonia occurred between November 2002 and February 2003 in Guandong province, China. Health authorities in China investigated the outbreak and identified Chlamydia pneumoniae as the causitive agent. The Ministry of Health in Beijing has informed WHO that the outbreak in Guandong is over and that there is no evidence of a link between the outbreak in Guandong and the H5N1 cases in Hong Kong SAR. The Department of Health in Hong Kong SAR has intensified its surveillance for influenza among patients with influenza-like symptoms or atypical pneumonia. No unusual increase in influenza activity has been detected over the past few weeks. WHO is continuing to work closely with health authorities in Beijing, China and Hong Kong SAR. Reagents for laboratory diagnosis of influenza A(H5N1) have been made available to the Ministry of Health in Beijing, the National Influenza Centres and to other members of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network."

          "In early January 2003, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome in Kinshasa. Serum and nasopharyngeal samples from 5 districts from Kinshasa were tested by Institut Pasteur, Paris. Evidence from 16 of the 22 serum samples strongly suggests influenza virus A(H3N2) to be involved in the current outbreak. This virus has been circulating worldwide for several years. Influenza vaccine containing the WHO recommended vaccine strains protect against this influenza virus. Virus isolation and characterization are currently underway. The Ministry of Health conducted epidemiological studies from December 2002 to mid-January 2003 in health zones and medical institutions in Kinshasa. Fourteen medical institutions reported 3 963 influenza cases including 126 deaths (case-fatality rate of 3.2%) and 33 health zones reported 27 211 cases including 170 deaths (case-fatality rate of 0.6%). The differences in the case-fatality rates can be explained by differences in health and nutritional status and access to health care services. Children under 5 years of age were the most affected. The epidemiology of this outbreak is still not completely understood as limited resources have impeded a more thorough investigation. However, Epicentre/Médecins sans Frontières, France have recently initiated more comprehensive data collection and analysis."
