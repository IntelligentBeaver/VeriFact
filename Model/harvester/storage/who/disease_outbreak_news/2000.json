Laboratory testing has confirmed the disease in humans and animals in 4 governorates: Hodeidah, Hajjah, Mahweet and Sadeh and there is serologic evidence of the disease in animals in Dhamar governorate.   Surveillance and control activities are ongoing.  Although the disease is restricted to the north-western part of the country, areas to the southwest are now experiencing evidence of Rift Valley fever transmission. There is persistent transmission in El-Zuhrah district, Hodeidah governorate despite extensive and vigorous mosquito control activities. A team of epidemiologists will be carrying out a survey in El-Zuhrah district to assess the importance of direct animal contact versus exposure to mosquitoes as a risk factor for disease.  It will also assess the economic impact of the outbreak on the community. A joint technical team has been formed by the Ministries of Health and Agriculture of the governments of Yemen and Saudi Arabia to fight the epidemic. WHO has launched an appeal for US$ 975 000 to support efforts to control and prevent Rift Valley Fever  in Yemen ( see previous report )."

          "The public health authorities of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia with the support of WHO and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC),\r\nhave decided to implement a cholera vaccination campaign in the unaffected islands, using\r\nthe live oral CVD-103HgR vaccine.  Several clinical studies have shown that one oral\r\ndose of this vaccine provides 70-90% protective immunity after only seven days.",
          "Although the outbreak is still ongoing, it is limited to\r\nPohnpei island.  However, the cholera vaccination campaign is a preventive measure to\r\ncontain the spread of cholera to other areas.",
          "This cholera vaccine campaign does not replace the usual\r\nrecommendations for safe water, appropriate sanitation and environmental measures, but is\r\nrather a complementary tool to contain the cholera outbreak in this specific situation."

A report of one case in a third district has not yet been verified. Laboratory results have confirmed  yellow fever IgM in 1 of 5 clinical samples sent to Institut Pasteur, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, for testing; virus detection is now underway in this and the other samples.",
          "These cases were detected following training in integrated surveillance for district surveillance officers in the county. As this training is introduced in the other counties, the outbreak may prove to be more extensive. Other districts are now beginning to detect suspected cases.",
          "All cases which have been investigated have occurred among unvaccinated persons. The most recent YF vaccination campaign in the area was conducted in 1999 but was limited to a single refugee camp. Most of the refugees who were vaccinated in that exercise have left the area. A nationwide YF vaccination campaign was conducted in 1995, but coverage was reported to be low, leaving much of the population susceptible.",
          "The population in the Grand Cape Mount County lives in small villages or towns of approximately 5-10 000 people. There is a lot of movement across the border with Sierra Leone. The road between Grand Cape Mount County and the capital of Liberia, Monrovia, is in good condition and there is a considerable amount of traffic to and from Monrovia. If YF were introduced in Monrovia there would be 1.5 million people at risk.",
          "In response to the outbreak, the MOH, Liberia, WHO, and health sector non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have agreed to: implement a mass vaccination campaign targeting the 150 000 population immediately at risk. WHO is providing vaccine and autodestruct syringes for this campaign. intensify vaccination and surveillance in the affected communities and other districts not yet known to be affected.",
          "WHO is seeking to mobilize support for YF detection and response activities."

          "The recent report of illness amongst 8 young children in\r\nVladivostock who had played with discarded ampoules of smallpox vaccine has now been\r\nconfirmed by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. Laboratory confirmation of\r\nthe illness in the children is being sought. The report has evoked much public concern. In\r\nsome of the reports, there were misconceptions about the components of the vaccine used to\r\nprevent smallpox, and about why any country might still be retaining stocks of smallpox\r\nvaccine. This note aims to clarify these issues.",
          "1) Smallpox vaccine is not made from smallpox virus.",
          "The vaccine which was used for centuries to vaccinate\r\nagainst smallpox was not made from smallpox, but from vaccinia virus. Vaccinia is a\r\ndifferent virus from the virus which causes smallpox. However, it is a member of the same\r\nfamily of viruses to which the smallpox virus belongs. The smallpox virus is also known as\r\nvariola virus. Mass vaccinations with smallpox vaccine made from vaccinia virus led to the\r\neradication of smallpox announced by WHO in 1980. People vaccinated with smallpox vaccine\r\n(vaccinia) develop reactions to it which range from mild and transient to severe, and very\r\nrarely, fatal.",
          "2) Two countries still keep smallpox virus (variola)\r\nstocks.",
          "Although smallpox disease has been eradicated, two\r\nlaboratories still hold stocks of smallpox virus (variola). These are the WHO\r\nCollaborating Centres in Atlanta, USA and Koltsovo, Russian Federation.",
          "3) Many countries still hold smallpox vaccine (vaccinia)\r\nstocks.",
          "WHO recommends that countries which still have stocks of\r\nsmallpox vaccine (vaccinia) maintain these stocks. This recommendation has been made for\r\ntwo reasons. Firstly, small amounts of vaccine are still needed to vaccinate laboratory\r\npersonnel handling vaccinia virus and other members of this virus family. Some of these\r\nviruses are found in nature and cause illness among animals, and some are used in research\r\nto make new, safer vaccines against a variety of infectious diseases. Secondly, smallpox\r\nvaccine (vaccinia) will also be needed in case of a deliberate or accidental release of\r\nsmallpox virus (variola), which is a very unlikely event but currently of great concern to\r\nsome countries.",
          "For further information on this topic, see the summary of the recent meeting of the WHO\r\nAdvisory Committee on Variola Virus Research, published in the Weekly Epidemiological\r\nRecord.",
          "4) Disposal of biological materials and pharmaceuticals",
          "All biological materials and pharmaceuticals such as\r\nvaccines, drugs and diagnostic specimens should be disposed of safely. Some may require\r\ninactivation before disposal. This can be accomplished by autoclaving or incineration."

The Ministry of Health issued a press\r\nrelease stating that a pork tongue in jelly is suspected to be the origin of the outbreak,\r\non the basis of case-control study data. However, the name of the brand has not yet been\r\nidentified and the Pasteur Institute in Paris is screening Listeria monocytogenes food isolates to detect the epidemic clone.",

From early August 1998 to 6 January 1999, at least 50 cases caused by a rare\r\nstrain of the bacterium L. monocytogenes , serotype 4b, were reported in the United\r\nStates. Six adults died and 2 pregnant women had spontaneous abortions.

In response, WHO and FAO are undertaking\r\nrisk assessments for L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods. In October 2000, the\r\npreliminary report of a Joint FAO/WHO consultation on microbiological risk assessment will\r\nbe delivered to CCFH, which is expected to define more focused questions for further\r\nstudy.

The case was born on 13 June 1998, had onset of paralysis on 12 October, after a day of fever on 11 October. The parents took the boy to a local private clinic in a neighbouring township when a sudden onset of flaccid paralysis made him unable to stand or walk (both of which he had been capable of before). Two stool samples were taken, the first on 14 October and the second on 25 October. They were analyzed in the provincial laboratory. Both samples yielded poliovirus isolates, which were later typed and differentiated as P1 wild viruses at the national laboratory in Beijing. At the time that the second sample was taken five contacts were sampled, one of which, a four year old cousin of the infected child, was also positive for wild poliovirus. The case child was unregistered and had received zero doses of polio vaccine.",
          "The case belongs to the Sala minority group, a Muslim group of Turkic speaking people whose ancestors migrated to Qinghai from the area of Turkmenistan about seven hundred years ago. There are around 80 000 Sala in China, 60 000 in Qinghai Province (nearly all of which live in Xunhua Sala Autonomous County) and nearly all of the remainder in neighbouring Gansu Province. Adult male Sala travel widely as traders and workers, within Qinghai province and outside to other provinces, including Gansu, Sichuan,Xinjiang, and particularly Tibet, even as far as the border area with Nepal.",
          "Neither the case nor the direct family reported a history of travel outside the county in the two months prior to onset. No visit to the family by a traveler from outside the county was reported to occur during the same period. However, the family, including the case, attended a major festival of Sala people in the county capital during the period 25 to 28 September 1999. Up to 30 000 Sala are reported to have attended this gathering.",
          "Despite intensive investigation in the area of the case, including searches of health facilities, no evidence of wide-scale circulation of wild poliovirus has yet been found. Surveillance quality including laboratory proficiency in Qinghai Province and in neighbouring provinces is in general good. Indications are therefore that the virus has been recently imported.",
          "The Ministry of Health of China is actively collaborating with the global laboratory network including CDC Atlanta, NIID Tokyo and the national laboratories in India. Initial sequencing information on the wild poliovirus show a close similarity to viruses recently circulating in India. The virus is significantly different from those that have been circulating in China up to the last case in 1994. Further genomic sequencing work is proceeding.",
          "A combined MOH/WHO/UNICEF/JICA mission visited Qinghai Province from 20-25 December 1999 to review the response to the case. Initial case response immunization has been carried out, achieving high coverage of the target group. Extensive additional activities are planned, including large scale immunization across several provinces, intensified surveillance, retrospective review of hospital records at all levels in several provinces,and active search for cases of acute flaccid paralysis."

          "On 13 January, the National Epidemiology Center (CENEPI), Brazil, reported 3\r\nlaboratory-confirmed cases of yellow fever to WHO. All 3 persons were infected while on\r\nholiday in December in the National Park of Chapada dos Veadeiros, Alta Paraiso, Goias\r\nState, located approximately 250 km north of Brasilia. The park is in a forested area\r\nwhere yellow fever is known to be endemic, thus these cases resulted from sylvatic\r\ntransmission.",
          "Two of the cases were in residents of Brasilia (one fatal case) and 1 case was in Rio\r\nde Janeiro. Because the cases were recognized in non-endemic urban areas where Aedes\r\naegypti mosquitoes are present, immunization programmes and vector control measures\r\nare being carried out in both cities to avoid any potential urban transmission. Adequate\r\nsupplies of yellow fever vaccine are available in Brazil."
