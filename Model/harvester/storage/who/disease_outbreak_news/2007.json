An increasing number of cases of acute watery diarrhoea has also been reported in Diala, a province neighbouring Baghdad. Although V. cholerae has not yet been laboratory confirmed, the clinical symptoms indicate the presence of cholera.

          "The Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is continuing to respond to the on-going outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the Province of Kasai Occidental with the support of a wide range of international partners.",
          "As of today, there has been a total of 17 laboratory-confirmed cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever reported in the Mweka and Luebo health zone, Kasai Occidental Province, along with additional confirmations of other etiologies associated with this outbreak including typhoid and Shigella dysenteriae type 1. The last confirmed case of Ebola died on 22 September in Kampungu MSF isolation ward and was buried safely. Mobile laboratories, installed by specialists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States and the National Public Health Agency of Canada in two of the affected villages are enabling the teams on the ground to conduct rapid and precise diagnosis of new suspected Ebola cases within two to six hours.",
          "Teams on the ground are focusing on breaking the chain of transmission and are continuing to monitor additional suspected cases in isolation facilities and to trace contacts. The national health authorities are putting in place stringent infection control measures in health centres and hospitals in the affected area to minimize the risk of infection among health care workers. Information and training material on infection control is being prepared and disseminated to provincial health authorities across the country in case additional cases are identified beyond the currently affected area.",
          "The local health authorities in the affected area are working closely with social mobilization experts, and communication teams to develop key information messages for the local communities. Journalists are preparing and broadcasting radio sketches on the prevention of Ebola as well as providing communities with information on how to recognize its early symptoms and alert the relevant authorities. It is estimated that up to 60% of the local population is being reached through these radio broadcasts.",
          "The communications teams are also working through local civil society groups including women and youth associations, churches, military units, schools and markets to reach as wide a spectrum of the population as possible. These activities are essential to alert the communities to the risk of transmission while at the same time reducing the panic and fear that are frequently associated with outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fever.",
          "Retrospective investigations of hospital records are under-way to determine the progress the outbreak took in its initial stages and to document the spread of the epidemic in the first few months."

          "Since late August 2007, an outbreak of cholera has spread to 25 districts of Northern Iraq and 4 districts in Southern Iraq and across the centre of the country. It is estimated that more than 30 000 people have fallen ill with acute watery diarrhoea, among which 2 116 were identified as positive for Vibrio cholerae. The case fatality rate is 0.52% and has remained low throughout the outbreak, although it continues to spread across Iraq and dissemination to as yet unaffected areas remains highly possible.",
          "The outbreak was first detected in Kirkuk province, where 68% of laboratory-confirmed cholera cases have so far been reported, and then spread to Sulaymaniah and Erbil provinces. Additional isolated cases of Cholera have also been identified in other parts of the country, including Tikrit (6 cases confirmed), Mosul (2 cases confirmed), Basra (1 case confirmed), Baghdad (2 cases confirmed) and Dahuk (1 case confirmed).",
          "The Government of Iraq has mobilized a multi-sectoral response to the outbreak. Specific control measures have been reinforced and preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission to unaffected areas have been put in place. However, a severe shortage of chlorination products has been noted and replenishment is urgently needed to enable water supplies to be treated to render it safe for human consumption. Provision of safe water is the highest priority in controlling an outbreak of cholera.",
          "WHO continues to support the National and local health authorities in the ongoing response operations. Ten interagency diarrhoeal disease kits, each sufficient to treat 400 moderate and 100 severe cases, arrived in Erbil International airport on 16 September. Rapid diagnostic tests are being pre-positioned in remote health care facilities. In addition, 10% of all positive stool samples are being sent to NAMRU 3 reference laboratory(US Navy Advanced Research Unit) in Cairo for further confirmation and phenotypic characterization.",

Cases of human infection with H5N1 have frequently been linked to the home slaughter and subsequent handling of diseased or dead birds prior to cooking. These practices represent the highest risk to human infection and are the most important to avoid. When handling raw poultry or live or dead birds, it is imperative to disinfect hands and surfaces with soap and water. Consumers also need to be sure that during the cooking process, poultry reaches temperatures of at least 70°C in all parts and that eggs are fully cooked throughout. Detailed recommendations concerning food safety are available here."

          "Viruses with a genetic mutation, linked in laboratory testing to moderately reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir, have been discovered in two persons previously reported with H5N1 infections in Egypt. Both patients had been on treatment with oseltamivir for two days before the clinical samples that yielded the viruses were taken.",
          "The two patients from whom samples were taken were a 16 year-old female and a 26 year-old male from Gharbiyah Province, Egypt. 1 They were a niece and uncle, respectively, who lived in the same house. The girl was admitted to a hospital on 19 December 2006, while the man was admitted on 17 December. On 21 December they began receiving 2 tablets per day of oseltamivir. On 23 December they were moved to a referral hospital. The samples which have so far been tested were taken from the two patients on 23 December. The girl died on 25 December and the man died on 28 December 2006.",
          "In this and all other H5N1 investigations there is close, ongoing coordination between Egypt's Ministry of Health and Population (MOH&P) and WHO. It was Egypt's monitoring and rapid virological analysis conducted at the Central Public Health Laboratory in Cairo that initially allowed the diagnoses of H5N1 to be made. Confirmatory testing and genetic sequencing was done at NAMRU-3 and at two WHO Collaborating Centres located in Atlanta, USA and London, UK.",
          "At this time there is no indication that oseltamivir resistance is widespread in Egypt or elsewhere. WHO is not making any changes in antiviral treatment recommendations for H5N1-infected persons published in June 2006 because the clinical level of resistance of these mutations is not yet well established. Current laboratory testing suggests that the level of reduced susceptibility is moderate. This mutation has previously been identified in Viet Nam in one case in 2005. Moreover, these mutations are not associated with any known change in the transmissibility of the virus between humans. Based on these considerations, the public health implications at this time are limited. Finally, these findings do not indicate a need for a change in phase level. The WHO pandemic preparedness level remains at three.",
          "The Egyptian authorities, WHO and its Collaborating Centres will continue to share with the public all relevant information from the on-going investigations and analyses as soon as it becomes available.",
          "1 The ages and dates in this update related to the two patients, may differ slightly from earlier reports, but reflect the most recent information provided to WHO."
