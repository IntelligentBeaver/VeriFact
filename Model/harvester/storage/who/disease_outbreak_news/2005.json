          "The Ministry of Health of China has confirmed an additional case of human infection on the mainland with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case is a 41-year-old woman from the south-eastern province of Fujian. She developed symptoms of fever followed by pneumonia on 6 December, and was admitted to hospital two days later. The patient died on 21 December.",
          "On 13 December, initial laboratory tests on samples from the patient tested negative for H5N1. But further tests on 23 December – including PCR tests carried out at the Chinese Center for Disease Control in Beijing – showed positive results. The virus was also isolated from the patient.",
          "Close contacts who have been placed under medical observation have not displayed any symptoms, health authorities report.",
          "Agricultural authorities so far have not been able to confirm the presence of the H5 virus subtype in poultry in the vicinity of the patient’s residence or place of work. Investigators have not been able to confirm any direct contact between the patient and poultry prior to the onset of illness. The investigation, however, is continuing and answers to these and other questions are still being sought.",
          "This is China’s seventh laboratory-confirmed human case. Of these cases, three have been fatal (including this latest case). To date, China has reported human cases in six provinces and regions: Hunan, Anhui, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Fujian."

Diagnostic confirmation using antibody tests, though reliable, is thus slower than that achieved using direct tests for virus RNA.",

          "Today, the Angolan Ministry of Health has declared the Marburg haemorrhagic fever outbreak over.",
          "The largest and deadliest outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever on record* In mid-March the Angola Ministry of Health (MOH) along with WHO actively investigated reports of 63 deaths (mostly children and three health care workers) among patients at the Uige Provincial Hospital, Angola. On 21 March, Marburg haemorrhagic fever was identified as the cause of the outbreak by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Following the laboratory confirmation, the MOH asked WHO to mobilize technical assistance and financial aid to help control the outbreak.",
          "The international response to the outbreak in Angola began on 22 March. The team from WHO, included experts from the Inter-country programme for southern Africa, the Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and from Headquarters, and partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). ( see below the list of partners and organizations who worked with the Ministry of Health to control the outbreak ). In addition Médecins sans Frontières (Belgium, France, Holland and Spain) assisted with infection control and established isolation facilities in Uige, Luanda, Songo and Negage hospitals.",
          "The Angolan Government, WHO and other partners, established a surveillance system for identification of suspected cases and follow up of their contacts. Mobile teams were sent to the field to investigate rumours, obtain clinical specimens for laboratory tests, hospitalize suspected patients and monitor their contacts.",
          "A portable field laboratory established by the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory began operating in Uige on 4 April and a second laboratory operated by the US CDC in Luanda became operational on 10 April. Field laboratories provide rapid and sufficiently reliable results for use during an outbreak, when decisions about appropriate case management and contact tracing need to be made quickly.",
          "The disease spread particularly among people exposed to the Marburg virus during home care or at funerals, via contact with body fluids of those who died from the disease. The dangerous use of home-based injections was also identified as a major cause of the outbreak's spread.",
          "Early in the outbreak there was considerable confusion among the local population due to mistrust of the health-care system. Most preferred home-based care given by their traditional healers or family members. Intensive social mobilization campaigns were implemented successfully in the whole province to restore confidence and trust. A key element of the strategy was to include in the team traditional healers, pastors, teachers and community workers and to use a wide variety of communication formats. Guidance from two medical anthropologists, from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, who joined the outbreak control team was also critical for the community compliance with outbreak control measures.",

          "The spread of H5N1 to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur. However, all evidence to date indicates that the H5N1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans. WHO advises countries experiencing outbreaks in poultry to follow certain precautions, particularly during culling operations, and to monitor persons with a possible exposure history for fever or respiratory symptoms. The early symptoms of H5N1 infection mimic those of many other common respiratory illnesses, meaning that false alarms are likely.",
          "The WHO level of pandemic alert remains unchanged at phase 3: a virus new to humans is causing infections, but does not spread easily from one person to another.",
          "WHO continues to recommend that travellers to areas experiencing outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 in poultry should avoid contact with live animal markets and poultry farms. Large amounts of the virus are known to be excreted in the droppings from infected birds. Populations in affected countries are advised to avoid contact with dead migratory birds or wild birds showing signs of disease.",
          "Direct contact with infected poultry, or surfaces and objects contaminated by their droppings, is considered the main route of human infection. Exposure risk is considered highest during slaughter, defeathering, butchering, and preparation of poultry for cooking. There is no evidence that properly cooked poultry or poultry products can be a source of infection.",
          "Countries located along migratory routes need to be vigilant for signs of disease in wild and domestic birds. Recent events make it likely that some migratory birds are now implicated in the direct spread of the H5N1 virus in its highly pathogenic form."

The case, in an 8-year-old boy, was confirmed as positive for H5N1 infection by a WHO reference laboratory in Hong Kong. The boy remains in hospital for observation and treatment. Current investigations in Indonesia have produced no evidence that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person to person.",
          "Background on avian influenza in Indonesia",
          "Since mid-2003, Indonesia has experienced outbreaks of avian influenza in its poultry population. Prior to the new case announced today, two human cases of H5N1 infection in Indonesia have been laboratory confirmed, one in July and another in September. All three cases have been investigated by the Indonesia health authorities, with WHO support, and searches for further cases have been conducted.",
          "As investigations have produced no evidence that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person to person, WHO has not raised its current level of pandemic alert. WHO will, however, continue to monitor the situation closely. Given the experience of other H5N1 affected countries in Asia, the detection of further human cases in Indonesia or elsewhere would not be surprising.",
          "Laboratory confirmation of cases in Indonesia has led to heightened public concern, intensified surveillance for further cases, and strengthened government commitment to contain the disease. As a result, several patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of possible exposure to the avian virus are being evaluated as part of ongoing surveillance efforts. Samples from these patients have also been sent for analysis by the WHO reference laboratory in Hong Kong.",
          "Overall assessment",
          "In all affected countries, most human cases of H5N1 infection have been linked to contact with poultry. In a few instances, limited human-to-human transmission of the virus may have occurred following close contact with a patient during the acute phase of illness. In all known instances, such transmission has been limited and has not led to larger outbreaks in the general community, indicating that the virus does not spread easily among people at this time.",

          "In July 2005, a cluster of 3 deaths in one family was investigated. H5N1 infection was confirmed in the 38-year-old father but laboratory test results for his two daughters did not meet criteria for acute H5N1 infections. WHO reports only laboratory-confirmed cases.",
          "Investigation of the July family cluster was unable to determine the source of exposure. Testing and monitoring of more than 300 close contacts failed to detect any further cases."

Both Russia and Kazakhstan reported outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in late July, and confirmed H5N1 as the causative agent in early August. Deaths in migratory birds, infected with the virus, have also been reported. Outbreaks in both countries have been attributed to contact between domestic birds and wild waterfowl via shared water sources.",
          "These are the first outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza recorded in the two countries. Both countries were previously considered free of the virus.",
          "Since the initial reports, the Russian H5N1 outbreak in poultry, which has remained confined to Siberia, has spread progressively westward to affect 6 administrative regions. In Kazakhstan, several villages bordering the initial outbreak site in Siberia are now known to have experienced disease in poultry. To date, outbreaks in the two countries have involved some large farms as well as small backyard flocks, with close to 120,000 birds dead or destroyed in Russia and more than 9,000 affected in Kazakhstan.",
          "In early August, Mongolia issued an emergency report following the death of 89 migratory birds at two lakes in the northern part of the country. Avian influenza virus type A has been identified as the cause, but the virus strain has not yet been determined. Samples have been shared with WHO reference laboratories and are currently being investigated. Also in early August, an outbreak of H5N1 in poultry was detected in Tibet, China.",
          "In all of these recent outbreaks, authorities have announced control measures in line with FAO and OIE recommendations for highly pathogenic avian influenza. To date, no human cases have been detected, vigilance is high, and rumours are being investigated by local authorities.",
          "The outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan provide evidence that H5N1 viruses have spread beyond their initial focus in south-east Asian countries, where outbreaks are now known to have begun in mid-2003. Despite aggressive control efforts, FAO has warned that the H5N1 virus continues to be detected in many parts of Viet Nam and Indonesia and in some parts of Cambodia, China, Thailand, and possibly also Laos. The south-east Asian outbreaks, which have resulted in the death or destruction of more than 150 million birds, have had severe consequences for agriculture and most especially for the many rural farmers who depend on small backyard flocks for income and food. Human cases, most of which have been linked to direct contact with diseased or dead poultry in rural areas, have been confirmed in four countries: Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia. Only a few instances of limited human-to-human transmission have been recorded. Poultry outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in Japan, Malaysia, and the Republic of Korea were successfully controlled.",
          "WHO fully agrees with FAO and OIE that control of avian influenza infection in wild bird populations is not feasible and should not be attempted. Wild waterfowl have been known for some time to be the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses. Migratory birds can carry these viruses, in their low pathogenic form, over long distances, but do not usually develop signs of illness and only rarely die of the disease. The instances in which highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been detected in migratory birds are likewise rare, and the role of these birds in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza remains poorly understood.",
          "Very large die-offs of migratory birds from avian influenza, such as the one detected at the end of April at Qinghai Lake in central China, in which more than 6,000 birds died, are considered unusual. Research published in July indicates that H5N1 viruses in that outbreak are similar to viruses that have been circulating in south-east Asia for the last two years.",
          "Analyses of viruses from the Russian outbreak, recently published on the OIE website , show apparent similarity to viruses isolated from migratory birds during the Qinghai Lake outbreak. Specimens from the Mongolian outbreak in migratory birds should also prove useful in shedding light on these recent developments. Monitoring the spread and evolution of avian H5N1 viruses in birds and rapidly comparing these results with previously characterized H5N1 viruses is an essential activity for assessing the risk of pandemic influenza.",
          "Implications for human health",
          "The poultry outbreaks in Russia and Kazakhstan are caused by a virus that has repeatedly demonstrated its ability, in outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997, in Hong Kong in 2003, and in south-east Asia since early 2004, to cross the species barrier to infect humans, causing severe disease with high fatality. A similar risk of human cases exists in areas newly affected with H5N1 disease in poultry.",
          "Experience in south-east Asia indicates that human cases of infection are rare, and that the virus does not transmit easily from poultry to humans. To date, the majority of human cases have occurred in rural areas. Most, but not all, human cases have been linked to direct exposure to dead or diseased poultry, notably during slaughtering, defeathering, and food preparation. No cases have been confirmed in poultry workers or cullers. No cases have been linked to the consumption of properly cooked poultry meat or eggs.",
          "Factors relating to poultry densities and farming systems seen in different countries may also influence the risk that human cases will occur. During a 2003 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, caused by the H7N7 strain, in the Netherlands, more than 80 cases of conjunctivitis were detected in poultry workers, cullers, and their close contacts, and one veterinarian died. That event, which was contained following the destruction of around 30 million poultry, underscores the need for newly affected countries to follow FAO/OIE/WHO recommended precautions when undertaking control measures in affected farms.",
          "Pandemic risk assessment",
          "The possible spread of H5N1 avian influenza to poultry in additional countries cannot be ruled out. WHO recommends heightened surveillance for outbreaks in poultry and die-offs in migratory birds, and rapid introduction of containment measures , as recommended by FAO and OIE. Heightened vigilance for cases of respiratory disease in persons with a history of exposure to infected poultry is also recommended in countries with known poultry outbreaks. The provision of clinical specimens and viruses, from humans and animals, to WHO and OIE/FAO reference laboratories allows studies that contribute to the assessment of pandemic risk and helps ensure that work towards vaccine development stays on course.",
          "The expanding geographical presence of the virus is of concern as it creates further opportunities for human exposure. Each additional human case increases opportunities for the virus to improve its transmissibility, through either adaptive mutation or reassortment. The emergence of an H5N1 strain that is readily transmitted among humans would mark the start of a pandemic."

          "Health education to hospital and other health-care workers has been continuing since January 2004, when avian influenza was first reported in Indonesia. The Ministry of Health, working with WHO has carried out seminars and workshops to strengthen surveillance of influenza-like illness, outbreak investigation, and appropriate isolation and barrier nursing. Stockpiling of personal protective equipment to protect health and veterinary workers, and procurement of antivirals for treatment and prophylaxis, as appropriate, is continuing. Information has been provided to assist the community with general health precautions, including frequent hand-washing, avoiding contact with sick animals, and safe and hygienic handling and cooking of poultry."

          "At the request of the Ministry of Health, WHO sent a team of international experts to Viet Nam last week to assess laboratory and epidemiological data on recent cases and determine whether the present level of pandemic alert should be increased. Team members were drawn from institutes in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America having extensive experience in the testing of avian influenza viruses in human clinical specimens.",
          "The team completed its work on Wednesday and submitted its preliminary findings to the government. The team found no laboratory evidence suggesting that human infections are occurring with greater frequency or that the virus is spreading readily among humans. The current level of pandemic alert, which has been in effect since January 2004, remains unchanged.",
          "Some reports now circulating suggest that WHO has downgraded its assessment of the pandemic threat. These reports are unfounded. The experts were specifically asked to search for evidence that could substantiate concerns raised first at a WHO consultation of international experts held at the beginning of May in Manila. That consultation considered suggestive findings, largely based on epidemiological observations, that the H5N1 virus had changed its behaviour in ways consistent with an improved, though not yet efficient, ability to spread directly from one human to another. The specific epidemiological observations considered included milder disease across a broader age spectrum and a growing number of clusters of cases, closely related in time and place.",
          "More recently, testing of clinical specimens by international experts working in Viet Nam provided further suggestive evidence of more widespread infection with the virus, raising the possibility of community-acquired infection. These findings have not been confirmed by the present investigative team.",
          "Firm evidence of improved transmissibility would be grounds for moving to a higher level of pandemic alert. Because of the huge consequences of such a change, WHO is following a cautious approach that combines heightened vigilance for new cases with immediate international verification of any suggestive findings.",
          "Because the detection of H5N1 in clinical specimens is technically challenging and prone to errors, members of the investigative team took sophisticated laboratory equipment with them to Hanoi for on-site testing. Tests were performed using WHO-approved reagents and primers.",
          "While these first results are reassuring, further retesting of clinical specimens will continue over the next few weeks to provide the most reliable possible foundation for risk assessment."

This week, staff from the mobile surveillance teams were able to visit and look for signs of illness in more than half of the 100 persons known to have had close contact with a Marburg patient. New cases are, however, continuing to occur with no known link to a previous case, suggesting that the surveillance system has not yet reached the efficiency needed to interrupt chains of transmission.",

To date, at least two traditional healers have died of Marburg haemorrhagic fever.",

[ Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A/(H5N1) Reported to WHO ]. Numbers for Viet Nam, where the vast majority of recent cases have occurred, have been amended in line with case counts provided by the Ministry of Health during late April and May. Since the third wave of infection began in Viet Nam in mid-December 2004, 49 cases have been reported. Of these cases, 17 were fatal. The most recent case was reported to the ministry on 17 April.",
          "WHO has asked the Ministry of Health in Viet Nam to supplement the numbers with data on individual cases. Rapid field investigation of new cases, especially when these occur in clusters, remains essential to assess possible changes in transmission patterns that could indicate improved pandemic potential of the virus.",
          "Since January 2004, when human cases of H5N1 avian influenza were first reported in the current outbreak, 97 cases and 53 deaths have been reported in Viet Nam, Thailand and Cambodia. Viet Nam, with 76 cases and 37 deaths, has been the most severely affected country, followed by Thailand, with 17 cases and 12 deaths, and Cambodia, with 4 cases and 4 deaths."

The vast majority of cases have occurred in Uige Province, where 326 cases and 300 deaths have been reported. No cases have been reported outside Uige for the past five weeks.",
          "Infrastructures and protocols for controlling the outbreak are in place and functioning well. The isolation unit at Uige’s provincial hospital is being used, infection control in the hospital has improved, and safe burial practices are now being followed. Portable field laboratories continue to provide rapid diagnostic support. A campaign to stop home treatment of patients using unsafe injections has resulted in the collection and safe disposal of a large number of needles and syringes. The campaign, which has been supported by religious and community leaders and volunteers from the local Red Cross, is thought to have raised public awareness of the associated risks considerably.",
          "Support from religious and community leaders has also allowed the work of mobile surveillance teams to run more smoothly, increasing the efficiency of case finding and contact tracing. However, some new cases continue to be linked to exposure in homes and at funerals, indicating that public understanding of the disease still needs to be improved.",
          "As transmission of the virus requires close personal contact with an ill or recently deceased patient, the risk to international travellers to Angola is considered to be very low. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Angola."

          "As of 27 April, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 275 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 255 were fatal. In Uige Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 266 cases, of which 246 have been fatal, were reported as of 28 April.",
          "With all control measures – teams, equipment, and protocols – needed to contain the outbreak now in place, extreme care must be taken to guard against any practices that could again amplify transmission. At this point in the outbreak, an amplification event would be a setback capable of extending the presently intense containment efforts for several weeks. During past outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers, such events have historically resulted in an additional two transmission cycles and a second wave of cases.",
          "Control operations in Uige have experienced some recent setbacks. On two occasions earlier this week, doctors at Uige’s large provincial hospital were directly exposed to blood from Marburg patients being treated on general wards, without adequate infection control. The doctors are under observation. These high-risk exposures should not have occurred.",
          "Such incidents indicate that infection control procedures at the hospital have been seriously compromised. They occurred despite a system put in place, and supported by equipment and training, to safely screen new admissions for exposure history and fever and ensure the separation of possible cases from patients on the general wards.",
          "In another recent incident, the body of a deceased patient was left, uncleaned and uncollected, on an open ward for more than eight hours, placing hospital staff and other patients at risk. In another incident, a severely ill baby admitted to the paediatric ward was placed in a cot, without disinfection, immediately after the body of another baby, who died from the disease, had been removed. In line with cultural practices, mothers are present on the paediatric ward and share the care of severely ill children, thus also sharing the exposure risk.",
          "Under such conditions, amplification of transmission is highly likely to occur. Had safety protocols, set in place by the international team, been followed, none of these incidents would have occurred. Closing of the hospital has been considered but is not a viable option. Such a step would deprive many patients of potentially life-saving care while re-directing others to private clinics, where conditions and practices are even more unsafe and even more likely to result in additional cases.",
          "Yesterday, the Minister of Health, accompanied by a vice-minister and the head of the WHO office in Angola, flew to Uige to investigate the situation, find solutions, and oversee their implementation. The officials have recognized that strong measures will be needed to ensure that patients admitted to the hospital for other conditions are not placed at risk of Marburg infection. The first steps to correct the situation were put in place today, and involve the collaboration of ministry officials, WHO, and Médecins Sans Frontières.",
          "WHO has decided to strengthen the presence in Uige of international staff specialized in infection control. WHO welcomes the direct intervention of ministry officials. This high-level support should help ensure that containment measures, previously set in place and of proven efficacy, are restored and fully adhered to.",
          "Investigation of several recent fatalities in Uige indicates a clear link between home-based treatments using unsafe syringes and spread of the virus. This problem is being addressed urgently. A massive door-to-door campaign, supported by banners and posters throughout Uige municipality, was launched yesterday to inform residents of the associated dangers and collect and safely destroy syringes. The campaign has continued today."

          "22 April 2005",
          "As of 20 April, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 266 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 244 were fatal. In Uige Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 253 cases, of which 233 have been fatal, were reported as of 21 April.",
          "Assessment of the outbreak",
          "The international response to the outbreak in Angola began one month ago, on 22 March. The features of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, and the conditions in Angola, have been an extreme test of international capacity to hold emerging diseases at bay. The outbreak in Angola is the largest and deadliest on record for this rare disease, which is presently showing a case fatality rate higher than 90%. For comparison, outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever have shown mortality rates ranging, according to the virus strain involved, from 53% to 88%. The only other large outbreak of Marburg, in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 1998 through 2000, had a case fatality of 83%.",
          "Two factors make the rapid detection of outbreaks of Marburg haemorrhagic fever difficult: the extreme rarity of this disease and its similarity to other diseases seen in countries where deaths from infectious diseases are common. Neither the source nor the date of the initial cases in Angola can be presently identified with any certainty.",
          "The number of cases began increasing in February and then, more dramatically, in March. On 21 March, Marburg virus was detected in patient samples sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta (USA), and WHO assistance was requested by the Ministry of Health in Angola. The operational response began the following day. As known from extensive experience with outbreaks of other viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, outbreaks of Marburg can be brought to an end using classic public health interventions. In theory, the measures needed to end the Angolan outbreak are few in number and straightforward in nature. Rapid detection and isolation of patients, tracing and management of their close contacts, infection control in hospitals and protective clothing for staff work to interrupt chains of transmission and thus seal off opportunities for further spread.",
          "Such straightforward measures are complicated by the distinct features of this disease. The sudden onset, dramatic symptoms, and rapid deterioration of patients, and the absence of a vaccine and effective treatment, invariably incite great anxiety in affected populations. This anxiety, in turn, can interfere with control operations, especially when communities begin hiding cases and bodies because of suspicions about the safety of hospitals.",
          "In the current outbreak, such suspicions are understandable. Very few patients with laboratory-confirmed Marburg haemorrhagic fever have survived; most hospitalized patients have died within a day or two following admission. For affected communities, staff from the mobile teams, fully suited in protective gear, are seen as taking away relatives and loved ones who may never again be seen alive.",
          "WHO staff in Uige have today reported further signs that community attitudes are improving, though hostility towards the mobile teams remains of concern in one area known to have recent cases and deaths. Efforts to sensitize affected communities are continuing, with local volunteers supported by Portuguese-speaking experts from Brazil and Mozambique.",
          "Conditions in Angola – a country weakened by almost three decades of civil unrest – have presented additional challenges. Supplies of water and electricity are intermittent, also in health care facilities. Weakened infrastructures, including those for communications and transportation, are another problem. Yesterday, the WHO office in Uige was informed of a death in another municipality, but was unable to collect the body for safe burial because of poor road conditions.",
          "Fortunately, spread of the disease beyond Uige Province, located in the interior of the country, has been limited. Of the 266 cases and 244 deaths, 197 cases and 183 deaths occurred in Uige municipality. Other municipalities in Uige Province account for an additional 56 cases and 50 deaths.",
          "WHO believes that the risk of international spread is low. No foreign nationals, with the exception of those involved in the direct care of patients, have been infected. There is no evidence that people can spread the virus before the onset of symptoms. Shortly after symptom onset, patients become rapidly and visibly very ill",
          "WHO is optimistic that the outbreak can be controlled if present activities continue with sufficient vigour. All the essential containment measures are being applied with extensive international support, including more than 60 international staff drawn from institutions in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and the cooperation of national authorities and experts.",
          "Tools and methods developed during international responses to outbreaks of other diseases have all been brought to bear on the present outbreak, and the success of this collaborative effort has surpassed initial expectations. Needs, which have ranged from satellite telephones and hand-held radio sets to vehicles, protective equipment, disinfectants, and specialized staff, have been rapidly communicated and immediately met.",
          "WHO and its partners are nonetheless prepared and organized to continue the outbreak response for several additional months, if this is needed. An important present goal is to transfer skills and responsibilities for outbreak response to national staff, and training efforts are under way with this goal in mind."

          "As of 12 April, 235 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these cases, 215 have died.",
          "Uige Province remains the most severely affected area, reporting a cumulative total of 208 cases and 194 deaths. The isolation ward at the province’s large 400-bed hospital, which has been specially equipped and staffed for the care of Marburg patients, is empty, despite the fact that cases and deaths are known to be occurring in the community. It is apparent that, for the time being, the community does not accept the concept of isolation. Residents are unwilling to report suspected cases and allow these people to be managed under conditions that reduce the risk of further transmission.",
          "Measures such as patient isolation and infection control that reduce opportunities for further transmission are the principal tools for bringing the outbreak under control. Given the urgency of the situation, WHO may temporarily introduce, as an emergency measure, a harm reduction strategy aimed at making a dangerous situation somewhat better. Family members and other caregivers who refuse to allow patients to be cared for in the isolation facility are being informed of ways to protect themselves from infection and given appropriate supplies. WHO has placed urgent orders for disinfectants, which are currently in short supply in Angola.",
          "Today, international staff drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network began training sessions for staff at the provincial hospital in the use of equipment and supplies to reduce the risk of infection in the health care setting. This training, which has been very well received, will continue through Saturday. Fever-screening units are being established to ensure that all persons admitted to hospital are initially screened for symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever before being admitted to the general hospital wards.",
          "Apart from continuing security concerns, another pressing problem is poor access to remote communities in Uige Province and correspondingly poor surveillance for cases in these areas. With the assistance of a military helicopter, international staff have begun pre-positioning supplies and equipment needed for outbreak control in these areas so that a response can be launched immediately should cases begin to occur.",
          "In a tragic development, four Red Cross volunteers, freshly trained in social mobilization, were killed today by lightning while on their way to work. Support from Red Cross volunteers has been instrumental in controlling large outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever. WHO recognizes the importance of this support and deeply regrets the death of these volunteers."

          "As of 11 April, 231 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these cases, 210 have died. Uige Province, with 202 cases and 190 deaths, remains the most severely affected area.",
          "The present outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever is unprecedented in its size and urban nature, and its dimensions are still unfolding. Although surveillance to detect cases has improved, it remains patchy. In Uige, where daily mobile teams are active, surveillance continues to be largely concentrated on the investigation of deaths and collection of bodies. The security of teams remains a concern. More vehicles are needed and WHO is making the necessary arrangements on an urgent basis.",
          "To bring the outbreak under control, the detection and isolation of patients needs to be much earlier, but this will not happen until the public understands the disease and the high risks associated with treating patients in homes. Infection control needs to improve in heath care settings, and WHO is continuing to supply effective personal protective equipment, for both national and international staff, adapted to conditions in African countries.",
          "A welcome development is the decision by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to strengthen its presence in Uige. Volunteers from these societies are part of a group of workers mobilized to conduct a door-to-door public information and education campaign in collaboration with community and church leaders and traditional healers. Today, workers received specialized training from experts in social mobilization and medical anthropology drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. These workers have been rapidly deployed to deliver public talks at markets and schools.",
          "The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has extensive experience in responding to emergencies in Africa and has been instrumental in bringing large outbreaks of Ebola under control. Because of this experience, workers from the Federation are usually viewed by communities as welcome help. WHO anticipates that this added and welcome support to response activities will help create greater acceptance of control measures and reduce high-risk behaviours.",
          "Advice for travellers",
          "All currently available data indicate that casual contact plays no role in the spread of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Transmission requires extremely close contact involving exposure to blood or other bodily fluids from a patient who will most likely be showing visible signs of illness. The disease can also be transmitted following exposure to items, including bedding and clothing, recently contaminated by a patient.",
          "In addition, transmission can occur in hospitals lacking adequate equipment and supplies for infection control and training in their proper use. The hospital system in Angola has suffered from almost three decades of civil unrest, and several cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have occurred in health care staff exposed during the treatment of patients in Uige.",
          "To date, WHO is not aware of any cases of Marburg that have occurred in foreign nationals other than those involved in the care of cases in Uige.",
          "WHO does not recommend restrictions on travel to any destination within Angola, but does advise some precautions. Travellers to Angola should be aware of the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and of the need to avoid close contact with ill persons. Persons with existing medical conditions who might require hospitalization should consider deferring non-essential travel to Angola, particularly to Uige Province.",
          "Those travelling to Angola for the purpose of working in health care settings should be fully informed regarding the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, equipped with effective personal protective equipment, and trained in the procedures to prevent transmission in such settings.",
          "Travellers leaving Angola should be advised to seek medical attention should any illness with fever develop within 10 days of their departure. Information about recent travel to Angola should be included when symptoms are reported.",
          "Health care workers and health authorities in countries neighbouring Angola should be aware of the symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and maintain vigilance for cases. Countries having close ties with Angola, necessitating frequent travel there by their citizens, may want to consider the introduction of measures to increase vigilance for potential symptoms in persons returning from Angola. In some cases, the introduction of screening procedures to identify potentially infected persons may be considered.",
          "WHO recommends that travellers with a clear exposure history be treated as contacts and placed under surveillance for 21 days, during which time their temperature should be monitored daily."

Poultry deaths occurred in this village in February, but no poultry deaths occurred in the two weeks prior to the girl’s onset of symptoms. Human-to-human transmission as a source of the girl’s infection appears unlikely, as none of her known contacts were sick with similar symptoms before she became ill. Investigations as to the source of the girl’s infection are continuing.",

Campaigns have benefited from support by the provincial governor and officials from the health department, who have made personal visits to affected communities. Religious leaders are also helping to sensitize the public.",
          "Some improvements are already apparent. More alerts to suspected cases and deaths are being reported directly by residents. Some 360 contacts are being followed up by the teams in Uige, but more improvements are needed to detect cases earlier, ensure their isolation and supportive care, and find and manage contacts.",
          "WHO is concerned that deaths are continuing to occur within the community, as care of patients by family members without adequate protective equipment greatly increases the risk of further transmission. Staff at Uige’s large provincial hospital also need training and equipment to reduce the risk that routine surgical and laboratory procedures might endanger staff and other patients.",
          "An isolation ward, dedicated to the care of Marburg haemorrhagic fever patients, has been established at this hospital by Médecins sans Frontières. Concern arises from the risk that persons infected with the virus might be admitted for another suspected illness and undergo testing or treatment procedures without adequate precautions.",

Moreover, because the disease has no cure, hospitalization is not associated with a favourable outcome, and confidence in the medical care system has been eroded.",
          "WHO is familiar with such reactions, which have been seen during previous outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Two medical anthropologists are already in Uige and will be joined shortly by experts in social mobilization from Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mozambique. Public compliance with control measures is not expected to improve in the absence of intense campaigns to educate the public about the disease.",
          "In African countries, the single most important factor in controlling viral haemorrhagic fevers is the engagement of affected communities as partners in control. To achieve this engagement, local belief systems about the causes of disease and traditional rituals for mourning the dead must be respected. When the public understands and accepts a few simple messages – avoid contact with blood and other fluids when caring for the ill, don’t touch bodies of the deceased – transmission within the community can be stopped and the outbreak brought under control.",
          "International appeal",
          "Specialized international staff and equipment have been deployed rapidly and measures are beginning to have an impact. Control of the outbreak will require intensified and sustained technical support from multidisciplinary teams, and additional materials and supplies. Provision of adequate personal protective equipment is a particularly urgent need. Increased field coordination of technical, operational and logistic support is likewise needed.",

To reduce the risk of transmission in health care facilities, priorities include the provision of personal protective equipment for front-line staff and essential supplies for infection control, including disinfectants.

Within this network, laboratories in Canada, Germany, South Africa, and the USA are providing diagnostic support for the Angolan outbreak. All have experience in working with Marburg virus.",

To ensure accurate tracking of the outbreak, members of the network are also standardizing methods for sample collection, testing, and the interpretation of results. The various diagnostic tests for Marburg haemorrhagic fever require skilled technical interpretation, as findings can vary according to the phase of the patient’s illness, the way in which samples were taken, and the type of test used.",
          "In Angola, a portable field laboratory is now operating in Uige and a second one should be operational in Luanda shortly. Field laboratories provide rapid and sufficiently reliable results for use during an outbreak, when decisions about appropriate case management and contact tracing need to be made quickly. The laboratory network is providing backup support for situations in which exceptionally precise diagnostic results are important because of the implications for control measures. Such situations include the possible exportation of a case to another country, and a suspected case in a person who may have placed numerous other people at unusually high risk.",
          "Sophisticated laboratory studies of the virus may help shed some light on certain unusual features of the outbreak, including the high fatality rate and the overwhelming concentration of initial cases in children under the age of five years. In this regard, comparisons of the virus with strains from previous outbreaks may be instructive.",
          "A longer-term objective, whose achievement has long proved elusive, is to determine where Marburg virus hides in nature between outbreaks. Studies of viruses from Angola may offer some clues.

          "6 April 2005",
          "As of 5 April, the Angolan Ministry of Health has reported 181 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these, 156 have died. Cases have now been reported from five provinces. Uige remains the epicentre of the outbreak. While children under the age of 5 years initially accounted for around 75% of cases, recent cases are including an increasing number of adults.",
          "One person is currently under investigation for Marburg haemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
          "Assessment of the outbreak",
          "WHO is concerned about the further evolution of the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola, and this concern is fully shared by the government. Following confirmation of Marburg virus as the causative agent, on 21 March, WHO sent its senior epidemiologists to Uige to assess the situation and organize an initial emergency response. That assessment prompted a rapid and massive augmentation of support in the form of international teams of specialized staff, presently in Uige and Luanda, and several shipments of supplies. Staff have been drawn from WHO and its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). Equipment to strengthen local diagnostic and communication capacity is also now in place.",
          "This escalation of support is continuing, with the government making great efforts to facilitate the rapid influx of staff and supplies and set up the basic infrastructure for a sustained emergency response.",
          "WHO has acquired extensive experience in the successful control of viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, a closely-related disease that is clinically almost identical. Based on this experience, WHO remains confident that the outbreak can be brought under control. At the same time, however, the implementation of effective control measures faces several significant challenges, some of which may be unique to this outbreak.",
          "Marburg haemorrhagic fever is an extremely rare disease that remains poorly understood. Information on the behaviour of Marburg virus once it enters a human population is sparse. As detailed in a fact sheet recently issued by WHO, the outbreak in Angola is one of only two large outbreaks of this disease that have occurred in indigenous African populations since the virus was first detected in 1967. The only other large outbreak, which began in late 1998 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was confined to two sparsely populated villages in an isolated corner of the country, caused sporadic cases with small chains of transmission over two years, and never reached the intensity of transmission seen in just the past few weeks in Angola. The outbreak in Angola is not only the largest on record, with the highest fatality, but is also the first to occur in an urban setting.",
          "Almost three decades of civil unrest have left Angola with a severely weakened health infrastructure, a hospital system in dire need of basic equipment and supplies, inadequate communication and transportation systems, and a population weakened by economic hardship. These weaknesses hamper containment efforts, which depend on active surveillance for cases, rapid detection and isolation in specially designated and equipped facilities, and rapid tracing of contacts.",
          "Based on experiences with Ebola, control measures can have an immediate impact by interrupting chains of transmission. The eventual success of such measures depends on their sustained application, supported by efficient surveillance, and requires very good communication and transportation systems. Such systems are not presently available in Angola and cannot be established quickly. As another consequence of the country’s recent history, hundreds of thousands of landmines are thought to remain in the country, making transportation by rail and road precarious and necessitating air transport of staff and equipment.",
          "Intensified surveillance in Uige over the past few days has determined that some patients are not being hospitalized and are dying within the community, creating an urgent need to organize services for the safe collection and burial of deceased persons.",
          "Cases in health care workers point to the need to greatly increase supplies of protective equipment for front-line workers, particularly in hard-hit Uige and densely populated Luanda. WHO has arranged three shipments of this equipment to date; more shipments are on their way. Personal protective equipment is also being supplied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Médecins sans Frontières, and UNICEF. Nonetheless, supplies still fall short of the need. The symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, and its rapid fatality in the majority of cases, can cause great anxiety in affected populations. This anxiety increases the risk that people in affected areas may flee to other areas, thus fanning wider spread. Moreover, control measures are socially disruptive and may further increase public unease. In Uige, there is some evidence of a reluctance to seek treatment or remain under care in hospitals. Efforts are urgently needed to strengthen the hospital system, restore public confidence, and thus improve compliance with control measures.",
          "Numerous alerts are now being received each day, and teams from the Ministry of Health and WHO are being rapidly deployed to conduct investigations. Outcomes are reported daily by radio, and information about the evolution of the outbreak is improving.",
          "The incubation period of this disease, which can be as short as 3 days, necessitates rapid and efficient contact tracing, and this has been made a priority. Good tracing and management of contacts helps to ensure that possible cases are isolated prior to the onset of symptoms, when the risk of transmission to others is highest. Other current priorities include the protection of front-line staff, strengthening of infection control in designated isolation wards, improved transportation of suspected cases to these wards, and public education to encourage protective behaviours and improve compliance with control measures.",
          "In addition to these fundamental tasks, a top priority at present is to prevent the virus from establishing a foothold in densely populated urban or peri-urban parts of the country. For example, Uige, which is presently the epicentre of the outbreak, has around 500,000 inhabitants, but Luanda, where some cases have been reported, has a population close to 3 million. Response capacity in Luanda is being strengthened by the Ministry of Health, and WHO is increasing the number of international staff there as a support.",
          "International collaboration",
          "Over the past two weeks, WHO has provided support to the Ministry of Health from Headquarters, the Regional Office for Africa, and Country Offices in Angola and in Mozambique.",

          "The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed three additional cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. The cases concern a 5-year-old boy from the central province of Quang Binh, a 17-year-old girl from the northern province of Nam Dinh, and a 40-year-old woman from the northern province of Quang Ninh. The 17-year-old girl has died.",
          "An earlier case has also been confirmed. These recently confirmed cases bring the total in Viet Nam since mid-December to 28.",
          "WHO is aware of reports of suspected H5 avian influenza infection in five members of a family who are presently hospitalized in the northern port city of Haiphong. These cases, which include the parents and their three young daughters, are undergoing further investigation following initial tests indicating infection with the H5 subtype of avian influenza. Reports indicate outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry in the vicinity. Field investigation of this family cluster is under way.",
          "The current outbreak of human cases in Viet Nam has included several clusters, mostly in family members, of cases closely related in time and place. Thorough investigation of all such clusters is essential to determine possible changes in the behaviour of the virus and thus support assessment of the risk of an influenza pandemic.",
          "There is currently no evidence that the H5N1 virus is spreading easily from person to person. Rapid sharing with WHO of viruses from recent clusters of cases has become increasingly important. Analysis can determine whether any significant changes in the virus have taken place and provide further support for risk assessment.",
          "Several media reports have recently covered rumours of a large outbreak of influenza-like illness in Quang Binh Province. The outbreak is presently under investigation by provincial and central health authorities. Samples have been taken for testing, and WHO is awaiting the results. The number of cases with influenza-like illness appears much smaller than initially reported by the media.",
          "Cambodia",
          "The Ministry of Health in Cambodia has today confirmed the country’s second human case of avian influenza.",
          "The 28-year-old man, from Kampot Province, developed symptoms on 17 March and was hospitalized in Phnom Penh on 21 March. He died on 22 March. The same day, laboratory tests by the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh confirmed that the man was infected with H5 avian influenza virus. The Cambodian government immediately launched an investigation to search for possible additional cases and identify possible sources of exposure to the virus. The investigation team, which is continuing its work in Kampot Province, includes Cambodian Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agricultural officials joined by staff from the WHO country office and the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh. FAO is assisting the investigation of animal disease. Numerous deaths among chickens in the area have been reported and samples taken from sick chickens have tested positive for avian influenza. The results from the investigation indicate the deceased man had contact with sick poultry. An 18 year-old boy initially identified as an additional suspected case has tested negative for the avian influenza virus. Samples taken from twenty seven other people, including family contacts of the confirmed case and Phnom Penh medical staff involved in his care, have all tested negative for H5 avian influenza infection. Results from a further six people from Kampot Province have also tested negative for H5 influenza virus.",
          "Cambodia’s previous case, a 25-year-old woman who died in late January, was also from Kampot Province but lived in another district.",
          "The majority of poultry in Cambodia are raised in small backyard flocks in rural areas, making surveillance for outbreaks especially challenging. A campaign to educate rural populations about the dangers of contact with dead or diseased poultry is being undertaken by the government, with support from WHO."

          "Laboratory tests have identified Marburg virus as the causative agent in an outbreak of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in Angola. Virus was detected 21 March in samples from nine of twelve fatal cases.",
          "Retrospective analysis has now identified 102 cases in the outbreak, which dates back to October 2004. Of these cases, 95 have been fatal.",
          "Most cases are presently concentrated in Uige Province in the northern part of the country (see map below).",
          "Since the start of the outbreak, the monthly number of cases has progressively increased, but this increase could be the result of intensified surveillance. Around 75% of cases have occurred in children under the age of 5 years. Cases in adults include a small number of health care workers.",
          "Marburg virus disease has no vaccine or curative treatment, and can be rapidly fatal. In the present outbreak, most deaths have occurred between 3 to 7 days following the onset of symptoms.",
          "Past outbreaks indicate that close contact with bodily fluids of infected people, as may occur in health care settings or during burial practices, increases the risk of infection.",
          "WHO is supporting efforts by the Ministry of Health in Angola to strengthen infection control in hospitals, to intensify case detection and contact tracing, and to improve public understanding of the disease and its modes of transmission.",
          "Background",
          "Marburg virus disease is an acute febrile illness accompanied by severe haemorrhagic manifestations. The disease has an incubation period of 3 to 9 days. In the earliest stage of infection, symptoms are non-specific and may be easily confused with more common diseases, including malaria, yellow fever, and typhoid fever. A severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting are early symptoms, as are severe chest and lung pains, sore throat, and cough. A high proportion of cases develop severe haemorrhagic manifestations between days 5 and 7, most frequently affecting the gastrointestinal tract and the lungs. A characteristic rash usually appears at this time, sometimes involving the whole body.",
          "The disease was first identified in 1967 during simultaneous outbreaks affecting laboratory workers in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany and in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The outbreaks, which involved 31 cases and seven deaths, were subsequently linked to contact with infected monkeys imported from Uganda.",
          "The virus then disappeared until February 1975, when an acutely ill man with a recent travel history to Zimbabwe was admitted to a hospital in South Africa. Infection spread from the man to his travelling companion and a nurse at the hospital. The man died, but the other two cases recovered.",
          "In 1980, two cases, one of which was fatal, occurred in Kenya. In 1987, an additional single case, which was fatal, occurred in Kenya.",
          "The largest outbreak on record, which occurred from late 1998 to late 2000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, involved 149 cases, of which 123 were fatal. The outbreak was initially concentrated in workers at a gold mine in Durba.",
          "Marburg virus disease occurs very rarely and appears to be geographically confined to a small number of countries in the southern part of the African continent. When cases do occur, the disease has epidemic potential, as it can spread from person to person, most often during the care of patients. For this reason, strict measures for infection control need to be applied during the management of cases. Containment of an outbreak of Marburg virus disease also requires the rapid tracing and isolation of contacts. Health education is needed to inform communities of the risks associated with traditional burial practices.",
          {
            "text": "Despite intensive investigations extending over several years, research has failed to find an animal reservoir of the virus or determine where it hides in nature between outbreaks.",

          "26 January 2005",
          "The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today reported two further laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza in Viet Nam.",
          "The first newly reported case is a 35-year-old woman from the southern province of Dong Thap. She developed symptoms on 14 January, was admitted to hospital on 20 January, and died the following day.",
          "The second newly reported case is a 17-year-old boy from the southern province of Bac Lieu. He was hospitalized on 10 January and died on 14 January.",
          "These additional cases bring the total in Viet Nam since mid-December to ten. Nine of these cases were fatal.",
          "The recent family cluster in northern Viet Nam As announced previously, a family cluster in northern Viet Nam has been the focus of intense investigation. The cluster involves three brothers. Of these, Vietnamese authorities have identified influenza A H5 infection in two: a 46-year-old man and his 42-year old brother. The older brother developed symptoms on 26 December and died on 9 January. The younger brother was hospitalized with respiratory symptoms on 12 January and has now fully recovered. He is known to have provided bedside care for his older brother during a period of critical illness.",
          "The source of infection for the two brothers remains undetermined and investigations are ongoing. The third brother, aged 36 years, was hospitalized for observation only, did not develop symptoms, and remains in good health. Results of tests, conducted as part of the investigation, are pending. Clinical specimens for the two confirmed cases are being sent to a WHO collaborating centre for further characterization.",
          "Surveillance for further cases among health care workers, other family members, and residents in both communities where the brothers lived has so far found no evidence of additional cases. If limited human-to-human transmission has occurred, all evidence at this stage suggests that the chain of transmission ended after a single person was infected.",
          "Preventing transmission during care by family members",
          "Further sporadic human cases and occasional family clusters can be expected considering the current spread of outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in some Asian countries. Experience to date indicates that possible human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly during prolonged close contact of a family member with a patient who was critically ill. WHO has issued guidance on the precautions that can be taken in health care facilities to minimize opportunities for transmission of H5N1 infection from patients to close contacts, including health care workers and family members.",
          "Rapid detection and investigation of clusters of H5N1 cases, closely related in time and place, are key surveillance activities that can provide an early alert to possible changes in the transmissibility of the virus."

          "Laboratory results have confirmed avian influenza infection (H5 virus subtype) in two brothers in the northern part of Viet Nam. The first case, a 46-year-old resident of Thai Binh Province, developed symptoms on 1 January. He died on 9 January.",
          "Avian influenza – situation in Viet Nam – update 4",
          "His 42-year-old brother, a resident of Hanoi, developed symptoms on 10 January, nine days after his brother fell ill. He remains hospitalized in Hanoi and is recovering. He is known to have provided bedside care for his brother, who was treated at the same hospital in Hanoi. The investigation surrounding the new cases is considering two hypotheses.",
          "The first one includes the possibility that the 42-year-old man may have acquired his infection directly from his brother. All evidence to date suggests that isolated instances of limited, unsustained human-to-human transmission can be expected from avian influenza viruses in humans.",
          "Their occurrence does not call for any change in the present level of pandemic alert. Intensified surveillance for respiratory symptoms in close contacts of the two men has been initiated in both Thai Binh Province and Hanoi and it is reassuring that no cases of respiratory illness have so far been detected among these people.",
          "Health authorities in Viet Nam have launched an immediate investigation of the source of infection in the two brothers. WHO staff in that country are being kept closely informed.",
          "The second hypothesis is focusing on a possible direct source of poultry-to-human transmission. Preliminary findings point to a family meal in which a dish containing raw duck blood and raw organs was served.",
          "Public health officials in Viet Nam have repeatedly advised against the consumption of dishes made with fresh duck blood or with raw or inadequately cooked poultry products. As a precautionary measure, similar culinary practices involving dishes containing raw poultry parts or organs should be avoided in all countries experiencing outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry.",
          "To date, most human cases linked to contact with poultry are thought to have acquired their infection following exposure to dead or diseased birds around households. Evidence suggests that particularly risky exposure occurs during the slaughter, defeathering, and preparation of poultry for cooking.",
          "Proper cooking destroys the H5N1 virus. In general, WHO recommends that poultry should be cooked until all parts reach an internal temperature of 70 o C. No cases of H5N1 infection have been linked to the consumption of thoroughly cooked poultry and egg products.",
          "Avian influenza: food safety issues",
          "Media reports that a third 35-year-old brother has been hospitalized have not been confirmed.",
          "These latest two cases bring the total in Viet Nam since mid-December 2004 to eight. Of these, seven have died. The 18-year-old woman from Tien Giang Province, announced previously, died on 19 January.",

The level of pandemic risk depends on how widespread H5N1 is in domestic poultry, how often the virus is transmitted to humans, and the concurrent circulation of human influenza viruses. Areas with the highest prevalence of avian influenza were not directly affected by the tsunami, thus there is no inherent increased risk of the emergence of the pandemic strain due to the tsunami itself. However, any activity that spreads avian influenza increases the possibility of the emergence of a pandemic virus. The risk of importing avian influenza into areas affected by the tsunami can be minimized by controlling the movement of poultry from areas where outbreaks of avian influenza have occurred. It is also important to ensure that infected poultry are kept out of the food chain, including emergency food relief activities."
