Antananarivo, the capital and largest city in Madagascar, has also been affected with 2 recorded cases of plague, including 1 death. There is now a risk of a rapid spread of the disease due to the city’s high population density and the weakness of the healthcare system. The situation is further complicated by the high level of resistance to deltamethrin (an insecticide used to control fleas) that has been observed in the country.",
          "The national task force has been activated to manage the outbreak. With support from partners – including WHO, the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, the “Commune urbaine d’Antananarivo” and the Red Cross – the government of Madagascar has put in place effective strategies to control the outbreak. Thanks to financial assistance from the African Development Bank, a 200,000 US dollars response project has been developed. WHO is providing technical expertise and human resources support. Measures for the control and prevention of plague are being thoroughly implemented in the affected districts. Personal protective equipment, insecticides, spray materials and antibiotics have been made available in those areas.",
          "Plague is a bacterial disease caused by Yersinia pestis, which primarily affects wild rodents. It is spread from one rodent to another by fleas. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which produces the characteristic plague bubo (a swelling of the lymph node). If the bacteria reach the lungs, the patient develops pneumonia (pneumonic plague), which is then transmissible from person to person through infected droplets spread by coughing. If diagnosed early, bubonic plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Pneumonic plague, on the other hand, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases; patients can die 24 hours after infection. The mortality rate depends on how soon treatment is started, but is always very high.",
          "WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. In urban areas, such as Antananarivo, the surveillance of epidemic risk indicators is highly recommended for the implementation of preventive vector control activities."

          "South Sudan",
          "In South Sudan, 2 cases due to cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) have been confirmed. The strains were isolated from 2 acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in Unity state, with onset of paralysis on 9 September and 12 September 2014, respectively. In Unity state, as many as 33% of children remain under-immunized against poliovirus. Both cases are from an internally-displaced persons camp in Unity state. Unity state has been affected by civil unrest, leading to population displacements and declining vaccination coverage in most of the areas.",
          "In 2014, South Sudan has been participating in regional Horn of Africa outbreak response, given the risk posed by an ongoing wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) outbreak affecting the region (with cases in 2014 in parts of Somalia and Ethiopia). Two National Immunization Days (NIDs) were conducted in April (with trivalent oral polio vaccine – OPV) and May (with bivalent OPV). In response to confirmation of the cVDPV2, NIDs were held on 4 November with trivalent OPV and further Subnational Immunization Days (SNID) covering the 3 states with civil unrest (Unity, Upper Nile and Jonglei) are planned for 2 December 2014 and January 2015 with trivalent OPV. The objective is to rapidly stop the cVDPV2 in the internally-displaced persons camp and prevent further spread, while further boosting immunity to type 1 polio and minimize risk of re-infection from other parts of the Horn of Africa.",
          "Madagascar",
          "In Madagascar, cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) has been confirmed after the virus was isolated from 1 case of AFP (onset of paralysis on 29 September 2014) and 3 healthy contacts. The most recent supplementary immunization activities in Madagascar were conducted in December 2011/January 2012. SNIDs are planned for December, with NIDs to be held in January 2015. An estimated more than 25% of children remain under-immunized against poliovirus in the country. Madagascar was previously affected by a cVDPV2 outbreak in 2001/2002 (resulting in 5 cases) and in 2005 (resulting in 5 cases). A VDPV was also isolated during a research study among healthy children in Toliara I in 2011. Concerted outbreak response each time rapidly stopped those events. However, repeated emergence of separate cVDPV events underscores the risk of these events occurring in populations which are not fully immunized and of the importance of maintaining high levels of vaccination coverage.",
          "Circulating VDPVs are rare but well-documented strains of poliovirus which can emerge in some populations which are inadequately immunized. Due to the small risk of cVDPVs, use of OPV must be stopped to secure a lasting polio-free world. OPV will be withdrawn in a phased manner, beginning with the removal of type 2-containing OPV. The type 2 component contained in trivalent OPV accounts for 90% of all cVDPV cases.",
          "In South Sudan, given that the cases detected are in an internally-displaced persons camp which can be accessed for vaccination, the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of international spread of the cVDPV2 from South Sudan to be low. However, the risk of international spread would increase if other areas are infected by the cVDPV2. With regard to Madagascar, given the history associated with previous cVDPVs, WHO assesses the risk of international spread from Madagascar to be low.",
          "It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.",
          "WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel."

As of 16 September 2014, 130 laboratory-confirmed cases of EV-D68 have been reported in 12 US states – Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. Investigations into suspected clusters in many other states are ongoing.",
          "EV-D68 is identified using molecular techniques at a limited number of laboratories in the USA. Enterovirus infections, including EV-D68, are not nationally notifiable, but laboratory detections of enterovirus and parechovirus types are reported voluntarily to the National Enterovirus Surveillance System, which is managed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
          "Currently, there are no available vaccines or specific treatments for EV-D68 and clinical care is supportive. Symptoms of EV-D68 may include fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough, and body and muscle aches. Individuals with pre-existing conditions, such as asthma or other respiratory diseases, may be especially prone to severe infections from EV-D68 and may experience difficulty breathing or have wheezing."

Genetic sequencing of these latest isolated viruses confirms continued wild poliovirus circulation, gaps in surveillance resulting in undetected transmission and geographic expansion to new areas of the country.",
          "The outbreak in Cameroon has been ongoing since at least October 2013. The outbreak continued into 2014, with international spread to Equatorial Guinea. In March 2014, WHO elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high, due to expanding circulation and influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic (CAR). This risk assessment remains in place. Further undetected circulation in Cameroon cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the risk of virus spreading into CAR is considered to be particularly high given the large-scale population movements from CAR into Cameroon.",
          "In May 2014, the Director-General of WHO declared the international spread of wild poliovirus to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), under the International Health Regulations. Cameroon is one of the countries that meets the criteria for ‘states currently exporting wild poliovirus’ and was therefore recommended to implement extraordinary measures to mitigate the risk of further international spread.",
          "Cameroon has conducted seven nationwide supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in 2014. The next subnational SIAs are planned for 23-26 August and 4-7 September in 2 regions (East and Adamaoua ) of the country, aiming to reach children aged less than ten years, and all age groups in formal and informal refugee camps. On 22 August, CAR started a series of five sub-national polio immunization activities that will cover the western half of the country and which will end with the September synchronized round covering the central block countries of the African region.",
          "Outbreak response quality to date in Cameroon has varied by geographic area. The confirmation of new cases and undetected, geographically-expanded spread of transmission, has resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.",
          "It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.",

At this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.",
          "Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. There has been no evidence of sustained human to human transmission, therefore the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low.",
          "WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.",

As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.",
          "WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions."

At this time, it is believed that the outbreak in DRC is unrelated to the ongoing outbreak in west Africa.",

Currently, some companies have taken the decision to suspend services to the affected countries. This includes airlines and shipping companies. As a result of these decisions, countries are beginning to experience supply shortages, including fuel, food, and basic supplies. WHO is working with the UN World Food Programme to ensure adequate food and supplies, but calls on companies to make business decisions based on scientific evidence with regard to the transmission of Ebola virus.",
          "In the current outbreak, the majority of Ebola virus disease cases are a result of human-to-human transmission and failure to apply appropriate infection prevention and control measures in home care, some clinical settings, and in burial rituals. It is important to understand that EVD is not an airborne disease. Individuals may become infected as a result of contact with the bodily fluids (vomit, diarrhoea, sputum, blood, etc.) from persons who are confirmed to have EVD or who have died from EVD. Companies bringing goods and services to the affected countries are at low risk for exposure to EVD and WHO, under the International Health Regulations, encourages companies and organizations to continue providing these necessary supplies.",

Reports have been received by WHO of suspected cases and systematic verification is underway in a number of countries to confirm whether these are actual EVD cases. Overall, these reports are a positive sign that surveillance is working and countries are stepping up their preparedness to respond. As of today, no cases have been confirmed outside Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone.",

          "The response of WHO and other partners to the Ebola Virus outbreak is continuing to grow in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. To reduce the likelihood that those who are infected will carry the disease outside their communities, the governments have set up quarantine zones in areas of high transmission including severely-affected cities such as Gueckedou in Guinea, Kenema and Kailahun in Sierra Leone and Foya in Liberia.",
          "This prevents people living in these areas from moving to other parts of the country and potentially increasing EVD transmission. However, it also means that barriers to travel limit their access to food and other necessities. While preventing further transmission of EVD is crucial, it is essential that people in those zones have access to food, water, good sanitation and other basic supplies.",
          "WHO is working with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure people in the quarantine zones receive regular food aid and other non-medical supplies. WFP is now scaling up its programme to distribute food to the around 1 million people living in the quarantine zones in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.",
          "Food has been delivered to hospitalized patients and people under quarantine who are not able to leave their homes to purchase food. Providing regular food supplies is a potent means of limiting unnecessary movement.",

To correct this misunderstanding, WHO called a press conference at the UN Palais des Nations in Geneva on 14 August. Dr Isabelle Nuttall, speaking on behalf of WHO, said, “Air travel, even from Ebola-affected countries, is low-risk for Ebola transmission.”",
          "Dr Nuttall further clarified modes of transmission for Ebola and emphasized that the disease is not an airborne virus, unlike influenza or tuberculosis. The infection is transmitted to others through direct contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person, such as blood, vomit, sweat, and diarrhoea. Even if an individual infected with EVD travels by plane, the likelihood of other passengers and crew coming into contact with the individual’s bodily fluids is very low.",

The report also confirms that the patient travelled by air and arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, on 20 July via Lomé, Togo, and Accra, Ghana. The sample from this case is yet to be sent to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, due to refusal by courier companies to transport this sample.

This phenomenon is retrogressive to the control of the EVD outbreak; and calls for stepping up outbreak containment measures, especially effective contact tracing.",
          "In addition, the Ministry of Health of Nigeria has reported the first probable case of EVD. According to the Nigeria authorities, the case is a 40-year-old Liberian male national who recently travelled to Nigeria where he presented in hospital with symptoms of EVD. The patient travelled by air and arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, on 20th July via Lomé, Togo. He was symptomatic while traveling, was admitted to a private hospital immediately on arrival, and died on 25 July. On 22 July, a sample was taken and preliminary laboratory analysis was conducted in the virology laboratory of Lagos University Teaching Hospital and tested positive for Ebola virus. The sample from this case is being referred to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, for confirmation. The national authority in Nigeria is working closely with WHO and partners to ensure that this incident case is contained at the source.",
          "In an effort to accelerate the response to the current EVD outbreak in West Africa, the Director General of WHO held discussions with the donor community and development partners on 24 July 2014 in Geneva. Countries and agencies again pledged their assistance and support to the outbreak and efforts are underway to secure additional human and financial resources.",
          "The Regional Director for the Africa Region, Dr Luis Sambo, continued his fact-finding mission in the three affected countries. After visiting Liberia earlier in the week (21 – 22 July), he visited Sierra Leone (22 – 23 July) and Guinea (23 – 25 July). The goal of his visits was to assess first-hand the EVD outbreak, review the current response and challenges, and explore the best ways to rapidly contain the outbreak in West Africa. Official meetings with Presidents, Ministers of Health and other senior government officials, international and local NGOs, UN agencies, and other stakeholders were held.",
          "During the mission, the Regional Director underscored the seriousness of the outbreak while reiterating that it can be contained using known infection prevention and control measures. He observed that the outbreak is beyond each national health sector alone and urged the governments of the affected countries to mobilize and involve all sectors, including civil society and communities, in the response. He requested the respective governments to re-deploy adequate and appropriate national staff and other national resources to the field level and promote behavioural change while respecting cultural practices. He repeated the mandate to countries to enhance cross-border collaboration and strengthen effective coordination and the mandate of WHO to coordinate the response to public health emergencies. On behalf of WHO, the Regional Director pledged WHO’s continued commitment to the affected countries and reaffirmed its role in engaging and mobilizing the international community in support of national efforts to control the EVD outbreak.",
          "On 24 July 2014, the Prime Minister of Guinea and the Regional Director officially inaugurated the WHO Sub-regional Outbreak Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry. The Centre will consolidate and harmonize the technical support at local, country, regional, and international level. WHO has asked its partners to deploy representatives from their respective organizations to sit in the hub and contribute to the activities of the coordination centre. The establishment of the SEOCC was a follow-up action from the emergency Ministerial Meeting held in Accra, Ghana, earlier in the month.",

On the first leg of his mission, the Regional Director visited Liberia from 21 - 22 July 2014. The goal of the visit is to make a first-hand assessment of the EVD outbreak, review the current outbreak response and challenges, and explore the best ways to rapidly contain the EVD outbreak in West Africa. The Regional Director held official meetings with the President of Liberia and the Minister of Health, including senior government officials. The President and the Regional Director also participated in the Ebola national coordination meeting at the Ministry of Health. During this meeting, the Regional Director emphasized the need to step up implementation of key outbreak containment strategies, including community engagement and involvement, effective contact tracing, cross-border collaboration and effective coordination. Discussions were also held with international and local non-governmental organizations, UN agencies, and other stakeholders to enhance collaboration and effective coordination. The Regional Director called upon all partners to be fully involved in the EVD outbreak response. Following his visit to Liberia, significant financial contributions and commitments were made, including from the Government and partners.",

The plan is aligned to the inter-country strategy for accelerated response to the outbreak, adopted in the Accra Ministerial meeting. It is expected that the launch and subsequent implementation of this strategic plan will bring tangible improvement and scale up effective outbreak containment measures at field level. Similarly, the Ministry of Health and partners in Guinea and Sierra Leone are conducting planning meetings to re-strategize and come up with concrete, action-oriented national operational plans to accelerate the response to the EVD outbreak response.",

The patient had Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and was admitted to a hospital on 6 June 2014 due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient was discharged on 14 June 2014 and continued treatment at home. She was in a stable condition until she developed severe acute respiratory symptoms and was readmitted to a hospital on 25 June 2014. The patient was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV on 5 July 2014 and died on the same day. The patient had no history of travel and no known history of contact with animals or consumption of raw camel milk products in the 14 days prior to becoming ill. The patient did not have known contact with a previously reported MERS-CoV case. However, during her first hospitalisation, the patient had close contact with another patient with severe acute respiratory infection.",

          "Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.",
          "Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.",

An assessment of the outbreak response conducted in Liberia identified several gaps and challenges. Some of the gaps identified include low coverage of contact tracing; persisting denial and resistance in the community; weak data management; inadequate infection prevention and control practices, especially in peripheral health facilities; and weak leadership and coordination at sub-national levels. Underpinning these challenges were limited financial resources and human technical capacity. Comprehensive mapping of the financial, logistics, and human resource needs will be articulated in the national operational plan under development. This exercise of developing prioritized operational plans is also being conducted in Guinea and Sierra Leone.",
          "Following the call for regional collaboration during the Accra Ministerial meeting, the Government and the Ministry of Health of Gambia provided a team of 11 health-care workers to support outbreak response in Sierra Leone. While this team will contribute the critical human resource needs, the mission will be crucial for enhancing capacity for epidemic preparedness and response in The Gambia. This mission is being supported by UNDP, Gambia, and WHO Sierra Leone.",
          "Efforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the outbreak response in the three countries, including contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and coordination.",
          "WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.",
          "New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 15 – 17 July 2014, 67 new cases of EVD, including 19 new deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 0 new cases and 0 deaths; Liberia, 22 new cases with 10 deaths; and Sierra Leone 45 new cases and 9 deaths. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD.",
          "As of 17 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 1 048, including 632 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 410 cases (301 confirmed, 95 probable, and 14 suspected) and 310 deaths (203 confirmed, 95 probable, and 12 suspected); Liberia, 196 cases (76 confirmed, 56 probable, and 64 suspected) and 116 deaths (54 confirmed, 40 probable, and 22 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 442 cases (368 confirmed, 48 probable, and 26 suspected) and 206 deaths (165 confirmed, 35 probable, and 6 suspected).",
          "The total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on best available information reported by Ministries of Health."

Two nationwide bOPV campaigns are planned for mid-July 2014 and mid-August 2014; the July 2014 round will target the entire population, and the August 2014 round will target children under 15 years old.",

No further samples have tested positive to date in Brazil, nor have any paralytic polio cases been detected there.",

Outbreak response teams in Guéckédou, where community deaths continue to be reported, encountered resistance and apprehension from the communities. The delegation engaged local and opinion leaders in order to build a relationship of trust with the community, which should foster cooperation and enhance acceptance of outbreak control measures. As a result of this engagement and dialogue, leaders of 19 out of 23 villages pledged their commitment to embrace the EVD outbreak response. Meanwhile, leaders of the four villages that did not turn up for the meeting later made contacts with the local administrative authority, expressing their willingness to be part of the response. In addition, the national authority has established administrative and law enforcement mechanisms to deal with extreme instances of resistance, such as violence towards the response teams.",

Between 8 – 12 July 2014, 79 new cases, and 65 deaths were reported from Liberia and Sierra. In Liberia, 30 new cases and 13 deaths were reported, while in Sierra Leone, 49 new cases and 52 deaths have been reported. These include suspect, probable and laboratory confirmed cases. This trend indicates that a high level of transmission of the Ebola Virus continues to take place in the community. The epidemic situation in Guinea is being closely observed, with 6 new cases and 3 deaths reported between 8 – 12 July 2014. The respective Ministries of Health are working with WHO and partners to step up outbreak containment measures.",
          "As a follow up action to the Emergency Ministerial meeting in Accra, the Regional Director, WHO African Region has taken a decision to re-deploy senior, technical, and support staff to the sub-regional coordination centre that is being established in Conakry, Guinea. The personnel re-assigned include a Director, Regional Advisors, epidemiologists, communication experts, social mobilization specialists, data managers, administrative officers, and other support staff. Preparation to establish the coordination centre is being finalized, with operations of the centre scheduled to be activated on 15 July 2014. The centre will act as a control and coordination platform, consolidating and harmonizing the technical support to the West African countries including assisting in resource mobilization.",
          "The three affected countries, with support from WHO, have initiated the process of reviewing and updating the current EVD national response plans. This exercise will lead to the development of prioritized national operational plans, aligned to the inter-country strategy adopted by the Ministers of Health in Accra. The operational plan will clearly highlight priority interventions and map out the required resources (human, financial, and logistics) for effective implementation of the outbreak containment measures. In addition, these documents will be vital for mobilization of the additional resources.",
          "WHO is currently supporting the affected countries to strengthen contact tracing, as one of the most effective outbreak containment measures. Early detection and prompt isolation of new EVD cases is requisite for interrupting secondary transmission of Ebola virus in the community. Therefore, WHO supported the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) of Liberia to identify and train 107 community volunteers and 33 supervisors. In Sierra Leone, a total of 296 community volunteers have been trained. The trained volunteers have been deployed in the affected communities to conduct contact tracing and ensure immediate evacuation of suspected EVD cases from the community. In response to a request from MOHSW Liberia, WHO, with support from the Government of the United States of America, has supplied personal protective equipment (PPE) for and other medical supplies to Liberia in order to ensure the safety of health-care workers in their response efforts. This donation, was handed over to MOHSW Liberia on 26 June and 3 July, included PPE appropriate for use by both clinical care and burial teams. On 14 July, additional supplies, including backpack sprayers and hand sprayers for disinfection as well disposal bags for biohazard wastes, were delivered to the country.",
          "WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.",
          "New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 8 – 12 July, 2014, 85 new cases of EVD, including 68 new deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 6 new cases and 3 deaths; Liberia, 30 new cases with 13 deaths; and Sierra Leone 49 new cases and 52 deaths. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD.",
          "As of 12 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 964, including 603 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 406 cases (297 confirmed, 92 probable, and 17 suspected) and 304 deaths (198 confirmed, 92 probable, and 14 suspected); Liberia, 172 cases (70 confirmed, 41 probable, and 61 suspected) and 105 deaths (48 confirmed, 33 probable, and 24 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 386 cases (339 confirmed, 37 probable, and 10 suspected) and 194 deaths (151 confirmed, 38 probable, and 5 suspected).",
          "The total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on best available information reported by Ministries of Health."

          "The evolution of the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia remains a serious concern as primary and secondary viral transmissions continue to occur in both urban and rural communities. Analyses of the current trend and the potential risk factors for the continuing spread of this epidemic have been conducted. The major factors responsible for continuous propagation of EVD outbreak in the sub-region include:",
          "1. Some negative cultural practices and traditional beliefs, resulting into mistrust, apprehension and resistance to adopt recommended public health preventive measures. The implication of this include poor health care seeking behaviour such as hiding of EVD patients, home-based management of EVD patients, and customary treatment of dead bodies. These are very high risk practices leading to extensive exposures to Ebola virus in the community. Consequently, community deaths continue to be reported. In addition, the potential contacts to the EVD patients managed at home and exposures during customary burial procedures are not systematically identified and put under observation (very critical measures for containment of community transmission of Ebola virus). This is therefore a major factor amplifying the outbreak.",
          "2. The extensive movement of people within and across borders has facilitated rapid spread of the infection across and within the three countries. The homogeneous community living along the border areas have common socio-cultural activities that enhance viral transmission e.g. visiting sick relatives or attending to burial ceremonies of relatives across the border. In addition, the cross border movement has complicated tracking and follow up of contacts, with several contacts loss to follow up.",
          "3. Currently, the coverage of effective outbreak containment measures is not comprehensive. The unprecedented geographical expanse of the EVD outbreak in the three countries requires enormous and robust response capacity and structures in terms of human capital, financial, operational and logistics requirements. This is the first major EVD outbreak in West Africa and the affected countries had weak capacity and structures for epidemic preparedness and response, particularly for viral haemorrhagic fever. Lastly, the apprehension of some communities limits access to affected population with effective outbreak control measures.",
          "In an effort to rapidly interrupt further spread of the Ebola virus, the World Health Organization convened a special Ministerial meeting on Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa. The meeting, held on 2-3 July 2014 in Accra, Ghana, brings together Ministers of Health and senior health officials from 11 African countries (Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Uganda), as well as partners, Ebola survivors, representatives of airlines and mining companies, and the donor communities. The objective of the meeting was to obtain consensus from Member States and partners on the optimal ways to interrupt the ongoing Ebola virus transmission in West Africa in order to reduce the human, social and economic impact of the current and future EVD outbreaks. The meeting focused on getting a clear understanding of current situation and response, including gaps and challenges; developing a comprehensive operational response plan for controlling the outbreak; priority preparedness activities to be implemented by countries at risk; and engagement of national authorities to optimally respond to EVD outbreak.",
          "WHO, technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), UN agencies and donors continue to provide the necessary technical support to the Ministries of Health to stop the transmission of the EVD in the communities and health facilities.",
          "The support is provided in the form of deployment of additional experts; provision of field logistics; and provision of equipment which include the establishment of field laboratories, personal protective equipment and medical supplies.",
          "WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.",
          "New cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD.",
          "As of 2 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 779, including 481 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 412 cases (292 confirmed, 100 probable, and 20 suspected) and 305 deaths (194 confirmed, 94 probable, and 17 suspected); Liberia, 115 cases (54 confirmed, 24 probable, and 37 suspected) and 75 deaths (38 confirmed, 22 probable, and 15 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 252 cases (211 confirmed, 35 probable, and 6 suspected) and 101 deaths (67 confirmed, 29 probable, and 5 suspected).

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",

Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.",

A new exportation event from Equatorial Guinea demonstrates that the risk of international spread from central Africa remains very high (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_03_17_polio/en/). On 18 June 2014, Brazil reported that wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) had been detected in a sewage sample collected in March 2014 at Viracopos International Airport in Sao Paolo state. Genetic sequencing indicates that this virus is most closely related to the virus that is circulating in Equatorial Guinea.",
          "Four wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in Equatorial Guinea in 2014. The index case – Equatorial Guinea’s first case to be reported since 1999 – had onset of paralysis on 28 January 2014; the country’s most recent case occurred on 3 April 2014. Genetic sequencing indicates these cases are linked to an ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Cameroon (Cameroon’s most recent case was on 31 January 2014). Equatorial Guinea is implementing outbreak response activities, with three National Immunization Days (NIDs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) in April and May, and plans for further NIDs in July and August. NIDs are deemed essential to stop the outbreak as an estimated 40% of children are fully immunized against polio through the routine immunization programme in the country.",
          "No one in Brazil has been paralyzed by the virus nor is there evidence of transmission within the population of that country. This importation event in Brazil demonstrates that all regions of the world continue to be at risk of exposure to wild poliovirus until polio eradication is completed globally. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for polioviruses (especially through the detection and investigation of Acute Flaccid Paralysis or AFP cases) in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Uniformly high routine immunization coverage should be maintained at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.",
          "An analysis of immunity levels across central Africa found important immunity gaps in most countries in 2014, prompting the large-scale polio immunization campaigns that are ongoing in the area. In Gabon, a nationwide immunization campaign was held in June (with a further round planned for July), and in the Republic of Congo, a nationwide activity was conducted in May (another round is planned for June). Polio vaccination campaigns have been conducted where possible in the Central African Republic (May to June), with another round planned for accessible areas in July.",
          "There is no evidence to date that Brazil was re-infected by the poliovirus of Equatorial Guinea origin that was detected in a sewage sample collected in Sao Paolo State in March 2014; to date there has been no evidence of transmission of the virus in Brazil following this exposure.",
          "Given Brazil’s high levels of population immunity, reflected in the high routine immunization coverage (>95%) and periodic vaccination campaigns, the lack of evidence so far of WPV1 transmission and the response being implemented, WHO assesses the risk of spread of this virus within or from Brazil as low.",
          "WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio."

He was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV on 16 June. His condition deteriorated and he died on 18 June. The patient is reported not to have had contact with a laboratory-confirmed case with MERS-CoV. He neither had a history of recent travel nor a history of contact with animals. Preliminary investigations indicate that none of the personnel working in the ward where the patient was initially admitted had illnesses that fit the case definition for MERS-CoV.",

The patient is currently in a stable condition. He travelled to Mecca, Jeddah City, to perform Umrah on 31 May and travelled from there to Egypt on 3 June. He returned from Egypt to Riyadh on 9 June. The patient is reported not to have had contact with a previously laboratory-confirmed case with MERS-CoV and is reported not to have had contact with animals.

          "Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.",
          "Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.",

The cumulative suspected, probable, and confirmed (including 3 new confirmed Ebola deaths) was 55 not 58. The new confirmed deaths were double counted. On 24 June 2014, WHO reported 34 deaths from EVD based on best available information from Sierra Leone. (http://who.int/csr/don/2014_06_24_ebola/en/) This discrepancy in numbers is a result of a change in the reporting methodology on the part of Sierra Leone. The new method did not include probable or suspect deaths and were only deaths of laboratory-confirmed cases. The reported cases in Kono and Western Area were suspect cases which have now proved negative. As of 24 June, there are no confirmed cases of Ebola in Kono and Western Area.",

Virus has been detected in the sewage only; sewage samples collected from the same site subsequent to the detection of WPV1 have been either negative or only positive for Sabin strains or non-polio enteroviruses; to date no case of paralytic polio has been reported. The isolate was detected through routine environmental surveillance testing of sewage water; there is no evidence of transmission of WPV1.",

Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water (http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20140123/en/index.html ).

His condition deteriorated as he developed pneumonia and gastrointestinal symptoms and he was admitted to the hospital on 30 May 2014. A specimen was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV on 31 May 2014. He is currently in a stable condition. He has no known comorbidities, but does have a history of contact with a laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV health-care worker case reported to WHO on 11 May 2014. He has no history of travel and no history of contact with animals.",

This global total includes all of the cases reported in this update, plus 44 laboratory-confirmed cases officially reported to WHO by Saudi Arabia between 19 May and 2 June. WHO is working closely with Saudi Arabia for additional information on these cases and will provide further updates as soon as possible.",
          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
          "Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health-care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.",
          "It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients – regardless of their diagnosis – in all work practices all the time.",
          "Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",
          "Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",
          "People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",
          "WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions."

          "The case is a 69 year-old male Jordanian citizen and resident of Amman governorate. The patient was admitted to hospital on 29 April 2014 for a surgical procedure. He was discharged on 3 May 2014. On 8 May, the patient presented with fever. His condition deteriorated and he was admitted to the same hospital on 11 May. Two days later, on 13 May, he started to complain of cough. A specimen was collected from the patient and it tested negative for MERS on the same day, but a chest X-Ray showed pneumonia. A second specimen was collected and it tested positive by PCR on 23 May. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit in a critical condition.",
          "The patient is known to have comorbidities, no history of travel, and no history of contact with animals. He also has no history of contact with a laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV case. However, he was admitted to the same hospital where a laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV fatal case was admitted. This case was reported to WHO on 6 May.",
          "Contact tracing and screening of family members, health workers, and patients for MERS-CoV is currently ongoing.",
          "Globally, 636 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to WHO, including 193 deaths. This global total includes all of the cases reported in this update, plus 17 laboratory confirmed cases officially reported to WHO by Saudi Arabia between 16 and 18 May. WHO is working closely with Saudi Arabia for additional information on these cases and will provide further updates as soon as possible.",
          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
          "Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health-care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.",
          "It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients – regardless of their diagnosis – in all work practices all the time.",
          "Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",
          "Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",
          "People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",
          "WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions."

The case was discovered during the national contact investigation, performed in relation to the first MERS-CoV case in the Netherlands reported on 14 May 2014.",
          "This second patient is a 73 year-old female citizen of the Netherlands and a close family member of the first case. Both patients were on the same trip through the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and shared a hotel room throughout the entire journey. This second patient has co-morbidities and developed first symptoms, including some breathing difficulties, on 5 May 2014 in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Upon return to the Netherlands on 10 May, the patient presented with mild respiratory symptoms and fever, but these were not severe enough for her to seek medical help.",
          "During contact investigation, her clinical condition was re-evaluated by a general practitioner and sampling for MERS-CoV was initiated. Samples taken from the patient are currently being tested, but initial findings confirm she is positive for MERS-Cov. Currently, the patient is in a stable condition with fever and mild respiratory symptoms and is hospitalized in isolation.",
          "Identification of close contacts (including flight contacts) has been initiated, although the majority of her contacts overlap with those from the first patient.",
          "Globally, 614 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to WHO, including 181 deaths. The global total includes all of the case reported in this update, plus 41 laboratory confirmed cases officially reported to WHO from Saudi Arabia between 10 and 15 May. WHO is working with Saudi Arabia for additional information on these cases and will provide further updates as soon as possible.",
          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
          "Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.",
          "It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients – regardless of their diagnosis – in all work practices all the time.",
          "Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",
          "Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",
          "People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",
          "WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions."

          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
          "Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.",
          "It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients – regardless of their diagnosis – in all work practices all the time.",
          "Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",
          "Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",
          "People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",
          "WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions."

          "The cumulative total of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (40 cases, including 20 deaths); Guekedou (72/51); Macenta (13/10); Kissidougou (1/1); and Dabola (1/1). The analysis of the epidemiological data during the last three weeks shows that the number of new cases is decreasing in Guekedou.",
          "EVD prevention and control activities continue in Guekedou. These include: a suite of innovative community sensitization and social mobilization activities with community leaders, mining companies, banks, schools and universities, and local nongovernmental organizations; the dissemination of awareness messages through rural community radio and posters; the screening of films on EVD; and providing education about EVD door-to-door in affected villages or neighborhoods.",
          "The numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities, and contact tracing activities. The recent introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases.",
          "As the incubation period for EVD can be up to three weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.",
          "There has been no change in the epidemiological situation in Liberia. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported that there are no current alerts of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF)-like illness in Liberia. Active surveillance activities continue. As of 5 May, 152 contacts have completed 21 days of follow-up and been discharged from medical surveillance.",
          "As of 7 May, no cases of EVD have been confirmed in Sierra Leone. From 16 March to 7 May 2014, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) of Sierra Leone has tested 106 patients presenting with a VHF-like illness for EVD and Lassa fever. No cases of EVD have been detected using ebolavirus PCR assays while 10 patients have been confirmed with a Lassa fever virus infection. Lassa fever is endemic in Sierra Leone. Thirty-five (35 contacts) have been traced; 15 have completed 21 days of follow-up and have been discharged from medical surveillance; and 20 are under follow up.",
          "EVD preparedness and response training has been provided to 375 health-care workers, including senior district-level nursing staff, primary health-care staff, senior hospital-based nurses and clinicians, and hospital superintendents. Personal protective equipment has been prepositioned in all district hospitals, selected private and mission hospitals, and the Armed Forces hospital. Active surveillance activities continue, including the investigation of all rumours of VHF-like illness.",
          "WHO continues to support the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Liberia in their EVD prevention and control activities. As of 7 May, 113 experts have been deployed to assist in the response. This includes 54 experts deployed through the global WHO surge mechanism, 33 international experts from among partner institutions of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), 10 externally recruited consultants, 16 WHO staff who were locally repurposed. Expertise has been mobilized in the areas of coordination, medical anthropology, clinical case management, data management and health informatics, surveillance and epidemiology, infection prevention and control, laboratory services, logistics, risk communications, social mobilization, finance and administration, and resource mobilization.",

The patient was diagnosed as having hepatitis B and is reported to have developed symptoms on 17 March 2014, including fever, productive cough, chills, headache, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. He was admitted to hospital on 22 March 2014 in Hadramoot Governorate, and subsequently transferred on 29 March 2014 to an intensive-care unit of a private hospital in Sanaa. He was intubated, developed renal failure, and died on 31 March 2014.",
          "Prior to the patient's decline and subsequent death, on 31 March 2014 oropharyngeal specimens were collected from the patient and tested positive on 2 April 2014. On 24 April 2014, the specimens were sent to the United States’ Naval Medical Research Unit-3 (NAMRU-3) for external confirmation and tested positive on 5 May 2014. Oropharyngeal specimens collected from 12 contacts of the patient tested negative at NAMRU-3.",
          "The patient was an aircraft maintenance engineer with contact among passengers at the airport where he was working. He had no history of travel during the last month of his illness and no known contact with a confirmed case. He is reported to have visited a camel farm on a weekly basis and drank fresh raw camel milk.",
          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
          "Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.",
          "It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients – regardless of their diagnosis – in all work practices all the time.",
          "Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",
          "Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",
          "People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",

          "He was identified through contact tracing activities and is asymptomatic. He is a relative of a previously reported case on 23 April 2014. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected on 22 April 2014 and by 24 April 2014 the Central Public Health Laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV by PCR testing. The national authorities of Saudi Arabia have traced contacts for this case and the case reported on 22 April. No secondary cases were identified.",
          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
          "Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.",
          "It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients – regardless of their diagnosis – in all work practices all the time.",
          "Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",

Of 210 patients tested for ebolavirus infection, 127 cases have been laboratory confirmed by PCR, including 81 deaths. In addition, 44 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and 55 cases (34 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. Twenty-five (25) health-care workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 16 deaths (11 confirmed). Seven (7) patients are in isolation facilities in Guinea; Conakry (4 patients, 2 confirmed) and Guekedou (3 patients, all confirmed).",

          "The cumulative total of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (40 cases, including 20 deaths); Guekedou (72/49); Macenta (13/10); Kissidougou (1/1); and Dabola (1/1). The date of isolation of the most recent confirmed cases is 30 April in Conakry and Guekedou.",

All the contacts from the other 4 outbreak locations have completed their 21-day medical surveillance period and have been discharged from follow up.",
          "The numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities and contact tracing activities. The recent introduction of ebolavirus serology to test PCR-negative clinical cases is also likely to change the final number of laboratory confirmed cases.",
          "As the incubation period for EVD can be up to 3 weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.",
          "The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has completed the process of revising clinical cases of EVD based on their final laboratory results. All cases which tested PCR positive or ebolavirus IgM positive have been reclassified as “confirmed acute” cases. PCR negative but ebolavirus IgG positive cases are considered “confirmed convalescent” cases. Following the reclassification of suspected cases, as of 2 May the total number of clinical EVD cases reported in Liberia is 13 (6 confirmed, 2 probable and 5 suspected cases), including 11 deaths. There were 2 confirmed cases in HCWs, both of whom died. There have been no new clinical cases in Liberia since 6 April.",
          "The above criteria will be used to classify future cases of EVD in Liberia, should they occur. In addition, in the situation where neither PCR nor serological testing is carried out and/or the results of repeated testing remain equivocal, future clinical cases and deaths will classified as either probable or suspected based on the presence of a clinically compatible illness and evidence of epidemiological linkage to known confirmed case(s).",

          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
          "Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.",
          "It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients – regardless of their diagnosis – in all work practices all the time.",
          "Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",
          "Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",
          "People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",

To date, 191 patients have been tested for ebolavirus infection and 115 cases have been laboratory confirmed, including 72 deaths. In addition, 42 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and 61 cases (35 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. Twenty-six (26) health care workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 16 deaths (12 confirmed).",
          "Clinical cases of EVD have been reported from Conakry (58 cases, including 24 deaths), Guekedou (127/91), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1). Laboratory confirmed cases and deaths have been reported from Conakry (37 cases, including 19 deaths), Guekedou (63/41), Macenta (13/10), Kissidougou (1/1) and Dabola (1/1). The date of onset of the most recent clinical case, a suspected case, is 23 April while the date of isolation of the most recent confirmed case is 22 April. Two new deaths have also been reported among existing cases; one of the deaths was a patient with confirmed EVD. Thirteen (13) patients are in isolation in Conakry (6 patients, 5 confirmed), Guekedou (7 patients, all confirmed). Contact tracing activities continue in all affected areas.",
          "Overall, the epidemiological situation in Guinea has improved significantly over the last few weeks. The date of onset of the last reported case from Macenta was 24 days ago and a similar time has elapsed for Dabola (25 days), Kissigougou (26) and Djingaraye (31 days). Two incubation periods (42 days) without cases is the standard for declaring an EVD outbreak over in a particular location.",
          "The focus of response activities at present includes clinical case management and ongoing training in hospital-based infection prevention and control (IPC). A documentary will be made on the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) isolation facility in Guekedou. WHO, in collaboration with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), has mobilized a new medical team comprising of IPC and intensive care physicians in support of the clinicians at the Donka Hospital in Conakry.",
          "The numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities and contact tracing activities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States, has arrived in Guinea to further strengthen diagnostic capacity for EVD by retesting patients who were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative by ebolavirus serology.",
          "The cross-border meeting on EVD response between the governments of Guinea and Liberia was successfully hosted by the Guinean government, attended by 25 participants from delegations from both countries. The overall objective of the meeting was to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and the follow up of contacts along the borders of the two countries in order to stop transmission of EVD. Key actions for implementation include: development of an action plan on the cross-border response to EVD; strengthening coordination of cross-border activities with engagement of local authorities; sharing information on the cross-border movement of suspected cases of EVD; reinforcing community awareness of EVD and ways to reduce personal and community risk of disease; and reinforcing active surveillance and contact tracing along the border as needed.",
          "As the incubation period for EVD can be up to three weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.",
          "From 13 March, the date of onset of the first laboratory confirmed case in Liberia, to 24 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported a total of 35 clinically compatible cases of EVD; 6 confirmed cases, 2 probable cases and 27 suspected cases. The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case was 6 April. The MOHSW has started to reclassify suspected cases against their laboratory test results. Most of the suspected cases are expected to be discarded at the end of this process.",
          "WHO, in collaboration with GOARN, is planning to replace experts who recently completed their missions in Liberia in the areas of case management, IPC and epidemiology.",
          "The Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone is currently investigating 3 patients with an illness compatible with a viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) for EVD and Lassa fever (the latter is endemic in Sierra Leone). All rumours of EVD cases are being investigated and active case finding is also ongoing.",
          "The laboratory at the Lassa Fever isolation facility at the Kenema Government Hospital is now analysing all suspected cases of VHF for both Lassa fever and EVD. As of 24 April 2014, 98 samples collected have been tested; 10 samples tested positive for Lassa fever and the remaining 88 tested negative for both diseases. Fifteen contacts have completed 21 days of follow up while 20 contacts remain under medical observation.",

To date, 169 patients have been tested for ebolavirus infection and 112 cases have been laboratory confirmed, including 69 deaths. In addition, 41 cases (34 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD and 55 cases (33 deaths) are classified as suspected cases. Twenty-five (25) health care workers (HCW) have been affected (18 confirmed), with 16 deaths (12 confirmed).",
          "Clinical cases of EVD have been reported from Conakry (53 cases, including 23 deaths), Guekedou (122/87), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1). Laboratory confirmed cases and deaths have been reported from Conakry (37 cases, including 19 deaths), Guekedou (60/38), Macenta (13/10), Kissidougou (1/1) and Dabola (1/1). These updated figures include 3 new cases isolated on 20 April from Conakry and Guekedou, 2 of whom are laboratory confirmed. Five new deaths have also been reported among existing cases; all 5 of the deaths were patients with confirmed EVD. Twenty-one (21) patients were in isolation in Conakry (12), Guekedou (8) and Macenta (1), while 16 patients who recovered from their illness were discharged from hospital.",
          "Contact tracing activities continue in all affected areas. A total of 217 contacts are currently under medical observation and 92 have completed their 21 days of follow-up.",
          "The numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of cases, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and the continuing laboratory investigations. As the incubation period for EVD can be up to three weeks, it is likely that the Guinean health authorities will report new cases in the coming weeks and additional suspected cases may also be identified in neighbouring countries.",
          "From 13 March, the date of onset of the first laboratory confirmed case in Liberia, to 21 April, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Liberia has reported a total of 34 clinically compatible cases of EVD; 6 confirmed cases, including 6 deaths, 2 probable cases and 26 suspected cases. The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case was 6 April and the date of admission of the last confirmed case was 10 April. The confirmed and probable cases were reported from Lofa and Margibi Counties, while suspected cases have been reported from Bong, Grand Cape Mount, Montserrado and Nimba Counties as a result of enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities.",
          "The number of confirmed cases in HCWs has been adjusted down from 3 cases to two as data are reviewed against case definitions and laboratory results. The total number of deaths has also been revised from 13 to 11 as one of the deaths has been counted in the EVD statistics for Guinea and one death occurred in a discarded case. As laboratory tests have been conducted on 32 clinical samples overall only 6 of which have tested positive for ebolavirus to date, it is anticipated that most of the suspected cases currently reported by Liberia will be reclassified as discarded and removed from the case count in the future.",
          "Following data review, the number of contacts now stands at 162 in total; Foya district, Lofa County, the epicentre of the EVD outbreak in Liberia accounts for 72% (116) of the total contacts followed by Margibi County (17%, 28 contacts). Fifty-nine contacts (36% of the total) have completed 21 days follow up and have been discharged from medical observation.",
          "As of 22 April 2014, clinical samples from 19 clinically compatible cases of EVD have been tested at the Kenema Government Hospital. All 19 samples tested negative for ebolavirus. As part of enhanced surveillance activities, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone also decided to test for the presence of ebolavirus in samples from patients referred to the Lassa Fever Isolation Ward of the Kenema Hospital for the investigation of viral hemorrhagic fever-like illness who tested negative for Lassa fever virus infection.

Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",

          "17 April 2014 - In Equatorial Guinea, three new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported on 14 April 2014, the first polio in the country since 1999. Genetic sequencing indicates these cases are linked to an ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Cameroon which has subsequently been detected in Equatorial Guinea. The cases had onset of paralysis on 28 January 2014, 19 January 2014 and 24 March 2014, from Centro Sur, Bioko Norte and Litoral. Outbreak response in Equatorial Guinea is currently being planned, including National Immunization Days (NIDs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) on 21-24 April 2014. An estimated 40% of children are fully immunized against polio in the country.",
          "On 17 March 2014, WHO had elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to ‘very high’ (see previous polio outbreak news under 'related links'). The risk assessment was elevated due to: confirmation of three additional WPV1 cases (with onset of paralysis on 6, 25 and 31 January 2014) from three new regions of Cameroon, confirming continued WPV transmission and geographic expansion of infected areas following detection of four cases in October 2013; gaps in surveillance; and, influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic.",
          "The confirmation of new cases in Cameroon resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities, including converting a subnational immunization campaign to a full nationwide activity on 11-13 April 2014, and implementing nationwide campaigns in May and June 2014. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality of immunization campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.",
          "Immunity levels and surveillance sensitivity are also being assessed in neighbouring countries, in particular in Gabon and the Republic of Congo. In Gabon, a nationwide immunization campaign is planned for 22-26 April 2014 (targeting all children aged less than 15 years), and in the Republic of Congo, a nationwide activity will be conducted on 1 May 2014.",
          "It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.",

Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",
          "Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",
          "People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",

          "Laboratory support for the investigation is being provided by Institut Pasteur Dakar, Senegal, and the mobile laboratory in Guekedou. Reference laboratory functions have been provided by Institut Pasteur Lyon, France, the Bernhard-Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine Hamburg, Germany, and the Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI) laboratory in Lyon, France.",

Four new clinically compatible cases were reported on 4 April. One of the suspected cases is in a health care-worker. Both of the laboratory confirmed cases, sisters from Lofa County, have died.",
          "The suspected cases include a hunter treated at a hospital in Tapita, Nimba County, who died shortly after presenting to the health facility and a 3 year-old boy with a clinically compatible illness who had travelled from Guinea. The deceased hunter gave no history of contact with known cases in Liberia or Guinea and his exposure is being investigated to exclude transmission from an animal source (bush meat). The laboratory results for both of these suspected cases are pending.",

A total of 21 clinical samples have been sent to Conakry, Guinea, for laboratory testing. Counties of concern for EVD in Liberia include Lofa, Bong, Nimba, Margibi and Montserrado.",
          "In response, Liberia has been scaling up activities to prevent the further spread of EVD. The National Task Force is conducting daily coordination meetings with response partners. WHO continues to provide technical expertise to the MOHSW, including public communications, providing a high level briefing on EVD prevention and control to the joint session of both houses of parliament and mobilising experts in epidemiology and infection prevention and control.",

WHO is also working with the health information systems team at the MOHSW to further develop templates for case-based data collection and to track technical assistance. Additional deployments of regional experts, and partners in GOARN, are planned to support coordination activities, infection prevention and control, risk communications and social mobilisation.",

Seven isolation units have been established in 5 counties. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is conducting training for health-care workers in the affected counties on case management, including on setting up isolation facilities. An additional 60 HCWs have been trained in Margibi County.",
          "Community education and social mobilisation activities have been strongly supported by the media and telecommunications sectors in Liberia. Local government officials, community and religious leaders and traditional healers have been approached to support the MOHSW in prevention and control activities; however, additional resources are needed to expand surveillance and health promotion and social mobilisation activities to schools, religious gatherings, market places and work places.

Two of the suspected cases had travelled from Guinea. The patients were placed in isolation pending epidemiological investigations and laboratory testing. Contact tracing is underway. Clinical samples have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, United States, for testing. Epidemiological surveillance is being enhanced on the ground and Rapid Response Teams are being mobilised to identify and treat suspected cases should others present. An isolation unit has been prepared in Bamako and units are also being installed in other locations. Information hotlines are being made available to the public.",

Enhanced surveillance and public education activities are continuing.",

Metabiota Laboratory in Kenema working under the MOHS and with the WHO Country Office in Sierra Leone, has established a full suite of ebolavirus-specific assays and differential diagnostics for other important viral haemorrhagic fevers that are locally endemic. The full range of assays is described in the section of this report for Metabiota activities in Liberia.",
          "As this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to daily changes due to consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and ongoing laboratory investigations.",

The outbreak is now confirmed to be caused by a strain of ebolavirus with very close homology (98%) to the Zaire ebolavirus. This is the first time the disease has been detected in West Africa.",

Genus Ebolavirus comprises five distinct species: Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV); Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV); Reston ebolavirus (RESTV); Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV); and Taï Forest ebolavirus (TAFV). BDBV, EBOV, and SUDV have been associated with large EVD outbreaks in Africa, whereas RESTV and TAFV have not. Samples taken from patients in this outbreak have tested positive for EBOV.",
          "In Africa, fruit bats are believed to be the natural hosts of Ebola virus. The virus is transmitted from wildlife to people through contact with infected fruit bats, or through intermediate hosts, such as monkeys, apes, or pigs that have themselves become infected through contact with bat saliva or faeces.",
          "People may then become infected through contact with infected animals, either in the process of slaughtering or through consumption of blood, milk, or raw or undercooked meat.",
          "The virus is then passed from person to person through direct contact with the blood, secretions or other bodily fluids of infected persons, or from contact with contaminated needles or other equipment in the environment.",
          "EVD, which has a case fatality rate of up to 90%, is a severe acute viral illness often characterized by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache, nausea and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. Laboratory findings frequently include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.",
          "The incubation period, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is 2 to 21 days. People remain infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus, a period that has been reported to be as long as 61 days after onset of illness.",
          "When considering the diagnosis of EVD, other, more common diseases should not be overlooked; for example, malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, cholera, leptospirosis, plague, rickettsiosis, relapsing fever, meningitis, hepatitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers.",
          "Definitive diagnosis of EVD is made through laboratory testing. Because samples from patients are a source of infection risk for others, testing is conducted under maximum biological containment conditions.",
          "No vaccine is available, nor is there any specific treatment. Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. Patients are frequently dehydrated and require oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes, or intravenous fluids.",
          "Raising awareness of the risk factors for infection and the protective measures that should be taken is the only way to reduce human infection and subsequent deaths. Close unprotected physical contact with Ebola patients should be avoided. Appropriate use of gloves and personal protective equipment (including hand hygiene before putting on, and especially after taking off personal protective equipment) should be practised when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home.",
          "Almost all transmission of the virus to health-care workers has been reported when basic infection control measures have not been observed. Health-care workers caring for any patient should practice standard precautions. When caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus infection, health-care workers should apply, in addition to standard precautions, other infection control measures to avoid any exposure to patients’ blood and body fluids and with possibly contaminated environments.",
          "Preparation for burial of the bodies of persons who have died from Ebola virus disease also carries high risks of transmission of the virus. Those who have died from the disease should be promptly and safely buried.",
          "In coordination with national and regional authorities and technical partners, WHO has deployed experts to help assess and control the situation. Isolation facilities and a mobile laboratory have been established; infection prevention and control and clinical management guidance is being provided; and awareness and education campaigns, social mobilization, and risk communications activities are taking place throughout the affected areas.",
          "Anyone who has stayed in areas where EVD cases have recently been reported should be aware of the symptoms of infection and seek medical attention at the first sign of illness.",
          "Clinicians managing returning travellers from visiting these areas with compatible symptoms are advised to take into consideration the possibility of EVD. Malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, cholera, leptospirosis, plague, rickettsiosis, relapsing fever, meningitis, hepatitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers are differential diagnosis to consider in these patients.",

          "As at 31 March 2014, the Ministry of Health of Guinea has reported 122 clinically compatible cases of EVD, of which 24 are laboratory confirmed by PCR, and 98 are probable (78) or suspected (22) cases. This total number includes 80 deaths, of which 13 (16%) have been laboratory confirmed for EVD and the remaining 67 are considered as probable cases of EVD. These figures correspond to 19 new clinical cases and 14 new deaths since the 28 March. As of 30 March, 20 patients remain in isolation. Eleven health-care workers are among the probable and suspected cases. Cases have been reported from Conakry (11), Guekedou (77), Macenta (23), Kissidougou (8), and 3 from Dabola and Djingaraye combined.",
          "Case investigation and contact tracing are continuing, with 400 contacts under medical follow-up at present. Further strengthening of infection prevention and control in health-care facilities is a priority intervention. In addition, efforts are continuing to raise awareness in the community about the importance of personal protective measures to prevent ebolavirus transmission including hand washing, caring for the sick safely in the community, the use of personal protective equipment when handling potentially contaminated blood and body fluids and during environmental cleaning and disinfection, and safe burials.",
          "The Ministry of Health of Liberia has reported 8 clinically compatible cases of EVD, including 2 laboratory-confirmed cases, from 14 to 30 March. The 2 confirmed cases were reported from Lofa County. Two patients died; one of the deceased patients has been laboratory confirmed and the other death was in a probable case. Contact tracing is underway.",
          "Response activities in Liberia include a press conference by the Ministries of Health & Social Welfare and Ministry of Information, distribution of EVD prevention and control guidelines to health-care workers, training staff on case detection, contact tracing and follow up, clinical case management, infection prevention and control, specimen collection, handling and transportation and the safe handling of deceased patients. Staff from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and WHO have travelled to Lofa County to provide technical support and coordinate control efforts.",
          "Clinical specimens from suspected cases are being sent to the laboratory in Conakry, Guinea, for testing. Intensive community awareness raising campaigns are also underway through the mass media, via social mobilization activities and interpersonal communications, and involvement of telephone service providers in sending text messages.",
          "The Ministry of Health of Sierra Leone is maintaining a high level of vigilance following the deaths of 2 probable cases of EVD in one family who died in Guinea and their bodies repatriated to Sierra Leone. To date, active surveillance activities have identified no new suspected cases and all contacts of the deceased have remained well.",
          "As this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation and the number of laboratory results are subject to change due to enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities, ongoing laboratory investigations and consolidation of case, contact and laboratory data.",
          "WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.",
          "The risk of infection for travellers is very low since most human infections result from direct contact with the body fluids or secretions of infected patients, particularly in hospitals (nosocomial transmission) and as a result of unsafe procedures, use of contaminated medical devices (including needles and syringes) and unprotected exposure to contaminated body fluids. Travellers should avoid all contact with infected patients. Those who are providing medical care or are involved in the evaluation of an outbreak should wear protective clothing, including masks, gloves, gowns, eye protection and practice proper infection prevention and control and measures.",

In addition, a fifth suspected case died without laboratory confirmation. Intensive case investigations are underway to identify the source and route of these patients’ infection, record their travel histories before arrival in Conakry and determine their period of infectivity for the purposes of contact tracing. Rapid Response Teams are carrying out these investigations and sensitizing health care workers and the affected communities about EHF to reduce the risk of further transmission.",
          "The total number of suspected and confirmed cases in the on-going EHF outbreak in Guinea has increased to 103, including 66 deaths. Today 15 new suspected cases were reported in Guinea (8 in Guekedou and 2 in Macenta, in addition to the 5 cases in Conakry). The case fatality rate (CFR) is 64%. All age groups have been affected but most of the cases are adults aged 15-59 years. Four health care workers are among the deaths attributed to the Ebola outbreak. As this is a rapidly changing situation, the number of reported cases and deaths are preliminary and subject to change due to enhanced surveillance activities and laboratory testing of cases.",
          "Since the beginning of the outbreak, most of the cases have been reported in three districts in south east Guinea (Guekedou, Macenta, and Kissidougou districts). Contact tracing and follow up continues in these areas.",
          "To date, 15 cases have tested positive by PCR testing for the ebolavirus, confirmed by collaborating laboratories including the Institut Pasteur Lyon, France, Institut Pasteur (IP) Dakar, Senegal and Bernhard-Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine Hamburg, Germany. Laboratories studies demonstrated that Zaire ebolavirus is the virus responsible for the outbreak.",
          "The number of laboratory confirmed cases is subject to change as the laboratory results from the participating laboratories are still being consolidated and new samples are being tested.",
          "WHO has alerted countries bordering Guinea about the outbreak and to heighten surveillance for illness consistent with a viral haemorrhagic fever, especially along land borders. Both Sierra Leone and Liberia have reported suspected cases and deaths consistent with EHF to WHO among people who had travelled to Guinea before symptom onset. To date, WHO has received no reports of viral haemorrhagic fever from either country in individuals who have not travelled to Guinea. The three countries are sharing information with each other and with WHO daily. Liberia has reported 8 suspected cases of EHF, including 6 deaths, with travel histories to Guekedou district. Sierra Leone has reported 6 suspected cases, including 5 deaths. Investigations into these suspected cases are on-going.",
          "The MOH together with WHO and other partners continues to implement measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. As part of the international response to the outbreak, WHO and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) have deployed experts deployed to support Guinea in the following areas: outbreak coordination, clinical case management, surveillance and epidemiology, diagnostics, infection prevention and control, social mobilisation outbreak logistics and medical anthropology. Training health and community workers to detect, notify and manage suspected and confirmed cases and in measures to strengthen infection prevention and control, including the safe burial of the deceased, are priority interventions.",

          "As of 20 March 2014, in the Syrian Arab Republic a total of 37 WPV1 cases have been reported: 25 cases by the Syrian Arab Republic Ministry of Health, and 12 cases from contested areas (Aleppo, Edleb and Deir Al Zour) not yet reflected in official figures. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 17 December 2013, from Edleb.",
          "Further evidence of regional spread was confirmed this week by notification of a WPV1 case from Iraq, the first polio case in the country since 2000. The case, a six-month old boy from Baghdad who had not been immunized, developed paralysis on 10 February 2014. Genetic sequencing indicates the virus is most closely related to virus detected in the Syrian Arab Republic. WPV1 was also isolated from the child’s three-year old sister, who did not develop symptoms. Prospects for rapidly controlling this event are positive, as Iraq has been part of a regional Middle East emergency outbreak response since confirmation of polio in the Syrian Arab Republic was received in October 2013. In response, all countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, in a joint resolution, declared polio eradication to be an emergency, calling for support in negotiating and establishing access to those children who are currently unreached with polio vaccination.",
          "In Iraq, since October, two nationwide immunization campaigns and three subnational campaigns have been conducted, achieving overall high quality. Approximately 95% of children were reported to have been reached during each campaign, though coverage has varied by area. WHO and UNICEF estimates from 2012 put routine immunization levels in Iraq at 70%. Routine immunization levels in Baghdad are estimated to be 81%.",
          "As part of outbreak response, efforts have been ongoing to strengthen subnational surveillance sensitivity to ascertain the full extent of transmission, particularly in the Syrian Arab Republic. Subnational surveillance gaps persist, particularly in areas of Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Lattakia, Quneitra and Al Raqa. Surveillance quality has improved in other governorates of north-eastern Syrian Arab Republic, including in Deir Al Zour.",

          "In Israel, WPV1-positive samples continue to be detected through environmental surveillance. In total, 186 positive samples have been collected since 3 February 2013, the most recent of which on 16 February 2014. In West Bank and Gaza Strip 3 WPV1-positive samples have been detected by environmental surveillance, the most recent of which was detected in January 2014. No cases of polio paralysis have been detected in Israel, West Bank or Gaza Strip; WPV1 has been isolated from sewage samples only.",
          "A surveillance alert remains in place for the region, calling on countries to actively search for additional potential cases in addition to implementing the recommended SIAs with OPV. The risk of further international spread across the region remains high. WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio."

Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.",

Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",

Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",

Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",

For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",

In total, seven WPV1 cases have now been reported from West, North West, Centre and Adamaoua Regions, with onset of paralysis ranging from 1 October 2013 to 31 January 2014. Genetic sequencing of WPV1 isolates suggests prolonged undetected circulation of poliovirus. Due to continued poliovirus circulation in Cameroon, gaps in surveillance, and influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic, WHO is elevating the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high.",
          "Following confirmation of the outbreak in October 2013, Cameroon conducted three nationwide immunization campaigns with a fourth nationwide activity starting on 9 March 2014. Even though independent monitoring suggests some improvements, serious gaps in quality remain (both in implementation and monitoring) which must be urgently addressed. Quality varies greatly by region. The main reason for non-vaccination of children is that houses had not been visited (43% of non-vaccinated children). Analysis of overall population immunity (non-polio acute flaccid paralysis data 6-59 months) suggests upwards of 40% of children remain under-immunized (with 30% having received zero doses of oral polio vaccine – OPV). The continuation and expanding spread of transmission indicates serious gaps in quality of outbreak response.",
          "The confirmation of new cases has resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities, including converting a subnational immunization campaign to a full nationwide activity in April 2014, and implementing nationwide campaigns in May and June 2014. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.",
          "It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.",

          "Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.",
          "It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients – regardless of their diagnosis – in all work practices all the time.",
          "Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",
          "Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.",
          "All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",
          "People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",
          "WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions."

Therefore, it is important to ensure that standard precautions are consistently used for all patients and all work practices all of the time, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection with the MERS-CoV or any other pathogen. Droplet precautions should be added when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, and contact precautions plus eye protection should be added when caring for confirmed or probable cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions are indicated when performing aerosol generating procedures.",

          "7 February 2014 - On 3 February 2014, United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.",
          "The case is a 66 year-old male UAE national, residing in Abu Dhabi. He had onset of symptoms on 20 January 2014 with an upper respiratory tract illness and was admitted to hospital on 24 January 2014 with pneumonia and renal failure. He had underlying medical conditions.",
          "MERS-CoV was laboratory-confirmed at the national laboratory in Abu Dhabi on the 30 January 2014 by two positive PCR targets. The patient is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in stable condition. Public health authorities are carrying out contact tracing and an epidemiological investigation.",
          "The patient owns camels in UAE and has recent travel history to Oman from 20 January 2014 where he had contact with camels.",
          "Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 182 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 79 deaths.",
          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
          "MERS-CoV infections that may be acquired in health-care facilities illustrate the need to continue to strengthen infection prevention and control measures. Health-care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Education and training for infection prevention and control should be provided to all health-care workers and regularly refreshed.",
          "Early identification of the MERS-CoV is important, but not all the cases could be reliably and timely detected, especially when disease is mild or presents atypically. Therefore, it is important to ensure that standard precautions are consistently used for all patients and all work practices all of the time, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection with the MERS-CoV or any other pathogen. Droplet precautions should be added when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, and contact precautions plus eye protection should be added when caring for confirmed or probable cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions are indicated when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "When the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, the patient should be managed as potentially infected, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",
          "WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
          "Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.",
          "All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",
          "People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",
          "WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions."

          "The case is a 60-year-old man from Riyadh who became ill on 19 January and who had underlying medical conditions. He was hospitalized on 24 January and died on 28 January. Respiratory specimens were collected and sent to the central laboratory in Riyadh and confirmed positive for MERS-CoV on 28 January. Details of his possible contact with animals are unknown, and he has no history of contact with a laboratory-confirmed case.",
          "WHO has also been informed by the United Arab Emirates of the death on 16 January of a previously reported case of a 33 year-old male healthcare worker from Dubai (see Disease Outbreak News update from 3 January 2014).",
          "Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 181 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 79 deaths.",
          "MERS-CoV infections that may be acquired in health-care facilities illustrate the need to continue to strengthen infection prevention and control measures. Health-care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Education and training for infection prevention and control should be provided to all health-care workers and regularly refreshed.",
          "Early identification of the MERS-CoV is important, but not all the cases could be reliably and timely detected, especially when disease is mild or presents atypically. Therefore, it is important to ensure that standard precautions are consistently used for all patients and all work practices all of the time, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection with the MERS-CoV or any other pathogen. Droplet precautions should be added when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, and contact precautions plus eye protection should be added when caring for confirmed or probable cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions are indicated when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "When the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, the patient should be managed as potentially infected, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",
          "WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
          "Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.",
          "All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",
          "People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",
          "WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions."

The patient received medical treatment in an intensive care unit. He died on 14 January 2014. Samples tested positive for MERS-CoV after his death. The patient was a health care worker. He had a history of chronic disease and had no history of contacts with animals or contact with known cases of MERS-CoV. In addition, he had no travel history. The investigation is ongoing.",

The case is a 48 year old man who became ill on 31 December, 2013 and developed fever, dry cough, difficulty in breathing, abdominal pain and vomiting, and was admitted to a hospital on 9 January, 2014. While there, his condition worsened and on 16 January he was placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient died on 23 January. A sample taken from the patient on 21 January tested positive by PCR for MERS-CoV. The patient had underlying health conditions and he had travelled to the United Kingdom from 12 November to 25 December 2013 seeking treatment for his underlying conditions. The patient had no history of animal contact and is believed to have not attended any large social events in the last 30 days. It is reported that he had received 2 guests from Kuwait between 25 December and 31 December, 2013.

          "MERS-CoV infections that may be acquired in health care facilities illustrate the need to continue to strengthen infection prevention and control measures. Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors. Education and training for infection prevention and control should be provided to all health care workers and regularly refreshed.",
          "Early identification of the MERS-CoV is important, but not all the cases could be reliably and timely detected, especially when disease is mild or presents atypically. Therefore, it is important to ensure that standard precautions are consistently used for all patients and all work practices all of the time, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection with the MERS-CoV or any other pathogen. Droplet precautions should be added when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, and contact precautions plus eye protection should be added when caring for confirmed or probable cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions are indicated when performing aerosol generating procedures.",
          "When the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, the patient should be managed as potentially infected, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.",
          "WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
          "Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.",
          "All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",
          "People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",

          "The case is a 33 year-old male healthcare worker in Dubai who was in contact with the confirmed MERS-CoV case reported to WHO on 20 December. He developed symptoms on 27 December, and was hospitalized on 28 December with bilateral pneumonia, acute renal failure and thrombocytopenia. The patient has underlying history of bronchial asthma and chronic kidney disease. The case was laboratory confirmed for MERS-CoV on 29 December 2013. The patient is in critical but stable condition.",
          "Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 177 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 74 deaths.",
          "Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.",
          "Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.",
          "Patients diagnosed and reported to date have had respiratory disease as their primary illness. Diarrhoea is commonly reported among the patients and severe complications include renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with shock. It is possible that severely immunocompromised patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms.",
          "Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.",
          "All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.",
          "People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.",
          "WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.",
          "WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met."
