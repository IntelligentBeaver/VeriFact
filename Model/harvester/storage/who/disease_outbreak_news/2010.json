          "13 November 2010 - The risk of further international spread of the ongoing polio outbreak in Central Asia and the North Caucasus Federal Region in Russia continues to be high.",
          "In Central Asia, genetic sequencing of the poliovirus isolated from a child paralyzed in Kazakhstan on 12 August 2010 has confirmed ongoing circulation of the virus which caused the Tajikistan outbreak and subsequently spread to the Russian Federation, Turkmenistan and possibly Uzbekistan. In the Russian Federation, the detection of an additional case of polio with onset on 25 September in the Republic of Dagestan confirms ongoing poliovirus transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region.",
          "In Tajikistan, the epicenter of the Central Asian outbreak (458 WPV1 cases, at 3 November), no new polio cases have been reported since 4 July 2010 following five mass immunization campaigns with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), with a sixth and final round planned for 8-12 November. In Turkmenistan (three WPV1 cases), no new cases have been reported since 28 June 2010, and four mass OPV immunization campaigns have been completed. In Kazakhstan, the seven-year-old boy from Saryagach in the Southern Kazakhstan Oblast (SKO) who was paralyzed on 12 August 2010, represents the only case in the country; a second large-scale OPV mop-up round is being conducted in the first week of November.",
          "The Russian Federation's 14th case, the child paralyzed on 25 September, brings the total number of cases in the North Caucasus Federal Region to six, three each from Dagestan and Chechnya. Genetic sequencing of this virus is consistent with ongoing transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region since the detection of the index cases on 15 July 2010 in Dagestan and 4 August 2010 in Chechnya following two separate importations from Tajikistan. The other eight cases in Russia represent sporadic importations associated with individual cases, the last of which occurred on 2 July 2010; none of these cases has been associated with ongoing circulation following local catch-up immunization activities with OPV. In response to the continued transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region, the Russian Federation initiated a 1st round of mass OPV immunization in the area on 1 November, with a 2nd round planned for late November; both rounds will target all children aged six months to 15 years.",
          "Although Uzbekistan has not confirmed a polio case during the current outbreak in Central Asia, it is not possible to rule out ongoing, undetected transmission in the country because stool samples from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases are not currently being tested in a WHO-accredited laboratory; the bordering areas of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan have all reported cases; and, at least one Uzbek national became paralyzed shortly after arrival in Russia which, given the incubation period for paralytic poliomyelitis, suggests infection may have occurred prior to leaving Uzbekistan. Recognizing the risk of a poliovirus importation and outbreak, Uzbekistan has conducted 4 nationwide OPV campaigns, the last one from 25-31 October.",
          "Countries at risk of poliovirus importation from Central Asia or the North Caucasus Federal Region of the Russian Federation should continue to strengthen surveillance for AFP cases, ensure processing of all specimens at a WHO-accredited poliovirus laboratory, maintain high routine immunization coverage against polio, and conduct supplementary OPV immunization activities as needed to close gaps in population immunity.",
          "As per recommendations in the WHO's International Travel and Health guidelines, travelers to and from polio-affected countries should be fully protected by vaccination. Travelers who have in the past received three or more doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before departure. Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to a polio-infected area should have a complete course of polio vaccination. Travelers from polio-affected areas should have a full course of vaccination against polio before leaving, with a minimum one dose of OPV before departure.",

The number, geographic extent and target age groups of further campaigns will be determined by the Government based on the evolving epidemiology. The multi-country campaign may be further expanded to cover additional bordering at-risk areas. New cases continue to be reported.",
          "Countries across central Africa should strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also address any gaps in polio immunization coverage to minimise the consequences of a poliovirus introduction. As per the recommendations in the WHO publication International Travel and Health, travellers to and from all countries where polio is circulating, including the Republic of Congo and Angola, should be fully protected by vaccination.",
          "Given the recent progress towards polio eradication in Nigeria (98% reduction in cases in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009), rapidly stopping the persistent poliovirus transmission in central Africa (i.e. Angola, DR Congo) and stopping new polio outbreaks such as in Congo, are top international disease control priorities.",

          "The case was identified as a 27 year-old fisherman working in the Gambia (Tandji locality) who presented with clinical symptoms of fever and jaundice. Blood specimens from the patient were laboratory tested at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar and found to be IgM positive by ELISA and confirmed with PRNT, a more specific test. The patient had no history of yellow fever vaccination.",

          "Through WHO, the Gambia has been informed of the situation in order to assess the epidemiological situation in Tandji locality.",
          "Senegal conducted a yellow fever preventive mass vaccination campaign in 2007, targeting more than 3.1 million people in all 18 districts not previously protected through outbreak response. In the health district of Thies, 314 713 people were targeted and vaccination coverage of 91.8% (88.3 - 95.3%) was achieved. This preventive campaign was part of the global Yellow Fever Initiative which aims to prevent yellow fever epidemics and secure adequate yellow fever vaccine supply for Africa. Routine infant immunization coverage against yellow fever in Senegal was 79% in 2009.",
          "After the Gambia yellow fever outbreak in 1978-1979, a village-based serological retrospective study estimated some 8000 cases and 1700 deaths had occurred. According to some reports, the national vaccination coverage was estimated to be 95% in January 1979. The national routine infant immunization coverage reported for 2009 was 99%.",
          "In the face of high routine and recent preventive vaccination coverage in both Senegal and the Gambia, an epidemic is not anticipated and emergency vaccination is not required at this time. Investigation around sporadic cases may identify pockets of unimmunized individuals and guide immunization and vector control strategies at the local level for those at risk."

          "8 September 2010 - Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) are experiencing outbreaks of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1).",
          "In Angola, the outbreak which began in April 2007, has this year spread to re-infect previously polio-free areas in Angola (the provinces of Bie, Bengo, Huambo, Lunda Norte, Lunda Sul and Uige), as well as to neighbouring DR Congo, re-infecting Kasai Occidental province which borders Angola. This outbreak is classified as 're-established' transmission, as it has persisted for a period greater than 12 months.",
          "In DR Congo, in addition to newly-imported virus from Angola this year, a case detected in Katanga province with onset of paralysis on 20 June 2010, in the east of the country, has been genetically-linked to virus previously imported from Angola, last detected in eastern DR Congo in 2008. In 2009, a case was detected in Burundi, which was linked to the same transmission chain. DR Congo was previously regarded by the Advisory Committee on Poliomyelitis Eradication (ACPE) has having 'suspected' re-established transmission, and this suspicion is now confirmed.",
          "Given the recent progress achieved in Nigeria (99% reduction in cases this year compared to the same period in 2009), west Africa (no cases since 1 May 2010) and the Horn of Africa (no cases in more than 12 months), central Africa is now considered to be the greatest risk to Africa's polio eradication efforts. Angola's outbreak is currently the only geographically expanding outbreak in Africa. This situation increases the risk to achieving the next global milestone of the new Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Strategic Plan 2010-2012, the cessation of all re-established WPV transmission by end-2010.",
          "There is currently a high risk of international spread of WPV from Angola and DR Congo, given the limited impact to date of control measures and the historical cross-border spread from both countries. In 2010, outbreak response in both countries has been inadequate to stop transmission of the imported viruses. Independent monitoring of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) indicate as many as 25% of children are regularly missed during SIAs in key areas of Angola (including Luanda, Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul). In DR Congo, no response activities have been conducted in the east of the country since November 2009. The outbreaks require urgent action to reach a higher proportion of children with oral polio vaccine (OPV) across Angola and DR Congo and improve surveillance across Angola and DR Congo. Due to sub-national surveillance gaps, further undetected circulation of WPV1 cannot be ruled out. Given the increasingly widespread transmission of WPV1 in Angola and documented spread to DR Congo, the World Health Organization (WHO) considers the risk of further international spread as high. Given persistent undetected transmission of WPV1 in eastern DR Congo, and historical evidence of international spread, WHO considers the risk of further international spread as high.",
          "Urgent improvements are needed during SIAs and to fill sub-national surveillance gaps for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), through strengthened engagement and ownership by provincial- and district-level political and administrative leadership. In Angola, National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned for September, and additional responses are being discussed. In DR Congo, SIAs are being carried out in response to the new importations, and an urgent SIA and surveillance strengthening plan is being developed in response to the detection of the new case in the east of the country which confirmed persistent undetected transmission in that area.",
          "It is important that countries across central Africa and the Horn of Africa strengthen AFP surveillance, in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also strengthen population immunity levels to minimise the consequences of any virus introduction. As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International Travel and Health , guidance travelers to and from Angola and DR Congo should be fully protected by vaccination.",

          "In India, the current national influenza H1N1 2009 epidemic, which first began during late May and June 2010 in the southern state of Kerala (co-incident with start of the monsoon rains), continues to remain regionally intense in several western and southern states as well as the in the capital. The western state of Maharashtra, which to date, has detected the highest numbers of cases (including fatal cases), continues to record the most intense influenza H1N1 2009 activity, however, the rate of increase in the numbers of new cases reported per week appears to have slowed during mid-August 2010, suggesting that current epidemic activity may be peaking. Increasing H1N1 2009 activity has also been reported in Delhi since early August 2010, and in the southern states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh since late July 2010. A number of other states, primarily in western and northern India, reported small numbers of new cases during the third week of August 2010, suggesting that low level circulation of H1N1 2009 may be more geographically extensive. Since late July 2010, the vast majority of influenza virus detections have been H1N1 2009.",
          "In New Zealand, H1N1 2009 virus transmission remains active and locally intense, particularly in areas that were less affected during last winter's first pandemic wave. As of the third week of August 2010, the overall national weekly rate of consultations for ILI continued to increase above the seasonal baseline for the fourth consecutive week, however, the rate of increase in ILI consultations appears have slowed during the most recent reporting week, suggesting that peak epidemic activity may occur in the weeks ahead. Although the overall national rates of ILI consultations has not exceeded levels seen during the 2009 winter pandemic wave, several areas of New Zealand, most notably Hawke's Bay, Hutt Valley and Lakes, are all reporting local rates of ILI consultations that match or surpass rates seen at the national level at the peak of last winter's pandemic wave. The vast majority of influenza virus detections during the current epidemic period have been H1N1 2009.",

However, overall national rates of ILI consultations remain well below levels observed during the 2009 winter pandemic wave. The majority of recent influenza virus isolations have been characterized as H1N1 2009, however, seasonal H3N2 viruses have also been detected at low levels. Of note, an online influenza surveillance system that tracks the rate of ILI in the community found that recent increases in the rate of ILI have been among persons who were unvaccinated against H1N1 2009 virus. Although significantly fewer severe and total cases of H1N1 2009 virus infection have been detected this year compared to last winter, the median age of H1N1 2009 virus infected cases appears to similar although slightly older (21 vs. 26 years old).",

Influenza H1N1 (2009) virus transmission appears to be locally intense in parts of the country that were less affected during last winter's pandemic wave; however, to date, the overall national rate of ILI consultations and the numbers of severe and fatal cases of H1N1 (2009) remain below levels observed during the 2009 winter pandemic wave. The majority of influenza viruses detected during the current winter epidemic have been H1N1 (2009).",
          "In India, community transmission of H1N1 (2009) remained active and moderately intense in several states, most notably in the states of Maharashtra but also in several other western and southern states (Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu). Between mid-June 2010 and the second week of August 2010, the state of Maharashtra reported consecutive weekly increases in the number of new cases, including numbers of new fatal cases; the epidemic does not appear to have peaked in Maharashtra but the rate of increase in the numbers of new cases appears to have slowed. The epidemic appears to have stabilized or begun to decline in several other affected states.

The current epidemic of influenza H1N1 (2009) does not appear to have peaked yet in these states. Overall, 79 new laboratory confirmed H1N1 (2009) associated deaths were officially reported across India during the week of August 2-8. During last two weeks of July 2010, more than 1/3 of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza virus in the state of Maharashtra, all of which were H1N1 (2009). In the southern Indian state of Kerala, where recent influenza activity in India was first detected, transmission of H1N1 (2009) virus appears to have peaked during late June and early July 2010 and has declined substantially since. Seasonal influenza B viruses are also known to be currently circulating in India, although at lower levels than H1N1 (2009) viruses.",

          "Weekly update",
          "6 August 2010 - As of 1 August 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18449 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The overall situation remains largely unchanged since the last update. Globally, pandemic influenza transmission remains most active in parts of South Asia and in limited areas of tropical South and Central America. In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall seasonal and pandemic influenza activity remains low, except in South Africa, where peak wintertime influenza transmission due to circulating seasonal influenza viruses (H3N2 and type B) might have recently occurred. Seasonal influenza viruses, particularly H3N2 viruses, continue to circulate in parts of Central America, East Africa, and Southeast Asia.",
          "During the 2010 winter of the temperate southern hemisphere, the most active areas of influenza virus transmission have been in South Africa, where the majority of influenza virus detections have been seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses; pandemic influenza virus has been detected there only sporadically. Elsewhere in Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, and Australia, overall influenza activity remains low and below levels observed during recent, mild, pre-pandemic influenza seasons; among the latter three countries, pandemic influenza viruses have been detected most frequently, however, low level co-circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B has also been observed. In South Africa, the current wintertime epidemic of seasonal influenza appears to have peaked during early July 2010 and stabilized since then; to date, influenza type B viruses have accounted for a greater proportion of influenza viruses detected among severe (SARI) cases than have influenza H3N2 viruses. Chile and Argentina continue to observe low levels of respiratory diseases in the population, and much of what has been observed in recent months has been due to circulation of respiratory viruses other than influenza, particularly RSV. In Australia and New Zealand there has been a sustained upward trend in the rates of ILI over the past 6-8 weeks, particularly in recent weeks, however, overall rates remain well below those observed during the same period in 2009 during the first pandemic wave in the southern hemisphere. Data on the clinical and epidemiological pattern of pandemic influenza virus infection during the current winter season have been limited due to the fact that there has been limited virus transmission to date; however, preliminary data suggests that the pattern has not changed compared to what was seen last winter during the first pandemic wave in the southern hemisphere.",
          "In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of India, and to a much lesser extent, in parts of Nepal and Bhutan. Transmission appears to have peaked in the southern state of Kerala, while transmission remains moderately intense in the western state of Maharashtra, and may be increasing in several eastern states, including Orissa and West Bengal. Limited, preliminary data suggests that the overall intensity and severity of the current regional epidemics in India do not yet appear to exceed what was observed during the first wave in 2009, however, it is too early make a complete assessment of the situation as the regional epidemics are still evolving. Similarly, there has been no evidence to date to suggest that clinical and epidemiological pattern of pandemic influenza virus infection has changed during the current period of active transmission. Overall, across India, approximately ¼ of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza as of third week of July 2010; however, in at least one region of India, up to 1/3 of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza. In addition to the recent increases in circulation of pandemic influenza viruses in India, there has been, in recent months, active circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses, and to a lesser extent, seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses. In neighboring Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, but not Sri Lanka, there is limited evidence of low levels of pandemic influenza virus transmission, including reports of localized outbreaks in Nepal and Bhutan. In Southeast Asia, low to sporadic levels of co-circulating pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected across the region over the past month.",
          "In the tropical regions of the Americas, active subregional co-circulation of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses continued to be detected during July 2010. Since early June 2010, predominantly seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have circulated in Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras; seasonal influenza B and more recently H3N2 viruses in El Salvador; and, predominantly pandemic influenza and H3N2 viruses in Costa Rica and Columbia.",
          "In sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa), Ghana continued to report sustained transmission of pandemic influenza virus during June and July 2010; during the most recent reporting week, 27% of respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza virus. Limited data indicate that seasonal influenza H3N2 and B viruses continued to circulate at variable levels in parts of eastern Africa and central Africa, respectively. In Cameroon, a sustained period of active transmission of seasonal influenza B viruses, which began during early June 2010, now appears to be subsiding. In Kenya, there has been persistent low level circulation of seasonal H3N2 viruses since late April 2010.",

          "30 July 2010 - As of 25 July 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18398 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "Summary: Worldwide, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remains low. In the southern hemisphere (where the winter season is in progress), current influenza activity remains variable: ranging from low and stable activity in Chile and Argentina, to low but increasing activity in Australia and New Zealand, to elevated and recently peaked activity in South Africa. Significant seasonal and pandemic influenza virus transmission continues to be detected at variable levels across parts of the tropics, particularly in several countries of the Americas and South and Southeast Asia.",
          "In the southern hemisphere, overall influenza virus transmission remains low to sporadic, except in South Africa, where recent wintertime influenza activity appears to have peaked, and in Australia and New Zealand, where influenza activity remains low but continues to increase steadily, particularly in recent weeks. In South Africa, virologic data from outpatient sentinel surveillance suggest that the current period of influenza activity (primarily attributable to circulating seasonal influenza H3N2 and B viruses) began and rose sharply during early June 2010, with a likely peak and decline in activity occurring since the first week of July 2010. Data on the full extent of severe illness associated with recent influenza activity are not yet available, however, early reports suggest the current influenza season has been generally mild in terms of levels of clinical disease in the population. In Australia, overall rates of ILI remain low and have increased only slightly over the past four weeks (through the second week of July 2010); however, of note, the number of viral respiratory disease presentations to the emergency departments in Western Australia increased more dramatically during the same period. Overall, the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza virus was 5% at sentinel laboratories across Australia, of which approximately two-thirds were pandemic influenza viruses and one-third were seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses; respiratory viruses other than influenza continue to predominant in several regions of Australia. In New Zealand, rates of ILI are below the seasonal baseline but have increased steadily over the past month; recent reports suggest that more significant, but geographically uneven increases may have occurred during the third week of July 2010. Although the number of influenza virus detections remains low, the majority of virus isolates in New Zealand have been pandemic influenza virus. The most recent available virologic surveillance data (mid-July 2010) from Chile and Argentina indicate that very low levels of influenza viruses are currently circulating in the southern temperate regions of the Americas; the predominant circulating influenza viruses in Chile and Argentina are pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses, respectively.

          "In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of India, particularly in several western and southern states. The majority of new cases continue to be reported in the southern state of Kerala and in the western state of Maharashtra, the later of which reported a sharp increase in the number of cases, including small numbers of fatal cases, between the second and third week of July 2010. Smaller numbers of new cases have also been recently reported in other southern states and in the eastern state of West Bengal. In neighboring Bangladesh, low level co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to be detected over the month of July 2010. In Southeast Asia, low levels of pandemic influenza virus circulation were detected in several countries during July 2010, including Cambodia, Singapore and Malaysia. Significant levels of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continued to circulate in Singapore.",
          "In sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa), limited data indicate that seasonal influenza H3N2 and B viruses continued to circulate in parts of eastern Africa (Kenya) and central Africa (Cameroon), respectively. Ghana, in West Africa, reported sustained transmission of pandemic influenza virus during June and early July 2010.",
          "In the tropical regions of the Americas, active subregional co-circulation of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses was detected during July 2010. Since early June 2010, predominantly seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have circulated in Panama and Nicaragua; predominantly seasonal influenza B viruses in El Salvador and Bolivia; and predominantly pandemic influenza viruses in Costa Rica and Columbia.",

          "23 July 2010 - The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tajikistan has since 1 January 2010 reported 430 cases of polio following the importation of a wild poliovirus type 1 into the country. Nineteen of the cases were fatal. Seven virologically related cases have been detected in the Russian Federation, the only other country in the WHO European Region to confirm cases. The poliovirus causing the outbreak originated in northern India. This is the first outbreak of polio since the Region was certified polio-free in 2002.",
          "In response to the outbreak, four rounds of national immunization days (NIDs) with oral polio vaccine have been held in Tajikistan. Coverage was reported to be high and confirmed by independent monitors. The most recent round was conducted on 15–19 June (except in Dushanbe and six surrounding regions, where it started on 13 June). Preliminary data report nationwide coverage of 99.3%. Coverage higher than 97% is reported from all regions and in the groups aged 0–6 and 7–15 years.",
          "The most recent polio case had onset on 12 June, and the number of new cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) – of which polio can be one of the causes – being detected and reported to WHO has dropped sharply. However, there is not sufficient virological testing data from the recent AFP cases to revise WHO's assessment of the risk for further international spread, which remains 'high'.",
          "A joint national/international surveillance review is under way, under the auspices of the Ministry of Health, to further inform the current risk assessment and guide additional surveillance and immunization activities. The need for additional rounds of mass oral polio vaccine (OPV) immunization will be based on an ongoing evaluation of epidemiological and laboratory data. International travellers to and from polio affected areas should continue to be adequately immunized against polio as recommended in Chapter 6 of International Travel and Health guidance.",
          "The European Regional Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication met in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 28–29 June 2010. Addressing the meeting, Ms Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe, noted that the outbreak in Tajikistan threatens both the polio-free status of the Region and the eradication of polio globally.",
          "The Commission recognized that the European Region has reached a critical juncture and its polio-free status is in jeopardy. The gravity of the situation requires that all Member States reinforce their polio surveillance so that any spread will be detected rapidly and effective control measures instituted at the earliest possible moment.",
          "Neighbouring countries are responding to the outbreak by heightening surveillance while reviewing immunization status of children and conducting necessary supplementary immunization activities. Uzbekistan has held three national rounds of supplementary immunization with efforts to synchronize these rounds with Tajikistan in May and June. The first round of nationwide NIDs started in Turkmenistan on 12 July 2010, and Kyrgyzstan started its first round on 19 July.",

          "23 July 2010 - As of 18 July 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18366 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "Globally pandemic influenza activity remains low. The most active areas of influenza transmission remained in the tropical zones; primarily in West Africa, Central America, the Caribbean, and South and Southeast Asia, although activity is localized to relatively small areas in each region. In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, Australia and New Zealand have showed signs of increased respiratory disease in recent weeks. Both countries have continued to detect low levels of predominantly pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. In South Africa, the influenza season is well under way and is predominantly associated with seasonal influenza B and H3N2 viruses and small numbers of pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses.",
          "In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza activity remained low but with notable increases in recent weeks in some areas. South Africa had been experiencing a sharp increase in the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive for influenza viruses since late June 2010. For the current reporting week, 30-40% of sentinel respiratory samples from patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI)/influenza-like-illness (ILI) tested positive for influenza. Respiratory disease activity was associated primarily with seasonal influenza B and H3N2 viruses, with a much smaller number of pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses. Australia has reported a gradual increase in the number of respiratory disease consultations due to ILI since end of June to early July 2010 although this is of similar to the levels experienced in 2008. This increase of respiratory disease activity may be accounted for in part by circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Influenza viruses in Australia have been about 2/3 pandemic H1N1 influenza and 1/3 seasonal influenza H3N2. In New Zealand, rates of ILI have markedly increased compared to the previous reporting week but still remained below the seasonal baseline, primarily associated with pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. In Chile and Argentina, national rates of ILI remained low relative to last year at the same period of time.",
          "In Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remained low. The most active areas of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus transmission are in India, Cambodia and Singapore. Significant transmission of pandemic H1N1 influenza is occurring in the Southern states of Kerala and the Western state of Maharashtra, India. Cambodia has recently observed an increase in the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive for influenza virus (primarily pandemic H1N1 influenza and seasonal influenza H3N2) since early June 2010. In Singapore, levels of acute respiratory infections (ARI) have increased the past four weeks (through the week ending July 17). The proportion of patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic H1N1 influenza continues to be stable (15%); however, seasonal H3N2 viruses are currently the predominant circulating type/subtype of influenza viruses in Singapore.",
          "In sub-Saharan Africa, the current situation was largely unchanged since the last update. Pandemic H1N1 and seasonal influenza activity continued to be observed in several countries. Ghana has had a sustained circulation of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus since June 2010. Small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continued to be detected in eastern Africa.",
          "In the tropical regions of the Americas, the situation has remained similar to the previous week. Overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity were low, except in pockets of Central and South America with co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses (Costa Rica had predominantly pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, while Nicaragua and Panama had predominantly influenza H3N2 virus).",

          "Weekly update",
          "16 July 2010 - As of 12 July, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18337deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "Worldwide, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low. The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of South Asia, West Africa, and Central America. In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, pandemic and seasonal influenza activity has remained low during the first half of the southern hemisphere winter, except in South Africa, where increased detections of primarily seasonal influenza viruses (type B and H3N2) were reported during late June and early July 2010. Seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continue to circulate at varying levels across parts of the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Increased seasonal influenza activity continues to be observed in several countries of Central America.",
          "To date, most countries of the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, with the exception of South Africa, have reported low overall levels of respiratory disease activity and low to sporadic levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza virus circulation during the first half of the southern hemisphere winter season. Pandemic influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically or at low levels in most of these countries. As reported last week, South Africa began observing a sharp increase in the proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza virus (primarily seasonal influenza B and H3N2) during late June 2010, reaching a peak of ~50% detection rate during the first week of July 2010, and falling to ~40% during the second week of July 2010. In Chile (as of late June 2010) and Argentina (as of early July 2010), the most recent available data show that influenza activity remains sporadic in Argentina and low in Chile (~5% respiratory samples tested positive for influenza, 84% of which were pandemic virus with small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B detected as well). In both Chile and Argentina, RSV has been the predominant circulating respiratory virus since mid-April 2010. In Australia, as of the last week of June 2010, overall rates of ILI remained low and below levels observed during the same period in past three winter seasons. Although a small cluster of pandemic influenza cases, including a few hospitalized cases, were recently detected in the Northern Territory of Australia, pandemic and seasonal influenza virus detections remain otherwise sporadic, albeit slightly increased during late June and early July 2010. Similarly, in New Zealand, rates of ILI have remained low and below the seasonal baseline, with only sporadic detections of pandemic and seasonal H3N2 viruses through the first week of July 2010. In both Australia and New Zealand, current levels of ILI are similar to those observed during the same period in 2008, when the influenza season was noted to have arrived and peaked late in winter.",
          "In Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic, except in parts of southern and western India, Malaysia, and Singapore. As reported last week, in India, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active but stable in the southern state of Kerala. The extent of illness in the community is currently being assessed and monitored by the Government of India. Similar numbers of new cases, including small numbers of fatal cases, have been reported on a weekly basis since transmission first increased during mid-June 2010. Recent, small increases in pandemic influenza virus circulation have also been observed since mid-June 2010 in other southern and western states of India, particularly in the western state of Maharashtra. In Singapore, levels of ARI increased during the first two weeks of July 2010; however, the intensity of pandemic influenza virus transmission has declined during June and July 2010 after peaking in May 2010. The proportion of patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic influenza virus in Singapore remained stable (14-16%) during first two weeks of July 2010. In addition, substantial co-circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses (with pandemic H1N1 virus) was detected in Singapore throughout May and June 2010. In Malaysia, numbers of new cases of pandemic influenza continued to decline; overall pandemic influenza activity fell substantially in June and early July 2010 after peaking during mid-April to mid-May 2010. Low levels of seasonal influenza type B viruses (and to much lesser extent pandemic influenza virus) continue to circulate across northern and southern China as levels of ILI remain stable and near seasonal levels seen in the same period in recent years. Low levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza (H3N2 and type B) viruses also continued to circulate in Hong Kong SAR (China), Chinese Taipei, and parts of Thailand.",
          "In the tropical regions of the Americas, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remained low, except in parts of Central and South America, where there has been recent active co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses. The majority of recent active transmission of pandemic influenza virus has been reported in Colombia, Costa Rica, and to a lesser extent in Cuba. In Colombia, although low level circulation of pandemic influenza viruses has persisted throughout the first half 2010, a second period of active transmission began in mid-May 2010, peaked in June 2010, has now largely subsided during the second of week of July 2010. Similarly, in Costa Rica, low level circulation of pandemic virus has persisted throughout 2010, however, there has been a recent resurgence in active transmission (though less intense than the initial 2009 wave) of pandemic influenza virus during June 2010. As reported previously, in Panama, a sharp increase in the circulation influenza A viruses (particularly H3N2, but also small numbers of pandemic H1N1) was reported over the month of June 2010; a high intensity of respiratory diseases and a moderate impact on healthcare services continued to be reported during the second week of July 2010. In Nicaragua, recent active transmission of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses, which began during late May 2010 and peaked during mid June 2010, appears to have largely subsided during recent weeks. Many countries in the region continue to report ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV.",
          "In sub-Saharan Africa, the current situation is largely unchanged since the last update. Pandemic and seasonal influenza activity continues to be observed in several countries. Ghana, in West Africa, continued to have a sustained resurgence in circulation of pandemic influenza virus during June 2010, more than several months after the first period of pandemic activity peaked (early April 2010). Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate in parts of central and southern Africa, particularly in Cameroon, where an increase in influenza type B virus circulation was observed during June 2010. Small numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to be detected across Africa, particularly in eastern and southern Africa; the most recent detections have been reported in Kenya and South Africa.",

          "9 July 2010 - As of 4 July, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18311 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "Worldwide, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low. Active circulation of pandemic influenza virus persists in areas of the tropics, particularly in South and Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and West Africa. Overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity has remained low during the early part of the current winter season in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere. Low levels of seasonal influenza (H3N2 and type B) viruses were detected during June 2010 in South Africa, while Chile, Australia, and New Zealand, have all recently detected low levels of predominantly pandemic influenza virus. Increasing seasonal influenza activity has also recently been observed in several countries of Central America.",
          "Although rates of respiratory disease have begun to increase in several countries of the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, little pandemic or seasonal influenza activity has been seen so far during early part of the winter season. In South Africa, a sharp increase in the detection rate of influenza virus, primarily seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B, was observed during the later part of June and early July (> 40% of sentinel respiratory samples from patients with ILI tested positive for influenza during the first week of July); however, levels of respiratory illness-related outpatient consultations and hospitalizations do not appear to be significantly elevated. In Australia, slight increases in the rates of ILI have been reported in recent weeks, however, the overall number of influenza virus detections (primarily pandemic H1N1 and seasonal H3N2) remain low. In New Zealand, rates of ILI have steadily increased over the month of June; however, only small numbers of predominantly pandemic influenza virus have been detected so far. In both Australia and New Zealand, current levels of ILI are similar to those observed during the same period in 2008, when the influenza season was noted to have arrived and peaked late in winter. In Chile, overall levels of ILI remain very low; less than 5% of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza in late June 2010 (the majority were pandemic H1N1 virus with small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B detected as well). In Argentina, overall levels of ILI remained low and below levels observed during the past three winter influenza seasons; only small numbers of seasonal influenza type B viruses have been detected during recent weeks. In both Chile and Argentina, RSV has been the predominant circulating respiratory virus since mid-April 2010.",
          "In Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic, except in parts of India, Malaysia, and Singapore. In India, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active but stable in the southern state of Kerala; similar numbers of new, severe and fatal cases have been reported on a weekly basis since transmission first increased during mid-June 2010. Smaller increases in pandemic influenza virus circulation have also been observed since mid-June 2010 in other southern and western states of India. In Singapore, levels of ARI and pandemic influenza virus transmission declined during June 2010 after peaking in May 2010; the proportion of patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic influenza virus remained stable at 16% during the first week of July 2010. Of note, substantial co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses was detected in Singapore throughout May and June 2010. In Malaysia, declining numbers of new cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported suggesting that overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline substantially in June 2010 after peaking during mid-April to mid-May 2010. Very low level of seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate across China, Hong Kong SAR (China), Chinese Taipei and the Republic of Korea.",
          "In the tropical regions of the Americas, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remained low, except in parts of Central America, where there has been recent active co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal H3N2 viruses. In Panama, a sharp increase in the circulation influenza A viruses (particularly H3N2, but also small numbers of pandemic H1N1) was reported over the month of June 2010; during the most recent reporting week, a high intensity of respiratory diseases and a moderate impact on healthcare services was reported. In Nicaragua, recent active transmission of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses, which began during late May 2010 and peaked during mid June 2010, appears to have largely subsided during recent weeks. In Colombia, a recent period of active pandemic influenza virus transmission, spanning mid May to mid June 2010, now appears to have largely subsided. Many countries in the region continue to report ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV.",
          "In sub-Saharan Africa, the current situation is largely unchanged since the last update. Pandemic and seasonal influenza activity continues to be observed in several countries. Ghana, in West Africa, continues to have active circulation of pandemic influenza virus several months after activity peaked during early April 2010. Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate in parts of central and southern Africa, particularly in Cameroon. Small numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to be detected across Africa, particularly in eastern Africa; the most recent detections have been reported in Kenya and South Africa.",

          "7 July 2010 - A major outbreak of lead poisoning in children has been occurring in Zamfara State, Nigeria since at least March 2010, related to the processing of lead-rich ore for the extraction of gold.",
          "During March-April the Zamfara State Ministry of Health was informed by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) of an increasing number of childhood deaths and illness in villages in the two Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Bukkuyum and Anka. At the request of the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health, the United States Centers for Disease Control (US CDC) deployed a response team to assist in investigating this outbreak. At the same time, the Blacksmith Institute sent a team from TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering Inc to conduct an environmental assessment. These teams worked with the national and state authorities, MSF, and the country office of the World Health Organization (WHO). The investigations confirmed severe lead poisoning in more than 100 children in the villages of Dareta and Yargalma, with a mean blood lead concentration of 119 μg/dL (levels as low as 10 μg/dL are associated with impaired neurological development in young children). Moreover, lead concentrations in soil of >100,000 ppm were found in and around habitations in the villages (the limit for residential areas applied in the USA and France is 400 ppm).",
          "The Nigerian authorities requested WHO to provide further technical and financial assistance to contain the current outbreak and prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO deployed a team comprising three epidemiologists, a clinical toxicologist, a paediatrician, an environmental health expert and a laboratory specialist. This team, working with staff from the State Ministry of Health, confirmed a high degree of environmental lead contamination from the same cause in 5 additional villages (Tungar-dadj, Abare, Duza and Sunke (Anka LGA), and Tungar-guru (Bukuyum LGA)). A random sample of 56 children under 5 years from the villages of Abare and Tungar-guru revealed that >90% had blood lead concentrations above 45 μg/dL (for which chelation therapy is recommended) and >70% had concentrations above 70 μg/dL (for which urgent treatment is needed). A high incidence of convulsions and death in young children has been noted in these villages, and there is a strong likelihood that this is due to lead poisoning. An extrapolation from the above figures suggests that >2000 individuals are in need of chelation therapy in the 5 villages. Data from the State Ministry of Health hospital registry suggest there are still more villages where lead poisoning may be a problem.",
          "MSF is currently providing chelation therapy for around 100 children in two specially established units within the general hospitals of Bukkuyum and Anka. WHO has been collaborating with MSF and a number of international clinical toxicologists on the development of treatment protocols. The WHO team has also helped to set up a laboratory service for measuring blood lead concentrations in Gusau, and has provided training in surveillance and the management of lead poisoning.",
          "In order to prevent further deaths and long-term neurological impairment in affected children it is essential that the lead contamination is removed from villages and particularly the domestic compounds. In addition, it is essential that poisoned children are identified and given appropriate chelation therapy. For chelation therapy to be effective, however, children must be removed from exposure to lead, which means that they cannot return to their homes after treatment until their environment has been cleaned. The Blacksmith Institute and TerraGraphics are working with the Zamfara State authorities to decontaminate the villages of Dareta and Yargalma. Considerably more resources are needed to decontaminate the other 5 villages and to identify and treat all of the children, as well as affected adults (in particular pregnant women) in these villages.",

          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "Worldwide, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remains low. Active transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists in parts of the tropics, particularly in the Caribbean, West Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. Pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically during the early part of winter in the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. Global circulation of seasonal influenza virus type B viruses has declined substantially and persists at low levels in parts of East Asia, Central Africa, and Central America. During the past month, seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have been detected at low levels across parts of East Africa and South America.",
          "In most countries of the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere (Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand) pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically during the first two weeks of June 2010 and overall levels of respiratory disease in the population remain low. In Chile, during the second week of June, approximately 1% samples tested positive for influenza (the majority were pandemic influenza virus). In Argentina, small numbers of influenza type B viruses were detected during early June 2010. In both Chile and Argentina, respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) continued to be the predominant circulating respiratory virus. In South Africa, very small numbers of seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses were detected since the beginning of June 2010. In both Australia and New Zealand, levels of ILI are below recent historical seasonal levels and there have been only sporadic detections of seasonal or pandemic influenza virus during the first half of June 2010.",
          "In Asia, the most active areas pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of southern India, Bangladesh, Singapore, and Malaysia. In India, there have been recent reports of increasing pandemic influenza activity in the southern state of Kerala, including reports of small numbers of severe and fatal cases, particularly among pregnant women; the extent of illness in the community is currently being assessed. In Bangladesh, pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to co-circulate at low levels during early June 2010. In Thailand, limited data suggests that there continues to be low levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza virus co-circulating in parts of the country. In Singapore, during the third week of June 2010, levels of ARI declined below warning levels and the proportion of patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic influenza virus fell from 28% to 19%. In Malaysia, limited data suggests that overall pandemic influenza activity declined throughout June 2010 as pandemic virus continued to circulate at low levels. Throughout East Asia, overall pandemic and seasonal activity remained very low to sporadic. In China and Japan, levels of ILI remained at or below baseline levels for the summer months. Low and declining levels of seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to circulate across China, Hong Kong SAR (China), and Chinese Taipei.",
          "In the tropical regions of the Americas, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remained very low, except in Cuba and Colombia, where low levels of pandemic influenza virus continue to circulate (approximately 8% of respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza in both countries during the early part of June 2010). In Cuba, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active but has declined substantially since peaking during mid-April to mid-May 2010; no new fatal cases have been reported over the past four reporting weeks. In Colombia, persistent but low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus has increased slightly since late May 2010; however, the overall level of respiratory diseases in the population was reported to be low to moderate during mid June 2010. In several countries of the region, there has been recent circulation of seasonal influenza viruses including type A (Venezuela during May 2010) and B (Bolivia during March and May 2010; El Salvador during late May and early June 2010). Variable ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including RSV, continues to be reported across the region.",
          "In sub-Saharan Africa, pandemic and seasonal influenza activity has been limited to several countries. Ghana, in West Africa, continued to have active circulation of pandemic influenza virus long after overall activity peaked during early April 2010; the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive for pandemic influenza virus increased from 16% to 23% during the first two weeks of June 2010. Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate in parts of central and southern Africa, most notably in Cameroon. As reported in previous updates, small numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to be detected across Africa, particularly in eastern Africa; the most recent detections have been reported in Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa during the second week of June 2010. The persistence of H3N2 in this area over time very likely represents sustained community transmission of the virus.",

          "Weekly update",
          "18 June 2010 - As of 13 June, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18172 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The situation remains largely unchanged since the last update. Overall pandemic influenza activity remains low worldwide with geographically limited circulation of pandemic influenza virus in parts of the tropics, particularly in parts of Central America and the Caribbean and in parts of South and Southeast Asia. Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate at low levels across Asia and to a lesser extent across parts of Africa and South America. Recently re-emerged seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continue to circulate in East Africa. As countries of the temperate southern hemisphere enter winter, overall only sporadic influenza activity has been detected so far.",
          "In tropical region of the Americas, low or waning circulation of pandemic virus has been primarily reported in Costa Rica (since early 2010) and in Cuba (last reported at the end of May 2010), respectively. In Cuba and to a lesser extent in Costa Rica, recent pandemic influenza activity has been associated with small numbers of fatal cases. In Colombia, during the first week of June 2010, an increasing trend of respiratory diseases was associated with regional spread of pandemic influenza activity and a small number of new fatal cases, likely reflecting increasing but low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus. Throughout the rest of the region, there have been only sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus during the past month. In several countries of the region, there has been recent circulation of seasonal influenza viruses including type A (Venezuela since May 2010) and B (Bolivia since March 2010). Throughout the region there has been variable ongoing co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, particularly RSV.",
          "In Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to actively circulate in Malaysia, Singapore, and to a much lesser extent in parts of India, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. In Malaysia, limited data suggest that virus transmission persists but continues to decline; the number of new cases reported per week plateaued during mid-April 2010 and began to decline at the end of May 2010. In Singapore, during the second week of June 2010, the levels of ARI remained near the warning level but below the epidemic threshold; approximately 28% of respiratory samples from patients with ILI tested positive for pandemic influenza virus. In South Asia, low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus has persisted in western India (since early 2010) and Bangladesh (since late February 2010); in India but not Bangladesh, regional, low intensity transmission during 2010 has been associated with small numbers of fatal cases over time. Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to co-circulate with pandemic influenza virus in Bangladesh and have only recently emerged and become predominant in India, although at low levels. Of note, there have been recent media reports of increasing pandemic influenza activity in the southern Indian state of Kerala and more information is expected to become available soon. In Bhutan, there have recent reports of school outbreaks of pandemic influenza virus infection in three separate areas of the country, however, the overall intensity of respiratory diseases in the population was reported to be low.",
          "In Sub-Saharan Africa, pandemic influenza virus continued to circulate at low levels in limited areas of East and West Africa. During the first week of June 2010, 10% and 16% of all respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza virus in Tanzania and Ghana, respectively. Small but significant numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to be been detected in Kenya and Tanzania since late May 2010.",
          "Overall, in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, pandemic influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically during the past month. In the temperate southern hemisphere, only two countries, Chile and Uruguay, have recently reported small numbers of pandemic influenza virus detections. Other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV, are known to be circulating in Chile and Argentina. During first two weeks of June 2010, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses have been detected in South Africa. In New Zealand and Australia, overall levels of ILI remain low; only sporadic detections of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses have been recently reported in Australia.",

As countries of the temperate southern hemisphere enter winter, only sporadic influenza activity has been detected so far, except in Chile and Uruguay, both of which have recently reported small numbers of pandemic influenza virus detections. Although seasonal influenza B viruses have been the predominant type of influenza virus circulating worldwide since the end of February 2010, there have been increasing but low level detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses, particularly in South America and in East Africa.",
          "In the tropics of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza activity is low, however, both seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses are actively circulating in parts of tropical South America. Active but declining transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to be detected primarily in Cuba. Since early 2010, pandemic influenza virus has circulated at low levels in Costa Rica. Sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus continue to be reported in Brazil. During the most recent reporting week (last week of May 2010), both Brazil and Venezuela reported regional spread of influenza activity associated with an increasing trend of respiratory diseases. In Venezuela, recent influenza activity (which began during early May 2010) has been predominantly due to circulating seasonal influenza A viruses. In Bolivia, circulation of seasonal influenza viruses, predominantly type B, was observed between March and May 2010 and now appears to be subsiding.",
          "In Asia overall pandemic influenza virus transmission remains low, except in parts of tropical South and Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore, Malaysia, and Bangladesh. In Singapore, overall levels of ARI remained slightly below the epidemic threshold and the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive for pandemic influenza virus increased slightly to 34% (during the last week of May 2010). In Malaysia, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus transmission has begun to decline since plateauing during May 2010. In Bangladesh, there has been stable persistent low level co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza B viruses since March 2010. Sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus continued to be reported across other parts of Asia. In East Asia, overall influenza activity remains low, however, seasonal influenza B viruses continue to circulate at low and declining levels.",

During the most recent reporting week, 13% of all respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza virus in Ghana. Small but significant numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses have been detected in Kenya and Tanzania since late May 2010.",

In the temperate southern hemisphere, only two countries, Chile and Uruguay, have recently reported small numbers of pandemic influenza virus detections. In Chile, there was low level geographically limited circulation of pandemic influenza virus during May 2010; 3.4% of respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza virus during the last week of May 2010. Of note, in Uruguay, 11 (44%) of 25 samples tested positive for pandemic influenza during the most recent reporting week (the last week of May 2010); however, the corresponding intensity of respiratory diseases in the population is not yet known. Other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV, are known to be circulating in Chile and Argentina. There have been no recent detections of pandemic influenza virus in South Africa.

In the countries of temperate southern hemisphere there is no evidence yet to suggest that the winter influenza season has begun, however there has been limited localized pandemic influenza virus transmission in Chile. In the rest of the world, overall pandemic influenza virus transmission remains low. Seasonal influenza B viruses are currently the predominant type of influenza virus circulating globally, although at low levels. Of note, during the later part of May 2010, low but significant levels of predominantly seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have been detected in several countries of East Africa.",
          "In the tropical zone of the Americas, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission continue to be in parts of the Caribbean. In Cuba, pandemic influenza virus transmission has begun to decline after plateauing since mid-April 2010. In both Costa Rica and Columbia, there has been persistence of low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus since the beginning of 2010. Sporadic detections of pandemic and other seasonal influenza viruses, particularly type B, have been reported from several countries in the region during May 2010. Other respiratory viruses, for example RSV, are known to be circulating to varying extents in different countries across the region.",
          "In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of South and Southeast Asia, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, and to a lesser extent in Bangladesh. In Singapore, during the last week of May 2010, levels of ARI fell below the epidemic threshold and the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive for pandemic influenza fell from 39% to 29%. In Malaysia and Bangladesh, the numbers of new cases reported per week have been relative stable for the past 6 and 3 weeks, respectively, suggesting stable persistence of low level pandemic virus circulation during the past month in these areas. Very low levels of pandemic influenza virus also continue to circulate in parts of western and southern India, and in parts of Thailand. Sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus have been reported in many countries across the region during the past month. In East Asia, overall influenza activity remains low, however, seasonal influenza B viruses continue to circulate at low and declining levels across the region.",
          "In Sub-Saharan Africa, active but declining levels of pandemic influenza virus transmission continue to be detected in parts of West Africa, most notably in Ghana. During the most recent reporting week, 15% of all respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza virus in Ghana. Sporadic detections of seasonal influenza B continue to be reported in central Africa. Of note, low but significant numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses were recently detected in Kenya (6 of 57 respiratory samples tested) and Tanzania (13 of 25 respiratory samples tested) during the most recent reporting week.",
          "Overall, in the temperate regions of the northern and southern hemisphere, pandemic influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically during the past month. In the temperate southern hemisphere, Chile is the only country to recently report small number of pandemic influenza cases in a few areas of the country suggesting that overall transmission is currently limited. Other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV, are known to be circulating in Chile, Paraguay, and Argentina. There have been no recent detections of pandemic influenza virus in South Africa. In New Zealand and Australia, overall levels of ILI remain low; only sporadic detections of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses have been recently reported in Australia.",

          "The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia, where low level circulation is occurring. Except for localized areas of pandemic influenza activity in parts of Chile, there is little evidence of pandemic influenza activity in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere. Of note, Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) is widely circulating in South America resulting in an increase in respiratory disease activity, complicating somewhat the interpretation of syndromic surveillance data from the area. RSV primarily affects children under the age of 5 years. Seasonal influenza A viruses continue to be detected at low to sporadic levels in all regions. Influenza B has been reported in increasing but low numbers in South America, where it only recently appeared, while it is decreasing in Asia.",
          "In the Caribbean and Central America, Cuba and to a much lesser extent Costa Rica, continue to experience active circulation of pandemic influenza virus. In Cuba, current pandemic influenza activity, which began during late February 2010, remains unchanged since reaching a plateau during mid-April 2010; in addition, over the past month, there have been sporadic detections of seasonal influenza B viruses and also evidence of co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. In Costa Rica, sustained low levels of pandemic influenza virus have been co-circulating with other respiratory viruses since the beginning of 2010. Several other countries in the region continue to report sporadic detections of seasonal influenza B viruses and low level co-circulation of other respiratory viruses.",
          "In the tropical zone of South America, pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses continued to circulate at low to sporadic levels. In Peru, recent regional increases in respiratory diseases activity (in children under age 5) has been largely associated with circulating respiratory syncitial virus (RSV). In Colombia and Brazil, low levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have been detected over the past month. In Bolivia, a recent period of circulation of predominantly seasonal influenza type B viruses appears to have concluded.",
          "In Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic, except in limited areas of south and southeast Asia, particularly Singapore, Malaysia, and Bangladesh. In Singapore, levels of ARI have been elevated since April 2010 and in recent weeks have remained near epidemic threshold; approximately 39% of respiratory specimens from ILI patients tested positive for pandemic influenza virus during mid May 2010. In neighboring Malaysia, limited data suggest that active pandemic influenza virus circulation persist after recent activity peaked during mid April 2010; small numbers of fatal cases have been reported since that time. In Bangladesh, co-dominant circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza B viruses has been observed since mid April 2010, however, the overall intensity of respiratory diseases was reported to low during this period. Low levels of pandemic influenza virus continued to circulate in western India, while low and declining levels of seasonal influenza B viruses continued to be reported across East Asia.",

In addition to the persistence of low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus in Ghana, sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus have been reported during the past month in Cameroon, Angola, and Rwanda. In Cameroon, there has been persistent active circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses since mid-March 2010.",

          "The index case was identified as a 16 year-old female student in Kake high school. She presented with a clinical picture of fever and jaundice. Onset of symptoms started on 11 January with fever. She had no history of yellow fever vaccination and survived. The index case was identified through routine yellow fever surveillance system.",
          "Laboratory specimens from this case were found to be IgM positive by ELISA method at the National Laboratory in the Institut Pasteur, Yaoundé, Cameroon and confirmed positive by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)- a more specific test for yellow fever- at the regional reference laboratory for yellow fever at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal.",
          "Following identification of the index case, an outbreak investigation was conducted in the area. The investigation identified one person as symptomatic (fever). Laboratory tests by ELISA method of serum samples for this and 50 other contact were found to be negative.",
          "Cameroon conducted a yellow fever mass vaccination campaign in 62 at-risk-districts covering a population of 7.4 million in May 2009. The two districts of Kumba and Muyuka were however, not part of the campaign as they had no history of yellow fever cases in the past 50 years.",
          "The Ministry of Health plans to vaccinate 345,592 people in Kumba and Muyuka districts. The country has requested support from the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG), which manages the global emergency stockpile of yellow fever vaccine. The ICG has approved support for the vaccination campaign, which will be funded by the GAVI Alliance through the World Health Organization. This support is part of the global Yellow Fever Initiative which aims to prevent devastating yellow fever epidemics and secure adequate yellow fever vaccine supply for Africa.",

          "21 May 2010 - As of 16 May, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18097 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The current situation is largely unchanged since the last update. The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. In the temperate zone of the northern and southern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic. In central Africa, there has been increased transmission of seasonal influenza type B viruses, accounting for 85% of all influenza isolates in the region. Influenza B also continues to be detected at low levels across parts of Asia and Europe, and has now been reported in Central America.",
          "In the tropical region of the Americas, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission continue to be in parts of the Caribbean. In Cuba, a second period of active community transmission of pandemic influenza virus began during late February 2010, peaked during late April 2010, and has been declining since; this second period of transmission, although associated with severe and fatal cases, appears to be less intense overall than the first period of transmission which occurred during late September to late November 2009. In contrast, in the Dominican Republic, low to moderate intensity of respiratory diseases activity has been primarily associated with co-circulation of respiratory viruses other than influenza; only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses have been reported. Low levels of pandemic influenza viruses have been circulating across parts of Central America and tropical areas of South America, for example, in Mexico since December 2009, in Colombia and Brazil since early 2010, and in Guatemala since early April 2010. Nicaragua and Honduras have also been recently reporting geographically regional spread of influenza viruses, however, the relative proportions of seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza, and other respiratory virus detections are not known. In contrast, in Panama, low levels of respiratory disease over the past three months have been primarily associated with circulating respiratory viruses other than influenza. Of note, Bolivia experienced a recent period of low but sustained transmission of seasonal influenza type B viruses between late February and early May 2010. There continues to be evidence from several countries in this region that there is ongoing co-circulation of influenza with other respiratory viruses (including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus).",
          "In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission are in parts of South and Southeast Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Singapore. In Malaysia, limited data suggests that a second period of active pandemic influenza virus transmission has been occurring since early April 2010, but overall activity may have recently stabilized and does not appear to exceed pandemic influenza activity seen during an earlier period of transmission lasting from July until early September 2009. In Singapore, levels of ARI have remained elevated since mid April 2010; during the most recent reporting week, levels of ARI exceeded the epidemic threshold and the proportion of patients with ILI testing positive for pandemic influenza virus infection was 39%. In Bangladesh increased co-circulation of pandemic influenza and seasonal influenza type B viruses has been detected since mid April 2010 but now appears to have stabilized. Low level circulation of pandemic influenza continues to persist in Thailand and in the western and southern parts of India; sporadic detection of pandemic influenza continue to be reported in Cambodia and in the Philippines. In East Asia, only sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus are being reported; seasonal influenza type B viruses have been predominant in this region, however circulation appears to be declining in China and the Republic of Korea.",
          "In the temperate regions of the northern and southern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic. In Australia and New Zealand, slight increases in ILI activity were reported; however, in Australia, these increases have been attributed primarily to circulating respiratory viruses other than influenza. In the southern temperate regions of the Americas, only sporadic detections of influenza viruses have been reported, except in Chile, which continues to report localized areas of increased ILI activity (in the Los Lagos area) associated with co-circulation of pandemic influenza and other respiratory viruses. In Europe, very low to sporadic levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to be detected. Seasonal influenza type B virus persists mainly in parts of eastern and northern Europe. Georgia reported an increase in the number of respiratory disease consultations due to influenza-like-illness (ILI), mainly in children (under age 5) and school-age children (5-14 years old age group); whether this increase is associated with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus is not yet known.",
          "In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data from several countries suggest that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus in West Africa has now largely subsided. In Ghana, 6% of respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza virus during the most recent reporting week. Across the rest of region, the pandemic influenza virus continues to be detected sporadically or at low levels, most recently in Angola and Rwanda. Sporadic detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 and influenza B viruses have been reported in western, central Africa and to a lesser extent southern Africa.",

          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of the Caribbean and Central America, and to a lesser extent in West Africa and South and Southeast Asia. In the temperate zone* of the northern and southern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity remains sporadic. Seasonal influenza virus type B continues to be detected at low levels across parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe.",
          "In the tropical region of the Americas, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains most active in parts of the Caribbean, and to a lesser extent in Central America. In Cuba, pandemic influenza activity continued to decline after a recent period of intense transmission which began during late February 2010 and may have peaked during late April 2010. Geographically widespread pandemic influenza activity was reported in Jamaica (during much of February through May 2010) and in the Dominican Republic (since late April); however, other respiratory viruses are known to be co-circulating in the region and overall respiratory disease activity during this period was reported to remain low to moderate. The overall SARI** rate from sentinel sites in selected Caribbean countries (Dominica and Jamaica) increased since mid April 2010, however, the extent to which this was due circulating pandemic influenza virus versus other respiratory viruses is not known. In Central America and the tropical regions of South America: Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Columbia, Bolivia, and Peru all reported regional spread of influenza during one or more weeks since late April 2010 suggesting that low levels of circulating pandemic influenza virus persist in the region. In addition, there is evidence from several countries in this region that there is ongoing co-circulation of influenza with other respiratory viruses (including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus).",
          "In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of South and Southeast Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Singapore. In Bangladesh, a consistently increasing trend of respiratory disease associated with co-circulation of pandemic influenza and seasonal influenza type B viruses have been reported since mid April 2010; however, the overall intensity of respiratory diseases activity remains low to moderate. In Malaysia, limited data suggest that recent pandemic influenza activity began during early April 2010 and has been stably elevated since mid April 2010. In Singapore, the overall level of ARI remained stably elevated above baseline since early April 2010; 38% of respiratory specimens tested positive for pandemic influenza virus infection during the most recent reporting week. In Thailand, a recent period of sustained transmission of pandemic virus, extending from January until early April 2010, appears to have largely subsided. In India, low levels of pandemic influenza virus continued to be detected in several western and southern states, however, the overall level of respiratory diseases in the population remains low. In Indonesia, a period of low level circulation of seasonal H3N2 viruses which began during early February 2010 now appears to be subsiding. In East Asia, pandemic influenza virus is being detected only sporadically, however, persistent but declining levels of circulating seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to be reported, particularly in China, Hong Kong SAR (China), and in Chinese Taipei.",
          "In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data from several countries suggest that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to decline in parts of West Africa, while low levels of seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to circulate in parts of Central Africa and to a lesser extent in East Africa. In Ghana, pandemic influenza virus detections continued decline after peaking during early April 2010; during the most recent reporting week, 10%of respiratory specimens tested positive for pandemic influenza virus. There was no report of influenza activity in Senegal where a peak of pandemic influenza activity was observed in late February 2010. In central Africa, Cameroon continued to report co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses; the latter continued to be predominant during the most recent reporting week with approximately 31% of all respiratory samples testing positive for seasonal influenza type B and 4% testing positive for pandemic influenza virus. Sporadic detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 and influenza B viruses have been reported across eastern and western Africa over the past month.",

Symptoms of rickettsial infections include rash, fever, and flulike symptoms. African tick bite fever is caused by rickettsia africae and tends to be a milder illness, with less prominent rash and little tendency to progress to complicated disease. All rickettsial diseases respond to treatment with antibiotics such as doxycycline and tetracycline",

RVF is a viral disease that primarily affects animals (such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats and camels). The disease can also affect humans. The main mode of transmission of RVF is via direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes. There is evidence that humans may become infected by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.",

In Cameroon, low levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza type B virus continue to co-circulate, though the latter have been predominant during April 2010. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses during February and mid-March 2010 has been largely replaced by circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses during April 2010. Localized, low level pandemic influenza virus circulation continues to be observed in parts of East Africa, particularly in Rwanda and Tanzania. Sporadic detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continue to be reported across eastern, central, and western Africa.",
          "In tropical zone of the Americas, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active in several countries. In Central America, Guatemala reported three consecutive weeks of an increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity associated with regional spread of pandemic influenza virus and detection of severe cases. In Cuba, detections of pandemic virus and numbers of severe cases have increased since late March, however overall pandemic influenza activity may have recently peaked during the most recent reporting week. In Peru, the number of pneumonia cases in children under 5 years of age in the capital area has been increasing for the past seven weeks and remains above the epidemic threshold; however, the extent to which these pneumonia cases have been due to pandemic influenza H1N1 virus versus other respiratory viruses circulating in the region, is not known. Although the overall intensity of respiratory diseases across the region remained low to moderate during April 2010, for short periods of time, circulation of pandemic influenza virus was reported to widespread (in Cuba and Barbados) or regional (in Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, Columbia, Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador and Bolivia).",
          "In Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to actively circulate in several countries of the region, however, respiratory disease trends in the region are variable. In Malaysia, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza virus transmission persists with ongoing reports of new cases (including severe cases) and media reports of several school outbreaks, particularly during late April and early May 2010. In Singapore, the national level of ARI has been steadily increasing since early April 2010 and now exceeds the epidemic threshold; 37% of sentinel respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza during the most recent reporting week. In Thailand, the proportion of sentinel outpatients with ILI and sentinel inpatients with pneumonia testing positive for pandemic influenza virus infection has declined significantly since peaking during late March 2010.",
          "In South Asia, the most active area of pandemic influenza virus transmission continues to be in Bangladesh, which continues to report increasing respiratory diseases activity associated with co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses since mid April 2010. However, persistent low level co-circulation of both viruses has been detected since late February 2010. In India, localized low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus continues to be detected in parts of western and southern India.",
          "In East Asia, very low levels of pandemic influenza virus continue to be detected. Although overall rates of respiratory illness remain low across the region, recent low levels of influenza activity in a number of countries in the region have been largely due to circulating seasonal influenza type B viruses. Three countries in region, Mongolia, China, and South Korea, each experienced a period of sustained seasonal influenza type B virus circulation following an earlier, generally more intense, wintertime period of pandemic influenza virus transmission. China and South Korea continue observe active but declining levels of seasonal influenza type B virus circulation.",
          "In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remains sporadic, except in Chile, where there is evidence of low level community circulation of pandemic influenza virus, including detection of small numbers of severe cases; however it too early to know if this signals an early start to wintertime influenza season. The national level of ILI in Chile remained near baseline; however, in at least two southern regions the region specific level of ILI was elevated above baseline, and in one region, Los Lagos, the region specific baseline has been elevated slightly above the epidemic threshold for the past four weeks. Of note, 6% of sentinel respiratory samples in Chile tested positive for a respiratory virus, of these 32% were positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and 27% were positive for influenza viruses (half of which were subtyped as pandemic H1N1 virus).",
          "In Europe, overall influenza activity remained low with very low level co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses. The overall proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza remained stable at about 5.3%; and the total number of sentinel influenza B virus detections continued to exceed that of influenza A viruses, primarily due to low level seasonal influenza type B virus circulation in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan.",

          "30 April 2010 - As of 25th of April, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 17919 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The current situation is largely unchanged since the last update. The most active areas of transmission of pandemic influenza H1N1 virus continue to be parts of West and Central Africa with some focal areas of activity in South and Southeast Asia. Pandemic influenza activity H1N1 remains low in much of the temperate areas of both the northern and southern hemispheres. Seasonal influenza type B virus is the predominant influenza virus, though also at low levels of circulation, across East Asia, Northern and Eastern Europe. Influenza type B viruses have also been detected in Central Africa and this week in West Africa. Seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have continued to be detected in South and Southeast Asia, as well as sporadically in some countries of West and Central Africa, and Eastern Europe.",
          "In Sub-Saharan Africa, data from a limited number of countries suggests that active transmission of pandemic influenza H1N1 virus is declining across West and West-central Africa. Ghana is reporting moderate amounts of pandemic virus (16 % of all clinical specimens tested were positive for pandemic influenza) but smaller numbers of cases continue to be detected in Senegal, Niger and Cameroon. In East Africa, influenza activity has returned to low levels. Only Rwanda has detected small numbers of pandemic virus in the past week. In addition, a few seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses are seen in Ghana. Influenza type B has been increasingly detected in the area, notably in Ghana and Cameroon.",
          "In East Asia, pandemic influenza H1N1 virus circulation is now sporadic. In China, Mongolia, and Republic of Korea most influenza like illness cases continued to be primarily due to seasonal influenza type B viruses. In China and Mongolia influenza detections have continued to decline compared to previous recent weeks. The Republic of Korea reported increasing levels of respiratory disease activity associated with increasing detections of seasonal influenza type B in respiratory specimens over five consecutive weeks. Of note, small numbers of pandemic influenza H1N1, seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 viruses continued to be sporadically detected in some countries of the region.",
          "In Southeast Asia, overall levels of influenza activity were low. Although the predominant influenza virus circulating was still pandemic influenza H1N1, there was co-circulation of seasonal influenza type B and, to a lesser extent, H3N2 viruses in several countries including Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand. Malaysia has reported increasing levels of respiratory diseases activity associated with pandemic influenza H1N1 laboratory confirmed cases. Media sources have also reported school closures in the country. In Singapore, influenza-like-illness levels are still below the seasonal epidemic threshold but have increased compared to previous week.",
          "In South Asia, Bangladesh reported an increase in respiratory diseases activity associated with increasing numbers of pandemic influenza H1N1 laboratory confirmed cases since beginning of April. India reported pandemic influenza activity in the states of Maharashtra and recently Karnataka. Levels of respiratory diseases activity in both of these countries appear much less intense than in the initial wave of transmission which occurred late 2009. Although pandemic influenza is the predominant virus circulating in the region, seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to be detected in Iran and Bangladesh.",
          "In the tropical zone of the Americas, limited data suggested that pandemic influenza H1N1 activity remains low but with a few localized areas of transmission. Jamaica, Panama and Guatemala, reported increasing trends in respiratory disease activity. In Cuba, all provinces reported an increase in numbers of acute respiratory diseases cases in the last two weeks, mainly from the city of Havana. In Peru, the number of pneumonia cases in children under 5 years of age in Lima has been increasing since six consecutive weeks and remained above the epidemic threshold. However, the extent to which these pneumonia cases have been due to pandemic influenza H1N1 virus is not known. Notably, respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) has been reported to be circulating in the area.",
          "In the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza H1N1 activity remained low. In United States, the proportion of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness was below the national baseline. No influenza B is reported by countries of North America. In Europe, pandemic influenza activity is at very low intensity in all countries. The overall proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza remained stable at about 4.5%. For the current week, the total number of sentinel influenza B detections continued to exceed that of influenza A, mainly due to viral detections from Eastern Europe: Central, Siberian, Far Eastern regions of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan.",
          "In the temperate countries of the Southern Hemisphere, influenza-like illness activity remained low and at the levels experienced at the same time in previous years.

          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "Summary: Currently the most active areas of transmission of pandemic influenza are in parts of West and Central Africa but transmission is also still occurring in South East Asia, and Central America. Pandemic influenza activity remains low in much of the temperate zone of both the northern and southern hemispheres. Seasonal influenza type B viruses have been increasingly detected over a larger area and are now the predominant circulating influenza viruses across East Asia, Central Africa and Northern and Eastern Europe. Very small numbers of type B viruses have also recently been detected in Central America. Seasonal influenza H3N2 is still being detected in South and Southeast Asia (mainly Indonesia), as well as sporadically in several countries of West Africa, and Eastern Europe.",
          "In Europe, most countries reported a low intensity of respiratory diseases with only 6.8% of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza. This week the total number of influenza B virus detections continued to exceed that of influenza A, as in recent weeks, although at low levels. Of note, some sporadic detections of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses were reported in Eastern Europe.",
          "In East Asia, very few pandemic influenza viruses are being detected. In China, Mongolia, and Republic of Korea most influenza like illness (ILI) cases are now due primarily to influenza type B viruses. In China, overall influenza activity continues to decline and no pandemic influenza virus was detected this week. In Mongolia, influenza type B virus continues to circulate but is declining since a recent peak. An increased trend of respiratory disease activity associated with increasing circulation of influenza type B viruses has been reported in the Republic of Korea during the past few weeks. Small numbers of seasonal influenza H1N1 and H3N2 viruses continue to be sporadically reported in some countries of the region.",
          "In South and Southeast Asia, the most active areas of transmissions of pandemic influenza are in Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Although pandemic influenza virus is the predominant circulating influenza virus in the region, influenza H3N2 and influenza type B continue to co-circulate in Singapore and Thailand and Indonesia. In Singapore, rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) increased compared to previous week but are still below the epidemic threshold. In Indonesia, in contrast to other countries of the area, the predominant virus circulating continues to be influenza H3N2, with few detections of influenza type B and pandemic influenza viruses. In Malaysia, an increase in the number of respiratory disease consultations due to influenza-like-illness (ILI) was reported in the majority of the states compared to previous week. In Bangladesh, a small but slightly increased (compared to the previous week) numbers of pandemic influenza cases continues to be detected.",
          "Limited available data from North Africa suggests that respiratory disease activity there remains low. In sub-Saharan Africa, available data suggests ongoing community transmission of pandemic influenza virus in West Africa. Transmission appears to have peaked in Senegal in February but Ghana continues to have active, though decreasing, transmission. Cote d`Ivoire and Niger reported increasing trends of respiratory disease activity but no virological data were available. In central Africa, low levels of pandemic influenza activity continue to be reported in Cameroon. In addition, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 virus detections were reported by Angola. In eastern Africa, pandemic influenza virus continues to be detected in declining numbers in Rwanda with persistent reporting of small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 in Rwanda and Kenya. No increase in respiratory disease activity or detections of pandemic influenza viruses have yet been noted in Southern Africa. Influenza type B has been increasingly detected in some countries of central Africa.",
          "In the tropical zone of the Americas, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala, reported increases in respiratory diseases activity. In Guatemala, the number of respiratory disease consultations increased 80% compared to the previous week. Of note, co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, and adenovirus has been detected in addition to small numbers of pandemic influenza virus. In Mexico, during early April 2010, the sentinel surveillance system reported a 38.6% decrease in the number of influenza-like-illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases compared to the previous week.",

While the national ILI levels remain below the epidemic threshold, in Los Lagos, Tarapacá, and in some southern regions, the ILI level is above epidemic threshold. For the most recent reporting week, 6.8% of sentinel surveillance samples tested positive for respiratory viruses. Of these, 52.9% for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 23.5% for adenovirus, and 11.8% were positive for pandemic influenza virus.

          "23 April 2010 - Poliovirus type 1 has been detected in diagnostic samples from cases of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) from Tajikistan. This represents the first importation of poliovirus in the WHO European Region since it was certified polio-free in 2002.",
          "As of 21 April 2010, 120 cases of acute flaccid paralysis had been reported from Tajikistan. The majority of these have onset of paralysis within the past 2 weeks, prompting the Government to notify WHO of an outbreak. Ten of the children have died. The vast majority of the cases are children < five years of age. Preliminary data suggests >45% had four or more doses of oral polio vaccine.",
          "To date, poliovirus type 1 has been isolated in diagnostic specimens from 7 of these cases. All cases are in the south-west of the country, in an area bordering Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. Afghanistan is one of the four remaining polio-endemic countries. No cases have been reported in the areas of Afghanistan bordering Tajikistan.",
          "The Government of Tajikistan has requested technical guidance and support from WHO. Vaccine for three outbreak response rounds is being pre-positioned by UNICEF Supply Division for Tajikistan.",
          "Tajikistan's last case of clinically confirmed polio was in 1997; the last case of polio confirmed by virological testing was in 1991. Reported OPV3 coverage nationwide was 87% in 2008, the last year for which complete data are available under the WHO/UNICEF joint reporting process. AFP surveillance indicators in Tajikistan meet certification standards at the national level. In 2009, Tajikistan reported 35 cases of acute flaccid paralysis, of which none were caused by wild poliovirus. Globally, more than 90,000 cases of acute flaccid paralysis were reported in 2009, of which 1606 were caused by wild poliovirus.",
          "Three cases of acute flaccid paralysis have been reported in Uzbekistan on the Tajikistan border; poliovirus has not been isolated yet in laboratory testing. In addition, a child from Tajikistan travelled from Dushanbe to Tashkent for medical treatment shortly after onset of paralysis. The Government of Uzbekistan is planning one nationwide round of vaccination; the Government of Kyrgyzstan, is immunizing children <5 years over the course of European Immunization Week (26-30 April).",
          "WHO is communicating with countries in the Region about the outbreak. It is important that neighboring countries strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis, in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any sub-national gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 coverage is <80%."

          "16 April 2010 - As of 11 April 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 17798 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of the tropical zones of the Americas, West Africa, Eastern Africa and South East Asia. Although pandemic influenza continues to be the predominant circulating influenza virus worldwide, seasonal influenza type B virus circulation continues to be predominant in East Asia, and is being detected across other parts of Asia, and Europe at low levels. Sporadic detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have been reported across Asia, Eastern Europe and Eastern Africa most notably in recent weeks in Indonesia and Tanzania. Few seasonal H1N1 viruses were reported in the Russian Federation and Northern China in the last week.",
          "In East Asia, pandemic influenza activity continued to decline and is now at very low levels. The predominant virus associated with influenza-like-illness in the area is now influenza type B viruses, which continue to circulate in China, Mongolia, and Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea reports an increasing trend of respiratory disease activity associated with detections of influenza type B viruses and small numbers of pandemic H1N1. In China, outbreaks of acute respiratory infections associated with B virus detections are reported but none due to pandemic H1N1. The overall level of respiratory disease activity is similar to the level observed during the same period of 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons. Small numbers of seasonal H3N2 and sporadic seasonal H1N1 viruses were detected in Northern China. In Mongolia, rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) continue to decline and are associated with influenza type B only.",
          "In South and Southeast Asia, the most active areas of influenza transmission are Thailand and Singapore, where pandemic H1N1 is the dominant influenza virus, with co-circulation at lower levels of influenza type B and H3N2. Overall, the intensity of transmission is relatively low. In Thailand, respiratory disease activity has decreased since the previous week. Four percent of sentinel respiratory samples from ILI patients and 2.6% of sentinel respiratory samples from hospitalized patients with pneumonia were found to be positive for pandemic H1N1. Malaysia continues to report occasional outbreaks of respiratory disease in three states, Johor, Pahang, and Melaka. Only Melaka state has reported pandemic H1N1 laboratory confirmed cases, with 4 cases treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In India overall pandemic H1N1 activity is very low in most states, although in western India pandemic H1N1 cases continue to be reported in low numbers.",
          "In Europe, pandemic influenza activity has continued to decrease in recent weeks and is at very low intensity in all countries. The overall proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza remained low (5.4%), and the number of influenza type B virus detections exceeded that of influenza A. In Italy, 50% (7/14) of sentinel respiratory samples tested positive for influenza, all of which were seasonal influenza type B viruses.",
          "In the northern temperate zones of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as pandemic influenza H1N1 virus continues to circulate at very low levels in some areas. In temperate countries of the southern hemisphere, overall respiratory disease activity remained low.",
          "In tropical zone of the Americas, limited data suggests that overall influenza activity remains low with localized areas of active transmission in a number of countries. In Cuba, a slight increase of confirmed cases of pandemic virus was reported during the most recent reporting week. In Mexico, available data suggests that localized active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to occur around Mexico City but is very low nationally. In Peru, the number of pneumonia cases has increased over the last 2 weeks, especially in children less than 5 years of age, however there is no virological information available to indicate the cause of these cases. The lack of an associated increase in other age groups may indicate a cause other than influenza. Increased levels of ILI have also been reported across much of Brazil over the previous two weeks particularly in northern Brazil.",
          "In North Africa limited available data suggests that respiratory disease activity remained low. In sub-Saharan Africa, West Africa continues to see community transmission of pandemic influenza virus with Ghana currently being the primary focus of transmission (45% of all clinical specimens tested were positive for pandemic influenza) but smaller numbers of cases were also seen in Senegal and Niger. Pandemic influenza virus transmission appears to have peaked in Senegal approximately one month ago. Guinea has now reported their first cases of pandemic H1N1. In East Africa, cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 continue to be detected in Rwanda, though in declining numbers. Small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 and influenza type B viruses were detected during the last week in Rwanda, Kenya and South Africa. Notably, Tanzania has also recently reported significant transmission of seasonal influenza H3N2. No increases in respiratory disease activity or pandemic influenza have yet been noted in South Africa.",
          "In the South pacific, Vanuatu and Nauru reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity for this week, but this trend was not associated with laboratory confirmed detections of pandemic H1N1 virus.",
          "In other temperate countries out of the southern hemisphere, Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity continues to be low, with mostly detections of pandemic H1N1 and sporadic seasonal influenza viruses.",

          "Weekly update",
          "9 April 2010 - As of 4 April 2010, worldwide more than 213 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 17700 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The current situation is largely unchanged since the last update. The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission continue to be in parts of Southeast Asia, West Africa, and in the tropical zone of the Americas. In Chile, a country of the southern hemisphere temperate zone, there is evidence of early localized pandemic influenza virus transmission in advance of the usual start of the southern hemisphere winter influenza season. Seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to actively circulate in East Asia, but are also being detected at low levels across other parts of Asia and Europe.",
          "In Southeast Asia, the most active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to be in Thailand, however, overall disease activity has declined substantially since peaking during late February 2009. During the most recent reporting week, 6.7% and 16% of sentinel respiratory samples from outpatients with ILI and patients hospitalized with pneumonia, respectively, were positive for pandemic influenza. Low levels of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses have also been detected in Thailand in recent weeks. In Malaysia, limited data suggests that recent pandemic influenza activity may be declining with fewer detections of new cases. In Indonesia, recent low level circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses appears to be subsiding.",
          "In South Asia, limited data suggests the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission continues to be in Bangladesh, where an increasing number of cases have detected since late February 2009. Overall pandemic influenza activity remained low across the rest of the subcontinent with persistence of low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus in western India.",
          "In East Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at very low levels as overall rates of respiratory diseases remained low across much of the region. In China, overall rates of ILI remained at expected seasonal levels while most current influenza activity was due to circulating seasonal influenza type B viruses (accounting for >90% influenza virus detections). In Mongolia, rates of ILI continued to decline after a recent peak of influenza activity associated with circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses. Although overall rates of ILI and detections of influenza virus remain low in the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong SAR (China), and Chinese Taipei, an increasing proportion of virus isolates in recent weeks have been seasonal influenza type B viruses.",
          "In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggests that active circulation of pandemic influenza virus continues across parts of West and west-central Africa, and to a lesser extent in limited areas of East Africa. During early to mid-March 2009, 23% of respiratory sample tested positive for influenza in both Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana (the majority of virus isolates were pandemic H1N1). In Senegal, pandemic influenza transmission remains active but may be declining as the rate of sentinel specimens testing positive for pandemic influenza fell from a peak of 67% during early February 2009 to 17% during the most recent reporting week. In Cameroon, 38% (13/34) of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza during the past two weeks, of which 71% were pandemic and 29% were seasonal influenza type B viruses. Localized areas of active pandemic influenza transmission persist in areas of Eastern Africa, particularly Rwanda and Tanzania. Pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating in West and East Africa, however, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have also been identified.",
          "In Europe, low levels of pandemic influenza virus continue circulate across limited areas of Europe. The overall proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza remained low (6.2%); the total number of sentinel influenza type B virus detections exceeded that of pandemic influenza virus during the most recent reporting week. In Italy, 31% (9/29) of sentinel respiratory samples tested positive for influenza, all of which were seasonal influenza type B viruses. Most countries in the region reported a low intensity of respiratory diseases, and only Georgia reported geographically widespread influenza activity.",
          "In tropical zone of the Americas, limited data suggests that overall influenza activity remains low but variable with localized areas of active transmission in several countries, including in Cuba, Guatemala, Peru, and Bolivia, all of which reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases in association with localized to regional spread of influenza activity in at least one of the two recent reporting weeks. In Mexico, limited data suggests that localized active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to occur in several states throughout March 2010, particularly in parts of the Federal District which have reported recent increases in the number of severe and fatal pandemic H1N1 virus infections. In Brazil, increased levels of sentinel ILI have been reported across much of Brazil over the past month, however, most recent reports of severe and fatal illness due to pandemic influenza virus infection have been from the northern region.",
          "In the northern temperate zones of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as influenza virus continues to circulate at very low levels. In the United States, overall levels of ILI remained below the national baseline and were only slightly elevated above the regional baseline in the southwestern region (although this regional increase was not associated with increased sentinel detections of pandemic or other influenza viruses). The most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission in the United States currently appears to be in three southeastern states, all of which reported regional spread of influenza activity.",
          "In temperate countries of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza activity remained low, with mostly sporadic detections of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses. Of note, Chile has reported new detections of pandemic virus, including small numbers of severe cases, in at least three regions over the past two weeks; the significance of this early limited circulation of pandemic virus in advance of the usual winter influenza season is not yet known.",
          "Sporadic detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continued to be reported across Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, however, the most active (but overall low) circulation of seasonal H3N2 viruses has been reported in Indonesia.",

          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of the tropical zones of Asia, the Americas, and Africa. Pandemic influenza activity remains low in much of the temperate areas of both the northern and southern hemispheres. Although pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide, seasonal influenza type B viruses are predominant in much of East Asia, and have been increasingly detected at low levels across southeast and western Asia, East Africa, and in parts of eastern and northern Europe. Seasonal influenza A (H3N2) is still being detected in very small numbers in parts of Asia and Australia.",
          "In Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active but variable across the region. Thailand continues to report the most active circulation of pandemic virus in the region, however, disease activity may have recently peaked and begun to decline. Approximately half of all provinces in Thailand reported that >10% outpatient visits were due to influenza like illness (ILI). The proportion of outpatient sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza dropped to 10% after peaking at approximately 30% during mid February 2010. In Malaysia, limited data suggest pandemic influenza virus transmission persists as new cases continue to be reported. In Indonesia, no recent pandemic influenza activity has been reported, however, low levels of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses continue to be detected. In Myanmar, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza has declined substantially since a period of active transmission during February 2010.",
          "In South Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low, except in Bangladesh, which reported regional spread of pandemic influenza virus in association with an increase in new cases since late February 2010. In India, low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus persists in the western part of the country.",
          "In East Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remained low as circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses continued to increase across the region. In China, ILI activity has greatly decreased; however, approximately 20-30% of respiratory samples have tested positive for influenza in recent weeks. Of these, over 85% were seasonal influenza B viruses. In Mongolia, recent intense influenza activity due to seasonal influenza B viruses continues to decrease. Overall rates of ILI have returned to near baseline in both Japan and the Republic of Korea as pandemic influenza virus circulation continues to wane. Seasonal influenza B viruses are circulating at low level across other parts of East and Southeast Asia and Oceania (Hong Kong SAR (China), Japan, Republic of Korea, Chinese Taipei, Philippine, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia). Also, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have been detected in several countries of East and Southeast Asia as well as Oceania, particularly in Indonesia and in Australia.",
          "In North Africa and Western Asia, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels, as overall disease activity remained low across much of the region. In Iran, no pandemic influenza viruses have been detected recently, however, low levels of seasonal influenza B viruses continue to be detected.",
          "In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus transmission remains variable but most active in western Africa and in limited areas of eastern Africa. Localized areas of active pandemic influenza transmission persist in areas of Eastern Africa, particularly Rwanda and Tanzania. Pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating in West and East Africa, however, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2, H1N1, and seasonal influenza B viruses have also been identified.",
          "In tropical zone of the Americas, limited data suggests that overall influenza activity remains low but variable with localized areas of active transmission in a number of countries. Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia, all reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases associated with circulation of pandemic influenza virus for at least one week during March 2010. Localized increases in pandemic influenza activity have been associated with school outbreaks in several countries; however, in some places disease activity may be partially accounted for by co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. The most active area of pandemic influenza virus circulation in the region appears to be in Brazil where disease activity in the northern region has been associated with pandemic influenza virus transmission. In Mexico, limited data suggests that localized active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to occur in several states throughout March 2010, although overall influenza activity did not increase to peak levels observed during fall influenza season.",
          "In the northern and the southern temperate zones of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels. Although the national level of ILI activity remained below the seasonal baseline in the United States, three of ten subregions reported a resurgence of ILI activity above their respective baselines. The most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission currently appears to be in the southeastern United States, particularly in the states of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, all of which reported regional spread of influenza activity. A corresponding increase in confirmed severe cases of pandemic H1N1 has also been noted in the southeastern United States in recent weeks. In Canada, overall ILI activity remained below the seasonal baseline. In temperate countries of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza activity remained low, with sporadic detections of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses.",
          "In Europe, low levels of pandemic influenza virus continue to circulate across the region, particularly across southern and eastern Europe. The proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza remained low (4.6%). Three countries (Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria) reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity, however, these trends have not been associated with increased detections of pandemic influenza virus. Increased circulation of seasonal influenza B virus has been observed in the Siberian and far eastern regions of the Russian Federation, and in Italy and Sweden, where it continues to be the predominant circulating virus (although at overall low levels).",

          "26 March 2010 - As of 21 March 2010, worldwide more than 213 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 16,931 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of Southeast Asia, West Africa, and in the tropical zone of the Americas. After a period of sustained pandemic influenza transmission in Thailand over the past two months, overall activity now appears to be decreasing. In West Africa, limited data suggests that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists without clear evidence of a peak in activity. In Central America and in the tropical zone of South America, an increasing trend of respiratory disease activity associated with circulation of pandemic influenza virus has been reported since early March 2010 in an increasing number of countries. Although pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide, seasonal influenza B viruses are predominate in East Asia, and have been increasingly detected at low levels across southeast and western Asia, eastern Africa, and in parts of Europe.",
          "In Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus transmission has remained active and geographically widespread in Thailand since mid February 2010 and has been increasing since early March in Malaysia. In Thailand, the overall intensity of respiratory disease activity was reported to be low to moderate, and activity now appears to decreasing since mid March 2009; 10-22% of sentinel respiratory samples from patients with ILI tested positive for pandemic influenza during the most recent reporting week. In Malaysia, limited data suggests increasing detections of pandemic H1N1 cases over the past two weeks, although the extent and severity of illness is not currently known. Low numbers of seasonal influenza B viruses continue to be isolated in Thailand and in other parts of Southeast Asia.",
          "In South Asia, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains variable across the subcontinent. In Bangladesh, an increasing trend in respiratory disease activity and increasing detections of H1N1 cases has been reported since late February 2010; however, overall intensity of disease activity remains low. In India, although overall pandemic influenza activity remains low, pandemic H1N1 cases continue be reported in Western India.",
          "In East Asia, pandemic influenza virus transmission has declined substantially. Rates of ILI/ARI have returned to near baseline in Japan and Republic of Korea. In China, although overall ILI and pandemic influenza virus circulation has decreased substantially, circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses continues to be active (accounting for ~85% of all influenza viruses isolated during recent weeks). Similarly, in Mongolia, after experiencing a first peak of ILI activity due to circulation of pandemic influenza virus during November 2009, a second recent sharp peak of ILI activity occurred during late February and early March 2010 exclusively as a result circulating seasonal influenza B viruses. Overall influenza activity continues to remain low in Hong Kong SAR (China), Chinese Taipei, and DPR Korea.",
          "In Sub-Saharan Africa, pandemic influenza activity remains variable. Limited data suggest that the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission continue to be in West Africa and in limited areas of East Africa, particularly in Rwanda. Twenty-seven percent of respiratory specimens in Ghana, and 47% of specimens in Rwanda, tested positive for pandemic influenza virus during mid March 2010. In Senegal, a high intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported in association with increased detections of pandemic influenza virus. Pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating in West and East Africa, however, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 and seasonal influenza B viruses have also been identified.",
          "In tropical zone of the Americas overall influenza activity remains low, however, active transmission of pandemic influenza virus may be increasing, particularly across Central America and parts of South America. An increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity associated with detections of pandemic influenza virus was reported in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Panama. In Brazil, three consecutive weeks of increases in respiratory diseases activity have been associated with regional spread of pandemic influenza virus; three states in northern Brazil reported increases in detections of confirmed cases, however, the extent and severity of cases is not yet know. In Mexico, two weeks of increases (11-14% per week) in ILI and SARI were reported during late February and early March 2010, however, the extent to which respiratory disease activity has been due to pandemic influenza virus is not yet known.",
          "In Europe, overall pandemic influenza virus transmission continued to decline or remain low in most countries. Of note, over 20% of sentinel specimens in Germany, Italy, and the Russian Federation tested positive for influenza, however, these increased sentinel detections of influenza virus were not associated with significant increases in overall rates of acute respiratory illness; in Italy and the Russian Federation, seasonal influenza B viruses were either dominant or co-dominant with pandemic H1N1, respectively. In Romania and in Poland, recent increases in rates of ILI or ARI have not been associated with increased detections of pandemic or other influenza viruses.",
          "In North Africa and Western Asia, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels, as overall disease activity remained low across much of the region.",
          "In the northern and the southern temperate zones of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels.",
          "In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza activity remained low, with sporadic detections of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses.",
          {

          "19 March 2010 - As of 14 March 2010, worldwide more than 213 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 16813 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission continue to be in Southeast Asia and West Africa. Limited data suggests that pandemic influenza activity may be increasing across parts of Central America and the Caribbean. Low levels of pandemic influenza virus continue to circulate across southern and south-eastern Europe and in East, West, and South Asia. Although pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide, seasonal influenza B viruses are predominate in East Asia, and have been detected at low levels across southeast Asia and eastern Africa.",
          "In south and southeast Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission continue to be in Thailand; over the past month approximately 25-30% of sentinel respiratory samples from patients with ILI and 10-35% of sentinel respiratory samples from hospitalized patients with pneumonia tested positive for influenza (predominantly pandemic H1N1, but also small numbers of seasonal B viruses). Recent pandemic influenza activity in Thailand, while associated with severe and fatal illness, does not appear to exceed activity observed during an earlier period of peak transmission between June and September 2009. In Myanmar, respiratory disease activity may be declining after a period of increased activity associated with increased detection of pandemic H1N1 cases during February 2010. In Bangladesh, an increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity was reported for the past two weeks in association with increased numbers of confirmed cases and increased geographical spread of pandemic influenza virus. In India, low level of pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate in western India.",
          "In East Asia, pandemic influenza activity continued to decline substantially as rates of illness returned to baseline or remained low in Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong (SAR), and Chinese Taipei. In China, pandemic influenza activity has waned substantially, however, influenza type B viruses continue to circulate. In Mongolia, a recent sharp increase in ILI activity was associated almost exclusively with increased circulation of influenza B viruses. In addition, increasing but low levels of circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses has been observed across other parts of East and Southeast Asia (Japan, Republic of Korea, Chinese Taipei, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh). Small numbers of seasonal H3N2 viruses have also been detected in several countries of East and Southeast Asia.",
          "In West Africa, limited data suggest that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains sustained across much of the region without clear evidence of a peak in activity. In Ghana, 38% of respiratory specimens collected during the past week tested positive for influenza, and of these, approximately 70% were pandemic H1N1. Limited sentinel surveillance data from Nigeria suggest that levels of ILI have increased over the past two months in conjunction with increased detections of pandemic influenza H1N1 virus. Localized outbreaks of pandemic H1N1 influenza have also been recently reported in parts of East Africa, particularly in Rwanda. Pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating in West and East Africa, however, small numbers of seasonal H3N2 and seasonal B viruses have also been identified.",
          "In tropical zone of the Americas, particularly in Central America and the Caribbean, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza virus transmission may be active. Geographically regional to widespread pandemic influenza activity was reported across Central America and the Caribbean with mixed trends in the pattern of respiratory diseases activity (increasing activity in Jamaica, Bahamas, Nicaragua, Panama; and decreasing activity in Costa Rica, Guatemala). Honduras continues to report several outbreaks of respiratory disease in schools with limited laboratory confirmation of pandemic influenza virus infection. In Brazil, over the past two weeks, an increasing trend of respiratory diseases with low overall intensity was reported in association with regional spread of influenza virus.",
          "In North Africa and Western Asia, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels across the region. An increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity in association with regional spread of influenza was reported for past three weeks in Afghanistan and the past two weeks in Iraq; however, overall intensity of activity remains low to moderate in both countries. Localized to regional spread of pandemic was also reported in Morocco, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, and Oman.",
          "In Europe, overall pandemic influenza transmission continued to decline as low levels of pandemic virus continue to circulate in parts of eastern and south-eastern Europe. The overall percentage of sentinel respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza remained low (5.1%). Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be the predominant circulating influenza virus in the European region, except in Sweden and the Russian Federation, where seasonal influenza B viruses have been reported as co-dominant or dominant.",
          "In the northern and the southern temperate zones of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as influenza virus continued to circulate at low levels.",
          "In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza activity remained low, with sporadic detections of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses.",

          "12 March 2010 - As of 7 March 2010, worldwide more than 213 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 16713 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The most active areas of pandemic influenza transmission are currently in Southeast Asia, however, lower levels of pandemic virus circulation persist in other parts of Asia and in Eastern and South-eastern Europe. In West Africa, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus transmission may be increasing in region. Of note, seasonal influenza B viruses have been increasingly detected in Asia and appear to be spreading westward.",
          "In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggests that on-going community transmission of pandemic influenza virus continues to increase in parts of West Africa, without clear evidence of a peak in activity. Increased detections of pandemic influenza virus have been observed among sentinel surveillance sites in several countries, including Senegal and Cote D'Ivoire, however, to date, data is limited regarding the spectrum of clinical severity of cases. Recent increases in influenza activity have also been reported in Rwanda. Much of eastern and southern Africa likely experienced an earlier peak in pandemic influenza activity during November 2009 and late summer 2009, respectively.",
          "In South and Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus circulation persist in most countries, however, overall transmission remains most active in Thailand, especially since mid January 2010. Approximately half of all provinces in Thailand reported that greater than 10% of all outpatients sought care for ILI, and approximately 25% of all patients with ILI at sentinel sites tested positive for influenza. The current increase in the number of cases in Thailand remains well below an earlier period of peak transmission during June through September 2009. In Bangladesh, an increasing trend in respiratory disease was reported, however, overall influenza activity remains low. In India, influenza virus transmission persist at lower levels in the western region of India, while activity in other regions has largely subsided.",
          "In East Asia, pandemic influenza activity continues to decrease or remain low as levels of ILI return to seasonal baselines in Japan and in the Republic of Korea. In Mongolia, a recent sharp increase in ILI activity was associated predominantly with a resurgence of circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses. In China, pandemic influenza activity has declined since peaking during November 2009, however, overall influenza activity remains elevated, largely due to an increase in the circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses.",
          "In North Africa and Western Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low in most places, with the exception of Iraq and Afghanistan, both of which reported regional spread of influenza with an increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity. In Afghanistan, a moderate impact on the healthcare system was reported in association with increased respiratory diseases activity. Although overall influenza activity remains low in Iran, all recent influenza virus detection have been due to seasonal influenza B viruses.",
          "In Europe, overall pandemic influenza transmission continued to decline as low levels of pandemic virus continue to circulate in parts of eastern and south-eastern Europe. The overall percentage of sentinel respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza remained low (6.8%) but slightly increased compared to the previous week. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be the predominant circulating influenza virus in the European region with the exception of the Russian Federation and Sweden where influenza B was reported as co-dominant or dominant.",
          "In the northern and the southern temperate zones of the Americas, overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as influenza virus continued to circulate at low levels. In Central America, Nicaragua and Honduras, reported slight increases in respiratory diseases activity, possibly due to an increase in school outbreaks; however, it is unclear to what extent the increases are associated with circulation of pandemic influenza virus. In Brazil, an increasing trend of respiratory diseases with low overall intensity was reported in association with regional spread of influenza virus. In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza activity remained low, with sporadic detections of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses. Although pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant circulating influenza virus worldwide, circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses continue to increase and spread across Asia, parts of Eastern Europe, and Eastern Africa, but most notably in China, Mongolia, Iran and the Russian Federation.",

The most active areas of transmission are currently observed in parts of Southeast Asia and East and South-eastern Europe. Recently, influenza type B is increasingly reported in Asia.",

In Thailand, activity has increased and Myanmar continues to report regionally circulating pandemic virus. However, the overall intensity of activity nationally is still low in both countries. Respiratory disease activity is declining in all other countries of the area. In East Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists at low levels in most countries including Hong Kong SAR (China) and Chinese Taipei or has returned to baseline levels (Japan and the Republic of Korea). Of note, seasonal influenza B virus activity has been increasing in the area and is now the predominant influenza virus in Mongolia, China, and parts of South East Asia.

However, many countries of Eastern Europe (Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Armenia and Moldova) are still reporting some increased respiratory disease activity compared to their baselines. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza decreased further in week 7 to around 3.5%. The majority of those were positive for pandemic influenza and only a very few seasonal influenza H3N2 and influenza type B viruses were detected.",

          "Situation update:",
          "In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, pandemic influenza virus continues to be detected across many countries, however, overall influenza activity continues to wane in most places. The most active areas of transmission are currently in parts of south and southeast Asia and in limited areas of east and southeastern Europe.",
          "In Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus continued to circulate in areas, however, the overall intensity of respiratory diseases activity remained low and unchanged, except in a few countries. In Brunei Darussalam, during February 2009, influenza activity was reported to be geographically widespread and was associated with an increasing trend and high intensity of respiratory diseases. Both Myanmar and Thailand have reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases associated with geographically regional spread of influenza for the first half of February 2009, however, overall intensity currently remains low in both countries. In Thailand, approximately one third of provinces reported that >5% of medical visits were due to ILI during the most recent reporting week. In East Asia, virologic surveillance data suggest that pandemic influenza and seasonal influenza type B viruses continue to co-circulate. A recent increase in ILI activity in Mongolia may be due to an increase in the circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses. Overall influenza activity continues to decline and return to baseline levels in both Japan and the Republic of Korea (S. Korea). In Hong Kong SAR (China) and in Chinese Taipei, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels and overall ILI activity is substantially lower than what was observed peaks of activity during the fall months. In South Asia, overall influenza activity remained low, however, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists in the western part of India.",
          "In Europe, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists across parts of central and southeastern Europe, but overall intensity remained low, except for Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Slovakia, the Republic of Moldova, and parts of the Russian Federation which continued to report a moderate intensity respiratory diseases activity. Although an increasing trend of respiratory diseases continued to be reported in Georgia, Slovakia, and parts of the Russian Federation, the increased activity may be due to other circulating respiratory viruses. Among countries testing at least 20 sentinel respiratory specimens during the past reporting week, none reported that more than 20% of specimens had tested positive for influenza.",
          "In North Africa and West Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels as rates of illness in most countries in the region continued to decline or return to baseline. In Afghanistan, an increasing trend of respiratory diseases with moderate healthcare impact was report, however, it is unknown if the recent increase is associated with circulation of influenza virus.",
          "In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza virus transmission continued to be sporadic in most areas of the continent. Several countries in West Africa continue to report slight increases in the numbers of confirmed cases of pandemic influenza indicating that community transmission is likely beginning in the area; however, data are very limited.",
          "In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels but overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. In Central America and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low or unchanged in most places.",

In summary, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate widely in the tropical regions and is persisting in some areas of in parts of Europe. Respiratory disease activity is increasing in many areas of the world due to increasing transmission of influenza type B and Respiratory Syncitial Virus. Seasonal influenza H3N2 continues to be detected in areas of Asia and east Africa. The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

          "24 February 2010 - On 17 February 2010, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Cameroon reported three cases of Yellow Fever in Banjoun and Fantun districts of the country's Western Region.",
          "The index case was identified in a 28 year-old man from Bandrrefan village in Bandjoun district, who presented with a clinical picture of fever, jaundice and abdominal pain at the end of December 2009. He had no history of Yellow Fever vaccination and died on 7 January 2010, 3 days after his medical consultation. During the same period, a second case was reported in a 19 year-old male from the same village, who died on 23 January 2010, three days after he consulted the district hospital.",
          "The two cases were identified through routine Yellow Fever surveillance. Specimens from both cases were confirmed by laboratory tests from the Pasteur Centre of Cameroun and the Regional reference laboratory for Yellow Fever at Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal.",
          "Following identification of the two cases, an outbreak investigation was conducted in December 2009 in Fombat district, neighbouring Banjoun district. The investigation identified a third case in a 40 year-old man who died in October 2009. The case was later laboratory confirmed with Yellow Fever. Serum samples were taken from 77 ''contact persons'' of this case, all of which tested negative for Yellow Fever.",
          "Cameroon conducted a Yellow Fever mass vaccination campaign in 62 at-risk-districts covering a population of 7.4 million in May 2009. The two districts of Banjoun and Fantun were however, not part of the campaign earlier because they did not have any cases of Yellow Fever when the vaccination campaign took place in May 2009.",
          "The Ministry of Health plans to vaccinate 254,355 people in Banjoun and Fantun districts. The country has requested support from the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG), which manages the global emergency stockpile of yellow fever vaccine. The ICG has approved support for the vaccination campaign, which will be financed by the GAVI Alliance through the World Health Organization."

          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The situation is largely unchanged since the previous update. In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, active but declining pandemic influenza transmission persists in limited areas of eastern and southern Europe, South Asia, and in East Asia. Several countries in West Africa reported increases in the number of cases but there is as yet insufficient evidence to conclude that widespread community transmission is occurring. An increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity was reported in Thailand and Jamaica, however the cause of the respiratory disease is uncertain at this point.",
          "In Southeast Asia, several countries reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity but overall intensity remained low. After several months of sporadic influenza activity, Thailand reported increasing respiratory diseases activity marked by increased ILI in 24 provinces; however, the overall intensity of activity nationally remains low. In Myanmar and Indonesia, localized geographic spread of influenza activity, an increasing trend of respiratory diseases, and low overall intensity was reported. In South Asia, influenza activity persists in the northern and western states of India, however, overall influenza activity continued to decline or remained low in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. In East Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists but has been steadily declining in most countries of region (China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea), with the exception of DPR Korea, where an increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity was reported. In West Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate in many countries, however the overall intensity of current activity remains low in the region.",
          "In North Africa, pandemic influenza transmission persists but substantial declines in activity continue to be reported over the past month. In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza virus transmission may be sporadic in most areas of the continent. Several countries in West Africa continue to report increases in the numbers of confirmed cases of pandemic influenza, however, currently, no countries in the region are reporting an increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity.",
          "In Europe, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate across central and southeastern Europe, but the overall intensity of activity remained low in most places; only Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Slovakia, the Republic of Moldova, and the Russian Federation reported a moderate intensity of respiratory diseases activity. Several weeks of increases in ARI/ILI were reported in Slovakia and in the Russian Federation, but increased activity in these countries may be associated with other circulating respiratory viruses. Among 12 countries testing at least twenty sentinel respiratory specimes, only Hungary reported that greater than 20% specimens had tested positive for influenza.",
          "In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels but overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. In Central America and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low or unchanged in most places. Jamaica reported an increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity but the overall intensity remains low.",
          "Pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide. In addition to the increasing proportion of seasonal influenza type B viruses recently detected in China, low levels of seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating in parts of Africa, and Asia.",

Of note, Senegal became the third country within the past month (and fifth overall) to confirm first cases of pandemic H1N1 2009 in West Africa. There is insufficient evidence at this point to determine if this heralds the beginning of a period of more widespread transmission in West Africa, which heretofore may have been largely spared a significant period of communitywide pandemic influenza virus transmission.",

In China, pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses continue to co-circulate, however, over the last several weeks, seasonal influenza type B viruses have been predominant. In Japan, influenza activity continues to decrease towards seasonal baselines, including in Okinawa which is experiencing greater levels of influenza activity than in other parts of the country.

Among 15 countries testing more than 20 sentinel respiratory samples, the proportion of samples testing positive for influenza ranged from 0-14%. Recent slight increases in rates of ARI in Slovakia, Slovenia, and the Russian federation, do not appear to be associated with detections of influenza viruses and may be due to other circulating respiratory viruses.",

          "5 February 2010 - As of 31 January 2010, worldwide more than 211 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 15174 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity continues to decline or remain low in most regions since peaking during late October and November 2009. Several areas continue to have evidence of active but declining transmission, particularly in North Africa and in limited areas of Eastern Europe and East Asia.",
          "In North Africa, pandemic influenza transmission remains active and geographically widespread but overall activity has been declining since peaking during late December 2009 and early January 2010. During January 2010, a substantial decline in the number of pandemic virus isolations and new cases was observed in Morocco and Egypt, respectively. In West Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically widespread to regional, but overall activity remained low.",
          "In South and Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains active but geographically localized to regional. The overall intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported to be low to moderate in most places. In India, influenza activity continued to decline in all regions of the country, however, the most active areas of transmission currently are in the western states. An overall peak in the number of pandemic H1N1 cases was recorded in India during mid December 2009, and the majority of these cases were identified in the northern and western states of India. In Thailand, overall ILI activity remained low, however focal increase in activity were observed in several central and northern provinces.",
          "In East Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains active and geographically widespread across the region, however, overall activity continued to decline. In Japan, overall influenza activity continues to decline but transmission remains higher on the southern island of Okinawa than in other places. In the Republic of Korea (South Korea), rates of ILI continued to decline to near baseline after a substantial wave of activity which peaked during early to mid November 2009. In Mongolia, after a period of sustained elevated ILI activity since early November 2009, levels of ILI have recently fallen to the expected seasonal range. In northern and southern China, rates of ILI have returned to levels seen during recent seasons; however, approximately 30% of respiratory specimens tested were positive for influenza suggesting that active transmission of influenza viruses persists. Of note in China, in recent weeks the circulation of pandemic influenza H1N1 continued to decline with a concomitant increase in the circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses (pandemic H1N1 and seasonal Type B viruses accounted for 34% and 66% of all influenza viruses detected, respectively). Active transmission of pandemic influenza virus also persists in Hong Kong SAR (China), although at significantly lower levels than an earlier peak of activity during September and October 2009.",
          "In Europe, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active in a limited number of countries as overall activity remained low in most places. At least seven countries testing more than 20 sentinel respiratory samples reported that >20% of samples had tested positive for influenza (Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Greece, Luxembourg, and Romania); however, in all seven, rates of illness remained well below earlier peaks of activity. Small increases in ILI/ARI have been reported over the past two reporting weeks in Slovakia, Belarus, and the Russian Federation. The overall rate of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza fell to 14% after reaching a peak of 45% during early November 2009.",
          "In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. In Central America and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low or unchanged in most places.",
          "In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission.",
          "Pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide. In addition to the increasing proportion of seasonal influenza type B viruses recently detected in China, low levels of seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating in parts of Africa, East and Southeast Asia and are being detected only sporadically on other continents.",

          "Although much of the temperate northern hemisphere passed a peak of fall and wintertime pandemic influenza activity between late October and late November 2009, virus transmission remain active in several later affected areas, particularly in North Africa, limited areas of eastern and southeastern Europe, and in parts of South and East Asia.",
          "In North Africa, limited data suggests that pandemic influenza virus transmission remains active and geographically widespread, particularly in Morocco, Algeria, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and in Egypt, although most countries in the region appeared to have recently passed a peak of activity during December 2009 or January 2010. In west Asia, pandemic influenza activity continues be geographically regional to widespread, however activity levels have continued to decline or remain low since December 2009.",
          "In South Asia, pandemic influenza activity remains active but geographically variable. Recent peaks in activity were noted during late December and early January 2010 in northern India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Influenza activity remained stable but elevated in western India, continued to decline substantially in northern India, and remained low overall in southern and eastern India. In Bangladesh, regional spread influenza activity and a low intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported.",
          "In East Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active, however, overall activity continued to decline in most countries. An increasing trend in respiratory diseases with localized spread was reported for DPR Korea. In the Republic of Korea, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active (>20% respiratory specimens tested positive for pandemic H1N1), however, overall activity continue to decline since peaking during November 2009. In Japan, influenza activity continues to decline, however high levels of transmission persist on the southern island of Okinawa. In northern and southern China, pandemic virus isolations have declined substantially since peaking early to mid November 2009, however, in recent weeks detections of influenza type B viruses have increased.",
          "In southeast Asia, transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists, but current activity levels are low. In Vietnam, influenza activity has declined substantially since peaking during October and November 2009. In Thailand, focal outbreaks of influenza were reported from a few provinces in northern and central parts of the country, however, overall ILI activity remains low.",
          "In Europe, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains geographically regional to widespread in the central, eastern, and southeastern parts of the continent, however, overall activity continues to decline in most places. Several countries (Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and the Russian Federation) reported slight increases in the levels of ARI or ILI activity, however in most, levels remain well below recent peaks in activity. The overall rate of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (16%) continued to fall since peaking (45%) during early November 2009.",
          "In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. Of note, detections of RSV have increased in a few countries in the Americas, which may partially account for elevated ILI activity in those areas, particularly among young children. In the US and Canada, pandemic influenza virus detections and the numbers of severe and fatal cases have decline substantially as rates of ILI have fallen below seasonal baselines. In Central America and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low or unchanged in most places.",
          "In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission. Pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant virus circulating worldwide. Seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating at low levels in parts of Africa, east and Southeast Asia and are being detected only sporadically on other continents.",

The most common clinical presentation was uncomplicated influenza-like-illness (58%), however, approximately 28% had evidence of pneumonia, 20% required intensive care, and one case died. Six (40%) of 15 women at <37 weeks gestation delivered preterm; and among these six births, two died in utero and one died after delivery. Five of six pregnant women who delivered prematurely also had chest X-ray evidence of pneumonia.

          "15 January 2010 - As of 10 January 2010, worldwide more than 208 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 13554 deaths.",
          "WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.",
          "Situation update:",
          "The most intense areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of North Africa, South Asia, and east and southeastern Europe.",
          "In North Africa, limited data suggest that transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active throughout the region, particularly in Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt. In West Asia, limit data suggest that pandemic virus continues to circulate widely with a number of countries likely having already experienced a peak in activity prior to December. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be predominant circulating influenza virus in the northern African and western Asian regions with only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses.",
          "In South Asia, the northern and western parts of the subcontinent continued to experience active influenza transmission. In Nepal, increasing ARI activity and geographically regional to widespread influenza activity was reported during December and January. In India, overall activity may have peaked during mid to late December, however transmission has been regionally variable with a recently increasing trend in the western states, active but decreasing transmission in the northern states, and overall low activity in the eastern and southern states. In Sri Lanka, geographically widespread transmission with increasing trend of respiratory diseases was reported throughout December, however activity may have recently plateaued.",
          "In Europe, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically widespread throughout the continent, however, overall activity continued to decline substantially since November. A moderate intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported in Romania, Ukraine, Turkey, and Switzerland, however, rates of ILI/ARI have been decreasing or have plateaued in all. At least four countries testing more than 20 sentinel respiratory specimens reported greater than 25% specimens were positive for influenza (Romania, Georgia, Germany, and France). The overall rate of specimens testing positive for influenza fell to 22% in Europe after reaching a peak of 45% during early November 2009. Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus continues to be predominant circulating influenza virus in the European region with only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza viruses.",
          "In East Asia, influenza activity remains widespread but continues to decline overall. In Japan, influenza activity remains elevated but has declined since peaking at the end of November 2009. Although influenza transmission remains active and regionally variable in China, overall activity has declined substantially since peaking during mid November 2009 in northern and southern China. In Hong Kong SAR (China), influenza activity remained stably elevated but substantially lower than a large peak of activity during late September and early October 2009. In Mongolia, rates of ILI have been elevated above seasonal baseline since late October 2009 but declined substantially since a peak of activity was observed during November 2009. In DPR Korea, geographically regional influenza activity with increasing respiratory diseases trend was reported during early January 2010. Pandemic H1N1 continues to be the predominant circulating virus in the region but seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to circulate in very small numbers in northern China.",
          "In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low. In North America, peak influenza activity occurred during early, mid, and late October in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, respectively. Small areas of increased influenza activity may be occurring in central and northern Mexico.",
          "In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission. This suggests that the level of population immunity in areas that experienced intense, high-level transmission during a winter season is high enough to prevent sustained transmission from recurring during the summer when the virus is less transmissible.",

          "12 January 2010 - On 4 January 2010, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Guinea reported a case of yellow fever to the World Health Organization (WHO). The case occurred in the prefecture of Mandiana belonging to the Kankan region in the east of the country, near the border with Côte d'Ivoire. Côte d'Ivoire has recently conducted an outbreak response in the border health districts of Minignan and Madinani.",
          "The case in Guinea was a 35-year-old woman from the village of Malikila, sub-prefecture of Faralako, prefecture of Mandiana. On 23 November 2009, she presented with a clinical syndrome of fever and jaundice. The case was detected by cross-border investigation of the outbreak in Côte d'Ivoire. Following an outbreak investigation conducted by the Ministry of Health, a further six suspected cases were found in the sub-prefecture of Faralako, Mandiana-Centre and Saladou. These cases are under laboratory investigation.",
          "The regional reference laboratory for yellow fever at Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, confirmed the yellow fever case by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Other haemorrhagic fevers were excluded by specific tests.",
          "Following the detection of this case, the MoH has decided to vaccinate the entire population of the Mandiana prefecture. A total of 12 sub-prefectures with 290 292 people are targeted for an emergency reactive mass vaccination campaign, scheduled for the third week of January 2010. Vaccines have been made available from the global emergency vaccine stockpile, managed by the International Coordinating Group for Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) with funding from the GAVI Alliance and ECHO.",
          "Guinea is one of the high-risk endemic countries in Africa where a series of preventive mass vaccination campaigns has been implemented since 2007. Mandiana prefecture is one of the 25 prefectures in the country considered to be at highest risk of yellow fever. The prefecture was selected for preventive mass vaccination during the YF National Risk Assessment meeting in September 2008, however, the national campaign has not yet taken place due to limited vaccine supply. It is now scheduled to take place in 2010."

Among countries testing more than 20 clinical specimens from sentinel sites in the past week, the greatest proportions of samples testing positive for influenza were observed in Greece (72%), Georgia (54%), Switzerland (49%), Portugal (48%), Germany (48%), Luxembourg (40%), Romania (30%), Poland (25%), and Albania (23%). In most of western and northern Europe, rates of ILI/ARI continued to decline substantially, and in many places have returned to near seasonal baselines. Sporadic cases of seasonal H3N2 influenza have been identified in Western Europe but in very small numbers. Crude mortality rates among most European countries, measured as the cumulative number of pandemic H1N1 influenza associated deaths per million population, appear to be within the same range as rates observed elsewhere in northern and southern hemisphere, suggesting a relatively consistent global pattern of mortality.",
          "In North Africa and West Asia, limited data suggest that influenza transmission remains active. Although west Asia may have already experienced a peak in influenza activity, parts of North Africa continues to report increasing respiratory diseases activity, particularly in Egypt. Elevated levels of ILI activity and increased influenza virus detections were observed during November and December in Algeria and Morocco, but activity has likely peaked in the later.",
          "In South Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically widespread and active across the subcontinent - particularly in northern India, Nepal, and in Sri Lanka - where an increasing trend in respiratory diseases activity was reported. In Southeast Asia, influenza transmission remains geographically regional to widespread; however, overall influenza activity appears to be low but variable. Localized increases in ILI were reported in parts of Thailand over the past three weeks. In Vietnam, after a period of substantial influenza transmission during September through November, activity declined significantly in December. In Laos and Cambodia, overall respiratory disease activity was reported to be decreasing during most of December.",

Influenza/ILI activity continued to decline in Japan, in northern and southern China, Chinese Taipei, and Hong Kong SAR (China). Pandemic H1N1 is clearly still the predominant circulating virus but seasonal H3N2 viruses continue to circulate in very small numbers in northern China. Slight increases in rates of ILI were again reported in Mongolia.",

In North America, peak influenza activity occurred during early, mid, and late October in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, respectively. In all three countries, as expected, a substantially greater number of cases were recorded during the fall and winter transmission period as compared to spring and summer transmission period. In Canada, after experiencing substantial influenza activity unusually early during the fall and winter period, rates of ILI have now dropped below the historical seasonal baseline.",

          "8 January 2010 - On 6 November 2009, The Ministry of Health (MoH) in Cote d'Ivoire reported to the World health Organization (WHO) a yellow fever outbreak of 10 suspected cases and 6 deaths in Minignan and Madinani health districts, Denguele region, in the north-western part of the country near the Guinea and Mali borders.",
          "The index case was a 12 year-old male who consulted the Health Centre of Kaniasso in Minignan Health district on 5 September. He was a student in Kenigouara village, health area of Samantiguila, in Odienne district and had no history of yellow fever vaccination. Two further cases were reported from Madinani district.",
          "In total 5 suspected cases tested positive at the Institut Pasteur of Côte d'Ivoire, of which 3 cases were confirmed at the regional reference laboratory for yellow fever at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Other haemorrhagic fevers were also excluded by specific tests.",
          "After an outbreak investigation the Ministry of Health vaccinated 32,700 people from Health areas of Banakoro, Kaniaso, Sanaferedougou, Minignan and Samantiguila, and in December 2009 an emergency mass vaccination campaign targeting a population of 154,941 people was carried out in Minignan and Madinani health districts. Vaccines have been provided from the global emergency vaccine stockpile, managed by the International Coordinating Group for Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) with funding from the GAVI Alliance and the Central Emergency Response Funds (CERF). Côte d'Ivoire is part of a group of endemic countries in Africa where preventive mass vaccination campaigns are being implemented since 2007.",
          "An investigation carried out in Guinea at the border with Cote d'Ivoire has led to detection and confirmation by IP Dakar of a case of yellow fever. This case will also result in outbreak response for the affected area in Guinea."
