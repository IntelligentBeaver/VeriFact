Additionally, the financial and psychological toll on their families can have detrimental effects on their cognitive, linguistic and emotional development.</p><p>“For every mother and baby, a healthy start from pregnancy through childbirth and the first months after birth is essential,” said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Deputy Director General for Programmes at WHO. “Universal health coverage can ensure that everyone – including newborns – has access to the health services they need, without facing financial hardship. Progress on newborn health care is a win-win situation – it saves lives and is critical for early child development thus impacting on families, society, and future generations.”</p><p>Without specialized treatment, many at-risk newborns won’t survive their first month of life, according to the report. In 2017, some 2.5 million newborns died, mostly from preventable causes. Almost two-thirds of babies who die were born premature. And even if they survive, these babies face chronic diseases or developmental delays. In addition, an estimated 1 million small and sick newborns survive with a long-term disability.</p><p>With nurturing care, these babies can live without major complications. The report shows that by 2030, in 81 countries, the lives of 2.9 million women, stillborns and newborns can be saved with smarter strategies.

Other measures like resuscitating a baby who cannot breathe properly, giving the mother an injection to prevent bleeding, or delaying the cutting of the umbilical cord could also save millions. </p><p>According to the report, the world will not achieve the global target to achieve health for all unless it transforms care for every newborn.

    "content_html": "<div><p>A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates road traffic deaths continue to rise, with an annual 1.35 million fatalities. The WHO <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789241565684\">Global status report on road safety 2018</a> highlights that road traffic injuries are now the leading killer of children and young people aged 5-29 years.  </p><p>“These deaths are an unacceptable price to pay for mobility,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “There is no excuse for inaction. This is a problem with proven solutions. This report is a call for governments and partners to take much greater action to implement these measures.”</p><p>The WHO Global status report on road safety 2018 documents that despite an increase in the overall number of deaths, the rates of death relative to the size of the world population have stabilized in recent years. This suggests that existing road safety efforts in some middle- and high-income countries have mitigated the situation.</p><p>“Road safety is an issue that does not receive anywhere near the attention it deserves – and it really is one of our great opportunities to save lives around the world,” said Michael R Bloomberg, Founder and CEO of Bloomberg Philanthropies and WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries. “We know which interventions work. Strong policies and enforcement, smart road design, and powerful public awareness campaigns can save millions of lives over the coming decades.”   </p><p>In the settings where progress has been made, it is largely attributed to better legislation around key risks such as speeding, drinking and driving, and failing to use seat-belts, motorcycle helmets and child restraints; safer infrastructure like sidewalks and dedicated lanes for cyclists and motorcyclists; improved vehicle standards such as those that mandate electronic stability control and advanced braking; and enhanced post-crash care.</p><p>The report documents that these measures have contributed to reductions in road traffic deaths in 48 middle- and high-income countries. However, not a single low-income country has demonstrated a reduction in overall deaths, in large part because these measures are lacking.</p><p>In fact, the risk of a road traffic death remains three times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries.

      "description": "A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates road traffic deaths continue to rise, with an annual 1.35 million fatalities. The WHO Global status report on road safety 2018 highlights that road traffic injuries are now the leading killer of children and young people aged 5-29 years.  “These deaths are an unacceptable price to pay for mobility,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “There is no excuse for inaction. This is a problem with proven solutions. This report is a call for governments and partners to take much greater action to implement these measures.”The WHO Global status report on road safety 2018 documents that despite an increase in the overall number of deaths, the rates of death relative to the size of the world population have stabilized in recent years. This suggests that existing road safety efforts in some middle- and high-income countries have mitigated the situation.“Road safety is an issue that does not receive anywhere near the attention it deserves – and it really is one of our great opportunities to save lives around the world,” said Michael R Bloomberg, Founder and CEO of Bloomberg Philanthropies and WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries. “We know which interventions work. Strong policies and enforcement, smart road design, and powerful public awareness campaigns can save millions of lives over the coming decades.”   In the settings where progress has been made, it is largely attributed to better legislation around key risks such as speeding, drinking and driving, and failing to use seat-belts, motorcycle helmets and child restraints; safer infrastructure like sidewalks and dedicated lanes for cyclists and motorcyclists; improved vehicle standards such as those that mandate electronic stability control and advanced braking; and enhanced post-crash care.The report documents that these measures have contributed to reductions in road traffic deaths in 48 middle- and high-income countries. However, not a single low-income country has demonstrated a reduction in overall deaths, in large part because these measures are lacking.In fact, the risk of a road traffic death remains three times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The rates are highest in Africa (26.6 per 100 000 population) and lowest in Europe (9.3 per 100 000 population). On the other hand, since the previous edition of the report, three regions of the world have reported a decline in road traffic death rates: Americas, Europe and the Western Pacific.Variations in road traffic deaths are also reflected by type of road user. Globally, pedestrians and cyclists account for 26% of all road traffic deaths, with that figure as high as 44% in Africa and 36% in the Eastern Mediterranean. Motorcycle riders and passengers account for 28% of all road traffic deaths, but the proportion is higher in some regions, e.g. 43% in South-East Asia and 36% in the Western Pacific. Editors note:WHO’s global status reports on road safety are released every two to three years, and serve as the key monitoring tool for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020. Compared to the previous report in the series released in 2015, other findings from the Global status report on road safety 2018 include:22 additional countries amended their laws on one or more risk factors to bring them in line with best practice, covering an additional 1 billion people;46 countries representing 3 billion people have laws setting speed limits that align with best practice;45 countries representing 2.3 billion people currently have drink-driving laws that align with best practice; 49 countries representing 2.7 billion people, currently have laws on motorcycle helmet use that align with best practice;105 countries representing 5.3 billion people, currently have laws on seat-belt use that align with best practice; 33 countries representing 652 million people, currently have laws on the use of child restraint systems that align with best practice; 114 countries currently undertake some systematic assessment or star rating of existing roads; Only 40 countries representing 1 billion people, have implemented at least 7 or all of the 8 priority UN vehicle safety standards; More than half of countries (62%) have a telephone number with full country coverage to activate the emergency care system;55% of countries have a formal process to train and certify pre-hospital care providers.

    "content_html": "<div><p>The nineteenth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director General on 27 November 2018 at WHO headquarters with members, advisers and invited Member States attending via teleconference.</p><p>The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV).  The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations.  The following IHR States Parties provided an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 15 August 2018: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), Nigeria, Niger, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and Somalia. </p><h2><strong>Wild polio</strong></h2><p>The Committee commended the continued high level commitment seen in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the significant degree of cooperation and coordination, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border.  The committee noted that it is four years since there has been international spread outside of these two epidemiologically linked countries.</p><p>However, the Committee was very concerned by the increase in WPV1 cases globally in 2018, especially regarding the increased number of WPV cases in Afghanistan.  Furthermore, after a 10-month period of no international spread of wild poliovirus between the two neighbours, Pakistan and Afghanistan, cross border spread in both directions has occurred in the last three months.</p><p>In Pakistan the situation in 2018 has stagnated, with the number of cases so far at the same level in 2018 as for the whole of 2017.  Furthermore, positive environmental isolates in 2018 continue to be widely spread geographically indicating multiple areas of transmission and missed susceptible population groups.  Nevertheless, the performance of the eradication program has shown some improvement in areas such as SIA quality. </p><p>In Afghanistan, the number of polio cases has almost doubled in 2018, with 19 cases reported so far, compared to 10 at the same time last year, due to worsened security and greater inaccessibility, and persistent pockets of refusals and missed children.  Environmental surveillance is also finding an increased proportion of positive samples.  The security situation and access would need to significantly improve for eradication efforts to progress, as currently 1 million children under 5 years old are inaccessible in recent polio immunization campaigns.</p><p>It is now more than two years since the last WPV1 was detected in an accessible area of Nigeria, and four years since there has been any international spread of WPV1 from the country.  The Committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity, and noted that the inaccessible target population was now down to around 70,000 children, scattered across Borno in smaller pockets. </p><h2><strong>Vaccine derived poliovirus</strong></h2><p>The outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Somalia, Kenya, DR Congo, Niger and cVDPV1 in PNG and cVDPV3 in Somalia continue to be of major concern, particularly the apparent international spread between Somalia and Kenya and the recent spread from Nigeria into Niger of cVDPV2, given that traditionally cVDPV viruses have rarely spread across borders.  Conflict and population movement within and outside DR Congo indicate a degree of risk of spread.  <br/>Large inaccessible areas of Somalia are a significant constraint on achieving interruption of transmission of the cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 in the area, exacerbated by large population movements into and out of these areas.  <br/>Nevertheless because of the limited supply of IPV, in cVDPV type 2 outbreaks the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations for border immunization of departing travellers can be difficult.  The committee noted the progress made with cross border cooperation between PNG and Indonesia, but was concerned that new cases of cVDPV1 in new provinces of PNG had been detected in the last three months, and that surveillance indicators in Indonesian provinces neighbouring PNG were sub-optimal. Similarly, countries neighbouring Somalia, such as South Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti, have areas of weak surveillance which poses the risk that international spread may go undetected.  The outbreak of cVDPV2 in Syria has been successfully controlled with no international spread, and Syria is no longer considered infected but remains vulnerable. </p><p>The committee noted that in all infected countries, routine immunization was weak.  The outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Jigawa, and for the second time in Sokoto, Nigeria, again underlines the vulnerability of northern Nigeria to poliovirus transmission.  Routine immunization coverage remains very poor in many areas of the country, although the political leadership and national emergency programme to strengthen routine immunization is beginning to make an impact in some areas.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</p><ul><li>Although the declaration of the PHEIC and issuance of Temporary Recommendations has reduced the risk of international spread of WPV, progress is fragile, and should international spread now occur, the impact on WPV eradication would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and prolonging requirements for dedicated human and financial resources in support of the eradication effort. The reversal in progress in Afghanistan and the stagnation in Pakistan with exportation of WPV continuing between the two countries, heighten concerns.</li><li>There is a risk of global complacency as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and a concern that removal of the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency.</li><li>Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation. Gaps in population immunity in several key high-risk areas is evidenced by the current number of cVDPV outbreaks of all serotypes, which only emerge and circulate when polio population immunity is low as a result of deficient routine immunization programmes. </li><li>The international outbreak of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, with a highly diverged cVDPV2 that appears to have circulated undetected for up to four years, highlights that there are still high-risk populations in South and Central zones of Somalia where population immunity and surveillance are compromised by conflict.</li><li>Similarly the new spread of cVDPV2 between Nigeria and Niger highlights the significant risk of persisting type 2 outbreaks two years after OPV2 withdrawal, and the inability so far to prevent further spread within and outside Nigeria through application of consistently high quality mOPV2 SIAs is a concern.</li><li>The difficulty in controlling spread of cVDPV2 in DR Congo heightens these concerns and demonstrates significant gaps in population immunity at a critical time in the polio endgame;the low coverage with routine IPV vaccination in several countries neighbouring DR Congo heightens the risk of international spread, as population immunity is rapidly waning.</li><li>Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.</li><li>The increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies pose another risk. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. </li><li>The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks. A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.</li></ul><h2><strong>Risk categories</strong></h2><p>The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:</p><ul><li>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread.</li><li>States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread.</li><li>States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.</li></ul><h2>Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:</h2><ul><li>Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.</li><li>Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period</li><li>These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (e.g. Borno)</li></ul><p>Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report.</p><h3><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">TEMPORARY RECOMMENDATIONS</span></strong></h3><h3><strong>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread</strong><strong> </strong></h3><p> </p><p><strong>WPV1</strong>                                                                                <strong>        </strong></p><p>Afghanistan (most recent detection 25 Oct 2018)              </p><p>Pakistan (most recent detection 25 Oct 2018)</p><p>Nigeria (most recent detection 27 Sept 2016)    <br/>       </p><p><strong>cVDPV1</strong></p><p>Papua New Guinea (most recent detection 1 Oct 2018)</p><p><strong>cVDPV3</strong></p><p>Somalia (most recent detection 7 Sept 2018)</p><p> </p><p>These countries should:</p><ul><li>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.</li><li>Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. &gt; four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.</li><li>Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers.</li><li>Ensure that such travellers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.</li><li>Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travellers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea).</li><li>Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travellers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of

considerations</span></p><p>In areas where specific geographies are inaccessible, an intensive effort should be made to immunize communities on the periphery of inaccessible areas including providing immunization posts at key transit points of high population movement.</p><p>The outbreak in Papua New Guinea is an example of the ongoing vulnerability of some parts of the world to polioviruses. The committee urged countries in close proximity to the current outbreaks, such as Ethiopia, South Sudan, Djibouti, Indonesia, Central African Republic and Lake Chad basin countries to urgently strengthen polio surveillance and routine immunization including with bOPV and IPV.  There needs to be a renewed urgency to addressing these gaps wherever they exist.  The world is at a critical point in polio eradication, and failure to boost population immunity through strengthening routine immunization, and where outbreaks have occurred through implementation of high quality SIAs, in areas of known high risk could jeopardize or severely delay polio eradication. The current situation calls for unabated efforts and use of every tool available, to achieve the goal in these most challenging countries.</p><p>The Committee noted that the extension of the PHEIC for over four years in the context of the end game of the global eradication effort, was an exceptional use of the IHR.  The committee noted that there is a legitimate debate about whether this continued declaration of a PHEIC may weaken its impact as a tool to address global health emergencies, and specifically whether it continues to have utility noting that the risk of international spread appears to have substantially diminished since 2014.  It noted that it was not originally envisaged that a PHEIC would continue for such a long period, but the committee feels that the circumstances of an eradication program such as polio are unique.  In an eradication program, it is the mere existence of the virus in a country that necessitates strenuous emergency measures, in addition to the number of cases.  The committee was concerned that the removal of the PHEIC in the current situation where exportation of WPV and cVDPV continues and progress has may even have reversed, might send out the wrong message to the global community and might weaken the gains made in reducing the risk of international spread in some areas.  There is sound evidence that the Temporary Recommendations have been an important factor in reducing the risk of international spread since 2014 <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/cmoroni/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/8LCXSTBH/19th%20polio%20EC%20IHR%20statement%20final.docx#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>,<a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/cmoroni/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/8LCXSTBH/19th%20polio%20EC%20IHR%20statement%20final.docx#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>. </p><p>Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by Afghanistan, DR Congo, Nigeria, Niger, Papua New Guinea and Somalia, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 27 November 2018 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 27 November 2018. </p><div><br clear=\"all\"/><hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"/><div id=\"ftn1\"><p><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/cmoroni/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/8LCXSTBH/19th%20polio%20EC%20IHR%20statement%20final.docx#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> Wilder-Smith A, Leong WY, Lopez LF, et al.

          "The Committee commended the continued high level commitment seen in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the significant degree of cooperation and coordination, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border.  The committee noted that it is four years since there has been international spread outside of these two epidemiologically linked countries.",
          "However, the Committee was very concerned by the increase in WPV1 cases globally in 2018, especially regarding the increased number of WPV cases in Afghanistan.  Furthermore, after a 10-month period of no international spread of wild poliovirus between the two neighbours, Pakistan and Afghanistan, cross border spread in both directions has occurred in the last three months.",
          "In Pakistan the situation in 2018 has stagnated, with the number of cases so far at the same level in 2018 as for the whole of 2017.  Furthermore, positive environmental isolates in 2018 continue to be widely spread geographically indicating multiple areas of transmission and missed susceptible population groups.  Nevertheless, the performance of the eradication program has shown some improvement in areas such as SIA quality.",
          "In Afghanistan, the number of polio cases has almost doubled in 2018, with 19 cases reported so far, compared to 10 at the same time last year, due to worsened security and greater inaccessibility, and persistent pockets of refusals and missed children.  Environmental surveillance is also finding an increased proportion of positive samples.  The security situation and access would need to significantly improve for eradication efforts to progress, as currently 1 million children under 5 years old are inaccessible in recent polio immunization campaigns.",
          "It is now more than two years since the last WPV1 was detected in an accessible area of Nigeria, and four years since there has been any international spread of WPV1 from the country.  The Committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity, and noted that the inaccessible target population was now down to around 70,000 children, scattered across Borno in smaller pockets."

          "The outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Somalia, Kenya, DR Congo, Niger and cVDPV1 in PNG and cVDPV3 in Somalia continue to be of major concern, particularly the apparent international spread between Somalia and Kenya and the recent spread from Nigeria into Niger of cVDPV2, given that traditionally cVDPV viruses have rarely spread across borders.  Conflict and population movement within and outside DR Congo indicate a degree of risk of spread. Large inaccessible areas of Somalia are a significant constraint on achieving interruption of transmission of the cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 in the area, exacerbated by large population movements into and out of these areas. Nevertheless because of the limited supply of IPV, in cVDPV type 2 outbreaks the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations for border immunization of departing travellers can be difficult.  The committee noted the progress made with cross border cooperation between PNG and Indonesia, but was concerned that new cases of cVDPV1 in new provinces of PNG had been detected in the last three months, and that surveillance indicators in Indonesian provinces neighbouring PNG were sub-optimal. Similarly, countries neighbouring Somalia, such as South Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti, have areas of weak surveillance which poses the risk that international spread may go undetected.  The outbreak of cVDPV2 in Syria has been successfully controlled with no international spread, and Syria is no longer considered infected but remains vulnerable.",
          "The committee noted that in all infected countries, routine immunization was weak.  The outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Jigawa, and for the second time in Sokoto, Nigeria, again underlines the vulnerability of northern Nigeria to poliovirus transmission.  Routine immunization coverage remains very poor in many areas of the country, although the political leadership and national emergency programme to strengthen routine immunization is beginning to make an impact in some areas."

          "The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:"
        ],
        "bullets": [
          "Although the declaration of the PHEIC and issuance of Temporary Recommendations has reduced the risk of international spread of WPV, progress is fragile, and should international spread now occur, the impact on WPV eradication would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and prolonging requirements for dedicated human and financial resources in support of the eradication effort. The reversal in progress in Afghanistan and the stagnation in Pakistan with exportation of WPV continuing between the two countries, heighten concerns.",
          "There is a risk of global complacency as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and a concern that removal of the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency.",
          "Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation. Gaps in population immunity in several key high-risk areas is evidenced by the current number of cVDPV outbreaks of all serotypes, which only emerge and circulate when polio population immunity is low as a result of deficient routine immunization programmes.",
          "The international outbreak of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, with a highly diverged cVDPV2 that appears to have circulated undetected for up to four years, highlights that there are still high-risk populations in South and Central zones of Somalia where population immunity and surveillance are compromised by conflict.",
          "Similarly the new spread of cVDPV2 between Nigeria and Niger highlights the significant risk of persisting type 2 outbreaks two years after OPV2 withdrawal, and the inability so far to prevent further spread within and outside Nigeria through application of consistently high quality mOPV2 SIAs is a concern.",
          "The difficulty in controlling spread of cVDPV2 in DR Congo heightens these concerns and demonstrates significant gaps in population immunity at a critical time in the polio endgame;the low coverage with routine IPV vaccination in several countries neighbouring DR Congo heightens the risk of international spread, as population immunity is rapidly waning.",
          "Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.",
          "The increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies pose another risk. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.",
          "The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks. A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders."

      "description": "The nineteenth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director General on 27 November 2018 at WHO headquarters with members, advisers and invited Member States attending via teleconference.The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV).  The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations.  The following IHR States Parties provided an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 15 August 2018: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), Nigeria, Niger, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and Somalia. Wild polio: The Committee commended the continued high level commitment seen in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the significant degree of cooperation and coordination, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border.  The committee noted that it is four years since there has been international spread outside of these two epidemiologically linked countries.However, the Committee was very concerned by the increase in WPV1 cases globally in 2018, especially regarding the increased number of WPV cases in Afghanistan.  Furthermore, after a 10-month period of no international spread of wild poliovirus between the two neighbours, Pakistan and Afghanistan, cross border spread in both directions has occurred in the last three months.In Pakistan the situation in 2018 has stagnated, with the number of cases so far at the same level in 2018 as for the whole of 2017.  Furthermore, positive environmental isolates in 2018 continue to be widely spread geographically indicating multiple areas of transmission and missed susceptible population groups.  Nevertheless, the performance of the eradication program has shown some improvement in areas such as SIA quality. In Afghanistan, the number of polio cases has almost doubled in 2018, with 19 cases reported so far, compared to 10 at the same time last year, due to worsened security and greater inaccessibility, and persistent pockets of refusals and missed children.  Environmental surveillance is also finding an increased proportion of positive samples.  The security situation and access would need to significantly improve for eradication efforts to progress, as currently 1 million children under 5 years old are inaccessible in recent polio immunization campaigns.It is now more than two years since the last WPV1 was detected in an accessible area of Nigeria, and four years since there has been any international spread of WPV1 from the country.  The Committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity, and noted that the inaccessible target population was now down to around 70,000 children, scattered across Borno in smaller pockets. Vaccine derived poliovirus: The outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Somalia, Kenya, DR Congo, Niger and cVDPV1 in PNG and cVDPV3 in Somalia continue to be of major concern, particularly the apparent international spread between Somalia and Kenya and the recent spread from Nigeria into Niger of cVDPV2, given that traditionally cVDPV viruses have rarely spread across borders.  Conflict and population movement within and outside DR Congo indicate a degree of risk of spread.  Large inaccessible areas of Somalia are a significant constraint on achieving interruption of transmission of the cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 in the area, exacerbated by large population movements into and out of these areas.  Nevertheless because of the limited supply of IPV, in cVDPV type 2 outbreaks the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations for border immunization of departing travellers can be difficult.  The committee noted the progress made with cross border cooperation between PNG and Indonesia, but was concerned that new cases of cVDPV1 in new provinces of PNG had been detected in the last three months, and that surveillance indicators in Indonesian provinces neighbouring PNG were sub-optimal. Similarly, countries neighbouring Somalia, such as South Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti, have areas of weak surveillance which poses the risk that international spread may go undetected.  The outbreak of cVDPV2 in Syria has been successfully controlled with no international spread, and Syria is no longer considered infected but remains vulnerable. The committee noted that in all infected countries, routine immunization was weak.  The outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Jigawa, and for the second time in Sokoto, Nigeria, again underlines the vulnerability of northern Nigeria to poliovirus transmission.  Routine immunization coverage remains very poor in many areas of the country, although the political leadership and national emergency programme to strengthen routine immunisation is beginning to make an impact in some areas. Conclusion: The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:Although the declaration of the PHEIC and issuance of Temporary Recommendations has reduced the risk of international spread of WPV, progress is fragile, and should international spread now occur, the impact on WPV eradication would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and prolonging requirements for dedicated human and financial resources in support of the eradication effort. The reversal in progress in Afghanistan and the stagnation in Pakistan with exportation of WPV continuing between the two countries, heighten concerns.There is a risk of global complacency as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and a concern that removal of the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency.Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation. Gaps in population immunity in several key high-risk areas is evidenced by the current number of cVDPV outbreaks of all serotypes, which only emerge and circulate when polio population immunity is low as a result of deficient routine immunization programmes. The international outbreak of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, with a highly diverged cVDPV2 that appears to have circulated undetected for up to four years, highlights that there are still high-risk populations in South and Central zones of Somalia where population immunity and surveillance are compromised by conflict.Similarly the new spread of cVDPV2 between Nigeria and Niger highlights the significant risk of persisting type 2 outbreaks two years after OPV2 withdrawal, and the inability so far to prevent further spread within and outside Nigeria through application of consistently high quality mOPV2 SIAs is a concern.The difficulty in controlling spread of cVDPV2 in DR Congo heightens these concerns and demonstrates significant gaps in population immunity at a critical time in the polio endgame;the low coverage with routine IPV vaccination in several countries neighbouring DR Congo heightens the risk of international spread, as population immunity is rapidly waning.Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.The increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies pose another risk. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks. A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.Risk categories: The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread.States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread.States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV. Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV: Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period. These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (e.g. Borno)Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report. TEMPORARY RECOMMENDATIONS: States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread  WPV1                                                                                        Afghanistan (most recent detection 25 Oct 2018)              Pakistan (most recent detection 25 Oct 2018)Nigeria (most recent detection 27 Sept 2016)           cVDPV1Papua New Guinea (most recent detection 1 Oct 2018)cVDPV3Somalia (most recent detection 7 Sept 2018) These countries should:Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. > four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers.Ensure that such travellers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travellers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea). Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travellers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travellers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border. Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication. Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected.Provide to the Director-General a regular report on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel.States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread DR Congo (most recent detection 25 Sept 2018) Kenya (most recent detection 21 March 2018) Nigeria (most recent detection 17 Oct 2018) Niger (most recent detection 9 Sept 2018) Somalia (most recent detection 4 Oct 2018). These countries should: Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained. Noting the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections, consider requesting vaccines from the global mOPV2 stockpile based on the recommendations of the Advisory Group on mOPV2. Encourage residents and long­term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel; those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure. Ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status.Intensify regional cooperation and cross­border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus, and vaccinate refugees, travellers and cross­border populations, according to the advice of the Advisory Group. Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication. Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without the detection of circulation of VDPV2 in the country from any source, and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the criteria of a ‘state no longer infected’. At the end of 12 months without evidence of transmission, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPVWPV1Cameroon (last case 9 Jul 2014) Central African Republic (last case 8 Dec 2011) Chad (last case 14 Jun 2012) cVDPVSyria (last case 21 Sept 2017). These countries should: Urgently strengthen routine immunization to boost population immunity. Enhance surveillance quality, including considering introducing supplementary methods such as environmental surveillance, to reduce the risk of undetected WPV1 and cVDPV transmission, particularly among high risk mobile and vulnerable populations. Intensify efforts to ensure vaccination of mobile and cross­border populations, Internally Displaced Persons, refugees and other vulnerable groups. Enhance regional cooperation and cross border coordination to ensure prompt detection of WPV1 and cVDPV, and vaccination of high risk population groups. Maintain these measures with documentation of full application of high quality surveillance and vaccination activities. At the end of 12 months* without evidence of reintroduction of WPV1 or new emergence and circulation of cVDPV, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.* For the Lake Chad countries, this will be linked to when Nigeria is considered no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV2.   Additional considerations: In areas where specific geographies are inaccessible, an intensive effort should be made to immunize communities on the periphery of inaccessible areas including providing immunisation posts at key transit points of high population movement.The outbreak in Papua New Guinea is an example of the ongoing vulnerability of some parts of the world to polioviruses. The committee urged countries in close proximity to the current outbreaks, such as Ethiopia, South Sudan, Djibouti, Indonesia, Central African Republic and Lake Chad basin countries to urgently strengthen polio surveillance and routine immunization including with bOPV and IPV.  There needs to be a renewed urgency to addressing these gaps wherever they exist.  The world is at a critical point in polio eradication, and failure to boost population immunity through strengthening routine immunization, and where outbreaks have occurred through implementation of high quality SIAs, in areas of known high risk could jeopardize or severely delay polio eradication. The current situation calls for unabated efforts and use of every tool available, to achieve the goal in these most challenging countries. The Committee noted that the extension of the PHEIC for over four years in the context of the end game of the global eradication effort, was an exceptional use of the IHR.  The committee noted that there is a legitimate debate about whether this continued declaration of a PHEIC may weaken its impact as a tool to address global health emergencies, and specifically whether it continues to have utility noting that the risk of international spread appears to have substantially diminished since 2014.  It noted that it was not originally envisaged that a PHEIC would continue for such a long period, but the committee feels that the circumstances of an eradication program such as polio are unique.  In an eradication program, it is the mere existence of the virus in a country that necessitates strenuous emergency measures, in addition to the number of cases.  The committee was concerned that the removal of the PHEIC in the current situation where exportation of WPV and cVDPV continues and progress has may even have reversed, might send out the wrong message to the global community and might weaken the gains made in reducing the risk of international spread in some areas.  There is sound evidence that the Temporary Recommendations have been an important factor in reducing the risk of international spread since 2014 [1],[2]. Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by Afghanistan, DR Congo, Nigeria, Niger, Papua New Guinea and Somalia, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 27 November 2018 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 27 November 2018.

This is according to a new report published today by leading health organizations. </p><p>Because of gaps in vaccination coverage, measles outbreaks occurred in all regions, while there were an estimated 110 000 deaths related to the disease. <br/></p><p>Using updated disease modelling data, the report provides the most comprehensive estimates of measles trends over the last 17 years. It shows that since 2000, over 21 million lives have been saved through measles immunizations. However, reported cases increased by more than 30 percent worldwide from 2016. <br/></p><p>The Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and Europe experienced the greatest upsurges in cases in 2017, with the Western Pacific the only World Health Organization (WHO) region where measles incidence fell.<br/></p><p>“The resurgence of measles is of serious concern, with extended outbreaks occurring across regions, and particularly in countries that had achieved, or were close to achieving measles elimination,” said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Deputy Director General for Programmes at WHO. “Without urgent efforts to increase vaccination coverage and identify populations with unacceptable levels of under-, or unimmunized children, we risk losing decades of progress in protecting children and communities against this devastating, but entirely preventable disease.”<br/></p><p>Measles is a serious and highly contagious disease. It can cause debilitating or fatal complications, including encephalitis (an infection that leads to swelling of the brain), severe diarrhoea and dehydration, pneumonia, ear infections and permanent vision loss. Babies and young children with malnutrition and weak immune systems are particularly vulnerable to complications and death.</p><p>The disease is preventable through two doses of a safe and effective vaccine. For several years, however, global coverage with the first dose of measles vaccine has stalled at 85 percent. This is far short of the 95 percent needed to prevent outbreaks, and leaves many people, in many communities, susceptible to the disease. Second dose coverage stands at 67 percent.<br/></p><p>“The increase in measles cases is deeply concerning, but not surprising,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “Complacency about the disease and the spread of falsehoods about the vaccine in Europe, a collapsing health system in Venezuela and pockets of fragility and low immunization coverage in Africa are combining to bring about a global resurgence of measles after years of progress. Existing strategies need to change: more effort needs to go into increasing routine immunization coverage and strengthening health systems. Otherwise we will continue chasing one outbreak after another.”<br/></p><p>Responding to the recent outbreaks, health agencies are calling for sustained investment in immunization systems, alongside efforts to strengthen routine vaccination services. These efforts must focus especially on reaching the poorest, most marginalized communities, including people affected by conflict and displacement. <br/></p><p>The agencies also call for actions to build broad-based public support for immunizations, while tackling misinformation and hesitancy around vaccines where these exist.<br/></p><p>“Sustained investments are needed to strengthen immunization service delivery and to use every opportunity for delivering vaccines to those who need them,” said Dr Robert Linkins, Branch Chief of Accelerated Disease Control and Vaccine Preventable Disease Surveillance at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Measles &amp; Rubella Initiative Management Team Chair. <br/></p><p>The Measles and Rubella Initiative is a partnership formed in 2001 of the American Red Cross, CDC, the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF, and WHO.<br/></p><h2>Note to editors</h2><p>‘Progress Toward Regional Measles Elimination — Worldwide, 2000–2017’ is a joint publication of WHO and CDC.

This is according to a new report published today by leading health organizations. Because of gaps in vaccination coverage, measles outbreaks occurred in all regions, while there were an estimated 110 000 deaths related to the disease. Using updated disease modelling data, the report provides the most comprehensive estimates of measles trends over the last 17 years. It shows that since 2000, over 21 million lives have been saved through measles immunizations. However, reported cases increased by more than 30 percent worldwide from 2016. The Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and Europe experienced the greatest upsurges in cases in 2017, with the Western Pacific the only World Health Organization (WHO) region where measles incidence fell.“The resurgence of measles is of serious concern, with extended outbreaks occurring across regions, and particularly in countries that had achieved, or were close to achieving measles elimination,” said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Deputy Director General for Programmes at WHO. “Without urgent efforts to increase vaccination coverage and identify populations with unacceptable levels of under-, or unimmunized children, we risk losing decades of progress in protecting children and communities against this devastating, but entirely preventable disease.”Measles is a serious and highly contagious disease. It can cause debilitating or fatal complications, including encephalitis (an infection that leads to swelling of the brain), severe diarrhoea and dehydration, pneumonia, ear infections and permanent vision loss. Babies and young children with malnutrition and weak immune systems are particularly vulnerable to complications and death.The disease is preventable through two doses of a safe and effective vaccine. For several years, however, global coverage with the first dose of measles vaccine has stalled at 85 percent. This is far short of the 95 percent needed to prevent outbreaks, and leaves many people, in many communities, susceptible to the disease. Second dose coverage stands at 67 percent.“The increase in measles cases is deeply concerning, but not surprising,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “Complacency about the disease and the spread of falsehoods about the vaccine in Europe, a collapsing health system in Venezuela and pockets of fragility and low immunization coverage in Africa are combining to bring about a global resurgence of measles after years of progress. Existing strategies need to change: more effort needs to go into increasing routine immunization coverage and strengthening health systems. Otherwise we will continue chasing one outbreak after another.”Responding to the recent outbreaks, health agencies are calling for sustained investment in immunization systems, alongside efforts to strengthen routine vaccination services. These efforts must focus especially on reaching the poorest, most marginalized communities, including people affected by conflict and displacement. The agencies also call for actions to build broad-based public support for immunizations, while tackling misinformation and hesitancy around vaccines where these exist.“Sustained investments are needed to strengthen immunization service delivery and to use every opportunity for delivering vaccines to those who need them,” said Dr Robert Linkins, Branch Chief of Accelerated Disease Control and Vaccine Preventable Disease Surveillance at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Measles & Rubella Initiative Management Team Chair. The Measles and Rubella Initiative is a partnership formed in 2001 of the American Red Cross, CDC, the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF, and WHO.Note to editors‘Progress Toward Regional Measles Elimination — Worldwide, 2000–2017’ is a joint publication of WHO and CDC. It is published within the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record and in CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.Launched in 2001, the Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI) is led by the American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation, CDC, UNICEF and WHO. M&RI is committed to ensuring that no child dies from measles or is born with congenital rubella syndrome, and achieving the Global Vaccine Action Plan goal of measles and rubella elimination in at least five WHO regions by 2020. Measles elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles virus transmission in a region or other defined geographical area for more than 12 months. Conversely, a country is no longer considered to be measles free if the virus returns and transmission is sustained continuously for more than a year. Further informationThe report is available in CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report as of November 29 2018 and in WHO’s Weekly Epidemiological Record from November 30 2018.Further information on immunization progress is also contained within the  2018 Assessment Report of The Global Vaccine Action Plan by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, published in November 2018.",

The trial is the first-ever multi drug trial for an Ebola treatment. It will form part of a multi-outbreak, multi-country study that was agreed to by partners under a World Health Organization (WHO) initiative.“While our focus remains on bringing this outbreak to an end, the launch of the randomized control trial in DRC is an important step towards finally finding an Ebola treatment that will save lives,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Until now, patients have been treated under a compassionate use protocol, with drugs that showed promise and had a good safety profile in laboratory conditions. The giant step DRC is taking now will bring clarity about what works best, and save many lives in years to come. We hope to one day say that the death and suffering from Ebola is behind us.”Until now, over 160 patients have been treated with investigational therapeutics under an ethical framework developed by WHO, in consultation with experts in the field and the DRC, called theMonitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions(MEURI). The MEURI protocol was not designed to evaluate the drugs. Now that protocols for trials are in place, patients will be offered treatments under that framework in the facilities where the trial has started. In others, compassionate use will continue up to the time when they join the randomization. Patients will not be treated noticeably differently from before, though the treatment they receive will be decided by random allocation. The data gathered will become standardized and will be useful for drawing conclusions about the safety and efficacy of the drugs.“Our country is struck with Ebola outbreaks too often, which also means we have unique expertise in combatting it,” said Dr Olly Ilunga, Minister of Health of the DRC.  “These trials will contribute to building that knowledge, while we continue to respond on every front to bring the current outbreak to an end.”In October, WHO convened a meeting of international organizations, United Nations partners, countries at risk of Ebola, drug manufacturers and others to agree on a framework to continue trials in the next Ebola outbreak, whenever and wherever that is. Over time, this will lead to an accumulation of evidence that will help to draw robust conclusions across outbreaks about the currently available drugs, and any new ones that may come along.At the heart of the long term plan and the current trial is always the goal to ensure that patients with Ebola and their communities are treated with respect and fairness.

To this extent, as a tangible sign of the wish to close cooperation between WHO and the EP, a Joint Statement has been signed by both parties”.Dr Tedros thanked Members of the European Parliament for their commitment to the right to health and to the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-Being, to be presented at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2019: “The new Joint Statement between WHO and the European Parliament will provide a great opportunity for future collaboration on achieving the health related Sustainable Development Goals ,” he concluded.",

    "content_html": "<p>Reductions in malaria cases have stalled after several years of decline globally, according to the new <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"/publications/i/item/9789241565653\">World malaria report 2018</a><em>. </em>To get the reduction in malaria deaths and disease back on track, WHO and partners are joining a new country-led response, launched today, to scale up prevention and treatment, and increased investment, to protect vulnerable people from the deadly disease. </p><p>For the second consecutive year, the annual report produced by WHO reveals a plateauing in numbers of people affected by malaria: in 2017, there were an estimated 219 million cases of malaria, compared to 217 million the year before. But in the years prior, the number of people contracting malaria globally had been steadily falling, from 239 million in 2010 to 214 million in 2015. </p><p>“Nobody should die from malaria. But the world faces a new reality: as progress stagnates, we are at risk of squandering years of toil, investment and success in reducing the number of people suffering from the disease,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “We recognise we have to do something different – now. So today we are launching a country-focused and -led plan to take comprehensive action against malaria by making our work more effective where it counts most – at local level.”</p><h2>Where malaria is hitting hardest</h2><p>In 2017, approximately 70% of all malaria cases (151 million) and deaths (274 000) were concentrated in 11 countries: 10 in Africa (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania) and India. There were 3.5 million more malaria cases reported in these 10 African countries in 2017 compared to the previous year, while India, however, showed progress in reducing its disease burden.</p><p>Despite marginal increases in recent years in the distribution and use of insecticide-treated bed nets in sub-Saharan Africa – the primary tool for preventing malaria – the report highlights major coverage gaps. In 2017, an estimated half of at-risk people in Africa did not sleep under a treated net. Also, fewer homes are being protected by indoor residual spraying than before, and access to preventive therapies that protect pregnant women and children from malaria remains too low.</p><div contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"width:640px;height:360px;position:relative;z-index:40;\"><div><div sf-youtube-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGMwZDmWl2w\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"1\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fGMwZDmWl2w?v=fGMwZDmWl2w&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fweb-prod.who.int&amp;widgetid=1\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div></div></div><h2>High impact response needed</h2><p>In line with WHO’s strategic vision to scale up activities to protect people’s health, the new country-driven <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"/publications/i/item/WHO-CDS-GMP-2018.25\">“High burden to high impact” response plan</a> has been launched to support nations with most malaria cases and deaths.

    "content_html": "<br/>\nNew measures to overcome challenges in the response to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are having a positive impact, although the outbreak remains dangerous and unpredictable, the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping and the World Health Organization (WHO) said after a joint mission to assess the outbreak. <br/>\n<br/>\nWHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Jean-Pierre Lacroix yesterday travelled with the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, to the city of Beni in eastern DRC, the epicentre of the outbreak, where they met health workers, civil society representatives, peacekeeping troops and local authorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe United Nations Stabilization Mission in the DRC, MONUSCO, has recently taken an active approach to armed groups operating in North Kivu, which has contributed to a period of calm in and around the city of Beni, although some attacks have continued in surrounding villages.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder the leadership of the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners are also making greater use of community surveillance, in which community members are trained to conduct contact tracing activities in areas that outsiders have difficulty accessing. This has contributed to a decline in new cases over the past two weeks, although the situation remains of grave concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr Lacroix and Dr Tedros also met DRC Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala to share their observations and recommendations and to discuss how best to support the government’s response to the outbreak.<br/>\n<br/>\n“We are facing numerous complex challenges, but it’s encouraging and inspiring to see that our efforts to deliver as one UN have been extremely successful in many hotspots and will help to end the outbreak and save lives,” said Mr Lacroix.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the outbreak began in August, there have been 308 cases and 191 deaths, about half of which have been in Beni, a city of 800,000 people. The current outbreak is the country’s 10th and is on track to surpass the previous largest outbreak, which was in Yambuku in 1976 when there were 318 cases and 280 people died. <br/>\n<br/>\nMONUSCO has provided support to the Ebola response since the beginning of the outbreak through the provision of logistical support, office facilities, transportation, communication and security.<br/>\n<br/>\nEbola response teams have sometimes faced difficulties on the ground, with misinformation and mistrust due to decades of conflict contributing to a reluctance with some local populations to allow Ebola response teams to vaccinate, conduct contact tracing and perform safe and dignified burials. Community engagement activities have helped address concerns and most local communities have proven supportive and are keenly aware of the dangers of Ebola and the importance of ending the outbreak. <br/>\n<br/>\n“The fact that we have so far prevented Ebola from spreading into neighbouring countries is a testament to the hard work and determination of staff from all partners,” said Dr Tedros.  “As complex and challenging as this outbreak is, I am confident that working together with the Ministry of Health, MONUSCO and all our partners, we can and will end it.”<br/>\n<br/>\nWHO has almost 280 staff in North Kivu, supporting hundreds more from the Ministry of Health and partners. <br/>\n<br/>\nSix treatment centres have been built, where 91 patients are currently being treated. The centres are operated by the Ministry of Health and partners including ALIMA, Médecins Sans Frontières and the International Medical Corps. Each treatment centre is supported by a mobile laboratory to rapidly diagnose cases and guide treatment. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo date, 27,000 people have been vaccinated against Ebola, and almost every new patient receives one of 4 investigational treatments, something which was never previously possible during an Ebola outbreak. While mourning those who have died, they noted that 91 people have recovered and returned to their communities thanks to the hard work and joint efforts of national and international responders. <br/>\n<br/>\nMr Lacroix and Dr Tedros paid tribute to the dedication of staff from WHO, MONUSCO, the Ministry of Health and all partners who are fighting a dangerous outbreak in extremely difficult conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.who.int/docs/default-source/imported2/transcription-de-la-conf%C3%A9rence-de-presse-conjointe-dpko-oms-2018-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Transcript of the Press Conference</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<div> </div>",

Initial symptoms for both include fever and rash. But measles can be deadly, causing devastating health complications, such as pneumonia, blindness\n    and brain damage, especially among children. Rubella, also known as German measles, is particularly serious for pregnant women. Infection can lead to miscarriage or birth defects, including blindness, deafness and heart disease.Historically low levels of measles were recorded in the Region in 2012, then a resurgence of cases and deaths occurred from 2013 to 2016.In October 2017, all 37 countries and areas in the WHO Western Pacific Region—which spans from China and Mongolia in the west to French Polynesia and New Zealand in the east— committed to eliminate measles and rubella as soon as possible\n    with the adoption of a regional strategy and plan of action.That same year, intensified efforts led to a drop in both diseases to the lowest levels on record in the Region—5.2 cases of measles and 2.45 cases of rubella per million people—a testament to the power of strengthened immunization programmes,\n    disease surveillance and laboratory capacity.Today’s announcement brings the total number of measles-free countries and areas in the Region to nine: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Hong Kong SAR (China), Japan, Macao SAR (China), New Zealand, the\n    Republic of Korea and Singapore. Among these, five have also stopped transmission of rubella: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Macao SAR (China), New Zealand and the Republic of Korea.“I’m delighted to be able to make this announcement today,” said Dr Shin Young-soo, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific. “It goes to show that when countries have strong immunization programmes that protect against both\n    these viruses, surveillance systems to detect them, and laboratories to test and confirm diagnoses, they can eliminate measles and rubella.”“But we must not let down our guard,” he cautioned. “Countries still working towards elimination should further strengthen control efforts. Even in countries that have achieved elimination, the job is not done. They must remain vigilant,\n    continue improving vaccination rates and catch any imported cases to ensure these diseases cannot spread again.” Quotes from the verified countries“The elimination of rubella is a great day for public health in Australia and sends a powerful message that vaccination works. I commend the efforts of Australia’s health professionals over the decades and the millions of parents who ensure their children are always vaccinated. Our National Immunisation Program played an essential role in this huge achievement by ensuring high levels of vaccination coverage for rubella,” said the Hon. Greg Hunt MP, Minister for Health, Australia.“Following WHO certification of Brunei Darussalam’s measles-free status in 2015, we are very pleased to now be acknowledged for eliminating rubella. This is an achievement for the country and reflects our commitment to eliminating childhood infections and ensuring universal health coverage. High vaccination coverage and surveillance must be maintained to ensure prevention and early detection. Continuous vigilance, strong political commitment, concerted and collaborative efforts are also needed to eliminate childhood infections such as rubella in the region altogether,” said Dr Haji Md Isham bin Jaafar, Minister of Health, Brunei Darussalam .“The Government of the Macao SAR (China) is very pleased to have been verified by the World Health Organization as having eliminated rubella. We are grateful to WHO for its support in this success, and we are committed to sustaining our rubella elimination status,” said Dr Lei Chin Ion, Director of the Health Bureau of Macao SAR (China)",

          "“Adoption of the Declaration at this global conference in Astana will set new directions for the development of primary health care as a basis of health care systems,” said Yelzhan Birtanov, Minister of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan. “The new Declaration reflects obligations of countries, people, communities, health care systems and partners to achieve healthier lives through sustainable primary health care.”",
          "UNICEF and WHO will help governments and civil society to act on the Declaration of Astana and encourage them to back the movement. UNICEF and WHO will also support countries in reviewing the implementation of this Declaration, in cooperation with other partners.",
          "Notes to editors:",
          "The ﻿ Global Conference on Primary Health Care ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ is taking place from 25-26 October in Astana, Kazakhstan, co-hosted by WHO, UNICEF and the Government of Kazakhstan. Participants include ministers of health, finance, education and social welfare; health workers and patient advocates; youth delegates and activists; and leaders representing bilateral and multilateral institutions, global health advocacy organizations, civil society, academia, philanthropy, media and the private sector.",
          "The Declaration of Astana , unanimously endorsed by all WHO Member States, makes pledges in four key areas: (1) make bold political choices for health across all sectors; (2) build sustainable primary health care; (3) empower individuals and communities; and (4) align stakeholder support to national policies, strategies and plans."

But the Committee remains deeply concerned by the outbreak and emphasized that response activities need to be intensified and ongoing vigilance is critical. The Committee also noted the very complex security situation. Additionally, the Committee has provided public health advice below.</p>\n<h3>Proceedings of the Meeting</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/ebola-2018-october-ec-members/en/\">Members and advisors of the Emergency Committee</a> met by teleconference. Presentations were made by representatives of the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the epidemiological situation, the response strategies, and recent adaptations, including implementation of rapid response teams at community level, with a focus on Beni. A representative of the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (MONUSCO) reported on the work of MONUSCO, including its logistics and security activities to support the response. During the informational session, the WHO Secretariat provided an update on the situation and the response to the current Ebola outbreak and preparedness activities in neighbouring countries.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Committee’s role was to provide to the Director-General its views and perspectives on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Whether the event constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the event constitutes a PHEIC, what Temporary Recommendations should be made.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Current situation</h3>\n<p>On 1 August, WHO was notified by the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of Ebola Virus Disease in North Kivu province. Cases were also subsequently found in Ituri Province. From 4 May to 15 October 2018, 216 EVD cases were reported, of which 181 are confirmed and 35 are probable; 139 total deaths have occurred, of which 104 are confirmed and 35 are probable. The global case fatality rate stands at 64% overall, and at 57% among confirmed cases.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNine neighbouring countries have been advised that they are at high risk of spread and have been supported with equipment and personnel. Particular emphasis has been placed on Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan in terms of preparedness activities.</p>\n<h3>Key challenges</h3>\n<p>After discussion and deliberation on the information provided, the Committee concluded that this Ebola outbreak is taking place in a particularly complex context and poses several important challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This outbreak is taking place in an active conflict zone amidst prolonged humanitarian crises. Approximately 8 major security incidents have occurred in the Beni area in the past 8 weeks. These factors have complicated contact tracing and other aspects of the response. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Community mistrust, stemming from a variety of reasons, including the security situation, and people who avoid follow-up or delay seeking care, remain significant problems that require deepening engagement by community, national and international partners.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New cases being identified without epidemiological links are of great concern and require further detailed epidemiological mapping. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The assessment of the risk of spread is low at global level but it is very high at both national and regional levels. There has been no change to the risk assessment since 28 September. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ring vaccination efforts have achieved high coverage rates among eligible populations but rely heavily on highly performing contact tracing in DRC and all countries that may be affected.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Committee also noted positive developments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\r\n    The Committee commended the government of the DRC, WHO, and all response partners for the progress made under difficult circumstances. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All pillars of the response are working at scale and are being adjusted in real time. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Surveillance activities are commendable but need to be intensified.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MONUSCO is providing needed support for logistics and security for the response. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Investigational vaccines and therapeutics are being used for the first time at scale. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Screening at border crossings is being undertaken on a very large scale.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preparedness activities in neighbouring countries are ongoing, although these will require substantial additional financial support. </p>\n</li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In conclusion, the Emergency Committee, while advising that a PHEIC should not be declared at this time, offered the following Public Health Advice: </p>\n<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO, and partners must intensify the current response. Without this, the situation is likely to deteriorate significantly. This response should be supported by the entire international community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A critical determining factor is the safety and security of the population, which, in turn, affects the community’s perception of the response.

Women and girls are subjected, and often forced, to undergo virginity testing for various reasons. These include requests from parents or potential partners to establish marriage eligibility or from employers for employment eligibility. It is mostly performed by doctors, police officers, or community leaders on women and girls in order to assess their virtue, honour or social value. In some regions, it is common practice for health professionals to perform virginity testing on victims of rape, supposedly to ascertain whether or not rape occurred.<br/><br/>Virginity testing is often performed by inspecting the hymen for tears or its size of opening, and/or inserting fingers into the vagina (the “two-finger” test). Both techniques are practiced under the belief that the appearance of the female genitalia can indicate a girl’s or woman’s history of sexual activity. WHO states that there is no evidence that either method can prove whether a woman or girl has had vaginal intercourse or not.<br/> <br/><strong>Emphasis on women’s “virginity” is a form of gender discrimination<br/></strong><br/>The term “virginity” is not a medical or scientific term.  Rather, the concept of “virginity” is a social, cultural and religious construct – one that reflects gender discrimination against women and girls.<br/><br/>The social expectation that girls and women should remain “virgins” (i.e. without having sexual intercourse) is based on stereotyped notions that female sexuality should be curtailed within marriage. This notion is harmful to women and girls globally.<br/> <br/><strong>Health impacts of virginity testing <br/></strong><br/>These examinations are not only a violation of women’s and girls’ human rights, but in cases of rape can cause additional pain and mimic the original act of sexual violence, leading to re-experience, re-traumatization and re-victimization. Many women suffer from adverse short- and long-term physical, psychological and social consequences of this practice. This includes anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress. In extreme cases, women or girls may attempt suicide or be killed in the name of “honour”.<br/><br/>Performing this medically unnecessary and harmful test violates several human rights and ethical standards including the fundamental principle in medicine to ‘do no harm’. WHO recommends that this test should not be performed under any circumstances.<br/> <br/><strong>Governments, health professionals and communities must act to eliminate the practice<br/></strong><br/>There is an urgent need to raise awareness among health professionals and communities of the detrimental effects of performing this test on women and girls, its lack of scientific validity, and the need to eliminate its use. Some governments have banned virginity testing and enacted laws to criminally punish those who perform the examination. Many professional health associations and human rights organizations have condemned this practice as unscientific and a violation of women’s and girls’ rights.<br/><br/>UN Human Rights, UN Women and WHO are committed to ending virginity testing and ensuring that the rights of all women and girls are upheld. The following are recommended strategies to eliminate virginity testing in settings where it occurs:</div><ul><li>Health professionals and their professional associations should be aware that virginity testing has no scientific merit and cannot determine past vaginal penetration.

      "description": "Eleven heads of the world’s leading health and development organizations today signed a landmark commitment to find new ways of working together to accelerate progress towards achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.Coordinated by the World Health Organization, the initiative unites the work of 11 organizations, with others set to join in the next phase.The commitment follows a request from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of Ghana, and Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, with support from United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, to develop a global action plan to define how global actors can better collaborate to accelerate progress towards the health-related targets of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.“Healthy people are essential for sustainable development – to ending poverty, promoting peaceful and inclusive societies and protecting the environment. However, despite great strides made against many of the leading causes of death and disease, we must redouble our efforts or we will not reach several of the health-related targets,” the organizations announced today at the World Health Summit in Berlin. “The Global Action Plan represents an historic commitment to new ways of working together to accelerate progress towards meeting the 2030 goals. We are committed to redefine how our organizations work together to deliver more effective and efficient support to countries and to achieve better health and well-being for all people.”The group has agreed to develop new ways of working together to maximize resources and measure progress in a more transparent and engaging way. The first phase of the plan’s development is organized under three strategic approaches: align, accelerate and account.Align: The organizations have committed to coordinate programmatic, financing and operational processes to increase collective efficiency and impact on a number of shared priorities such as gender equality and reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health.Accelerate: They have agreed to develop common approaches and coordinate action in areas of work that have the potential to increase the pace of progress in global health. The initial set of seven “accelerators” include community and civil society engagement, research and development, data and sustainable financing.  Account: To improve transparency and accountability to countries and development partners, the health organizations are breaking new ground by setting common milestones for nearly 50 health-related targets across 14 Sustainable Development Goals. These milestones will provide a critical checkpoint and common reference to determine where the world stands in 2023 and whether it is on track to reach the 2030 goals.The Global Action Plan will also enhance collective action and leverage funds to address gender inequalities that act as barriers to accessing health, and to improve comprehensive quality health care for women and girls, including sexual and reproductive health services. The organizations that have already signed up to the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All are: Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Global Financing Facility, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, Unitaid, UN Women, the World Bank and WHO. The World Food Programme has committed to join the plan in the coming months.The final plan will be delivered in September 2019 at the United Nations General Assembly.For more information,  https://www.who.int/initiatives/sdg3-global-action-plan",

      "description": "The Conference of Parties to the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC) today opens its eighth session (COP 8), with a view to defining a roadmap for strengthening and expanding the scope of the landmark global health treaty.The COP8 discussions from 1 to 6 October bring together delegations from 137 countries, along with representatives of United Nations agencies, other intergovernmental organizations and civil society. Conference participants will review the progress in reducing tobacco use and strategies for addressing the emergence of new tobacco products and tobacco industry interference in tobacco control efforts.WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who will open the conference, has hailed the tobacco control treaty as one of the greatest public health achievements of the last twenty years.“Since it came into force 13 years ago, the FCTC remains one of the word’s most powerful tools for promoting public health,” says Dr. Tedros. “Through the implementation of this treaty, we are making great progress, and we are saving lives.”As a result of this treaty, countries have passed comprehensive tobacco control laws, including increased taxes on tobacco, establishment of smoke-free spaces, and requirements for large graphic health warnings and plain packaging of tobacco products.A new  Global Progress Report on Implementation of the WHO FCTC to be launched at the FCTC press conference today at 13h15 CET, features results of the reports submitted by Parties to the treaty in the 2018 reporting cycle. The report highlights global achievements in tobacco control resulting from national strategies and implementation of measures to cut tobacco use, as well as ongoing challenges posed by policy gaps and the tobacco industry.“Many governments have advanced tobacco control actions and clearly progressed on implementing the Convention,” says Dr. Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, Head of the WHO FCTC Secretariat. “But this is not a time to be complacent. With astronomical budgets, the tobacco industry continues its furious efforts to undermine the implementation of our treaty.”High on the agenda of COP8 discussions will be a draft of a Medium-term Strategic Framework to outline priorities for scaling up the global tobacco control agenda and strengthening implementation of the treaty over the next five years.This will include a push to extend tobacco control efforts to include a new focus on the negative impacts of tobacco production on the environment and on development.“We hope this conference will be the starting point for a wider application of the FCTC as an international treaty that extends beyond tobacco control to support strategies aimed also at promoting sustainable development and protecting environmental resources,” says Dr. Costa e Silva.Michael Møller, Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva, has emphasized the critical need to link tobacco control with sustainable development strategies.

          "Heads of state and government today committed to 13 new steps to tackle noncommunicable diseases including cancers, heart and lung diseases, stroke, and diabetes, and to promote mental health and well-being. “Today, world leaders have taken a set of landmark steps to beat NCDs,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “These add up to a historic opportunity to promote health, save lives, and grow economies.” World leaders agreed to take responsibility themselves for their countries’ effort to prevent and treat NCDs. They also agreed that these efforts should include policy, legislative and regulatory measures, including fiscal measures to protect people from tobacco use, unhealthy diets, and the harmful use of alcohol, for example by restricting alcohol advertising, and banning smoking. They committed to implement a series of WHO-recommended policies to prevent and control of NCDs - such as public education and awareness campaigns to promote healthier lifestyles, vaccinating against HPV virus to protect against cervical cancer and treating hypertension and diabetes. WHO estimates that implementing all these policies could generate US$ 350 billion in economic growth in low and lower-middle-income countries between now and 2030. Other specific commitments focus on halting the rise of childhood obesity, promoting regular physical activity, reducing air pollution and improving mental health and wellbeing. The political declaration reaffirms WHO’s global leadership of the fight to beat NCDs and promote mental health, and urges the Organization to continue working closely with key partners, including government, civil society and the private sector. In particular, it calls on food manufacturers to take several actions. These include reformulating products to reduce salt, free sugars and saturated and industrially produced trans fats, using nutrition labelling on packaged food to inform consumers, and reducing the exposure to, and curbing the impact of, the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages on children.",

      "description": "World leaders meeting today at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly have committed to ensure that 40 million people with tuberculosis (TB) receive the care they need by end 2022. They also agreed to provide 30 million people with preventive treatment to protect them from developing TB.Watch the webcast recording\r\n“Today is a landmark in the long war on TB,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “These are bold promises – to keep them partnership is vital. WHO is committed to working with every country, every partner and every community to get the job done.”\r\n\r\nHeads of state and government attending this first-ever UN High-level meeting on TB agreed to mobilize US$ 13 billion a year by 2022 to implement TB prevention and care, and US$ 2 billion for research. They committed to take firm action against drug-resistant forms of the disease; build accountability and to prioritize human rights issues such as the stigma that still prevails around TB in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThey acknowledged that the current rate of progress was endangering prospects of meeting global targets to end TB. Today, TB remains the world’s deadliest infectious disease: it killed 1.6 million people in 2017, including 300 000 people with HIV. In the same year, 10 million people fell ill with TB.  \r\n\r\n“The political declaration proposed for this meeting sets a roadmap for accelerated action to end TB in line with the vision and targets for 2030,” said H.E. Ms Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly. “We have before us the opportunity for a clear win – a chance to save the lives of millions, to preserve billions in resources, to demonstrate the success of the Sustainable Development Goals, and to reaffirm the utility, efficacy and necessity of multilateralism and the UN System. Let us not miss this opportunity.”\r\n\r\nThe political declaration is the culmination of recent leadership commitments at global and regional level – including the 2017 Moscow Declaration to End TB – to drive universal access, sufficient and sustainable financing, intensified research and innovation, and accountability across all sectors.",

      "description": "More than 3 million people died as a result of harmful use of alcohol in 2016, according a report released by the World Health Organization (WHO) today. This represents 1 in 20 deaths. More than three quarters of these deaths were among men. Overall, the harmful use of alcohol causes more than 5% of the global disease burden.\r\nWHO’s Global status report on alcohol and health 2018 presents a comprehensive picture of alcohol consumption and the disease burden attributable to alcohol worldwide. It also describes what countries are doing to reduce this burden. \r\n“Far too many people, their families and communities suffer the consequences of the harmful use of alcohol through violence, injuries, mental health problems and diseases like cancer and stroke,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. “It’s time to step up action to prevent this serious threat to the development of healthy societies.”\r\nOf all deaths attributable to alcohol, 28% were due to injuries, such as those from traffic crashes, self-harm and interpersonal violence; 21% due to digestive disorders; 19% due to cardiovascular diseases, and the remainder due to infectious diseases, cancers, mental disorders and other health conditions.\r\nDespite some positive global trends in the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking and number of alcohol-related deaths since 2010, the overall burden of disease and injuries caused by the harmful use of alcohol is unacceptably high, particularly in the European Region and the Region of Americas.\r\nGlobally an estimated 237 million men and 46 million women suffer from alcohol-use disorders with the highest prevalence among men and women in the European region (14.8% and 3.5%) and the Region of Americas (11.5% and 5.1%). Alcohol-use disorders are more common in high-income countries.\r\n\r\nGlobal consumption predicted to increase in the next 10 years\r\nAn estimated 2.3 billion people are current drinkers. Alcohol is consumed by more than half of the population in three WHO regions – the Americas, Europe and the Western Pacific. Europe has the highest per capita consumption in the world, even though its per capita consumption has decreased by more than 10% since 2010. Current trends and projections point to an expected increase in global alcohol per capita consumption in the next 10 years, particularly in the South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions and the Region of the Americas. \r\n\r\nHow much alcohol are people drinking?\r\nThe average daily consumption of people who drink alcohol is 33 grams of pure alcohol a day, roughly equivalent to 2 glasses (each of 150 ml) of wine, a large (750 ml) bottle of beer or two shots (each of 40 ml) of spirits. \r\nWorldwide, more than a quarter (27%) of all 15–19-year-olds are current drinkers. Rates of current drinking are highest among 15–19-year-olds in Europe (44%), followed by the Americas (38%) and the Western Pacific (38%). School surveys indicate that, in many countries, alcohol use starts before the age of 15 with very small differences between boys and girls.\r\nWorldwide, 45% of total recorded alcohol is consumed in the form of spirits. Beer is the second alcoholic beverage in terms of pure alcohol consumed (34%) followed by wine (12%). Worldwide there have been only minor changes in preferences of alcoholic beverages since 2010. The largest changes took place in Europe, where consumption of spirits decreased by 3% whereas that of wine and beer increased.\r\nIn contrast, more than half (57%, or 3.1 billion people) of the global population aged 15 years and over had abstained from drinking alcohol in the previous 12 months.\r\n\r\nMore countries need to take action\r\n“All countries can do much more to reduce the health and social costs of the harmful use of alcohol,” said Dr Vladimir Poznyak, Coordinator of WHO’s Management of Substance Abuse unit. “Proven, cost-effective actions include increasing taxes on alcoholic drinks, bans or restrictions on alcohol advertising, and restricting the physical availability of alcohol.”\r\nHigher-income countries are more likely to have introduced these policies, raising issues of global health equity and underscoring the need for greater support to low- and middle-income countries.\r\nAlmost all (95%) countries have alcohol excise taxes, but fewer than half of them use other price strategies such as banning below-cost selling or volume discounts. The majority of countries have some type of restriction on beer advertising, with total bans most common for television and radio but less common for the internet and social media.\r\n“We would like to see Member States implement creative solutions that will save lives, such as taxing alcohol and restricting advertising. We must do more to cut demand and reach the target set by governments of a 10% relative reduction in consumption of alcohol globally between 2010 and 2025,” added Dr Tedros.\r\nReducing the harmful use of alcohol will help achieve a number of health-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those for maternal and child health, infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases and mental health, injuries and poisonings.",

It urges political leaders gathering next week for the first-ever United Nations High-level Meeting on TB to take decisive action, building on recent moves by the leaders of India, the Russian Federation, Rwanda, and South Africa. Nearly 50 Heads of State and Government are expected to attend the meeting.</p><p>“We have never seen such high-level political attention and understanding of what the world needs to do to end TB and drug-resistant TB, said Dr.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.   “We must capitalize on this new momentum and act together to end this terrible disease.”</p><p>To meet the global target of ending TB by 2030, countries need to urgently accelerate their response – including by increasing domestic and international funding to fight the disease. The WHO report provides an overview of status of the epidemic and the challenges and opportunities countries face in responding to it.</p><p><strong><br/>Status of the TB epidemic</strong></p><ul><li>Overall, TB deaths have decreased over the past year. In 2017, there were 1.6 million deaths (including among 300 000 HIV-positive people). Since 2000, a 44% reduction in TB deaths occurred among people with HIV compared with a 29% decrease among HIV-negative people; </li><li>Globally, an estimated 10 million people developed TB in 2017. The number of new cases is falling by 2% per year, although faster reductions have occurred in Europe (5% per year) and Africa (4% per year) between 2013 and 2017;</li><li>Some countries are moving faster than others - as evidenced in Southern Africa, with annual declines (in new cases) of 4% to 8% in countries such as Lesotho, Eswatini, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, thanks to better TB and HIV prevention and care. In the Russian Federation, high level political commitment and intensified TB efforts have led to more rapid declines in cases (5% per year) and deaths (13% per year) </li><li>Drug-resistant TB remains a global public health crisis: In 2017, 558 000 people were estimated to have developed disease resistant to at least <em>rifampicin</em> – the most effective first-line TB drug. The vast majority of these people had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), that is, combined resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid (another key first-line TB medicine).</li><li>WHO estimates that a quarter of the world’s population has TB infection.</li></ul><p><strong><br/>The TB response: </strong><strong>Challenges and opportunities</strong></p><p>      Access to care and prevention:</p><ul><li>Underreporting and under-diagnosis of TB cases remains a major challenge. Of the 10 million people who fell ill with TB in 2017, only 6.4 million were officially recorded by national reporting systems, leaving 3.6 million people undiagnosed, or detected but not reported. Ten countries accounted for 80% of this gap, with India, Indonesia and Nigeria topping the list.</li><li>Less than half of the estimated one million children with TB were reported in 2017, making it a much higher gap in detection than that in adults.</li></ul></div><ul><li>Treatment coverage lags behind at 64% and must increase to at least 90% by 2025 to meet the TB targets. </li><li>To urgently improve detection, diagnosis and treatment rates, WHO, the Stop TB Partnership and the Global Fund launched the new initiative in 2018,  <a href=\"/initiatives/find-treat-all-endtb\">Find. Treat. All. #EndTB</a><em>, </em>which set the target of providing quality care to 40 million people with TB from 2018 to 2022.</li><li>Only around half of the estimated 920,000 people with HIV-associated TB were reported in 2017.Of these, 84% were on antiretroviral therapy. Most of the gaps in detection and treatment were in the WHO African Region, where the burden of HIV-associated TB is highest. Only one in four people with MDR-TB were reported to have received treatment with a second-line regimen. China and India alone were home to 40% of patients requiring treatment for MDR-TB, but not reported to be receiving it. Globally, MDR-TB treatment success remains low at 55%, often due to drug toxicity making it impossible for patients to stay on treatment. A month ago, WHO issued a Rapid Communication on key changes to treatment of drug-resistant TB based on the latest scientific evidence. These changes should result in better treatment outcomes and more lives saved. WHO is already working with countries and partners to roll out these changes.</li><li>The Organization predicts that at least 30 million people should be able to access TB preventive treatment between 2018 and 2022, based on new WHO guidance. Although preventive treatment for latent TB infection is expanding, most people needing it are not yet accessing care. WHO strongly recommends preventive treatment for people living with HIV, and children under 5 years living in households with TB. Related new guidance was issued by WHO in 2018, to facilitate greater access to preventive services for those who need it.<br/><br/>Financing for implementation and research</li><li>One of the most urgent challenges is to scale up funding. In 2018, investments in TB prevention and care in low- and middle-income countries fell US$3.5 billion short of what is needed. The report flags that without an increase in funding, the annual gap will widen to US$ 5.4 billion in 2020 and to at least US$ 6.1 billion in 2022.A further US$ 1.3 billion per year is required to accelerate the development of new vaccines, diagnostics and medicines.</li></ul><p>“It is unacceptable that millions lose their lives, and many more suffer daily from this preventable and curable disease,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Global TB Programme.  “We need to join forces to root out this disease that has a devastating social and economic impact on those who are “left behind”, whose human rights and dignity are limited, and who struggle to access care. The time for action is now.”</p><p>WHO is guiding national and global actions to reach everyone with care, including those with TB, through a transformative health agenda and push towards Universal Health Coverage. This includes proactive engagement with civil society and other key stakeholders to jointly help countries get on track to end TB.</p><p><strong><br/>Historic opportunity to put the TB response on track </strong></p><p>Next week’s UN High-Level Meeting comes at a critical time. Ending the TB epidemic requires action beyond the health sector to address the risk factors and determinants of the disease. Commitments at the level of Heads of State will be essential to galvanize multi-sectoral action.   </p><p>“We must make sure that this report and the commitments we hear next week from country leaders at the High Level Meeting on TB translate into action,” said Dr Eric Goosby, UN Special Envoy on TB.  “Equally important, we must ensure that we hold our leaders accountable for the actions they promise to take.  And we must hold ourselves accountable for keeping the pressure on.”</p><p>In June this year, an Interactive Civil Society Hearing was organized by the Office of the President of the General Assembly, with the support of WHO, the Stop TB Partnership, civil society and other stakeholders as a key preparatory step towards high-level meeting. WHO continues to work closely with the Office of the President of the General Assembly in preparations for the High Level Meeting on 26 September, with civil society and partners.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Editors notes:</strong></p><p><strong>About the UN High-level Meeting on TB</strong></p><p>The United Nations General Assembly High-level Meeting on the fight against tuberculosis will take place on 26 September 2018 (www.who.int/UNHLMonTB/). The meeting follows the Global Ministerial Conference on Ending TB (Moscow, 16-17 November 2017), which resulted in high-level commitments from nearly 120 countries to accelerate the End TB response as expressed in the Moscow Declaration to End TB. </p>",

      "description": "Fewer people fell ill and died from tuberculosis (TB) last year but countries are still not doing enough to end TB by 2030, warns the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although global efforts have averted an estimated 54 million TB deaths since 2000, TB remains the world’s deadliest infectious disease.WHO’s 2018 Global TB Report, released in New York today, calls for an unprecedented mobilization of national and international commitments. It urges political leaders gathering next week for the first-ever United Nations High-level Meeting on TB to take decisive action, building on recent moves by the leaders of India, the Russian Federation, Rwanda, and South Africa. Nearly 50 Heads of State and Government are expected to attend the meeting.“We have never seen such high-level political attention and understanding of what the world needs to do to end TB and drug-resistant TB, said Dr.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.   “We must capitalize on this new momentum and act together to end this terrible disease.”To meet the global target of ending TB by 2030, countries need to urgently accelerate their response – including by increasing domestic and international funding to fight the disease. The WHO report provides an overview of status of the epidemic and the challenges and opportunities countries face in responding to it.Status of the TB epidemicOverall, TB deaths have decreased over the past year. In 2017, there were 1.6 million deaths (including among 300 000 HIV-positive people). Since 2000, a 44% reduction in TB deaths occurred among people with HIV compared with a 29% decrease among HIV-negative people; Globally, an estimated 10 million people developed TB in 2017. The number of new cases is falling by 2% per year, although faster reductions have occurred in Europe (5% per year) and Africa (4% per year) between 2013 and 2017;Some countries are moving faster than others - as evidenced in Southern Africa, with annual declines (in new cases) of 4% to 8% in countries such as Lesotho, Eswatini, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, thanks to better TB and HIV prevention and care. In the Russian Federation, high level political commitment and intensified TB efforts have led to more rapid declines in cases (5% per year) and deaths (13% per year) Drug-resistant TB remains a global public health crisis: In 2017, 558 000 people were estimated to have developed disease resistant to at least rifampicin – the most effective first-line TB drug. The vast majority of these people had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), that is, combined resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid (another key first-line TB medicine).WHO estimates that a quarter of the world’s population has TB infection.The TB response: Challenges and opportunities      Access to care and prevention:Underreporting and under-diagnosis of TB cases remains a major challenge. Of the 10 million people who fell ill with TB in 2017, only 6.4 million were officially recorded by national reporting systems, leaving 3.6 million people undiagnosed, or detected but not reported. Ten countries accounted for 80% of this gap, with India, Indonesia and Nigeria topping the list.Less than half of the estimated one million children with TB were reported in 2017, making it a much higher gap in detection than that in adults.Treatment coverage lags behind at 64% and must increase to at least 90% by 2025 to meet the TB targets.

In sub-Saharan Africa, 1 in 13 children died before their fifth birthday. In high-income countries, that number was 1 in 185.  <br/> <br/>“Millions of babies and children should not still be dying every year from lack of access to water, sanitation, proper nutrition or basic health services,” said Dr. Princess Nono Simelela, Assistant Director-General for Family, Women and Children’s Health at WHO. “We must prioritize providing universal access to quality health services for every child, particularly around the time of birth and through the early years, to give them the best possible chance to survive and thrive.”<br/> <br/>Most children under 5 die due to preventable or treatable causes such as complications during birth, pneumonia, diarrhea, neonatal sepsis, and malaria. By comparison, among children between 5 and 14 years of age, injuries become a more prominent cause of death, especially from drowning and road traffic. Within this age group, regional differences also exist, with the risk of dying for a child from sub-Saharan Africa 15 times higher than in Europe.<br/> <br/>“More than six million children dying before their fifteenth birthday is a cost we simply can’t afford,” said Timothy Evans, Senior Director and Head of the Health, Nutrition and Population Global Practice at the World Bank Group. “Ending preventable deaths and investing in the health of young people is a basic foundation for building countries’ human capital, which will drive their future growth and prosperity.”<br/> <br/>For children everywhere, the <g class=\"gr_ gr_42 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" data-gr-id=\"42\" id=\"42\">most risky</g> period of life is the first month. In 2017, 2.5 million newborns died in their first month. A baby born in sub-Saharan Africa or in Southern Asia was nine times more likely to die in the first month than a baby born in a high-income country. And progress towards saving newborns has been slower than for other children under 5 years of age since 1990.<br/> <br/>Even within countries, disparities persist. Under 5 mortality rates among children in rural areas are, on average, 50% higher than among children in urban areas. In addition, those born to uneducated mothers are more than twice as likely to die before turning 5 than those born to mothers with a secondary or higher education.<br/> <br/>Despite these challenges, fewer children are dying each year worldwide. The number of children dying under 5 has fallen dramatically from 12.6 million in 1990 to 5.4 million in 2017. The number of deaths in older children aged between 5 to 14 years dropped from 1.7 million to under a million in the same period.<br/> <br/>“This new report highlights the remarkable progress since 1990 in reducing mortality among children and young adolescents,” said UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Liu Zhenmin. “Reducing inequality by assisting the most vulnerable newborns, children and mothers <g class=\"gr_ gr_45 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" data-gr-id=\"45\" id=\"45\">is</g> essential for achieving the target of the Sustainable Development Goals on ending preventable <g class=\"gr_ gr_46 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling\" data-gr-id=\"46\" id=\"46\">childhood</g> deaths and for ensuring that no one is left behind.”<br/><br/><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AMZIFV567G1\">Photos, b-roll and the full report</a><strong> <br/></strong><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.unicef.org/childsurvival/files/Statistical_tables_IGME_report_2018_final.pdf\">Regional and country data</a><br/><br/><strong>About UN IGME </strong><br/>The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation or UN IGME was formed in 2004 to share data on child mortality, harmonise estimates within the United Nations system, improve methods for child mortality estimation, report on progress towards child survival goals and enhance country capacity to produce timely and properly assessed estimates of child mortality.

A baby born in sub-Saharan Africa or in Southern Asia was nine times more likely to die in the first month than a baby born in a high-income country. And progress towards saving newborns has been slower than for other children under 5 years of age since 1990. Even within countries, disparities persist. Under 5 mortality rates among children in rural areas are, on average, 50% higher than among children in urban areas. In addition, those born to uneducated mothers are more than twice as likely to die before turning 5 than those born to mothers with a secondary or higher education. Despite these challenges, fewer children are dying each year worldwide. The number of children dying under 5 has fallen dramatically from 12.6 million in 1990 to 5.4 million in 2017. The number of deaths in older children aged between 5 to 14 years dropped from 1.7 million to under a million in the same period. “This new report highlights the remarkable progress since 1990 in reducing mortality among children and young adolescents,” said UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Liu Zhenmin. “Reducing inequality by assisting the most vulnerable newborns, children and mothers is essential for achieving the target of the Sustainable Development Goals on ending preventable childhood deaths and for ensuring that no one is left behind.” Photos, b-roll and the full report Regional and country data About UN IGME The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation or UN IGME was formed in 2004 to share data on child mortality, harmonise estimates within the United Nations system, improve methods for child mortality estimation, report on progress towards child survival goals and enhance country capacity to produce timely and properly assessed estimates of child mortality. UN IGME is led by UNICEF and includes the World Health Organization, the World Bank Group and the United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

      "description": "New evidence continues to signal that the number of hungry people in the world is growing, reaching 821 million in 2017 or one in every nine people, according to The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018 released today. Limited progress is also being made in addressing the multiple forms of malnutrition, ranging from child stunting to adult obesity, putting the health of hundreds of millions of people at risk.\r\nHunger has been on the rise over the past three years, returning to levels from a decade ago. This reversal in progress sends a clear warning that more must be done and urgently if the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger is to be achieved by 2030. \r\nThe situation is worsening in South America and most regions of Africa, while the decreasing trend in undernourishment that characterized Asia seems to be slowing down significantly.\r\nThe annual UN report found that climate variability affecting rainfall patterns and agricultural seasons, and climate extremes such as droughts and floods, are among the key drivers behind the rise in hunger, together with conflict and economic slowdowns. \r\n“The alarming signs of increasing food insecurity and high levels of different forms of malnutrition are a clear warning that there is considerable work to be done to make sure we ‘leave no one behind’ on the road towards achieving the SDG goals on food security and improved nutrition,” the heads of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP) and WHO warned in their joint foreword to the report.  \r\n“If we are to achieve a world without hunger and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030, it is imperative that we accelerate and scale up actions to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of food systems and people’s livelihoods in response to climate variability and extremes,” the leaders said. \r\n \r\nThe impact of climate variability and extremes on hunger \r\nChanges in climate are already undermining production of major crops such as wheat, rice and maize in tropical and temperate regions and, without building climate resilience, this is expected to worsen as temperatures increase and become more extreme.  \r\nAnalysis in the report shows that the prevalence and number of undernourished people tend to be higher in countries highly exposed to climate extremes. Undernourishment is higher again when exposure to climate extremes is compounded by a high proportion of the population depending on agricultural systems that are highly sensitive to rainfall and temperature variability.   \r\nTemperature anomalies over agricultural cropping areas continued to be higher than the long-term mean throughout 2011–2016, leading to more frequent spells of extreme heat in the last five years. The nature of rainfall seasons is also changing, such as the late or early start of rainy seasons and the unequal distribution of rainfall within a season.  \r\nThe harm to agricultural production contributes to shortfalls in food availability, with knock-on effects causing food price hikes and income losses that reduce people’s access to food.   \r\n \r\nSlow progress on ending all forms of malnutrition  \r\nPoor progress has been made in reducing child stunting, the report says, with nearly 151 million children aged under 5 too short for their age due to malnutrition in 2017, compared to 165 million in 2012. Globally, Africa and Asia accounted for 39% and 55%  of all stunted children, respectively.\r\nPrevalence of child wasting remains extremely high in Asia where almost 1 in 10 children under five has low weight for their height, compared to just one in 100 in Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nThe report describes as “shameful” the fact that one in three women of reproductive age globally is affected by anaemia, which has significant health and development consequences for both women and their children. No region has shown a decline in anaemia among women of reproductive age, and the prevalence in Africa and Asia is nearly three times higher than in North America. \r\nRates of exclusive breastfeeding in Africa and Asia are 1.5 times higher than those in North America where only 26% of infants under 6 months receive breastmilk exclusively. \r\n \r\nThe other side of hunger: obesity on the rise \r\nAdult obesity is worsening, and more than one in eight adults in the world is obese. The problem is most significant in North America, but Africa and Asia are also experiencing an upward trend, the report shows. \r\nUndernutrition and obesity coexist in many countries, and can even be seen side by side in the same household. Poor access to nutritious food due to its higher cost, the stress of living with food insecurity, and physiological adaptations to food deprivation help explain why food-insecure families may have a higher risk of overweight and obesity. \r\n \r\nCall for action\r\nThe report calls for implementing and scaling up interventions aimed at guaranteeing access to nutritious foods and breaking the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition. Policies must pay special attention to groups who are the most vulnerable to the harmful consequences of poor food access: infants, children aged under five, school-aged children, adolescent girls, and women. \r\nAt the same time, a sustainable shift must be made towards nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food systems that can provide safe and high-quality food for all. \r\nThe report also calls for greater efforts to build climate resilience through policies that promote climate change adaptation and mitigation, and disaster risk reduction.  \r\n \r\nKey facts and figures \r\n\r\n    Number of  hungry people in the world in 2017: 821 million or 1 in every 9 people \r\n    in Asia: 515 million\r\n    in Africa: 256.5 million\r\n    in Latin America and the Caribbean: 39 million\r\n    Children under 5 affected by stunting (low height-for-age): 150.8 million (22.2%)\r\n    Children under 5 affected by wasting (low weight-for-height): 50.5 million (7.5%)\r\n    Children under 5 who are overweight (high weight-for-height): 38.3 million (5.6%)\r\n    Percentage of women of reproductive age affected by anaemia: 32.8% \r\n    Percentage of infants aged below 6 months who were exclusively breastfed: 40.7%\r\n    Adults who are obese: 672 million (13% or 1 in 8 adults).\r\n\r\n \r\nNote to editors\r\nThe heads of agencies issuing today's report are: \r\n\r\n    José Graziano da Silva, Director-General of FAO\r\n    Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD\r\n    Henrietta H. Fore, Executive Director of UNICEF\r\n    David Beasley, Executive Director of WFP and \r\n    Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. \r\n\r\nThe report is part of tracking progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 2-Zero Hunger, which aims to end hunger, promote food security and end all forms of malnutrition by 2030. The report also tracks progress on six of the seven World Health Assembly global nutrition targets.\r\n\r\nLast year’s report observed that three factors are behind the recent rise in hunger: conflict, climate and economic slowdowns, and provided an in-depth study of the role of conflict. This year’s report focuses on the role of climate variability and extremes to explain the observed trends in food security. The attribution of climate variations and extremes to climate change is beyond the",

    "content_html": "<div>\n<p>The eighteenth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director General on 15 August 2018 at WHO headquarters with members, advisers and invited Member States attending via teleconference.</p>\n<p>The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV).  The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations.  The following IHR States Parties provided an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 30 April 2018: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and Somalia. </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Wild polio</strong></h3>\n<p>Overall the Committee was encouraged by continued progress in WPV1 eradication, with the number of cases globally remaining low in 2018, but was concerned about the increase number of WPV cases in Afghanistan.  In addition, there has been no international spread of WPV1 since October 2017.  </p>\n<p>The Committee commended the continued high level commitment seen in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the significant degree of cooperation and coordination, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border.  The joint planning to cease transmission in the two recognized zones of transmission (the northern corridor which extends from Nangarhar to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, and the southern corridor from Kandahar to Quetta Block) is a key to success in achieving WPV eradication in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Region, and globally.  The committee noted that it is four years since there has been international spread outside of these two epidemiologically linked countries.</p>\n<p>The Committee commended the achievements in Pakistan that have resulted in a sustained reduction in the number of cases, with only three cases so far in 2018 from one district, and a fall in the proportion of environmental samples that have tested positive for WPV1.  However, environmental surveillance continues to detect WPV1 transmission in many high-risk areas of the country such as Karachi, Peshawar and the Quetta Block.  The drive to finish eradication in the 2018-19 polio low transmission season and the steps taken to ensure maintenance of current efforts during the political transition in Pakistan were also welcomed.</p>\n<p>The Committee was very concerned by the increase in WPV1 cases in Afghanistan in 2018, with 11 cases reported so far, compared to six at the same time last year.  The increased insecurity resulting in nearly 1 million being inaccessible in recent polio immunization campaigns was a significant part of the reason for the jump in cases, along with persisting pockets of missed children, particularly in the southern and eastern regions</p>\n<p>The Committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity, and noted that 15,606 settlements have been reached at least once by vaccination teams as at May 2018, with 3218 remaining unreached.  Furthermore, use of community monitors from inaccessible settlements has expanded surveillance reach and resulted in the notification of AFP cases from Abadam and Marte that were silent for the last two years (before 2018).  It is now two years since the last WPV1 was detected in Nigeria, and four years since there has been any international spread. </p>\n<p>There is ongoing concern about the districts of the neighboring countries of the Lake Chad basin region that have been affected by the Boko Haram insurgency, with the consequent lack of services and presence of IDPs and refugees. The risk of international spread from Nigeria to the Lake Chad basin countries or further afield in sub-Saharan Africa remains substantial. The Committee was encouraged that the Lake Chad basin countries, Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), Niger and Nigeria continued to be committed to sub-regional coordination of immunization and surveillance activities.  However, there are widespread persistent gaps in population immunity across these countries, and the ongoing population movement in the sub-region and insecurity are major challenges.                 </p>\n<h3><strong>Vaccine derived poliovirus</strong></h3>\n<p>The committee was very concerned by the increase in circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV).  Since the last meeting, new emergences with circulation of VDPV have been detected in Papua New Guinea, DR Congo (Mongala) and Nigeria (Sokoto).  In Nigeria and DR Congo multiple lineages of cVDPV2 are circulating concurrently, and in Somalia, both cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 are circulating.  </p>\n<p>Control of the outbreaks in DR Congo remains difficult to achieve.  Gene sequencing and analysis has shown that there have been three different cVDPV2 sub-types circulating.  The analysis of the newly detected cVDPV2 in Mongala Province indicates the virus has emerged after OPV2 withdrawal in 2016.  Conflict and population movement within and outside DR Congo represent a risk of further spread.  The detection of cVDPV2 in Ituri Province far from previously detected cases and adjacent to the border with Uganda heightened these concerns and is an example that the virus can spread long distances.  The outbreaks of Ebola virus disease further complicates the response.</p>\n<p>The new outbreak of cVDPV1 in PNG highlights that there are vulnerable areas of the world not usually the focus of eradication efforts.  The swift action of the Government of PNG in declaring a national public health emergency was welcomed, and highlights the utility of the Temporary Recommendations in such circumstances.</p>\n<p>The outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Somalia and Kenya, and cVDPV3 in Somalia are of major concern, particularly the apparent international spread between Somalia and Kenya.  </p>\n<p>The outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Jigawa, and for the second time in Sokoto, Nigeria, again underlines the vulnerability of northern Nigeria to poliovirus transmission.  Routine immunization coverage remains very poor in many areas of the country, although the national emergency programme to strengthen routine immunisation is beginning to make an impact in some areas.</p>\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although the risk of international spread of WPV has greatly diminished since the PHEIC was declared in 2014, should international spread now occur, the impact on progress towards WPV eradication would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and prolonging requirements for dedicated human and financial resources in support of the eradication effort. </li>\n<li>There is a risk of growing global complacency as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and removal of the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency.The apparent reversal in progress in Afghanistan heightens concerns.</li>\n<li>Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation. Gaps in population immunity in several key high-risk areas is evidenced by the current number of cVDPV outbreaks of all serotypes, which only emerge and circulate when polio population immunity is low as a result of deficient routine immunization programmes. </li>\n<li>The new international outbreak of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, with a highly diverged cVDPV2 that appears to have circulated undetected for up to four years, highlights that there are still high-risk populations in South and Central zones of Somalia where population immunity and surveillance are compromised by conflict.</li>\n<li>Inaccessibility to vaccination programs remains another major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.</li>\n<li>The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks, particularly between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Nigeria and its Lake Chad neighbors, and countries in and bordering the Horn of Africa and DR Congo.</li>\n<li>The inaccessible population in Borno state in Nigeria remains substantial despite the commendable efforts to reach all settlements.Some of these populations have not received polio vaccine since WPV1 was detected in 2016, so ongoing transmission in these unreached pockets cannot be ruled out. The risk of transmission in the Lake Chad sub-region appears considerable, with significant gaps in population immunity in these vulnerable countries, compounded by international population movement.</li>\n<li>The difficulty in controlling spread of cVDPV2 in DR Congo demonstrates significant gaps in population immunity at a critical time in the polio endgame;the lack of IPV vaccination in several countries neighboring DR Congo heightens the risk of international spread, as population immunity is rapidly waning.</li>\n<li>The increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses another risk. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.

          "Overall the Committee was encouraged by continued progress in WPV1 eradication, with the number of cases globally remaining low in 2018, but was concerned about the increase number of WPV cases in Afghanistan.  In addition, there has been no international spread of WPV1 since October 2017.",
          "The Committee commended the continued high level commitment seen in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the significant degree of cooperation and coordination, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border.  The joint planning to cease transmission in the two recognized zones of transmission (the northern corridor which extends from Nangarhar to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, and the southern corridor from Kandahar to Quetta Block) is a key to success in achieving WPV eradication in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Region, and globally.  The committee noted that it is four years since there has been international spread outside of these two epidemiologically linked countries.",
          "The Committee commended the achievements in Pakistan that have resulted in a sustained reduction in the number of cases, with only three cases so far in 2018 from one district, and a fall in the proportion of environmental samples that have tested positive for WPV1.  However, environmental surveillance continues to detect WPV1 transmission in many high-risk areas of the country such as Karachi, Peshawar and the Quetta Block.  The drive to finish eradication in the 2018-19 polio low transmission season and the steps taken to ensure maintenance of current efforts during the political transition in Pakistan were also welcomed.",
          "The Committee was very concerned by the increase in WPV1 cases in Afghanistan in 2018, with 11 cases reported so far, compared to six at the same time last year.  The increased insecurity resulting in nearly 1 million being inaccessible in recent polio immunization campaigns was a significant part of the reason for the jump in cases, along with persisting pockets of missed children, particularly in the southern and eastern regions",
          "The Committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity, and noted that 15,606 settlements have been reached at least once by vaccination teams as at May 2018, with 3218 remaining unreached.  Furthermore, use of community monitors from inaccessible settlements has expanded surveillance reach and resulted in the notification of AFP cases from Abadam and Marte that were silent for the last two years (before 2018).  It is now two years since the last WPV1 was detected in Nigeria, and four years since there has been any international spread.",
          "There is ongoing concern about the districts of the neighboring countries of the Lake Chad basin region that have been affected by the Boko Haram insurgency, with the consequent lack of services and presence of IDPs and refugees. The risk of international spread from Nigeria to the Lake Chad basin countries or further afield in sub-Saharan Africa remains substantial. The Committee was encouraged that the Lake Chad basin countries, Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), Niger and Nigeria continued to be committed to sub-regional coordination of immunization and surveillance activities.  However, there are widespread persistent gaps in population immunity across these countries, and the ongoing population movement in the sub-region and insecurity are major challenges."

          "The committee was very concerned by the increase in circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV).  Since the last meeting, new emergences with circulation of VDPV have been detected in Papua New Guinea, DR Congo (Mongala) and Nigeria (Sokoto).  In Nigeria and DR Congo multiple lineages of cVDPV2 are circulating concurrently, and in Somalia, both cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 are circulating.",
          "Control of the outbreaks in DR Congo remains difficult to achieve.  Gene sequencing and analysis has shown that there have been three different cVDPV2 sub-types circulating.  The analysis of the newly detected cVDPV2 in Mongala Province indicates the virus has emerged after OPV2 withdrawal in 2016.  Conflict and population movement within and outside DR Congo represent a risk of further spread.  The detection of cVDPV2 in Ituri Province far from previously detected cases and adjacent to the border with Uganda heightened these concerns and is an example that the virus can spread long distances.  The outbreaks of Ebola virus disease further complicates the response.",
          "The new outbreak of cVDPV1 in PNG highlights that there are vulnerable areas of the world not usually the focus of eradication efforts.  The swift action of the Government of PNG in declaring a national public health emergency was welcomed, and highlights the utility of the Temporary Recommendations in such circumstances.",
          "The outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Somalia and Kenya, and cVDPV3 in Somalia are of major concern, particularly the apparent international spread between Somalia and Kenya.",
          "The outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Jigawa, and for the second time in Sokoto, Nigeria, again underlines the vulnerability of northern Nigeria to poliovirus transmission.  Routine immunization coverage remains very poor in many areas of the country, although the national emergency programme to strengthen routine immunisation is beginning to make an impact in some areas."

          "The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:"
        ],
        "bullets": [
          "Although the risk of international spread of WPV has greatly diminished since the PHEIC was declared in 2014, should international spread now occur, the impact on progress towards WPV eradication would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and prolonging requirements for dedicated human and financial resources in support of the eradication effort.",
          "There is a risk of growing global complacency as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and removal of the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency.The apparent reversal in progress in Afghanistan heightens concerns.",
          "Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation. Gaps in population immunity in several key high-risk areas is evidenced by the current number of cVDPV outbreaks of all serotypes, which only emerge and circulate when polio population immunity is low as a result of deficient routine immunization programmes.",
          "The new international outbreak of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, with a highly diverged cVDPV2 that appears to have circulated undetected for up to four years, highlights that there are still high-risk populations in South and Central zones of Somalia where population immunity and surveillance are compromised by conflict.",
          "Inaccessibility to vaccination programs remains another major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.",
          "The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks, particularly between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Nigeria and its Lake Chad neighbors, and countries in and bordering the Horn of Africa and DR Congo.",
          "The inaccessible population in Borno state in Nigeria remains substantial despite the commendable efforts to reach all settlements.Some of these populations have not received polio vaccine since WPV1 was detected in 2016, so ongoing transmission in these unreached pockets cannot be ruled out. The risk of transmission in the Lake Chad sub-region appears considerable, with significant gaps in population immunity in these vulnerable countries, compounded by international population movement.",
          "The difficulty in controlling spread of cVDPV2 in DR Congo demonstrates significant gaps in population immunity at a critical time in the polio endgame;the lack of IPV vaccination in several countries neighboring DR Congo heightens the risk of international spread, as population immunity is rapidly waning.",
          "The increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses another risk. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. Outbreaks in fragile states are exceedingly difficult to control and threaten the completion of global polio eradication during its end stage.",
          "A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders."

      "Although the risk of international spread of WPV has greatly diminished since the PHEIC was declared in 2014, should international spread now occur, the impact on progress towards WPV eradication would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and prolonging requirements for dedicated human and financial resources in support of the eradication effort.",
      "There is a risk of growing global complacency as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and removal of the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency.The apparent reversal in progress in Afghanistan heightens concerns.",
      "Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation. Gaps in population immunity in several key high-risk areas is evidenced by the current number of cVDPV outbreaks of all serotypes, which only emerge and circulate when polio population immunity is low as a result of deficient routine immunization programmes.",
      "The new international outbreak of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, with a highly diverged cVDPV2 that appears to have circulated undetected for up to four years, highlights that there are still high-risk populations in South and Central zones of Somalia where population immunity and surveillance are compromised by conflict.",
      "Inaccessibility to vaccination programs remains another major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.",
      "The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks, particularly between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Nigeria and its Lake Chad neighbors, and countries in and bordering the Horn of Africa and DR Congo.",
      "The inaccessible population in Borno state in Nigeria remains substantial despite the commendable efforts to reach all settlements.Some of these populations have not received polio vaccine since WPV1 was detected in 2016, so ongoing transmission in these unreached pockets cannot be ruled out. The risk of transmission in the Lake Chad sub-region appears considerable, with significant gaps in population immunity in these vulnerable countries, compounded by international population movement.",
      "The difficulty in controlling spread of cVDPV2 in DR Congo demonstrates significant gaps in population immunity at a critical time in the polio endgame;the lack of IPV vaccination in several countries neighboring DR Congo heightens the risk of international spread, as population immunity is rapidly waning.",
      "The increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses another risk. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. Outbreaks in fragile states are exceedingly difficult to control and threaten the completion of global polio eradication during its end stage.",
      "A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.",

      "Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period",
      "These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (e.g. Borno)",
      "Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.",
      "Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. > four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.",
      "Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers.",
      "Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.",
      "Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea).",
      "Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.",
      "Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication.",
      "Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected.",

      "Encourage residents and long­term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel; those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) congratulates the country and all those involved in ending the outbreak, while urging them to extend this success to combatting other diseases in DRC.</p>\n<p>WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, joined Minister of Health Dr Oly Ilunga for the announcement in Kinshasa.</p>\n<p>“The outbreak was contained due to the tireless efforts of local teams, the support of partners, the generosity of donors, and the effective leadership of the Ministry of Health. That kind of leadership, allied with strong collaboration between partners, saves lives,” said Dr Tedros.</p>\n<p>Unlike previous Ebola outbreaks in the country, this one involved four separate locations, including an urban centre with river connections to the capital and to neighbouring countries, as well as remote rainforest villages. There were initial concerns that the disease could spread to other parts of DRC, and to neighbouring countries.</p>\n<p>Within hours of the outbreak being declared on 8 May, WHO released US$2 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies, deployed a team to augment capacity in the field, and activated an emergency incident management system.</p>\n<p>“WHO moved quickly and efficiently,” said Dr Moeti, “We also demonstrated the tremendous capacity of the African region. More than three-quarters of the 360 people deployed to respond came from within the region. Dozens of experts from Guinea spent weeks leading Ebola vaccination efforts here, transferring expertise which will enable the DRC to mount an effective response both within its borders and beyond.”</p>\n<p>Dr Tedros urged the DRC Government and the international community to build on the positive momentum generated by the quick containment of the Ebola outbreak.</p>\n<p>“This effective response to Ebola should make the Government and partners confident that other major outbreaks affecting the country such as cholera and polio can also be tackled,” said Dr Tedros. “We must continue to work together, investing in strengthened preparedness and access to healthcare for the most vulnerable.”</p>\n<h2>Note to editors</h2>\n<h3>Funding</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WHO’s rapid response and scale up of operations in the DRC was funded by a total of US$4 million disbursement from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE).</li>\n<li>WHO and partners appealed for US$57 million to stop the spread of Ebola.

      "description": "Today marks the end of the ninth outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The World Health Organization (WHO) congratulates the country and all those involved in ending the outbreak, while urging them to extend this success to combatting other diseases in DRC.\r\nWHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, joined Minister of Health Dr Oly Ilunga for the announcement in Kinshasa.\r\n“The outbreak was contained due to the tireless efforts of local teams, the support of partners, the generosity of donors, and the effective leadership of the Ministry of Health. That kind of leadership, allied with strong collaboration between partners, saves lives,” said Dr Tedros.\r\nUnlike previous Ebola outbreaks in the country, this one involved four separate locations, including an urban centre with river connections to the capital and to neighbouring countries, as well as remote rainforest villages. There were initial concerns that the disease could spread to other parts of DRC, and to neighbouring countries.\r\nWithin hours of the outbreak being declared on 8 May, WHO released US$2 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies, deployed a team to augment capacity in the field, and activated an emergency incident management system.\r\n“WHO moved quickly and efficiently,” said Dr Moeti, “We also demonstrated the tremendous capacity of the African region. More than three-quarters of the 360 people deployed to respond came from within the region. Dozens of experts from Guinea spent weeks leading Ebola vaccination efforts here, transferring expertise which will enable the DRC to mount an effective response both within its borders and beyond.”\r\nDr Tedros urged the DRC Government and the international community to build on the positive momentum generated by the quick containment of the Ebola outbreak.\r\n“This effective response to Ebola should make the Government and partners confident that other major outbreaks affecting the country such as cholera and polio can also be tackled,” said Dr Tedros. “We must continue to work together, investing in strengthened preparedness and access to healthcare for the most vulnerable.”\r\nNote to editors\r\nFunding\r\n\r\n    WHO’s rapid response and scale up of operations in the DRC was funded by a total of US$4 million disbursement from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE).\r\n    WHO and partners appealed for US$57 million to stop the spread of Ebola. The total funds received by all partners, as tracked by OCHA, amount to US$63 million. \r\n    Funding towards WHO’s contribution to the Ebola response was provided from: Italy (€ 300 000), UN CERF (US$ 800 000), Gavi (US$ 1 million), USAID (US$ 5.3 million), Wellcome Trust and UK-DFID (US$ 4.1 million), UK-DFID (£5 million), Germany (€5 million), Norway (NOK 8 million), Canada (CAD$1 million), World Bank PEF (US$ 6.8 million), Japan (US$1.3 million), EU ECHO (€ 1.5 million) and from the Ebola MPTF (US$ 428,000) bringing the total to approximately US$ 36 million. \r\n    Germany’s contribution is in recognition of the critical role the WHO CFE has played in responding to the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and will go to replenish the CFE, which provided initial funds for the response efforts.\r\n    In-kind contributions for medical evacuation were received from Norway.

    "lead": "Countries are making significant steps in tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR), but  serious gaps remain and require  urgent action, according to a report released today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health Organization (WHO).The report charts progress in 154 countries and reveals  wide discrepancies.  Some, including many European countries, have been working on  AMR policies in human and animal sectors for more than 4 decades. Others have only recently started to take action to contain this growing threat. Progress in developing and implementing plans is greater in high-income than low-income countries but all countries have scope for improvement. No country  reports sustained capacity at scale in all areas.The report looks at surveillance, education, monitoring and regulating consumption and use of antimicrobials in human health, animal health and production, as well as plants and the environment – as recommended in the Global Action Plan published in 2015.Promising findings include 105 countries with a surveillance system in place for reporting drug-resistant infections in human health and 68 countries with a system for tracking consumption of antimicrobials.  In addition, 123 countries reported that they have policies to regulate the sale of antimicrobials, including the requirement of a prescription for human use – a key measure to tackle overuse and misuse of antimicrobials.But implementation of these policies varies  and unregulated medicines are still available in places such as street markets, with no limits on how they are used. Medicines are very often sold over the counter and no prescription is requested. This puts human and animal health at risk, potentially contributing to the development of antimicrobial resistance.The report highlights areas,  particularly in the animal and food sectors, where there is an urgent need for more investment and action. For example, only 64 countries report that they follow FAO-OIE-WHO recommendations to limit the use of critically important antimicrobials for growth promotion in animal production. Of these, 39 are high-income countries, with the majority in WHO’s European Region. By contrast, only 3 countries from WHO’s African Region and 7 countries from the WHO Region of the Americas have taken this important step to reduce the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.A total of 67 countries report at least having legislation in place to control all aspects of production, licensing and distribution of antimicrobials for use in animals. But 56 either said that they had  no national policy or legislation regarding the quality, safety and efficacy of antimicrobial products used in animal and plant health, and their distribution, sale or use, or that they were unable to report whether they have these policies in place.There is also a substantial lack of action and data in  the environment and plant sectors. Although 78 countries have regulations in place to prevent environmental contamination generally, only 10 of them report having comprehensive systems to ensure regulatory compliance for all waste management, including regulations that limit the discharge of antimicrobial residues into the environment. This is insufficient to protect the environment from the hazards of antimicrobial production.“This report shows growing global momentum to combat antimicrobial resistance,” says Dr Ranieri Guerra, Assistant Director-General for Antimicrobial Resistance at WHO. “We call on governments to make sustained commitments across all sectors  –  human and animal health, plant health and the environment – otherwise we risk losing the use of these precious medicines.”“Supporting low- and middle-income countries to follow guidance of responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials in animals is an urgent priority,” says Dr Matthew Stone, Deputy Director General of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).  “Implementation of dedicated OIE international standards, appropriate national legislation and strengthening of veterinary services are essential steps to help all animal health stakeholders contribute to controlling the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance.”“FAO welcomes that many countries are taking concrete steps towards the responsible use of antimicrobials in agriculture,” says Maria Helena Semedo, FAO Deputy Director-General. “However, countries need to do more to reduce the unregulated and excessive use of antimicrobials in agriculture.  We particularly urge countries to phase out the use of antimicrobials for growth promotion in animal production – terrestrial and aquatic.”From this survey and other sources, the Tripartite (FAO, OIE and WHO) is aware that 100 countries now have national action plans for AMR in place and a further 51 countries have plans under development, but more needs to be done to ensure that they are implemented. Only 53 countries report that they have a multisectoral working group that is fully functional, although a further 77 have established such a group. Only 10 countries report that the funding for all actions in the plan is identified and many middle- and low-income countries may need long-term development assistance to implement their plans effectively and sustainably. Positively, among the top ten chicken-, pork- and cattle-producing countries that responded to the AMR survey, 9 out of 10 have at minimum developed a national action plan; the majority of these have plans in operation with a monitoring arrangement.About the survey",

Promising findings include 105 countries with a surveillance system in place for reporting drug-resistant infections in human health and 68 countries with a system for tracking consumption of antimicrobials.  In addition, 123 countries reported that they have policies to regulate the sale of antimicrobials, including the requirement of a prescription for human use – a key measure to tackle overuse and misuse of antimicrobials. But implementation of these policies varies  and unregulated medicines are still available in places such as street markets, with no limits on how they are used. Medicines are very often sold over the counter and no prescription is requested. This puts human and animal health at risk, potentially contributing to the development of antimicrobial resistance. The report highlights areas,  particularly in the animal and food sectors, where there is an urgent need for more investment and action. For example, only 64 countries report that they follow FAO-OIE-WHO recommendations to limit the use of critically important antimicrobials for growth promotion in animal production. Of these, 39 are high-income countries, with the majority in WHO’s European Region. By contrast, only 3 countries from WHO’s African Region and 7 countries from the WHO Region of the Americas have taken this important step to reduce the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. A total of 67 countries report at least having legislation in place to control all aspects of production, licensing and distribution of antimicrobials for use in animals. But 56 either said that they had  no national policy or legislation regarding the quality, safety and efficacy of antimicrobial products used in animal and plant health, and their distribution, sale or use, or that they were unable to report whether they have these policies in place. There is also a substantial lack of action and data in  the environment and plant sectors. Although 78 countries have regulations in place to prevent environmental contamination generally, only 10 of them report having comprehensive systems to ensure regulatory compliance for all waste management, including regulations that limit the discharge of antimicrobial residues into the environment. This is insufficient to protect the environment from the hazards of antimicrobial production. “This report shows growing global momentum to combat antimicrobial resistance,” says Dr Ranieri Guerra, Assistant Director-General for Antimicrobial Resistance at WHO. “We call on governments to make sustained commitments across all sectors  –  human and animal health, plant health and the environment – otherwise we risk losing the use of these precious medicines.” “Supporting low- and middle-income countries to follow guidance of responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials in animals is an urgent priority,” says Dr Matthew Stone, Deputy Director General of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).  “Implementation of dedicated OIE international standards, appropriate national legislation and strengthening of veterinary services are essential steps to help all animal health stakeholders contribute to controlling the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance.” “FAO welcomes that many countries are taking concrete steps towards the responsible use of antimicrobials in agriculture,” says Maria Helena Semedo, FAO Deputy Director-General. “However, countries need to do more to reduce the unregulated and excessive use of antimicrobials in agriculture.  We particularly urge countries to phase out the use of antimicrobials for growth promotion in animal production – terrestrial and aquatic.” From this survey and other sources, the Tripartite (FAO, OIE and WHO) is aware that 100 countries now have national action plans for AMR in place and a further 51 countries have plans under development, but more needs to be done to ensure that they are implemented. Only 53 countries report that they have a multisectoral working group that is fully functional, although a further 77 have established such a group. Only 10 countries report that the funding for all actions in the plan is identified and many middle- and low-income countries may need long-term development assistance to implement their plans effectively and sustainably. Positively, among the top ten chicken-, pork- and cattle-producing countries that responded to the AMR survey, 9 out of 10 have at minimum developed a national action plan; the majority of these have plans in operation with a monitoring arrangement.

      "description": "Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance - message from WHO Director-GeneralCountries are making significant steps in tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR), but  serious gaps remain and require  urgent action, according to a report released today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health Organization (WHO).The report charts progress in 154 countries and reveals  wide discrepancies.  Some, including many European countries, have been working on  AMR policies in human and animal sectors for more than 4 decades. Others have only recently started to take action to contain this growing threat. Progress in developing and implementing plans is greater in high-income than low-income countries but all countries have scope for improvement. No country  reports sustained capacity at scale in all areas.The report looks at surveillance, education, monitoring and regulating consumption and use of antimicrobials in human health, animal health and production, as well as plants and the environment – as recommended in the Global Action Plan published in 2015.Promising findings include 105 countries with a surveillance system in place for reporting drug-resistant infections in human health and 68 countries with a system for tracking consumption of antimicrobials.  In addition, 123 countries reported that they have policies to regulate the sale of antimicrobials, including the requirement of a prescription for human use – a key measure to tackle overuse and misuse of antimicrobials.

All countries’ responses from both years are published in an  open-access database, offering scope for in-country review with civil society and other stakeholders.For more information:Link to database and report:  https://www.who.int/activities/monitoring-progress-antimicrobial-resistance",

Oxytocin, however, must be stored and transported at 2–8 degrees Celsius, which is hard to do, in many countries, depriving many women of access to this lifesaving drug. When they can obtain it, the drug may be less effective because of heat exposure.</p></div><div>The study, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, has shown an alternative drug – heat-stable carbetocin – to be as safe and effective as oxytocin in preventing postpartum haemorrhage. This new formulation of carbetocin does not require refrigeration and retains its efficacy for at least 3 years stored at 30 degrees celsius and 75% relative humidity. <font size=\"-1\"><br/></font></div><ul><li><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1805489\">View study</a></li></ul></div><div><div>“This is a truly encouraging new development that can revolutionize our ability to keep mothers and babies alive,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.<br/><br/>Approximately 70 000 women die every year because of post-partum haemorrhage – increasing the risk that their babies also die within one month.<br/><br/>The clinical trial, the largest of its kind, studied close to 30 000 women who gave birth vaginally in 10 countries: Argentina, Egypt, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda and the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>Each woman was randomly given a single injection of either heat-stable carbetocin or oxytocin immediately following the birth of her baby. The study found that both drugs were equally effective at preventing excessive bleeding after birth.<br/><br/>Since both drugs in the study were kept in at the temperatures required to ensure maximum efficacy of oxytocin, the trial may underestimate the benefit expected with heat-stable carbetocin use in real-life settings where oxytocin may have degraded due to exposure to higher temperatures.<br/><br/>“The development of a drug to prevent postpartum haemorrhage that continues to remain effective in hot and humid conditions is very good news for the millions of women who give birth in parts of the world without access to reliable refrigeration,” says Dr Metin Gülmezoglu, from the Department of Reproductive Health and Research at WHO.<br/><br/>The next step is regulatory review and approval by countries.<br/><br/>WHO will ask its Guideline Development Group to consider whether heat-stable carbetocin should be a recommended drug for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage. <br/><br/><b>About the study</b></div></div><div><font size=\"-1\"><br/></font></div><div>This WHO study, also referred to as the CHAMPION (<b>C</b>arbetocin <b>HA</b>e<b>M</b>orrhage <b>P</b>revent<b>ION</b>) trial, was funded by MSD for Mothers.

    "content_html": "18 June 2018 ¦ Geneva: The World Health Organization (WHO) is today releasing its new International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).<br/> <br/>The ICD is the foundation for identifying health trends and statistics worldwide, and contains around 55 000 unique codes for injuries, diseases and causes of death. It provides a common language that allows health professionals to share health information across the globe.<br/> <br/>“The ICD is a product that WHO is truly proud of,\" says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “It enables us to understand so much about what makes people get sick and die, and to take action to prevent suffering and save lives.\"<br/>ICD-11, which has been over a decade in the making, provides significant improvements on previous versions. For the first time, it is completely electronic and has a much more user-friendly format. And there has been unprecedented involvement of health care workers who have joined collaborative meetings and submitted proposals. The ICD team in WHO headquarters has received over 10 000 proposals for revisions.<br/> <br/>ICD-11 will be presented at the World Health Assembly in May 2019 for adoption by Member States, and will come into effect on 1 January 2022. This release is an advance preview that will allow countries to plan how to use the new version, prepare translations, and train health professionals all over the country.<br/> <br/>The ICD is also used by health insurers whose reimbursements depend on ICD coding; national health programme managers; data collection specialists; and others who track progress in global health and determine the allocation of health resources.<br/>The new ICD-11 also reflects progress in medicine and advances in scientific understanding. For example, the codes relating to antimicrobial resistance are more closely in line with the Global<br/><br clear=\"all\"/>Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS). ICD-11 is also able to better capture data regarding safety in healthcare, which means that unnecessary events that may harm health – such as unsafe workflows in hospitals - can be identified and reduced.<br/> <br/>The new ICD also includes new chapters, one on traditional medicine: although millions of people use traditional medicine worldwide, it has never been classified in this system. Another new chapter on sexual health brings together conditions that were previously categorized in other ways (e.g. gender incongruence was listed under mental health conditions) or described differently. Gaming disorder has been added to the section on addictive disorders.<br/> <br/>“A key principle in this revision was to simplify the coding structure and electronic tooling – this will allow health care professionals to more easily and completely record conditions,” says Dr Robert Jakob, Team Leader, Classifications Terminologies and Standards, WHO.<br/> <br/>Dr Lubna Alansari, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Metrics and Measurement, says: “ICD is a cornerstone of health information and ICD-11 will deliver an up-to-date view of the patterns of disease.”<br/> <br/><b>Editors’ note:</b><br/>ICD-11 is linked to the WHO non-proprietary names of pharmaceutical products, and it can be used for cancer registration. ICD-11 has been designed to be used in multiple languages: a central translation platform ensures that its features and outputs are available in all translated languages. Transition tables from and to ICD-10 support migration to ICD-11. WHO will support countries as they move towards implementation of the new ICD-11.<br/><br/><br/><br/>",

Through the “E-2020 initiative,” WHO is supporting these countries as they scale up activities to become malaria-free. Other E-2020 countries in the Americas include Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico and Suriname.   </p><p>“I take pride in saying that PAHO has accompanied Paraguay in the crusade of malaria elimination since the beginning,” said Dr Carissa F Etienne, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), WHO regional office for the Americas. “This is a powerful reminder for the region of what can be achieved when countries are focused on an important goal, and remain vigilant after achieving that goal. We are hopeful that other countries will soon join Paraguay in eliminating malaria”.  <br/></p><h3>Achieving malaria-free status in Paraguay <br/></h3><p>From 1950 to 2011, Paraguay systematically developed policies and programmes to control and eliminate malaria, a significant public health challenge for a country that reported more than 80 000 cases of the disease in the 1940s. As a result, Paraguay registered its last case of <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> malaria in 1995, and <em>P. vivax</em> malaria in 2011.</p><p>A five-year plan to consolidate the gains, prevent re-establishment of transmission and prepare for elimination certification was launched in 2011. Activities focused on robust case management, engagement with communities, and education to make people more aware of ways to prevent malaria transmission, and about diagnosis and treatment options. </p><p>“Receiving this certification is a recognition of more than five decades of hard work in Paraguay, both on the part of public sector workers, as well as the community itself, who have collaborated time and time again in order to achieve the elimination of malaria,” said Dr Carlos Ignacio Morínigo, Minister of Health of Paraguay. “Reaching this goal also implies that we must now face the challenge of maintaining it. Therefore, Paraguay has put in place a solid surveillance and response system in order to prevent the re-establishment of malaria.” <br/></p><p>In 2016, in the next phase of the elimination drive, the Ministry of Health launched a 3-year initiative to build Paraguay’s front-line health workers’ skills. Backed by The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the country strengthened its capacity to prevent disease, identify suspected malaria cases, accurately diagnose malaria and provide prompt treatment – key strategies to tackle the on-going threat of malaria importation from endemic countries elsewhere in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa. <br/></p><p>“Paraguay’s success demonstrates the importance of investing in robust, sustainable systems for health, and I’m very pleased that the Global Fund supported this achievement,” said Peter Sands, Executive Director of the Global Fund. “We need to remain vigilant and prevent resurgence, but we also need to celebrate this victory.”<br/></p><p>In April 2018, the independent Malaria Elimination Certification Panel  concluded that Paraguay had interrupted indigenous malaria transmission for the requisite 3 years and had the capacity to prevent the re-establishment of transmission. The Panel recommended the WHO Director-General certify the country malaria-free. <br/></p><p>They highlighted factors such as the quality and coverage of health services, including malaria awareness among front-line health workers, the universal availability of free medical treatment, and a strong malaria surveillance system. <br/></p><p>Between 1960 and 1973, seven countries and territories from the Americas were certified malaria-free: Cuba, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago, and the northern part of Venezuela. In the Region of the Americas, malaria cases declined by 62%, and malaria-related deaths decreased by 61% between 2000 and 2015. However, the rise of malaria cases reported in several countries in 2016 and 2017 show that major challenges remain, including the diagnosis, treatment, and investigation of malaria cases, particularly in remote areas.  <br/></p><h3>Further information on malaria elimination progress <br/></h3><p>The official certification announcement will be made today at the Second annual global forum of malaria-eliminating countries, convened by WHO in San José, Costa Rica from 11-13 June. <br/></p><p>WHO is also releasing a progress update on elimination efforts in E-2020 countries, providing – for the first time – preliminary malaria case numbers for 2017. Ten more countries are on track to eliminate malaria by 2020.

However, eight other E-2020 countries saw increases in indigenous malaria cases in 2017, reflecting the global malaria trends reported in the latest WHO World malaria report. WHO is publishing country briefs for the 21 eliminating countries, offering an overview of progress, key malaria data and an assessment of what is needed to reach the 2020 elimination target."

But evidence reveals  a serious  lack of knowledge of the multiple health risks associated with tobacco.</p>\n<p>\"Most people know that using tobacco causes cancer and lung disease, but many people aren’t aware that tobacco also causes heart disease and stroke – the world’s leading killers,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"This World No Tobacco Day, WHO is drawing attention to the fact that tobacco doesn’t just cause cancer, it quite literally breaks hearts.\"</p>\n<p> While many people are aware tobacco use increases the risk of cancer, there are alarming gaps in knowledge of the cardiovascular risks of tobacco use. In many countries, this low awareness is substantial; for example in China, over 60% of the population is unaware smoking can cause heart attacks, according to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey.

      "description": "Tobacco use has declined markedly since 2000, according to a new WHO report, but the reduction is insufficient to meet globally agreed targets aimed at protecting people from death and suffering from cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs).\r\nFor  World No Tobacco Day 2018, WHO has joined with the World Heart Federation to highlight  the link between tobacco and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) -  the world’s leading causes of death, responsible for 44% of all NCD deaths, or 17.9 million deaths annually.\r\nTobacco use and second-hand smoke exposure are major causes of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and stroke, contributing to approximately 3 million deaths per year. But evidence reveals  a serious  lack of knowledge of the multiple health risks associated with tobacco.\r\n\"Most people know that using tobacco causes cancer and lung disease, but many people aren’t aware that tobacco also causes heart disease and stroke – the world’s leading killers,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"This World No Tobacco Day, WHO is drawing attention to the fact that tobacco doesn’t just cause cancer, it quite literally breaks hearts.\"\r\n While many people are aware tobacco use increases the risk of cancer, there are alarming gaps in knowledge of the cardiovascular risks of tobacco use. In many countries, this low awareness is substantial; for example in China, over 60% of the population is unaware smoking can cause heart attacks, according to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey. In India and Indonesia, more than half of adults do not know smoking can cause stroke.\r\n\"Governments have the power in their hands to protect their citizens from suffering needlessly from heart disease,\" says Dr Douglas Bettcher, WHO Director for the Prevention of NCDs. \"Measures that reduce the risks to heart health posed by tobacco include making all indoor public and workplaces completely smoke-free and promoting use of tobacco package warnings that demonstrate the health risks of tobacco.\" \r\nWorld off track to meet tobacco reduction target\r\nTobacco kills over 7 million people each year, despite the steady reduction in tobacco use globally, as shown in WHO’s new  Global Report on Trends in Prevalence of Tobacco Smoking 2000-2025.

It is crucial that poliovirus materials are appropriately contained under strict biosafety and biosecurity handling and storage conditions to ensure that the virus is not released into the environment, either accidentally or intentionally, to again cause outbreaks of the disease in susceptible populations. Member States expressed overwhelming commitment to fully implement and finance all strategies to secure a lasting polio-free world in the very near term.  Rotary International, speaking on behalf of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (which consists of WHO, Rotary, CDC, UNICEF and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) offered an impassioned plea to the global community to eradicate a human disease for only the second time in history, and ensure that no child will ever again be paralysed by any form of poliovirus anywhere. Closing remarksIn his final speech to this year's Assembly, Dr Tedros said that everywhere he went, he had the same message: health as a bridge to peace. \"Health has the power to transform an individual's life, but it also has the power to transform families, communities and nations,\" he told delegates. The Organization's new 5-year strategic plan, he said, called on WHO to measure its success not by its outputs, but by outcomes - by the measurable impact it delivers where it matters most - in countries.\"Ultimately, the people we serve are not the people with power; they're the people with no power,\" the Director-General said. He told delegates the true test of whether the discussions held in the Assembly this week were successful would be whether they resulted in real change on the ground and he urged them to go back to their countries with renewed determination to work every day for the health of their people.\"The commitment I have witnessed this week gives me great hope and confidence that together we can promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable,\" he concluded.Find out more about the Seventy-first World Health Assembly",

The resolution urges Member States to prioritize the development and greater use of digital technologies in health as a means of promoting Universal Health Coverage and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>It requests that WHO develop a global strategy on digital health and supports the scale-up of these technologies in countries by providing technical assistance and normative guidance, monitoring trends and promoting best practices to improve access to health services. </p><p>The resolution also asks Member States to identify priority areas in which they would benefit from WHO assistance, such as implementation, evaluation and scale up of digital health services and applications, data security, ethical and legal issues. Examples of existing digital health technologies include systems that track disease outbreaks by using \"crowdsourcing\" or community reporting; and mobile phone text messages for positive behaviour change for prevention and management of diseases like diabetes. </p><h2>Snakebite</h2><p>Delegates agreed a resolution that aims to reduce the number of people around the world who are either killed or are physically or mentally disabled by snakebite. An estimated 1.8 - 2.7 million people are bitten by venomous snakes each year, with between 81 000 and 138 000 people dying as a result. For every person who dies following a snakebite, another four or five are left with disabilities such as blindness, restricted mobility or amputation, and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>Snakebite overwhelmingly affects people from poor agricultural and herding communities and was categorized by WHO last year as a high-priority neglected tropical disease. Poor prevention, health worker training, diagnosis and treatment of cases of snakebite, as well as a lack of available tools, are all holding up progress on addressing the global burden of the disease.</p><p>Acknowledging the urgent need to improve access to safe, effective and affordable antivenoms for snakebite, delegates urged WHO to accelerate and coordinate global efforts to control snakebite 'envenoming' - the life-threatening disease that follows the bite of a venomous snake. </p><h2>Physical activity</h2><p>Member States endorsed the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity (GAPPA), a new initiative aimed at increasing participation in physical activity by people of all ages and ability to promote health and beat noncommunicable diseases, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes and breast and colon cancer, and support improved mental health and quality of life.</p><p>Worldwide, 23% of adults and 81% of adolescents aged 11-17 years do not meet the global recommendations for physical activity. Prevalence of inactivity is as high as 80% in some adult populations influenced by changing patterns of transportation, use of technology, urbanization and cultural values.</p><p>GAPPA provides countries with a prioritized list of policy actions to address the multiple cultural, environmental and individual determinants of physical inactivity. These actions are connected to four objectives that focus on creating active societies, environments, active people and active systems. The plan's goal is a 15% reduction in the global prevalence of physical inactivity in adults and in adolescents by 2030.</p><h2>Assistive technology</h2><p>Delegates adopted a resolution urging Member States to develop, implement and strengthen policies and programmes to improve access to assistive technology and requesting the Director-General to prepare by 2021 a global report on effective access to assistive technology. </p><p>Assistive technology, such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, walking frames, reading glasses and prosthetic limbs, enables people with difficulties in functioning to live productive and dignified lives, participating in education, the labour market and social life. Without such technology, people with disabilities and older people and others in need are often excluded, isolated and locked into poverty, and the burden of morbidity and disability increases.</p><p>An estimated 1 billion people would benefit from assistive products, a number that will rise to more than 2 billion by 2050. Yet 90% do not have access, owing to high costs and a lack of availability. The Director-General was requested to report on progress in the implementation of the present resolution to the Seventy-fifth World Health Assembly and thereafter to submit a report to the Health Assembly every four years until 2030.</p><h2>International Health Regulations</h2><p>Delegates welcomed a proposed five-year global strategic plan to improve public health preparedness and response, through implementation of the International Health Regulations. </p><p>The International Health Regulations (IHR) are an international legal instrument that is binding on 196 countries across the globe, including all WHO Member States of WHO. Their aim is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide.</p><p>The IHR, which entered into force on 15 June 2007, require countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to WHO. The IHR define the rights and obligations of countries to report public health events, and establish a number of procedures that WHO must follow in its work to uphold global public health security. </p><p>In 2017, WHO recorded a total of 418 public health events in its event management system: the initial source in reporting 136 of these was national government agencies, including National IHR Focal Points. The new strategy aims to help countries strengthen the core capacities they need to implement the regulations, including more reporting through IHR.</p><h2>Pandemic Influenza Framework (PIP) Framework</h2><p>Delegates considered the report by the Director-General on progress to implement decision WHA70(10) on Review of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework. The Health Assembly approved all the recommendations in the Director-General's report but requested that the final text of the analysis requested in decision WHA70(10)8b, be submitted to WHA 2019 rather than WHA 2020. </p><p>The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework brings together Member States, industry, other stakeholders, and WHO to implement an innovative  global approach to pandemic influenza preparedness and response. It was adopted by Member States during the World Health Assembly in 2011. </p><p>A key principle in the PIP Framework is that fairness and equity must continue to drive global work to prepare for a pandemic response. Thus, the PIP Framework has two objectives: to strengthen the sharing of influenza viruses with pandemic potential and increase access of developing countries to pandemic vaccines, antiviral medicines and other essential response products. </p><h2>Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease</h2><p>Delegates agreed a resolution calling for WHO to launch a coordinated global response to rheumatic heart disease, which affects around 30 million people each year. In 2015, the disease was estimated to have caused 350 000 deaths. The disease most commonly occurs in childhood and disproportionately affects girls and women.</p><p>Rheumatic heart disease is a preventable condition arising from acute rheumatic fever. Despite the availability of effective measures for prevention and treatment of the disease, cases have not significantly declined in recent years. Socioeconomic and environmental factors such as poor housing, undernutrition, overcrowding and poverty increase the likelihood and the severity of the disease.</p><p>Improving standards of living, expanding access to appropriate care, and ensuring a consistent supply of quality-assured antibiotics are some of the key strategies that can dramatically reduce the number of people affected. Delegates called on WHO to reinvigorate efforts to tackle rheumatic fever and to lead and coordinate renewed global efforts for its prevention and control.<br/><br/><a href=\"/about/governance/world-health-assembly/seventy-first\"><strong>Find out more about the Seventy-first World Health Assembly</strong></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>",

      "description": "Digital healthRecognizing the potential of digital technologies to play a major role in improving public health, delegates agreed on a resolution on digital health. The resolution urges Member States to prioritize the development and greater use of digital technologies in health as a means of promoting Universal Health Coverage and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.It requests that WHO develop a global strategy on digital health and supports the scale-up of these technologies in countries by providing technical assistance and normative guidance, monitoring trends and promoting best practices to improve access to health services. The resolution also asks Member States to identify priority areas in which they would benefit from WHO assistance, such as implementation, evaluation and scale up of digital health services and applications, data security, ethical and legal issues. Examples of existing digital health technologies include systems that track disease outbreaks by using \"crowdsourcing\" or community reporting; and mobile phone text messages for positive behaviour change for prevention and management of diseases like diabetes. SnakebiteDelegates agreed a resolution that aims to reduce the number of people around the world who are either killed or are physically or mentally disabled by snakebite. An estimated 1.8 - 2.7 million people are bitten by venomous snakes each year, with between 81 000 and 138 000 people dying as a result. For every person who dies following a snakebite, another four or five are left with disabilities such as blindness, restricted mobility or amputation, and post-traumatic stress disorder.Snakebite overwhelmingly affects people from poor agricultural and herding communities and was categorized by WHO last year as a high-priority neglected tropical disease. Poor prevention, health worker training, diagnosis and treatment of cases of snakebite, as well as a lack of available tools, are all holding up progress on addressing the global burden of the disease.Acknowledging the urgent need to improve access to safe, effective and affordable antivenoms for snakebite, delegates urged WHO to accelerate and coordinate global efforts to control snakebite 'envenoming' - the life-threatening disease that follows the bite of a venomous snake. Physical activityMember States endorsed the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity (GAPPA), a new initiative aimed at increasing participation in physical activity by people of all ages and ability to promote health and beat noncommunicable diseases, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes and breast and colon cancer, and support improved mental health and quality of life.Worldwide, 23% of adults and 81% of adolescents aged 11-17 years do not meet the global recommendations for physical activity. Prevalence of inactivity is as high as 80% in some adult populations influenced by changing patterns of transportation, use of technology, urbanization and cultural values.GAPPA provides countries with a prioritized list of policy actions to address the multiple cultural, environmental and individual determinants of physical inactivity. These actions are connected to four objectives that focus on creating active societies, environments, active people and active systems. The plan's goal is a 15% reduction in the global prevalence of physical inactivity in adults and in adolescents by 2030.Assistive technologyDelegates adopted a resolution urging Member States to develop, implement and strengthen policies and programmes to improve access to assistive technology and requesting the Director-General to prepare by 2021 a global report on effective access to assistive technology. Assistive technology, such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, walking frames, reading glasses and prosthetic limbs, enables people with difficulties in functioning to live productive and dignified lives, participating in education, the labour market and social life. Without such technology, people with disabilities and older people and others in need are often excluded, isolated and locked into poverty, and the burden of morbidity and disability increases.An estimated 1 billion people would benefit from assistive products, a number that will rise to more than 2 billion by 2050.

Each year, 15 million people aged 30 to 70 years die from an NCD and the current levels of decline in risk of premature death from NCDs are insufficient to meet the SDG NCD target.</p><p>The Assembly recognized that enhanced political leadership is needed to accelerate prevention and control of NCDs, such as by implementing cost-effective and feasible “best buys” and other recommended interventions to prevent and control NCDs. These measures include actions to reduce the main disease risks, namely tobacco use, physical inactivity, harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets, as well as air pollution.

I am honoured and it is my real proud privilege to say a few words from the perspective of a person who encountered this lifelong disability, just 2 years ago.</p><h3>Accepting the challenge</h3><p>On the eve of 18 March, 2016, at the wedding ceremony of my best friend, I had a tragic accident and lost consciousness within a fraction of a second. After regaining consciousness, I tried to move my legs but couldn’t. I consider myself fortunate because my friend’s mother, who herself was a doctor, was present at the same wedding and, because of her knowledge, didn’t let other people push me into a car and rush me to a hospital. Instead, I was laid on a couch till the ambulance arrived. But we were saddened to know that it did not have any spinal board in it. So we had to wait for another half hour till the arrival of a second ambulance with better facilities in it. And then with a delay of two hours I was taken to a nearby hospital. When I was transferred out of the ambulance, it was raining, I could feel the raindrops pouring on my body, but not on my legs and feet. At that very moment, being a medical student, I realized the gravity of what had struck me.</p><p>Lying on the hospital bed with two fractured vertebrae, I screamed, I cried, complained, and eventually broke down completely. This was something that I did not ask for. I had two options: either curl up in bed all day and cry, or accept the challenge of a new life and begin the journey of healing. I accepted the challenge of redefining my new life, not to give up.</p><h3>I use many assistive products to remain independent</h3><p>Before my accident, being a medical student, I had the theoretical knowledge about spinal cord injury and its complications. But it was not until my accident that I came to understand the consequences for an individual, family and the community. To say you’re paralyzed for the rest of the life is grief enough. But the limitations we have to face on different levels, is unbelievable, even today.</p><p>As I was comparatively privileged, I had the opportunity to access good rehabilitation services and a wheelchair. I tried with orthoses on both legs to improve my standing balance and to prevent secondary complications, but for practical reasons, ultimately, I settled on a wheelchair as it gives me better mobility and freedom. I use many assistive products to remain independent and productive, such as a transfer board for shifting from car to wheelchair or vice-versa, I use an air mattress at home that saves me from bed sores. Without all these aids, I might live in isolation, with many secondary complications.</p><p>Eventually I started enquiring about others – what happens to those living with similar challenges? I soon realized that I am not alone – millions of people like me exist around the globe. Disability is not only a result of accidents, some people are born with it, some experience it at an early age, while others experience in their old age. In low and middle income countries, these people generally have poorer health, lower educational achievements, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty. This is largely due to the barriers they face in their everyday lives, rather than their impairment or health conditions.</p><h3>Only 10% of people in the world have access to assistive products</h3><p>I am mentioning this to highlight the fact that only 10% of people in the world have access to such kind of basic health products – assistive products – and this percentage could be as low as 3% in many developing countries.</p><p>Personally, I think the first and biggest barrier to access is awareness about the need for and benefit of assistive products. Even health professionals do not know it or care about it. After being discharged from the hospital, I was told that I should contact social welfare and not the health sector anymore – I am disabled so, I should become a product of social welfare. I have discovered that this experience is quite universal. I remember a girl of my age who used to come to the same rehab centre with a similar disability but with a wheelchair twice her size, because of lack of awareness and low access to affordable wheelchairs.</p><p>We need to create awareness at every level, especially in the heath sector.</p><p>The second barrier is the preparedness of the health sector. Most people with spinal cord injury die within 1 to 5 years in developing countries, because not much attention is given to providing proper information regarding spinal cord injury, its complications and management. In most low and middle income countries, with higher rates of poverty and poorer health, people die not because of the spinal cord injury, but because of the secondary complications.</p><p>The most common complication is urinary tract infections with a high mortality rate in women, another avoidable complication is bed sores. Correcting bed sores itself is a nightmare and carries a greater burden for individuals and their families. Another is deep vein thrombosis, and the list goes on. If secondary complications are prevailing, that means the health sector is failing. The health sector needs to look beyond primary care. We have the right to live a healthy life like all of you.</p><h3>Universal health coverage or Health for all – do we really mean it?</h3><p>Are we really part of it? Is the provision of assistive products an integral part of Universal Health Coverage? I hope it is. If not, we need to do something – you never know what tomorrow will bring, just like I did not know that I would need to use a wheelchair for the rest of my life.</p><p>I now know that as people gets older, they will need more and more assistive products – starting with glasses and ending with wheelchairs – again, I am not alone.</p><p>The third barrier is the lack of access to appropriate assistive products, especially within the health sector. I got lucky because my uncle sent a good quality wheelchair from abroad, but how many can get lucky and have access to the same? But despite having good rehab services, I use substandard lower limb orthoses due to lack of access to high quality assistive products in my country.</p><p>After amputating a leg or stabilizing the spine, the job is not complete. I am well aware that we can prevent amputations in most diabetic cases with good health care, including self-care and a simple assistive product such as protective footwear. Hearing aids and dementia, mobility aids and good cushions or mattresses for pressure sores. We have the knowledge and these products exist – so we want to ensure they are available within the health sector for everyone.</p><p>There are essential health products as essential as medicines or vaccines for people in need. I am happy to see WHO is addressing this and I am sure countries will follow.</p><h3>The physical environment is not designed for people with disabilities</h3><p>The fourth barrier that is faced by people with disability is accessibility. Soon after having an appropriate wheelchair I decided to go out and be like others, practise medicine like other classmates. But I realized “Oh No” the physical environment, in which we all live, is not designed for all; especially for people like us and older people. Not every place in most countries has accessible entrances and exits. Most of the public places like universities, banks, parks, offices, stadiums, cinema halls, shopping malls, parking areas, are not accessible - this makes us feel excluded.</p><p>It is not about cost, I have been informed that nearly at the same cost, one can build an accessible environment. Please keep it in mind as demography is changing, we will all need an accessible environment at some stage. It is no more a luxury or add-on item – it is must. Anything good for us will be good for all.</p><p>A lot has to do with thinking, design and empathy. A person’s disability depends on people’s attitude, availability of assistive products and accessible environment.</p><p>Member States need to address these barriers to access to assistive technology.</p><p>I am honoured to be designated WHO Champion for Assistive Technology. I decided to dedicate my life to creating awareness, making the health sector more inclusive and prepared, improving access to high-quality, affordable assistive products and accessible environments.</p><p>This is my new dream – I need your support to achieve it.

Presentations were made by representatives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on recent developments, including measures taken to implement rapid control strategies, and existing gaps and challenges in the outbreak response. During the informational session, the WHO Secretariat provided an update on and assessment of the Ebola outbreak.</p>\n<p>The Committee’s role was to provide to the Director-General their views and perspectives on: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether the event constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)</li>\n<li>If the event constitutes a PHEIC, what Temporary Recommendations should be made</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Current situation</h2>\n<p>On 8 May, WHO was notified by the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of two lab-confirmed cases of Ebola Virus Disease occurring in Bikoro health zone, Equateur province.

This response should be supported by the entire international community.</li>\n<li>Global solidarity among the scientific community is critical and international data should be shared freely and regularly.</li>\n<li>It is particularly important there should be no international travel or trade restrictions.</li>\n<li>Neighbouring countries should strengthen preparedness and surveillance.</li>\n<li>During the response, safety and security of staff should be ensured, and protection of responders and national and international staff should prioritised.</li>\n<li>Exit screening, including at airports and ports on the Congo river, is considered to be of great importance; however entry screening, particularly in distant airports, is not considered to be of any public health or cost-benefit value.</li>\n<li>Robust risk communication (with real-time data), social mobilisation, and community engagement are needed for a well-coordinated response and so that those affected understand what protection measures are being recommended;  </li>\n<li>If the outbreak expands significantly, or if there is international spread,  the Emergency Committee will be reconvened.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Committee emphasized the importance of continued support by WHO and other national and international partners towards the effective implementation and monitoring of this advice.</p>\n<p>Based on this advice, the reports made by the affected States Parties, and the currently available information, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 18 May 2018 did not declare the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

Such actions would save more than 8 million lives over the same period.</p>\n<p>The report, titled <em>Saving lives, spending less: a strategic response to NCDs</em>, reveals, for the first time, the financing needs and returns on investment of WHO’s cost-effective and feasible “best buy” policies to protect people from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), the world’s leading causes of ill health and death.</p>\n<p>It shows that for every US$1 invested in scaling up actions to address NCDs in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs), there will be a return to society of at least US$7 in increased employment, productivity and longer life.</p>\n<p>\"The overarching message of this powerful new WHO report is optimistic,\" says WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"Tackling NCDs is an opportunity to improve health and economies.\"</p>\n<p>If all countries use these interventions, the world would move significantly closer to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 to reduce premature death from NCDs by one-third by 2030. Among the most cost-effective “best buy” interventions are increasing taxes on tobacco and alcohol, reducing salt intake through the reformulation of food products, administering drug therapy and counselling for people who have had a heart attack or stroke, vaccinating girls aged 9─13 years against human papillomavirus and screening women aged 30─49 years for cervical cancer.</p>\n<p>\"NCDs impose huge economic costs that fall heaviest on the low- and middle-income countries that can least afford them. This report makes the case for bold action against NCDs from a business perspective, and it outlines some of the most effective ways to reduce their toll, which can help to direct more resources to where they are needed most,\" says WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases Michael R. Bloomberg.</p>\n<p>LLMICs currently bear the brunt of premature deaths from NCDs: almost half (7.2 million) of the 15 million people who die globally every year between the age of 30 and 70 are from the world’s poorest countries. Yet global financing for NCDs is severely limited, receiving less than 2% of all health funding.</p>\n<p>But the report indicates that taking effective measures to prevent and control NCDs costs just an additional US$ 1.27 per person per year in LLMICs.</p>\n<p>The health gains from this investment will, in turn, generate US$350 billion through averted health costs and increased productivity by 2030, and save 8.2 million lives during the same period.</p>\n<p>For every US$1 invested in each policy area, the following returns have been documented:</p>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>US$12.82 from promoting healthy diets</li>\n<li>US$9.13 from reducing the harmful use of alcohol</li>\n<li>US$7.43 from lower tobacco use</li>\n<li>US$3.29 from providing drug therapy for cardiovascular disease</li>\n<li>US$2.80 from increasing physical activity</li>\n<li>US$2.74 from managing cancer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NCDs kill 41 million people each year, comprising 71% of all deaths globally. The number of deaths from NCDs is increasing across the world, including in LLMICs. As typically long-term conditions, NCDs are especially detrimental to families in low-resource settings, as lengthy and expensive treatment drains household resources, forces families into poverty and stifles development. <em>Saving lives, spending less: a strategic response to NCDs </em>issues a clear call for donors to support governments by offering funding as a catalyst for ambitiously scaling up the “best buy” policies which would save millions of lives. </p>\n<h2>Editors notes</h2>\n<p>Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases and mental disorders, tend to be of long duration and are the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behaviours factors. Tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets all increase the risk of dying from a NCD. Detection, screening and treatment of NCDs, as well as palliative care, are key components of the response to NCDs. WHO also recognizes that air pollution is a critical risk factor for NCDs.</p>",

    "content_html": "<p>WHO today released REPLACE, a step-by-step guide for the elimination of industrially-produced <em>trans</em>-fatty acids from the global food supply. </p><p>Eliminating trans fats is key to protecting health and saving lives: WHO estimates that every year, trans fat intake leads to  more than 500,000 deaths of people from cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Industrially-produced trans fats are contained in hardened vegetable fats, such as margarine and ghee, and are often present in snack food, baked foods, and fried foods. Manufacturers  often use them as they have a longer shelf life than other fats. But healthier alternatives can be used that would not affect taste or cost of food.</p><p>\"WHO calls on governments to use the <strong>REPLACE</strong> action package to eliminate industrially-produced <em>trans</em>-fatty acids from the food supply,\"said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"Implementing the six strategic actions in the <strong>REPLACE </strong>package will help  achieve the elimination of trans fat, and represent a major victory in  the  global  fight against cardiovascular disease.\"</p><p><strong>REPLACE </strong>provides six strategic actions to ensure the prompt, complete, and sustained elimination of industrially-produced trans fats from the food supply:</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">RE</span></strong><strong>view</strong> dietary sources of industrially-produced trans fats and the landscape for required policy change.</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">P</span></strong><strong>romote</strong> the replacement of industrially-produced trans fats with healthier fats and oils.</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">L</span></strong><strong>egislate </strong>or enact regulatory actions to eliminate industrially-produced trans fats. </p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">A</span></strong><strong>ssess</strong> and monitor trans fats content in the food supply and changes in trans fat consumption in the population. </p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">C</span></strong><strong>reate</strong> awareness of the negative health impact of trans fats among policy makers, producers, suppliers, and the public.</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">E</span></strong><strong>nforce</strong> compliance of policies and regulations.</p><p>Several high-income countries have virtually eliminated industrially-produced trans fats through legally imposed limits on the amount that can be contained in packaged food. Some governments have implemented nationwide bans on partially hydrogenated oils, the main source of industrially-produced trans fats.</p><p>In Denmark, the first country to mandate restrictions on industrially-produced trans fats, the trans fat content of food products declined dramatically and cardiovascular disease deaths declined more quickly than in comparable OECD countries.</p><p>\"New York City eliminated industrially-produced trans fat a decade ago, following Denmark’s lead,\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, President and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies. \"Trans fat is an unnecessary toxic chemical that kills, and there’s no reason people around the world should continue to be exposed.\"</p><p>Action is needed in low- and middle-income countries, where controls of use of industrially-produced trans fats are often weaker, to ensure that the benefits are felt equally around the world.  <strong></strong></p><p>WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases, Michael R. Bloomberg, a three-term mayor of New York city and the founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies, said: \"Banning trans fats in New York City helped reduce the number of heart attacks without changing the taste or cost of food, and eliminating their use around the world can save millions of lives. A comprehensive approach to tobacco control allowed us to make more progress globally over the last decade than almost anyone thought possible – now, a similar approach to trans fat can help us make that kind of progress against cardiovascular disease, another of the world’s leading causes of preventable death.\"</p><p>Elimination of industrially-produced trans fats from the global food supply has been identified as one of the priority targets of WHO’s strategic plan, the draft <a href=\"/about/general-programme-of-work/thirteenth\">13<sup>th</sup> \r\n General Programme of Work</a> (GPW13) which will guide the work of WHO in 2019 - 2023. GPW13 is on the agenda of the 71<sup>st</sup> World Health Assembly that will be held in Geneva on 21 – 26 May 2018. As part of the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals, the global community has committed to reducing premature death from noncommunicable diseases by one-third by 2030. Global elimination of industrially-produced trans fats can help achieve this goal.</p><p>\"Why should our children have such an unsafe ingredient in their foods?\" asks Dr Tedros. \"The world is now embarking on the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition, using it as a driver for improved access to healthy food and nutrition. WHO is also using this milestone to work with governments, the food industry, academia and civil society to make food systems healthier for future generations, including by eliminating industrially-produced trans fats.\"</p><h2><strong>Editors notes</strong></h2><p>There are two main sources for trans fats: natural sources (in the dairy products and meat of ruminants such as cows and sheep) and industrially-produced sources (partially hydrogenated oils). </p><p>Partially hydrogenated oils were first introduced into the food supply in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century as a replacement for butter, and became more popular in the 1950s through 1970s with the discovery of the negative health impacts of saturated fatty acids. Partially hydrogenated oils are primarily used for deep frying and as an ingredient in baked goods; they can be replaced in both.</p><p>WHO recommends that the total trans fat intake be limited to less than 1% of total energy intake, which translates to less than 2.2 g/day with a 2,000-calorie diet. Trans fats increases levels of LDL-cholesterol, a well-accepted biomarker for cardiovascular disease risk, and decreases levels of HDL-cholesterol, which carry away cholesterol from arteries and transport it to the liver, that secretes it into the bile. Diets high in trans fat increase heart disease risk by 21% and deaths by 28%. Replacing trans fats with unsaturated fatty acids decreases the risk of heart disease, in part, by ameliorating the negative effects of trans fats on blood lipids.

The outbreak was declared three days ago.  WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will travel to the DRC over the week-end to take stock of the situation and direct the continuing response in support of the national health authorities.</p>\n<p>As of 11 May, 34 Ebola cases have been reported in the area in the past five weeks, including 2 confirmed, 18 probable (deceased) and 14 suspected cases. Five samples were collected from 5 patients and two have been confirmed by the laboratory. Bikoro health zone is 250 km from Mbandaka, capital of Equateur Province in an area of the country that is very hard to reach. </p>\n<p>“WHO staff were in the team that first identified the outbreak. I myself am on my way to the DRC to assess the needs first-hand,” said Dr Tedros. “I’m in contact with the Minister of Health and have assured him that we’re ready to do all that’s needed to stop the spread of Ebola quickly. We are working with our partners to send more staff, equipment and supplies to the area.”</p>\n<p>A multidisciplinary team including WHO experts, along with staff from the Provincial Division of Health and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), arrived in Bikoro on 10 May. This first group of responders is now gathering more data to understand the extent and drivers of the epidemic. The team will also set up an active case search and contact tracing, establish Ebola treatment units to care for patients, set up mobile labs, and engage the community on safe practices. WHO will also work with national authorities in planning further public health measures such as vaccination campaigns.</p>\n<p>“WHO is supporting the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in coordinating this response; this is the country’s ninth Ebola outbreak and there is considerable expertise in-country,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “However, any country facing such a threat may require international assistance. WHO and its partners including MSF, World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the Congolese Red Cross, UNOCHA and MONUSCO , US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), are all stepping up their support.”  </p>\n<p>The response plan to the outbreak includes surveillance, case investigation, and contact tracing; community engagement and social mobilization; case management and infection prevention and control; safe and dignified burials; research response including the use of ring vaccination and antivirals; and coordination and operations support.</p>\n<p>“It is too early to judge the extent of this outbreak,” said Dr Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General for Emergency Preparedness and Response. “However, early signs including the infection of 3 health workers, the geographical extent of the outbreak, the proximity to transport routes and population centres, and the number of suspected cases indicate that stopping this outbreak will be a serious challenge. This will be tough and it will be costly. We need to be prepared for all scenarios.”</p>\n<p>In its latest Disease Outbreak News, WHO lists the risks to surrounding countries as moderate. WHO has however, already alerted those countries and is working with them on border surveillance and preparedness for potential outbreaks. WHO does not at this time advise any restrictions on travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>\n<p>ENDS</p>\n<h2><strong>Note to editors</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Current operations</strong></h3>\n<p>The first multidisciplinary team comprised of experts from WHO, Médecins Sans Frontières and the Provincial Division of Health arrived in Bikoro on 9 May to strengthen coordination and investigations.

    "lead": "The seventeenth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director General on 30 April 2018 at WHO headquarters with members, advisers and invited member states attending via teleconference.The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPVs).  The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations.  The following IHR States Parties provided an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 7 February 2018: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), Pakistan, Kenya, Somalia and Syrian Arab Republic.Wild polioOverall the Committee was encouraged by continued progress in WPV1 eradication, with the number of cases globally remaining low in 2018.  In addition, there has now been no international spread of WPV1 since October 2017.The Committee commended the continued high level commitment seen in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the high degree of cooperation and coordination, particularly targeting the high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border.  The joint planning to cease transmission in the two recognized zones of transmission (the northern corridor which extends from Nangarhar to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, and the southern corridor from Kandahar to Quetta Block) is a key to success in achieving WPV eradication in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the region, and globally.The Committee commended the achievements in Pakistan that have resulted in a sustained reduction in the number of cases, with only one case so far in 2018, and a fall in the proportion of environmental samples that have tested positive for WPV1.  No orphan virus (viruses that are not closely related to any other virus based on genetic analysis) has been detected so far in 2018, giving some confidence that surveillance is working well.  Notable achievements include better quality supplementary immunization activities (SIA) and improved communication to reduce missed children.  However, environmental surveillance continues to detect WPV1 transmission in many high risk areas of the country such as Karachi, Peshawar and the Quetta Block.  The robust response to environmental detections of WPV was welcomed.The Committee was concerned by the stagnation in progress in Afghanistan and the ongoing risks to eradication posed by the number of inaccessible and missed children, particularly in the southern and eastern regions, resulting in fourteen cases in 2017, and already seven cases in 2018.  The continued inaccessibility in Kandahar, Paktika, and parts of Nangarhar and Kunar, and issues with vaccine acceptance in some high risk areas particularly in Kandahar, the Bermel district of Paktika, and Kunar are the biggest challenges.  Of greatest concern are the children chronically unreached by the polio program, these numbering around 13,000 children in Shahwalikot and 40,000 children living in areas controlled by militant anti- government elements in the eastern region.The Committee commended the innovations that continue to be made in Nigeria to reach children in Borno, where the number of inaccessible children has fallen from 160,000 in late 2017 to around 104,000 currently.  While certain cross border activities are being undertaken, such as international synchronization of vaccination campaigns, these efforts appeared to be insufficient to ensure that any poliovirus still circulating undetected is not exported to neighbouring Lake Chad basin countries. The Committee also noted that routine immunization coverage is low, particularly in high risk areas of northern Nigeria. The country however has declared routine immunization a national public health emergency and is actively planning for Gavi transition with strengthening of its routine immunization program in mind.  Although it is over 19 months since the last detection of WPV1 in Nigeria, the outbreak response assessment by global polio experts concluded ongoing undetected transmission could not be ruled out.There is ongoing concern about the districts of the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin region that have been affected by the Boko Haram insurgency, with the consequent lack of services and presence of IDPs and refugees. The risk of international spread from Nigeria to the Lake Chad basin countries or further afield in sub-Saharan Africa remains substantial. The Committee was encouraged that the Lake Chad basin countries, Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), Niger and Nigeria continued to be committed to sub-regional coordination of immunization and surveillance activities.  However, there are widespread persistent gaps in population immunity across these countries, and the ongoing population movement in the sub-region and insecurity are major challenges.  The committee urged that work to characterize and vaccinate transient and permanent populations on the Lake Chad islands continue urgently.Vaccine derived poliovirusThe committee noted that in DR Congo, the vaccine-derived polio outbreak has now been declared a public health emergency, with resources being made available for an emergency operation centre, appointment of a national outbreak coordinator, and other resources.  However, there has been further transmission into new areas not covered by previous mOPV2 campaigns, with the report of a case in Haut Katanga province, and another eight cases reported in previously affected provinces.  Further rounds with mOPV2 are being planned.  Risks are compounded by poor surveillance in many areas, and widespread gaps in population immunity.  It was noted that upcoming elections with the possibility of civil unrest posed an additional risk to the ability of the country to halt the outbreak.  The movement of refugees and IDPs increases the risk of further spread, and the IPV shortage in neighbouring countries is another risk, with the under 2 age group vulnerable to type 2 infection.  In DR Congo, insecurity and geographical remoteness of the affected area pose significant challenges to controlling the outbreak.The committee noted that in Syria, there has been no new case for more than six months, giving hope that transmission may have stopped.  However, while AFP surveillance indicators are good, and environmental surveillance is now in operation, low level transmission cannot yet be ruled out.The new outbreak of cVDPV2 with international spread affecting Somalia and Kenya is a major concern, together with the recent detection of cVDPV3 by environmental sampling in Mogadishu.  While the robust response to date was commendable, the lack of clarity about where the virus emerged and circulated for a prolonged period prior to detection means that it remains unsure whether the population currently being targeted is sufficient.  The persistently inaccessible districts in the South and Central zones of Somalia makes an effective response extremely difficult, with more than 300,000 children aged under 5 years believed to be living in these districts.  Nomadic and refugee movement make other areas in the sub-region (e.g. Somali region of Ethiopia, north east Kenya, and Yemen) potentially at risk of international spread.The new outbreak of cVDPV2 recently detected in Jigawa, Nigeria, again underlines the vulnerability of northern Nigeria to poliovirus transmission.ConclusionThe Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:Although the risk of international spread of WPV may be diminishing as transmission falls, the impact of any delay in eradicating WPV caused by international spread, should it occur now, would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and the need to maintain human and financial resources for a longer period to achieve eradication. The risk of global complacency developing increases as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and removing the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency, particularly at an inopportune time given the upcoming Hajj with its heightened population movement.Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation, as evidenced by gaps in population immunity in several key high risk areas, and also the current number of cVDPV outbreaks, both type 2 and 3, which only emerge and circulate due to lack of polio population immunity.Inaccessibility to vaccination programs remains another major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks, particularly between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Nigeria and its Lake Chad neighbours, and countries in and bordering the Horn of Africa and DR Congo.The inaccessible population in Borno state in Nigeria remains substantial despite the commendable efforts to reach all settlements. These populations have not received polio vaccine since WPV1 was detected in 2016, so ongoing transmission in these unreached pockets cannot be ruled out. The risk of transmission in the Lake Chad sub-region appears considerable, with significant gaps in population immunity in these vulnerable countries, compounded by international population movement.The new international outbreak of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, with a highly diverged cVDPV2 that appears to have circulated undetected for up to four years highlights that there are still high-risk populations in South and Central zones of Somalia where population immunity and surveillance are compromised by inaccessibility.The ongoing spread of cVDPV2 in DR Congo demonstrates significant gaps in population immunity at a critical time in the polio endgame;the lack of IPV vaccination in several countries neighbouring DR Congo heightens the risk of international spread, as population immunity is rapidly waning.The increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses another risk. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. Outbreaks in fragile states are exceedingly difficult to control and threaten the completion of global polio eradication during its end stage.A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.Risk categoriesThe Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread.States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread.States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting periodThese criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (eg Borno)Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report.Temporary recommendationsStates infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spreadWPV1AfghanistanPakistanNigeriacVDPV3SomaliaThese countries should:Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained.Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. > four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers.Ensure that such travellers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travellers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea).Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travellers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travellers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication.Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected.Provide to the Director-General a regular report on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel.States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spreadDR CongoKenyaNigeriaSyrian Arab RepublicSomaliaThese countries should:Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained.Noting the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections, consider requesting vaccines from the global mOPV2 stockpile based on the recommendations of the Advisory Group on mOPV2.Encourage residents and long­term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel; those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure.Ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status.Intensify regional cooperation and cross­border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus, and vaccinate refugees, travellers and cross­border populations, according to the advice of the Advisory Group.Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication.Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without the detection of circulation of VDPV2 in the country from any source, and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the criteria of a ‘state no longer infected’.At the end of 12 months without evidence of transmission, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPVCameroon(last case 9 Jul 2014)Central African Republic(last case 8 Dec 2011)Chad (last case 14 Jun 2012)Niger(last case 15 Nov 2012)These countries should:Urgently strengthen routine immunization to boost population immunity.Enhance surveillance quality, including considering introducing supplementary methods such as environmental surveillance, to reduce the risk of undetected WPV1 and cVDPV transmission, particularly among high risk mobile and vulnerable populations.Intensify efforts to ensure vaccination of mobile and cross­border populations, Internally Displaced Persons, refugees and other vulnerable groups.Enhance regional cooperation and cross border coordination to ensure prompt detection of WPV1 and cVDPV, and vaccination of high risk population groups.Maintain these measures with documentation of full application of high quality surveillance and vaccination activities.At the end of 12 months* without evidence of reintroduction of WPV1 or new emergence and circulation of cVDPV, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.*For the Lake Chad countries, this will be linked to when Nigeria is considered no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV2.Additional considerationsThe Committee noted that in all the infected and vulnerable countries, routine immunization was generally quite poor, if not nationally, then in sub-national pockets.  The Committee also noted that surveillance in these areas may also be sub-optimal, particularly where access is compromised by conflict. The Committee strongly encourages all these countries to make further efforts to improve routine immunization and strengthen surveillance in such areas, and requested international partners to support these countries in rapidly improving routine immunization coverage to underpin eradication.The Committee also urged that Nigeria and the Lake Chad countries increase cross border efforts and joint planning and response.  Intensified effort is needed to identify and reach vulnerable populations in the sub-region, particularly in the Lake Chad islands.  Nigeria should ensure continuing political commitment and take measures to counter fatigue in the fight against polio.  Similarly, the DR Congo government needs to pay more attention to prevention of international spread of cVDPV2 from DR Congo, noting that neighbouring countries are affected by the global shortage of IPV.Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by Afghanistan, DR Congo, Kenya, Pakistan, and Somalia, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 7 May 2018 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 7 May 2018.",
    "content_html": "<p><p>The seventeenth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director General on 30 April 2018 at WHO headquarters with members, advisers and invited member states attending via teleconference. </p><p>The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPVs).  The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations.  The following IHR States Parties provided an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 7 February 2018: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), Pakistan, Kenya, Somalia and Syrian Arab Republic. </p><h2>Wild polio</h2><p>Overall the Committee was encouraged by continued progress in WPV1 eradication, with the number of cases globally remaining low in 2018.  In addition, there has now been no international spread of WPV1 since October 2017.  </p><p>The Committee commended the continued high level commitment seen in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the high degree of cooperation and coordination, particularly targeting the high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border.  The joint planning to cease transmission in the two recognized zones of transmission (the northern corridor which extends from Nangarhar to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, and the southern corridor from Kandahar to Quetta Block) is a key to success in achieving WPV eradication in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the region, and globally.  </p><p>The Committee commended the achievements in Pakistan that have resulted in a sustained reduction in the number of cases, with only one case so far in 2018, and a fall in the proportion of environmental samples that have tested positive for WPV1.  No orphan virus (viruses that are not closely related to any other virus based on genetic analysis) has been detected so far in 2018, giving some confidence that surveillance is working well.  Notable achievements include better quality supplementary immunization activities (SIA) and improved communication to reduce missed children.  However, environmental surveillance continues to detect WPV1 transmission in many high risk areas of the country such as Karachi, Peshawar and the Quetta Block.  The robust response to environmental detections of WPV was welcomed. </p><p>The Committee was concerned by the stagnation in progress in Afghanistan and the ongoing risks to eradication posed by the number of inaccessible and missed children, particularly in the southern and eastern regions, resulting in fourteen cases in 2017, and already seven cases in 2018.  The continued inaccessibility in Kandahar, Paktika, and parts of Nangarhar and Kunar, and issues with vaccine acceptance in some high risk areas particularly in Kandahar, the Bermel district of Paktika, and Kunar are the biggest challenges.  Of greatest concern are the children chronically unreached by the polio program, these numbering around 13,000 children in Shahwalikot and 40,000 children living in areas controlled by militant anti- government elements in the eastern region.   </p><p>The Committee commended the innovations that continue to be made in Nigeria to reach children in Borno, where the number of inaccessible children has fallen from 160,000 in late 2017 to around 104,000 currently.  While certain cross border activities are being undertaken, such as international synchronization of vaccination campaigns, these efforts appeared to be insufficient to ensure that any poliovirus still circulating undetected is not exported to neighbouring Lake Chad basin countries. The Committee also noted that routine immunization coverage is low, particularly in high risk areas of northern Nigeria. The country however has declared routine immunization a national public health emergency and is actively planning for Gavi transition with strengthening of its routine immunization program in mind.  Although it is over 19 months since the last detection of WPV1 in Nigeria, the outbreak response assessment by global polio experts concluded ongoing undetected transmission could not be ruled out.</p><p>There is ongoing concern about the districts of the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin region that have been affected by the Boko Haram insurgency, with the consequent lack of services and presence of IDPs and refugees. The risk of international spread from Nigeria to the Lake Chad basin countries or further afield in sub-Saharan Africa remains substantial. The Committee was encouraged that the Lake Chad basin countries, Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), Niger and Nigeria continued to be committed to sub-regional coordination of immunization and surveillance activities.  However, there are widespread persistent gaps in population immunity across these countries, and the ongoing population movement in the sub-region and insecurity are major challenges.  The committee urged that work to characterize and vaccinate transient and permanent populations on the Lake Chad islands continue urgently.</p><h2>Vaccine derived poliovirus</h2><p>The committee noted that in DR Congo, the vaccine-derived polio outbreak has now been declared a public health emergency, with resources being made available for an emergency operation centre, appointment of a national outbreak coordinator, and other resources.  However, there has been further transmission into new areas not covered by previous mOPV2 campaigns, with the report of a case in Haut Katanga province, and another eight cases reported in previously affected provinces.  Further rounds with mOPV2 are being planned.  Risks are compounded by poor surveillance in many areas, and widespread gaps in population immunity.  It was noted that upcoming elections with the possibility of civil unrest posed an additional risk to the ability of the country to halt the outbreak.  The movement of refugees and IDPs increases the risk of further spread, and the IPV shortage in neighbouring countries is another risk, with the under 2 age group vulnerable to type 2 infection.  In DR Congo, insecurity and geographical remoteness of the affected area pose significant challenges to controlling the outbreak.</p><p>The committee noted that in Syria, there has been no new case for more than six months, giving hope that transmission may have stopped.  However, while AFP surveillance indicators are good, and environmental surveillance is now in operation, low level transmission cannot yet be ruled out.</p><p>The new outbreak of cVDPV2 with international spread affecting Somalia and Kenya is a major concern, together with the recent detection of cVDPV3 by environmental sampling in Mogadishu.  While the robust response to date was commendable, the lack of clarity about where the virus emerged and circulated for a prolonged period prior to detection means that it remains unsure whether the population currently being targeted is sufficient.  The persistently inaccessible districts in the South and Central zones of Somalia makes an effective response extremely difficult, with more than 300,000 children aged under 5 years believed to be living in these districts.  Nomadic and refugee movement make other areas in the sub-region (e.g. Somali region of Ethiopia, north east Kenya, and Yemen) potentially at risk of international spread.  </p><p>The new outbreak of cVDPV2 recently detected in Jigawa, Nigeria, again underlines the vulnerability of northern Nigeria to poliovirus transmission.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</p><ul><li>Although the risk of international spread of WPV may be diminishing as transmission falls, the impact of any delay in eradicating WPV caused by international spread, should it occur now, would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and the need to maintain human and financial resources for a longer period to achieve eradication. The risk of global complacency developing increases as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and removing the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency, particularly at an inopportune time given the upcoming Hajj with its heightened population movement.</li><li>Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation, as evidenced by gaps in population immunity in several key high risk areas, and also the current number of cVDPV outbreaks, both type 2 and 3, which only emerge and circulate due to lack of polio population immunity. </li><li>Inaccessibility to vaccination programs remains another major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.</li><li>The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks, particularly between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Nigeria and its Lake Chad neighbours, and countries in and bordering the Horn of Africa and DR Congo.</li><li>The inaccessible population in Borno state in Nigeria remains substantial despite the commendable efforts to reach all settlements. These populations have not received polio vaccine since WPV1 was detected in 2016, so ongoing transmission in these unreached pockets cannot be ruled out. The risk of transmission in the Lake Chad sub-region appears considerable, with significant gaps in population immunity in these vulnerable countries, compounded by international population movement.</li><li>The new international outbreak of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, with a highly diverged cVDPV2 that appears to have circulated undetected for up to four years highlights that there are still high-risk populations in South and Central zones of Somalia where population immunity and surveillance are compromised by inaccessibility.</li><li>The ongoing spread of cVDPV2 in DR Congo demonstrates significant gaps in population immunity at a critical time in the polio endgame;the lack of IPV vaccination in several countries neighbouring DR Congo heightens the risk of international spread, as population immunity is rapidly waning.</li><li>The increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses another risk. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. Outbreaks in fragile states are exceedingly difficult to control and threaten the completion of global polio eradication during its end stage.</li><li>A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.</li></ul><h2>Risk categories</h2><p>The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:</p><p> </p><ul><li>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread.</li></ul><ul><li>States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread.</li><li>States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.</li></ul><p>Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:</p><ul><li>Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.</li><li>Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period</li><li>These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (eg Borno)</li></ul><p>Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report.</p><h2>Temporary recommendations</h2><h3>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread</h3><h4>WPV1</h4><ul><li>Afghanistan</li><li>Pakistan</li><li>Nigeria</li></ul><h4>cVDPV3</h4><ul><li>Somalia</li></ul><p>These countries should:</p><ul><li>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained.</li><li>Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. &gt; four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.</li><li>Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers.</li><li>Ensure that such travellers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.</li><li>Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination.

      "description": "The seventeenth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director General on 30 April 2018 at WHO headquarters with members, advisers and invited member states attending via teleconference. The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPVs).  The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations.  The following IHR States Parties provided an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 7 February 2018: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), Pakistan, Kenya, Somalia and Syrian Arab Republic. Wild polio: Overall the Committee was encouraged by continued progress in WPV1 eradication, with the number of cases globally remaining low in 2018.  In addition, there has now been no international spread of WPV1 since October 2017.  The Committee commended the continued high level commitment seen in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the high degree of cooperation and coordination, particularly targeting the high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border.  The joint planning to cease transmission in the two recognized zones of transmission (the northern corridor which extends from Nangarhar to Islamabad and Rawalpindi, and the southern corridor from Kandahar to Quetta Block) is a key to success in achieving WPV eradication in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the region, and globally.  The Committee commended the achievements in Pakistan that have resulted in a sustained reduction in the number of cases, with only one case so far in 2018, and a fall in the proportion of environmental samples that have tested positive for WPV1.  No orphan virus (viruses that are not closely related to any other virus based on genetic analysis) has been detected so far in 2018, giving some confidence that surveillance is working well.  Notable achievements include better quality supplementary immunization activities (SIA) and improved communication to reduce missed children.  However, environmental surveillance continues to detect WPV1 transmission in many high risk areas of the country such as Karachi, Peshawar and the Quetta Block.  The robust response to environmental detections of WPV was welcomed. The Committee was concerned by the stagnation in progress in Afghanistan and the ongoing risks to eradication posed by the number of inaccessible and missed children, particularly in the southern and eastern regions, resulting in fourteen cases in 2017, and already seven cases in 2018.  The continued inaccessibility in Kandahar, Paktika, and parts of Nangarhar and Kunar, and issues with vaccine acceptance in some high risk areas particularly in Kandahar, the Bermel district of Paktika, and Kunar are the biggest challenges.  Of greatest concern are the children chronically unreached by the polio program, these numbering around 13,000 children in Shahwalikot and 40,000 children living in areas controlled by militant anti- government elements in the eastern region.   The Committee commended the innovations that continue to be made in Nigeria to reach children in Borno, where the number of inaccessible children has fallen from 160,000 in late 2017 to around 104,000 currently.  While certain cross border activities are being undertaken, such as international synchronization of vaccination campaigns, these efforts appeared to be insufficient to ensure that any poliovirus still circulating undetected is not exported to neighbouring Lake Chad basin countries. The Committee also noted that routine immunization coverage is low, particularly in high risk areas of northern Nigeria. The country however has declared routine immunization a national public health emergency and is actively planning for Gavi transition with strengthening of its routine immunization program in mind.  Although it is over 19 months since the last detection of WPV1 in Nigeria, the outbreak response assessment by global polio experts concluded ongoing undetected transmission could not be ruled out. There is ongoing concern about the districts of the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin region that have been affected by the Boko Haram insurgency, with the consequent lack of services and presence of IDPs and refugees. The risk of international spread from Nigeria to the Lake Chad basin countries or further afield in sub-Saharan Africa remains substantial. The Committee was encouraged that the Lake Chad basin countries, Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), Niger and Nigeria continued to be committed to sub-regional coordination of immunization and surveillance activities.  However, there are widespread persistent gaps in population immunity across these countries, and the ongoing population movement in the sub-region and insecurity are major challenges.  The committee urged that work to characterize and vaccinate transient and permanent populations on the Lake Chad islands continue urgently. Vaccine derived poliovirus: The committee noted that in DR Congo, the vaccine-derived polio outbreak has now been declared a public health emergency, with resources being made available for an emergency operation centre, appointment of a national outbreak coordinator, and other resources.  However, there has been further transmission into new areas not covered by previous mOPV2 campaigns, with the report of a case in Haut Katanga province, and another eight cases reported in previously affected provinces.  Further rounds with mOPV2 are being planned.  Risks are compounded by poor surveillance in many areas, and widespread gaps in population immunity.  It was noted that upcoming elections with the possibility of civil unrest posed an additional risk to the ability of the country to halt the outbreak.  The movement of refugees and IDPs increases the risk of further spread, and the IPV shortage in neighbouring countries is another risk, with the under 2 age group vulnerable to type 2 infection.  In DR Congo, insecurity and geographical remoteness of the affected area pose significant challenges to controlling the outbreak. The committee noted that in Syria, there has been no new case for more than six months, giving hope that transmission may have stopped.  However, while AFP surveillance indicators are good, and environmental surveillance is now in operation, low level transmission cannot yet be ruled out.The new outbreak of cVDPV2 with international spread affecting Somalia and Kenya is a major concern, together with the recent detection of cVDPV3 by environmental sampling in Mogadishu.  While the robust response to date was commendable, the lack of clarity about where the virus emerged and circulated for a prolonged period prior to detection means that it remains unsure whether the population currently being targeted is sufficient.  The persistently inaccessible districts in the South and Central zones of Somalia makes an effective response extremely difficult, with more than 300,000 children aged under 5 years believed to be living in these districts.  Nomadic and refugee movement make other areas in the sub-region (e.g. Somali region of Ethiopia, north east Kenya, and Yemen) potentially at risk of international spread.  The new outbreak of cVDPV2 recently detected in Jigawa, Nigeria, again underlines the vulnerability of northern Nigeria to poliovirus transmission. Conclusion: The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion: Although the risk of international spread of WPV may be diminishing as transmission falls, the impact of any delay in eradicating WPV caused by international spread, should it occur now, would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and the need to maintain human and financial resources for a longer period to achieve eradication. The risk of global complacency developing increases as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and removing the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency, particularly at an inopportune time given the upcoming Hajj with its heightened population movement. Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation, as evidenced by gaps in population immunity in several key high risk areas, and also the current number of cVDPV outbreaks, both type 2 and 3, which only emerge and circulate due to lack of polio population immunity. Inaccessibility to vaccination programs remains another major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods. The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks, particularly between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Nigeria and its Lake Chad neighbours, and countries in and bordering the Horn of Africa and DR Congo. The inaccessible population in Borno state in Nigeria remains substantial despite the commendable efforts to reach all settlements. These populations have not received polio vaccine since WPV1 was detected in 2016, so ongoing transmission in these unreached pockets cannot be ruled out. The risk of transmission in the Lake Chad sub-region appears considerable, with significant gaps in population immunity in these vulnerable countries, compounded by international population movement. The new international outbreak of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, with a highly diverged cVDPV2 that appears to have circulated undetected for up to four years highlights that there are still high-risk populations in South and Central zones of Somalia where population immunity and surveillance are compromised by inaccessibility. The ongoing spread of cVDPV2 in DR Congo demonstrates significant gaps in population immunity at a critical time in the polio endgame; the lack of IPV vaccination in several countries neighbouring DR Congo heightens the risk of international spread, as population immunity is rapidly waning. The increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses another risk. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. Outbreaks in fragile states are exceedingly difficult to control and threaten the completion of global polio eradication during its end stage. A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders. Risk categories: The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows: States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread. States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread. States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV. Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV: Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer. Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period. These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (eg Borno)Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report. Temporary recommendations:  States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread: WPV1: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria. cVDPV3: Somalia. These countries should: Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained. Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. > four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel. Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers. Ensure that such travellers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination. Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travellers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea). Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travellers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travellers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border. Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication. Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected.

At the end of 12 months without evidence of transmission, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV: Cameroon (last case 9 Jul 2014), Central African Republic (last case 8 Dec 2011), Chad (last case 14 Jun 2012), Niger (last case 15 Nov 2012). These countries should: Urgently strengthen routine immunization to boost population immunity. Enhance surveillance quality, including considering introducing supplementary methods such as environmental surveillance, to reduce the risk of undetected WPV1 and cVDPV transmission, particularly among high risk mobile and vulnerable populations. Intensify efforts to ensure vaccination of mobile and cross­border populations, Internally Displaced Persons, refugees and other vulnerable groups. Enhance regional cooperation and cross border coordination to ensure prompt detection of WPV1 and cVDPV, and vaccination of high risk population groups. Maintain these measures with documentation of full application of high quality surveillance and vaccination activities. At the end of 12 months* without evidence of reintroduction of WPV1 or new emergence and circulation of cVDPV, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations. * For the Lake Chad countries, this will be linked to when Nigeria is considered no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV2. Additional considerations: The Committee noted that in all the infected and vulnerable countries, routine immunization was generally quite poor, if not nationally, then in sub-national pockets.  The Committee also noted that surveillance in these areas may also be sub-optimal, particularly where access is compromised by conflict. The Committee strongly encourages all these countries to make further efforts to improve routine immunization and strengthen surveillance in such areas, and requested international partners to support these countries in rapidly improving routine immunization coverage to underpin eradication.  The Committee also urged that Nigeria and the Lake Chad countries increase cross border efforts and joint planning and response.  Intensified effort is needed to identify and reach vulnerable populations in the sub-region, particularly in the Lake Chad islands.  Nigeria should ensure continuing political commitment and take measures to counter fatigue in the fight against polio.  Similarly, the DR Congo government needs to pay more attention to prevention of international spread of cVDPV2 from DR Congo, noting that neighbouring countries are affected by the global shortage of IPV. Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by Afghanistan, DR Congo, Kenya, Pakistan, and Somalia, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 7 May 2018 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 7 May 2018.",

    "content_html": "<p>The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Bikoro in Equateur Province today (8 May). The outbreak declaration occurred after laboratory results confirmed two cases of EVD. </p>\n<p>The Ministry of Health of Democratic of the Congo (DRC) informed WHO that two out of five samples collected from five patients tested positive for EVD at the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa. More specimens are being collected for testing. </p>\n<p>WHO is working closely with the Government of the DRC to rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners using the model of a successful response to a similar EVD outbreak in 2017. </p>\n<p>“Our top priority is to get to Bikoro to work alongside the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and partners to reduce the loss of life and suffering related to this new Ebola virus disease outbreak,” said Dr Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General, Emergency Preparedness and Response. “Working with partners and responding early and in a coordinated way will be vital to containing this deadly disease.”</p>\n<p>The first multidisciplinary team comprised of experts from WHO, Médecins Sans Frontières and Provincial Division of Health travelled today to Bikoro to strengthen coordination and investigations. </p>\n<p>Bikoro is situated in Equateur Province on the shores of Lake Tumba in the north-western part of the country near the Republic of the Congo. All cases were reported from iIkoko Iponge health facility located about 30 kilometres from Bikoro. Health facilities in Bikoro have very limited functionality, and rely on international organizations to provide supplies that frequently stock out.  </p>\n<p>“We know that addressing this outbreak will require a comprehensive and coordinated response. WHO will work closely with health authorities and partners to support the national response. We will gather more samples, conduct contact tracing, engage the communities with messages on prevention and control, and put in place methods for improving data collection and sharing,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.</p>\n<p>This is DRC’s ninth outbreak of EVD since the discovery of the virus in the country in 1976. In the past five weeks, there have been 21 suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in and around the iIkoko Iponge, including 17 deaths. </p>\n<p>“WHO is closely working with other partners, including Médecins Sans Frontières, to ensure a strong, response to support the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to prevent and control the spreading of the disease from the epicentre of iIkoko Iponge Health Zone to save lives,\" said Dr Allarangar Yokouide, WHO Representative in the DRC.  </p>\n<p>Upon learning about the laboratory results today, WHO set up its Incident Management System to fully dedicate staff and resources across the organization to the response. WHO plans to deploy epidemiologists, logisticians, clinicians, infection prevention and control experts, risk communications experts and vaccination support teams in the coming days. WHO will also be determining supply needs and help fill gaps, such as for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). WHO has also alerted neighbouring countries. </p>\n<p>WHO released US$ 1 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to support response activities for the next three months with the goal of stopping the spread of Ebola to surrounding provinces and countries.</p>\n<h2><strong>Building on the 2017 response</strong></h2>\n<p>Ebola is endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The last Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo occurred in 2017 in Likati Health Zone, Bas Uele Province, in the northern part of the country and was quickly contained thanks to joint efforts by the Government of DRC, WHO and many different partners. </p>\n<p>An effective response to the 2017 EVD outbreak was achieved through the timely alert by local authorities of suspect cases, immediate testing of blood samples due to strengthened national laboratory capacity, the early announcement of the outbreak by the government, rapid response activities by local and national health authorities with the robust support of international partners, and speedy access to flexible funding. </p>\n<p>Coordination support on the ground by WHO was critical and an Incident Management System was set up within 24 hours of the outbreak being announced. WHO deployed more than 50 experts to work closely with government and partners.</p>\r\nThe Ebola virus causes an acute, serious illness which is often fatal if untreated.

    "content_html": "<p>A spate of cholera outbreaks across Africa has prompted the largest cholera vaccination drive in history, with more than two million people across the continent set to receive oral cholera vaccine (OCV).</p>\n<p>                                                                                                 </p>\n<p>The vaccines, funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, were sourced from the global stockpile and are being used to carry out five major campaigns in Zambia, Uganda, Malawi, South Sudan and Nigeria. The campaigns, which will be completed by mid-June, are being implemented by the respective Ministries of Health supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners of the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC), and mostly in reaction to recent cholera outbreaks.</p>\n<p>                                                                                                                           </p>\n<p>In the 15 years between 1997 and 2012 just 1.5 million doses of cholera vaccines were used worldwide. In 2017 alone almost 11 million were used, from Sierra Leone to Somalia to Bangladesh. In the first four months of 2018 over 15 million doses have already been approved for use worldwide.</p>\n<p>                                                                                                                                      </p>\n<p>“This is an unprecedented response to a spike in cholera outbreaks across Africa,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “We have worked hard to ensure there is now enough vaccine supply to keep the global stockpile topped up and ready for most eventualities. However with more and more people now succumbing to this terrible, preventable disease, the need for improved water and sanitation – the only long-term, sustainable solution to cholera outbreaks – has never been clearer.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Through its Regional Office for Africa, WHO regularly provides technical and operational support to countries often affected by cholera in Africa. In particular, since the beginning of 2018 WHO has led on providing technical expertise and guidance, working closely with Ministries of Health in the five countries to plan and implement the campaigns with different partners. This is part of a global push to reduce cholera deaths by 90 percent by 2030.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Oral cholera vaccines are a key weapon in our fight against cholera,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “But there are many other things we need to do to keep people safe. WHO and our partners are saving lives every day by improving access to clean water and sanitation, establishing treatment centres, delivering supplies, distributing public health guidance, training health workers, and working with communities on prevention.” </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The burden of cholera remains high in many African countries. As of 7 May many countries are facing cholera outbreaks, with at least 12 areas or countries reporting active cholera transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Recent developments in the use of OCVs show that the strong mobilisation of countries and partners can effectively tackle the disease when tools for prevention and control are readily available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Every rainy season, cholera springs up and brings devastation to communities across Africa,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s Regional Director for Africa. “With this historic cholera vaccination drive, countries in the region are demonstrating their commitment to stopping cholera from claiming more lives. We need to build on this momentum through a multisectoral approach and ensure that everyone has access to clean water and sanitation, no matter where they are located.” </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The five African campaigns are:</p>\n<p>                                      </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nigeria<br/>\n</strong>1.2 million doses will protect around 600,000 people to contain an emerging cholera outbreak in Bauchi state, where more than 1700 cases have been reported.</li>\n<li><strong>Malawi</strong>\n<p>One million doses of cholera vaccine will protect over 500,000 people in Lilongwe to combat an outbreak which has infected more than 900 people across the country. </p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Uganda</strong>\n<p>360,000 doses of cholera vaccine have been shipped to Uganda to protect 360,000 people in Hoima District, Western Uganda, after an outbreak in Kyangwali refugee camp hospitalized more than 900 people. The country is also now engaging in long-term cholera control planning to vaccinate over 1.7 million people in the coming months.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Zambia</strong>\n<p>667,100 doses of cholera vaccine are being delivered as part of the second round of vaccination to the Lusaka slums after a major outbreak infected over 5700 people, killing more than 100. Zambia is also engaging on long term cholera control and planning vaccination in additional hotspots.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>South Sudan</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>113,800 doses have been shipped as a preventative measure ahead of the war-torn country’s rainy season. These extra doses will complement doses remaining from previous campaigns to target Panyijiar.

          "A spate of cholera outbreaks across Africa has prompted the largest cholera vaccination drive in history, with more than two million people across the continent set to receive oral cholera vaccine (OCV).",
          "The vaccines, funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, were sourced from the global stockpile and are being used to carry out five major campaigns in Zambia, Uganda, Malawi, South Sudan and Nigeria. The campaigns, which will be completed by mid-June, are being implemented by the respective Ministries of Health supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners of the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC), and mostly in reaction to recent cholera outbreaks.",
          "In the 15 years between 1997 and 2012 just 1.5 million doses of cholera vaccines were used worldwide. In 2017 alone almost 11 million were used, from Sierra Leone to Somalia to Bangladesh. In the first four months of 2018 over 15 million doses have already been approved for use worldwide.",
          "“This is an unprecedented response to a spike in cholera outbreaks across Africa,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “We have worked hard to ensure there is now enough vaccine supply to keep the global stockpile topped up and ready for most eventualities. However with more and more people now succumbing to this terrible, preventable disease, the need for improved water and sanitation – the only long-term, sustainable solution to cholera outbreaks – has never been clearer.”",
          "Through its Regional Office for Africa, WHO regularly provides technical and operational support to countries often affected by cholera in Africa. In particular, since the beginning of 2018 WHO has led on providing technical expertise and guidance, working closely with Ministries of Health in the five countries to plan and implement the campaigns with different partners. This is part of a global push to reduce cholera deaths by 90 percent by 2030.",
          "“Oral cholera vaccines are a key weapon in our fight against cholera,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “But there are many other things we need to do to keep people safe. WHO and our partners are saving lives every day by improving access to clean water and sanitation, establishing treatment centres, delivering supplies, distributing public health guidance, training health workers, and working with communities on prevention.”",
          "The burden of cholera remains high in many African countries. As of 7 May many countries are facing cholera outbreaks, with at least 12 areas or countries reporting active cholera transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Recent developments in the use of OCVs show that the strong mobilisation of countries and partners can effectively tackle the disease when tools for prevention and control are readily available.",
          "“Every rainy season, cholera springs up and brings devastation to communities across Africa,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s Regional Director for Africa. “With this historic cholera vaccination drive, countries in the region are demonstrating their commitment to stopping cholera from claiming more lives. We need to build on this momentum through a multisectoral approach and ensure that everyone has access to clean water and sanitation, no matter where they are located.”",
          "The five African campaigns are:",
          "Nigeria 1.2 million doses will protect around 600,000 people to contain an emerging cholera outbreak in Bauchi state, where more than 1700 cases have been reported.",
          "Malawi One million doses of cholera vaccine will protect over 500,000 people in Lilongwe to combat an outbreak which has infected more than 900 people across the country.",
          "Uganda 360,000 doses of cholera vaccine have been shipped to Uganda to protect 360,000 people in Hoima District, Western Uganda, after an outbreak in Kyangwali refugee camp hospitalized more than 900 people. The country is also now engaging in long-term cholera control planning to vaccinate over 1.7 million people in the coming months.",
          "Zambia 667,100 doses of cholera vaccine are being delivered as part of the second round of vaccination to the Lusaka slums after a major outbreak infected over 5700 people, killing more than 100. Zambia is also engaging on long term cholera control and planning vaccination in additional hotspots.",
          "South Sudan",
          "113,800 doses have been shipped as a preventative measure ahead of the war-torn country’s rainy season. These extra doses will complement doses remaining from previous campaigns to target Panyijiar. Over 2.6 million doses of OCV have been administered in South Sudan since 2014.",
          "Oral Cholera Vaccine is recommended to be given in two doses. The first gives protection for six months, the second for three to five years. All five campaigns should have completed their second round of vaccinations by mid-June.",
          "A resolution on cholera will be proposed by Zambia and Haiti at this month’s World Health Assembly, calling for renewed political will and an integrated approached to eliminate cholera, including investment in clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).",
          "The global cholera vaccine stockpile is managed by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC), which decides on OCV use in non-emergency settings, and the International Coordinating Group (ICG), which decides on outbreak response and features representatives from WHO, UNICEF, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Medecins Sans Frontières (MSF).

Since 2016, more than 1000 additional cities have been added to WHO’s database which shows that more countries are measuring and taking action to reduce air pollution than ever before.\r\nThe database collects annual mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>). PM<sub>2.5</sub> includes pollutants, such as sulfate, nitrates and black carbon, which pose the greatest risks to human health. WHO air quality recommendations call for countries to reduce their air pollution to annual mean values of 20 μg/m<sup>3</sup> (for PM<sub>10</sub>) and 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> (for PM<sub>25</sub>).\r\n<p>“Many of the world’s megacities exceed WHO’s guideline levels for air quality by more than 5 times, representing a major risk to people’s health,” says Dr Maria Neira, Director of the Department of Public Health, Social and Environmental Determinants of Health, at WHO. “We are seeing an acceleration of political interest in this global public health challenge. The increase in cities recording air pollution data reflects a commitment to air quality assessment and monitoring. Most of this increase has occurred in high-income countries, but we hope to see a similar scale-up of monitoring efforts worldwide.”  </p><p>While the latest data show ambient air pollution levels are still dangerously high in most parts of the world, they also show some positive progress. Countries are taking measures to tackle and reduce air pollution from particulate matter. For example, in just two years, India’s Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana Scheme has provided some 37 million women living below the poverty line with free LPG connections to support them to switch to clean household energy use. Mexico City has committed to cleaner vehicle standards, including a move to soot-free buses and a ban on private diesel cars by 2025. </p><p>Major sources of air pollution from particulate matter include the inefficient use of energy by households, industry, the agriculture and transport sectors, and coal-fired power plants.

    "content_html": "<p>Nearly one billion people will be vaccinated against yellow fever in 27 high-risk African countries by 2026 with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi – the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF and more than 50 health partners. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The commitment is part of the Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) in Africa strategy, which was launched by Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, Professor Isaac Folorunso Adewole, Nigeria’s Minister of Health and partners at a regional meeting in Abuja, Nigeria on Tuesday (10 April).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“The world is facing an increased risk of Yellow fever outbreaks and Africa is particularly vulnerable,” said Dr Tedros. “With one injection we can protect a person for life against this dangerous pathogen. This unprecedented commitment by countries will ensure that by 2026 Africa is free of Yellow fever epidemics.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>During the three-day EYE strategy regional launch meeting representatives from key African countries, WHO, UNICEF, Gavi, and other partners are developing a roadmap on how to roll-out the EYE strategy at national level. This implementation effort follows the endorsement of the strategy by African Ministers of Health at the 67<sup>th</sup> WHO regional committee in September 2017.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“This comprehensive, global strategy offers an unprecedented opportunity to end the devastating Yellow fever epidemics that periodically impact Africa,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “Ensuring that the most vulnerable communities have access to the vaccine through routine systems plays a central role in making this happen. Vaccine manufacturers and Gavi partners have worked hard to improve the global vaccine supply situation in recent years to make sure there is enough vaccine to respond to outbreaks, allow preventive campaigns and that routine immunization functions at full capacity.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The three objectives of the strategy include protecting at-risk populations through preventive mass vaccination campaigns and routine immunization programmes, preventing international spread, and containing outbreaks rapidly. Developing strong surveillance with robust laboratory networks is key to these efforts. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>UNICEF will make vaccines available, advocate for greater political commitment and provide support in vaccinating children through routine immunization as well as during outbreaks of the disease. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Today, the threat of yellow fever looms larger than ever before, especially for thousands of children across Africa,” said Stefan Peterson, UNICEF’s Chief of Health. “Given that almost half of the people to be vaccinated are children under 15 years of age, this campaign is critical to saving children’s lives, and would go a long way toward stamping out this disease.”</p>\n<p>After outbreaks of Yellow fever in densely populated cities in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo caused 400 deaths in 2016, the acute viral haemorrhagic disease re-emerged as a serious global public health threat. Brazil is currently battling its worst outbreak of Yellow fever in decades with more than 1,000 confirmed cases.

      "description": "Nearly one billion people will be vaccinated against yellow fever in 27 high-risk African countries by 2026 with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi – the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF and more than 50 health partners. \r\n \r\nThe commitment is part of the Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) in Africa strategy, which was launched by Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, Professor Isaac Folorunso Adewole, Nigeria’s Minister of Health and partners at a regional meeting in Abuja, Nigeria on Tuesday (10 April).\r\n \r\n“The world is facing an increased risk of Yellow fever outbreaks and Africa is particularly vulnerable,” said Dr Tedros. “With one injection we can protect a person for life against this dangerous pathogen. This unprecedented commitment by countries will ensure that by 2026 Africa is free of Yellow fever epidemics.”\r\n \r\nDuring the three-day EYE strategy regional launch meeting representatives from key African countries, WHO, UNICEF, Gavi, and other partners are developing a roadmap on how to roll-out the EYE strategy at national level. This implementation effort follows the endorsement of the strategy by African Ministers of Health at the 67th WHO regional committee in September 2017.\r\n \r\n“This comprehensive, global strategy offers an unprecedented opportunity to end the devastating Yellow fever epidemics that periodically impact Africa,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “Ensuring that the most vulnerable communities have access to the vaccine through routine systems plays a central role in making this happen. Vaccine manufacturers and Gavi partners have worked hard to improve the global vaccine supply situation in recent years to make sure there is enough vaccine to respond to outbreaks, allow preventive campaigns and that routine immunization functions at full capacity.”\r\n \r\nThe three objectives of the strategy include protecting at-risk populations through preventive mass vaccination campaigns and routine immunization programmes, preventing international spread, and containing outbreaks rapidly. Developing strong surveillance with robust laboratory networks is key to these efforts. \r\n \r\nUNICEF will make vaccines available, advocate for greater political commitment and provide support in vaccinating children through routine immunization as well as during outbreaks of the disease. \r\n \r\n“Today, the threat of yellow fever looms larger than ever before, especially for thousands of children across Africa,” said Stefan Peterson, UNICEF’s Chief of Health. “Given that almost half of the people to be vaccinated are children under 15 years of age, this campaign is critical to saving children’s lives, and would go a long way toward stamping out this disease.”\r\nAfter outbreaks of Yellow fever in densely populated cities in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo caused 400 deaths in 2016, the acute viral haemorrhagic disease re-emerged as a serious global public health threat. Brazil is currently battling its worst outbreak of Yellow fever in decades with more than 1,000 confirmed cases. The ease and speed of population movements, rapid urbanization and a resurgence of mosquitoes due to global warming have significantly increased the risk of urban outbreaks with international spread.\r\nExperience in West Africa demonstrates that the EYE strategy can work. When Yellow fever re-emerged as a public health issue in the early 2000s, countries in the region controlled the epidemics through preventive mass campaigns combined with routine immunization. No yellow fever epidemics have been recorded since in countries which successfully implemented this approach.\r\nNote to the Editors\r\nThe EYE strategy partners include GAVI the Vaccine Alliance, Endemic and New Technologies Franchise Sanofi Pasteur, Sealy Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Texas, GE Foundation, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Agence de Médecine Préventive (AMP), School of Veterinary Medicine University of Surrey, Bio Manguinhos/Fiocruz, Department for International Development (DFID), Institut Pasteur Dakar, ExxonMobil, Save the Children, ArcelorMittal, Wellcome Trust, Imperial College London, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Sanofi Pasteur, Department of Tropical Medicine University of Hawaii, Medair, Chumakov Federal Scientific Center for Research & Development of Immune-and-Biological Products Russian Academy  of Medical Sciences, China National Biotech Group, Skoll Global Threats Fund, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), BioProtection Systems/NewLikn Genetics Corp., Robert Koch-Institut, Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group (RITAG), PATH – Center for Vaccine Innovation and Access, Department of Entomology University of California, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Vaccinology and Immunology Unit University Hospitals Geneva, Nigerian Academy of Science, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Instituto Evandro Chagas (IEC), International Organization for Migration (IOM) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).",

    "content_html": "<p>Donors have pledged an additional US$15.3 million to support quick action by the World Health Organization to tackle disease outbreaks and humanitarian health crises through its emergency response fund in 2018, the Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE).</p>\n<p>Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland announced contributions ranging from US$20,000 to US$5.6 million at a conference hosted at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on Monday (March 26) – increasing CFE funding levels to US$23 million.</p>\n<p>This will enable the rapid financing of health response operations in the coming months – filling that critical gap between the moment the need for an emergency response is identified and the point at which funds from other sources can be released. WHO will seek to secure further donor commitments to achieve its US$100 million funding target for the 2018/2019 biennium.</p>\n<p>First-time pledges were made by Denmark, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Malta and Norway. The UK has increased its overall commitment to the fund from US$10.5 million to US$16 million, making it the second largest donor after Germany.</p>\n<p>“For the UK, the CFE is an extraordinarily good investment. We are convinced it has a vital and unique role to play in the global effort to prevent and mitigate health emergencies. Today we pledge an additional £4 million (US$5.6 million) for the Contingency Fund and pledge to work with WHO to better profile to a wider audience the huge value it brings. The G7 and the G20 share the UK’s desire for an adequately funded CFE. We urge our fellow Member States and donors to heed WHO’s call and to step forward to provide financial support for the Contingency Fund for Emergencies,” said Alistair Burt, UK Minister of State for International Development.</p>\n<p>The CFE’s ability to release funds within 24 hours sets it apart from complementary financing mechanisms that have different funding criteria and slower disbursement cycles. While other funding mechanisms allow for the scale up of response operations, none are designed to deliver an immediate and early response. The CFE has demonstrated that a small investment can save lives and dramatically reduce the direct costs of controlling outbreaks and responding to emergencies.</p>\n<p>“Without the CFE, recent outbreaks of Ebola in DRC, Marburg virus Disease in Uganda and pneumonic plague in Madagascar could have gotten out of control. By acting decisively and quickly, we can stop disease outbreaks and save thousands of lives for a fraction of the cost of a late response. The CFE has proven its value as a global public good that should be underwritten by long term investment,” said Dr Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director General for Emergency Preparedness and Response.</p>\n<p>Since 2015, the CFE has enabled WHO, national authorities and health partners to get quick starts on more than 50 disease outbreaks, humanitarian crises and natural disasters, allocating more than US$46 million. It has supported the rapid deployment of experts; better disease detection and reporting; the delivery of essential medicines, supplies and personal protective equipment; the strengthening of surveillance and vaccination; improved access to water, sanitation and health services; community engagement; and more.</p>\n<p>Madagascar’s health minister Dr Lalatiana Andriamanarivo called for increased support for the CFE, saying it was instrumental to containing an unprecedented outbreak of pneumonic plague that rapidly spread across the island nation in 2017.</p>\n<p>“We call on our international partners to support the Contingency Fund for Emergencies to enable WHO to respond to outbreaks everywhere across the world, and to reinforce national capacities to manage health emergencies in the future,” said Dr Andriamanarivo.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the CFE provided nearly US$21 million for operations in 23 countries, with most allocations released within 24 hours. Over half (56%) of allocations funded responses in the WHO Africa region, with 28% going to responses in countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region and 11% to the South East Asia Region.</p>\n<h2>Note to editors</h2>\n<p>The WHO Health Emergencies Programme has three funding categories: the core budget that covers essential functions; the appeals budget that covers the additional work done in response to acute and protracted health emergencies; and the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies.</p>\n<p>The Contingency Fund for Emergencies is replenished through donor contributions outside of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme core budget. Contributions are pooled and flexible, rather than earmarked for specific activities.</p>\n<h2>Pledges announced at the CFE Pledging Conference 26 March 2018</h2>\n<span></span>\n<table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"telerik-reTable-5\">\n<colgroup><col span=\"2\" width=\"64\"/> <col width=\"71\"/> <col width=\"64\"/> <col width=\"71\"/> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"telerik-reTableHeaderRow-5\" height=\"35\">\n<td class=\"telerik-reTableHeaderFirstCol-5\" style=\"text-align: left;

      "description": "Donors have pledged an additional US$15.3 million to support quick action by the World Health Organization to tackle disease outbreaks and humanitarian health crises through its emergency response fund in 2018, the Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE).\r\nCanada, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland announced contributions ranging from US$20,000 to US$5.6 million at a conference hosted at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on Monday (March 26) – increasing CFE funding levels to US$23 million.\r\nThis will enable the rapid financing of health response operations in the coming months – filling that critical gap between the moment the need for an emergency response is identified and the point at which funds from other sources can be released. WHO will seek to secure further donor commitments to achieve its US$100 million funding target for the 2018/2019 biennium.\r\nFirst-time pledges were made by Denmark, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Malta and Norway. The UK has increased its overall commitment to the fund from US$10.5 million to US$16 million, making it the second largest donor after Germany.\r\n“For the UK, the CFE is an extraordinarily good investment. We are convinced it has a vital and unique role to play in the global effort to prevent and mitigate health emergencies. Today we pledge an additional £4 million (US$5.6 million) for the Contingency Fund and pledge to work with WHO to better profile to a wider audience the huge value it brings. The G7 and the G20 share the UK’s desire for an adequately funded CFE. We urge our fellow Member States and donors to heed WHO’s call and to step forward to provide financial support for the Contingency Fund for Emergencies,” said Alistair Burt, UK Minister of State for International Development.\r\nThe CFE’s ability to release funds within 24 hours sets it apart from complementary financing mechanisms that have different funding criteria and slower disbursement cycles. While other funding mechanisms allow for the scale up of response operations, none are designed to deliver an immediate and early response. The CFE has demonstrated that a small investment can save lives and dramatically reduce the direct costs of controlling outbreaks and responding to emergencies.\r\n“Without the CFE, recent outbreaks of Ebola in DRC, Marburg virus Disease in Uganda and pneumonic plague in Madagascar could have gotten out of control. By acting decisively and quickly, we can stop disease outbreaks and save thousands of lives for a fraction of the cost of a late response. The CFE has proven its value as a global public good that should be underwritten by long term investment,” said Dr Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director General for Emergency Preparedness and Response.\r\nSince 2015, the CFE has enabled WHO, national authorities and health partners to get quick starts on more than 50 disease outbreaks, humanitarian crises and natural disasters, allocating more than US$46 million. It has supported the rapid deployment of experts; better disease detection and reporting; the delivery of essential medicines, supplies and personal protective equipment; the strengthening of surveillance and vaccination; improved access to water, sanitation and health services; community engagement; and more.\r\nMadagascar’s health minister Dr Lalatiana Andriamanarivo called for increased support for the CFE, saying it was instrumental to containing an unprecedented outbreak of pneumonic plague that rapidly spread across the island nation in 2017.\r\n“We call on our international partners to support the Contingency Fund for Emergencies to enable WHO to respond to outbreaks everywhere across the world, and to reinforce national capacities to manage health emergencies in the future,” said Dr Andriamanarivo.\r\nIn 2017, the CFE provided nearly US$21 million for operations in 23 countries, with most allocations released within 24 hours. Over half (56%) of allocations funded responses in the WHO Africa region, with 28% going to responses in countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region and 11% to the South East Asia Region.\r\nNote to editors\r\nThe WHO Health Emergencies Programme has three funding categories: the core budget that covers essential functions; the appeals budget that covers the additional work done in response to acute and protracted health emergencies; and the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies.\r\nThe Contingency Fund for Emergencies is replenished through donor contributions outside of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme core budget. Contributions are pooled and flexible, rather than earmarked for specific activities.\r\nPledges announced at the CFE Pledging Conference 26 March 2018\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Currency\r\n            Amount\r\n            Conversion\r\n            USD\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Canada\r\n            CDN\r\n            1,000,000\r\n            1.273\r\n            785,546\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Denmark\r\n            DKK\r\n            10,000,000\r\n            6.071\r\n            1,647,175\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Estonia\r\n            EUR\r\n            50,000\r\n            0.815\r\n            61,350\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Germany\r\n            EUR\r\n            2,150,000\r\n            0.815\r\n            2,638,037*\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Korea\r\n            USD\r\n            1,000,000\r\n            1\r\n            1,000,000\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Kuwait\r\n            USD\r\n            500,000\r\n            1\r\n            500,000\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Luxembourg\r\n            EUR\r\n            500,000\r\n            0.815\r\n            613,497\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Malta\r\n            USD\r\n            20,000\r\n            1\r\n            20,000\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Netherlands\r\n            EUR\r\n            1,000,000\r\n            0.815\r\n            1,226,994\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Norway\r\n            NOK\r\n            10,000,000\r\n            7.841\r\n            1,275,348\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            United Kingdom\r\n            GBP\r\n            4,000,000\r\n            0.72\r\n            5,555,556\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            TOTAL\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            15,323,501\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 {\r\n    border-collapse: collapse;\r\n    border: solid 0px;\r\n    font-family: Tahoma;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 tr.telerik-reTableHeaderRow-5 {\r\n    margin: 10px;\r\n    padding: 10px;\r\n    color: #3A4663;\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    font-size: 10pt;\r\n    font-style: normal;\r\n    font-family: Tahoma;\r\n    text-transform: capitalize;\r\n    font-weight: 500;\r\n    border-spacing: 10px;\r\n    line-height: 11pt;\r\n    vertical-align: top;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 td.telerik-reTableHeaderFirstCol-5 {\r\n    padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n    color: #3a4663;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 td.telerik-reTableHeaderLastCol-5 {\r\n    padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n    color: #3a4663;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 td.telerik-reTableHeaderOddCol-5 {\r\n    padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n    color: #3a4663;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 td.telerik-reTableHeaderEvenCol-5 {\r\n    padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n    color: #3a4663;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 tr.telerik-reTableOddRow-5 {\r\n    color: #666666;\r\n    vertical-align: top;\r\n    font-size: 10pt;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 tr.telerik-reTableEvenRow-5 {\r\n    color: #666666;\r\n    vertical-align: top;\r\n    font-size: 10pt;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 td.telerik-reTableFirstCol-5 {\r\n    padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 td.telerik-reTableLastCol-5 {\r\n    padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 td.telerik-reTableOddCol-5 {\r\n    padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 td.telerik-reTableEvenCol-5 {\r\n    padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 tr.telerik-reTableFooterRow-5 {\r\n    color: #3a4663;\r\n    font-weight: 500;\r\n    font-size: 10pt;\r\n    font-family: Tahoma;\r\n    line-height: 11pt;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 td.telerik-reTableFooterFirstCol-5 {\r\n    padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 td.telerik-reTableFooterLastCol-5 {\r\n    padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 td.telerik-reTableFooterOddCol-5 {\r\n    padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-5 td.telerik-reTableFooterEvenCol-5 {\r\n    padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* This amount includes a US$ 797,546 (€ 650,000) contribution from late December 2017.",

Communicable diseases are responsible for over four million deaths worldwide each year.</p>\n<p>This year we celebrate 70 years since the establishment of the World Health Organization and the 40th anniversary of the Declaration of Alma-Ata, which championed primary health care.

Clearly, we have huge challenges ahead of us.</p>\n<p>Universal health coverage means that all people should be able to access the health services and medicines and other health commodities they need which are of good quality without experiencing financial hardship - whoever they are, wherever they live, and without any form of discrimination.</p>\n<p>We are far from achieving this target - at least half the world’s population lacks access to the most basic health services, and almost 100 million people are plunged into extreme poverty every year because they have to pay for their health care out of their own pockets.</p>\n<p>And while poverty drives much inequity and inequality in access to health services worldwide, challenges extend far beyond financial and economic barriers. People are often denied services as a result of their race, ethnicity, social class, age, sex, sexual orientation and gender identity, migrant status, disability or religion. For example, with HIV we know that key populations, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs and prisoners are not only at greater risk of HIV infection but they are also less likely to be able to access the health services they need. And they are also at increased risk of a broad range of other health problems, including other infectious diseases.</p>\n<p>A clear commitment to “leaving no-one behind” must be applied to all communities. Reaching marginalized communities requires partnership and collaboration with those affected communities and with broader civil society:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We need to ensure community perspectives inform our understanding of essential packages of services, commodities and interventions;</li>\n<li>We need to work with communities to better understand who is being left behind and how to ensure universal health coverage can address disparities and gaps;</li>\n<li>We need to recognize and support the role of communities in service delivery and in strengthening broader health systems;</li>\n<li>We need to do more to enable your advocacy and activism efforts, to support of universal health coverage and to increase access to essential medicines and health commodities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Universal health coverage is ultimately a political choice. It is the responsibility of every country and national government to pursue it. I personally commit to spearheading the advocacy required to secure the political support of global, regional, and national leaders.</p>\n<p>I will continue to highlight universal health coverage at G7 and G20 meetings, at regional summits and at the United Nations General Assembly - including the General Assembly High-level meeting on universal health coverage planned for 2019. This year I will also push for accelerated action on communicable diseases – I will attend the International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam in July and the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Tuberculosis in September.</p>\n<p>The world needs a strong and broad coalition to drive health impact and I am delighted that WHO is hosting the secretariat of the UHC2030 partnership jointly with the World Bank.

    "content_html": "<p>The sixteenth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director General on 7 February 2018 at WHO headquarters with members, advisers and invited member states attending via teleconference.</p>\n<p>The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV). The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations. The following IHR States Parties presented an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 14 November 2017: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), Nigeria, Pakistan and Syrian Arab Republic.</p>\n<h2>Wild polio</h2>\n<p>Overall the Committee was encouraged by continued progress in WPV1 eradication, with the number of cases globally falling to an all-time low in 2017. In addition, there has been no international spread of WPV since the fifteenth meeting in November 2017.</p>\n<p>The Committee commended the continued high level commitment seen in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the high degree of cooperation and coordination, particularly targeting the high risk mobile populations that cross the international border, such as nomadic groups, local populations straddling the border, seasonal migrant workers and their families, repatriating refugees (official and informal), and guest children (children staying with relatives across the border). Stopping transmission in these populations remains a major challenge that cannot be under-estimated, underlining the critical continuing need for cross border activities in surveillance and vaccination.</p>\n<p>The Committee commended the achievements in Pakistan that have resulted in the number of cases falling to just eight cases in 2017 and no cases so far in 2018; these achievements included the improved accessibility, improved communication to reduce missed children and better quality supplementary immunization activities (SIA). However, environmental surveillance continues to detect WPV1 transmission in many high risk areas of the country, with the highest rates of positive samples in Karachi, Peshawar and the Quetta Block. Orphan viruses (viruses that are not closely related to any other virus based on genetic analysis) were detected in Karachi, Kila Abdullah, Pishin and Punjab, indicating missed transmission and gaps in surveillance. The Committee was very saddened to learn of the murder of two front line polio workers in Quetta, and acknowledged the extraordinary commitment of the Pakistan program to carry on with eradication activities.</p>\n<p>The Committee was concerned by the stagnation in progress in Afghanistan and the ongoing risks to eradication posed by the number of inaccessible and missed children, particularly in the southern region, resulting in fourteen cases in 2017, and already three cases in 2018. While inaccessibility can fluctuate over time, approximately 23,000 children are chronically unreached by the polio program. The current increase in violence and insecurity in parts of the country with consequent impact on all international program operations was of grave concern.</p>\n<p>The Committee commended the innovations that continue to be made in Nigeria to reach children in Borno. While the number of inaccessible settlements has fallen, there still remains a substantial population in Borno state that is totally inaccessible, including around 160,000 children aged under five. While certain cross border activities are being undertaken, such as international synchronization of vaccination campaigns, these efforts appeared to be insufficient to ensure no poliovirus still circulating undetected is exported to neighboring Lake Chad basin countries. There also seemed to be signs of decreasing political commitment and increasing fatigue in fighting polio; the Federal Government only released 2017 funding for polio in early 2018, the Presidential Task Team had not met regularly, and the Nigeria Governors’ Forum is no longer actively involved in the polio programme. The Committee also noted that routine immunization coverage is low, particularly in high risk areas of northern Nigeria. The country however has declared routine immunization a national public health emergency and is actively planning for Gavi transition. Although it is over 16 months since the last detection of WPV1, the recent outbreak response assessment by global polio experts concluded ongoing undetected transmission could not be ruled out.</p>\n<p>There is ongoing concern about the districts of the neighboring countries of the Lake Chad basin region that have been affected by the Boko Haram insurgency, with the consequent lack of services and presence of IDPs and refugees. The risk of international spread from Nigeria to the Lake Chad basin countries or further afield in sub-Saharan Africa remains substantial. The Committee was encouraged that the Lake Chad basin countries, Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), Niger and Nigeria continued to be committed to sub-regional coordination of immunization and surveillance activities. However, there are widespread persistent gaps in population immunity across these countries, and the ongoing population movement in the sub-region and insecurity are major challenges.</p>\n<h2>Vaccine derived poliovirus</h2>\n<p>In DR Congo, there has been further transmission particularly in Tanganyika province, necessitating further rounds with mOPV2. Risks are compounded by poor surveillance in many areas, and widespread gaps in population immunity. The Committee was particularly concerned that the response had not been put on a sufficient emergency footing, and there was a lack of urgency in some aspects of the response, including apparent lack of attention to minimizing the risk of international spread. It was noted that upcoming elections with the possibility of civil unrest posed an additional risk to the ability of the country to halt the outbreak.</p>\n<p>The Committee remains concerned by the size of cVDPV2 outbreak in Syrian Arab Republic but was encouraged by the efforts being made, noting the great difficulty in reaching all target populations because of the ongoing conflict. Although there is ongoing cross border coordination particularly with Lebanon, it remains unclear whether similar efforts are required and are being undertaken with other neighbouring countries. This is particularly important as poliovirus type 2 population immunity rapidly wanes globally, and the risk of spread beyond Syria’s borders will increase substantially, meaning urgent action is needed to stop transmission.</p>\n<p>The Committee remained concerned about the recent detection of three highly diverged type 2 VDPV viruses in the sewage in Mogadishu in Somalia . With substantial areas inaccessible to vaccination, the mOPV2 and IPV response in December, January and February will need to be carefully assessed to determine if transmission has been interrupted.</p>\n<p>Since the last committee meeting, there has been no new detection of cVDPV2 in Pakistan. As it is now over 16 months since the most recent cVDPV2 was detected, Pakistan no longer meets the criteria for a cVDPV2 infected country. However, based on the outbreak assessment in Nigeria, ongoing transmission could not be ruled out.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The potential risk of further spread through population movement, whether for family, social or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity, returning refugees, or nomadic populations, and the need for international coordination to address these risks, particularly between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Nigeria and its Lake Chad neighbors, and countries bordering the Syrian Arab Republic.</li>\n<li>The current special and extraordinary context of being closer to polio eradication than ever before in history, with the incidence of WPV1 cases in 2017 the lowest ever recorded.</li>\n<li>The risk and consequent costs of failure to eradicate globally a highly debilitating vaccine preventable disease. Even though global transmission of WPV1 has fallen dramatically and with it the likelihood of international spread, the consequences and impact of international spread should it occur now would be even more grave and a major set-back to achieving eradication.</li>\n<li>The risk of global complacency developing as the numbers of polio cases continues to fall and eradication becomes a tangible reality soon.</li>\n<li>The outbreak of WPV1 (and cVDPV) in Nigeria highlighting that there are high-risk areas where surveillance is compromised by inaccessibility, resulting in ongoing circulation of WPV for several years without detection. The risk of transmission in the Lake Chad sub-region appears considerable.</li>\n<li>The serious consequences of further international spread for the increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. Outbreaks in fragile states are exceedingly difficult to control and threaten the completion of global polio eradication during its end stage.</li>\n<li>The importance of a regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders, while also recognizing that the risk of distant international spread remains from zones with active poliovirus transmission.</li>\n<li>Additionally with respect to cVDPV:</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Risk categories</h3>\n<p>The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread.</li>\n<li>States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread.</li>\n<li>States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.</li>\n<li>Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period.</li>\n<li>These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (eg Borno)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months. After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report.</p>\n<h3>TEMPORARY RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>\n<h4>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Afghanistan</li>\n<li>Pakistan</li>\n<li>Nigeria</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These countries should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained.</li>\n<li>Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. &gt; four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.</li>\n<li>Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers..</li>\n<li>Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.</li>\n<li>Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea).</li>\n<li>Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.</li>\n<li>Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication.</li>\n<li>Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected.</li>\n<li>Provide to the Director-General a regular report on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Democratic Republic of the Congo</li>\n<li>Nigeria</li>\n<li>Syrian Arab Republic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These countries should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained.</li>\n<li>Noting the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections, consider requesting vaccines from the global mOPV2 stockpile based on the recommendations of the Advisory Group on mOPV2</li>\n<li>Encourage residents and long­term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel; those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure.</li>\n<li>Ensure that travelers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status.</li>\n<li>Intensify regional cooperation and cross­border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus, and vaccinate refugees, travelers and cross­border populations, according to the advice of the Advisory Group.</li>\n<li>Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication.</li>\n<li>Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without the detection of circulation of VDPV2 in the country from any source, and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the criteria of a ‘state no longer infected’.</li>\n<li>At the end of 12 months without evidence of transmission, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cameroon (last case 9 Jul 2014)</li>\n<li>Central African Republic (last case 8 Dec 2011)</li>\n<li>Chad (last case 14 Jun 2012)</li>\n<li>Niger (last case 15 Nov 2012)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These countries should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Urgently strengthen routine immunization to boost population immunity.</li>\n<li>Enhance surveillance quality, including considering introducing supplementary methods such as environmental surveillance, to reduce the risk of undetected WPV1 and cVDPV transmission, particularly among high risk mobile and vulnerable populations.</li>\n<li>Intensify efforts to ensure vaccination of mobile and cross­border populations, Internally Displaced Persons, refugees and other vulnerable groups.</li>\n<li>Enhance regional cooperation and cross border coordination to ensure prompt detection of WPV1 and cVDPV, and vaccination of high risk population groups.</li>\n<li>Maintain these measures with documentation of full application of high quality surveillance and vaccination activities.</li>\n<li>At the end of 12 months* without evidence of reintroduction of WPV1 or new emergence and circulation of cVDPV, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*For the Lake Chad countries, this will be linked to when Nigeria is considered no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV2.</p>\n<h4>Additional considerations</h4>\n<p>The Committee noted that in all the infected and vulnerable countries, routine immunization was generally quite poor, if not nationally, then in sub-national pockets. The Committee also noted that surveillance in these areas may also be sub-optimal, particularly where access is compromised by conflict. The Committee strongly encourages all these countries to make further efforts to improve routine immunization and strengthen surveillance in such areas, and requested international partners to support these countries in rapidly improving routine immunization coverage to underpin eradication.</p>\n<p>The Committee also urged that Nigeria and the Lake Chad countries increase cross border efforts and joint planning and response. Intensified effort is needed to identify and reach vulnerable populations in the sub-region, particularly in the Lake Chad islands. Noting the low number of international travelers being vaccinated in Nigeria, the committee again recommended that the country needs to improve implementation of the Temporary Recommendations regarding traveler vaccination, including reporting of achievements, and requests the secretariat to report back on this aspect of Nigeria’s response to the next Committee meeting. Nigeria should ensure continuing political commitment and take measures to counter fatigue in the fight against polio. Similarly, the DR Congo government needs to regard the current outbreak of cVDPV2 as a public health emergency and pay more attention to prevention of international spread of cVDPV2 from DR Congo, noting that neighboring countries are affected by the global shortage of IPV.</p>\n<p>Noting the issues that continue in countries previously subject to Temporary Recommendations such as the Ukraine and Somalia, the Committee requested the secretariat to continue to monitor these and other previously infected countries, and highlight to the Committee issues that pose a risk of international spread. The Committee requested an update on the situation in Somalia at its next meeting.</p>\n<p>Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports made by Afghanistan, DR Congo, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Syrian Arab Republic, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 13 February 2018 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 13 February 2018.</p>",

          "Overall the Committee was encouraged by continued progress in WPV1 eradication, with the number of cases globally falling to an all-time low in 2017. In addition, there has been no international spread of WPV since the fifteenth meeting in November 2017.",
          "The Committee commended the continued high level commitment seen in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the high degree of cooperation and coordination, particularly targeting the high risk mobile populations that cross the international border, such as nomadic groups, local populations straddling the border, seasonal migrant workers and their families, repatriating refugees (official and informal), and guest children (children staying with relatives across the border). Stopping transmission in these populations remains a major challenge that cannot be under-estimated, underlining the critical continuing need for cross border activities in surveillance and vaccination.",
          "The Committee commended the achievements in Pakistan that have resulted in the number of cases falling to just eight cases in 2017 and no cases so far in 2018; these achievements included the improved accessibility, improved communication to reduce missed children and better quality supplementary immunization activities (SIA). However, environmental surveillance continues to detect WPV1 transmission in many high risk areas of the country, with the highest rates of positive samples in Karachi, Peshawar and the Quetta Block. Orphan viruses (viruses that are not closely related to any other virus based on genetic analysis) were detected in Karachi, Kila Abdullah, Pishin and Punjab, indicating missed transmission and gaps in surveillance. The Committee was very saddened to learn of the murder of two front line polio workers in Quetta, and acknowledged the extraordinary commitment of the Pakistan program to carry on with eradication activities.",
          "The Committee was concerned by the stagnation in progress in Afghanistan and the ongoing risks to eradication posed by the number of inaccessible and missed children, particularly in the southern region, resulting in fourteen cases in 2017, and already three cases in 2018. While inaccessibility can fluctuate over time, approximately 23,000 children are chronically unreached by the polio program. The current increase in violence and insecurity in parts of the country with consequent impact on all international program operations was of grave concern.",
          "The Committee commended the innovations that continue to be made in Nigeria to reach children in Borno. While the number of inaccessible settlements has fallen, there still remains a substantial population in Borno state that is totally inaccessible, including around 160,000 children aged under five. While certain cross border activities are being undertaken, such as international synchronization of vaccination campaigns, these efforts appeared to be insufficient to ensure no poliovirus still circulating undetected is exported to neighboring Lake Chad basin countries. There also seemed to be signs of decreasing political commitment and increasing fatigue in fighting polio; the Federal Government only released 2017 funding for polio in early 2018, the Presidential Task Team had not met regularly, and the Nigeria Governors’ Forum is no longer actively involved in the polio programme. The Committee also noted that routine immunization coverage is low, particularly in high risk areas of northern Nigeria. The country however has declared routine immunization a national public health emergency and is actively planning for Gavi transition. Although it is over 16 months since the last detection of WPV1, the recent outbreak response assessment by global polio experts concluded ongoing undetected transmission could not be ruled out.",
          "There is ongoing concern about the districts of the neighboring countries of the Lake Chad basin region that have been affected by the Boko Haram insurgency, with the consequent lack of services and presence of IDPs and refugees. The risk of international spread from Nigeria to the Lake Chad basin countries or further afield in sub-Saharan Africa remains substantial. The Committee was encouraged that the Lake Chad basin countries, Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), Niger and Nigeria continued to be committed to sub-regional coordination of immunization and surveillance activities. However, there are widespread persistent gaps in population immunity across these countries, and the ongoing population movement in the sub-region and insecurity are major challenges."

It was noted that upcoming elections with the possibility of civil unrest posed an additional risk to the ability of the country to halt the outbreak.",

Nigeria should ensure continuing political commitment and take measures to counter fatigue in the fight against polio. Similarly, the DR Congo government needs to regard the current outbreak of cVDPV2 as a public health emergency and pay more attention to prevention of international spread of cVDPV2 from DR Congo, noting that neighboring countries are affected by the global shortage of IPV.",
          "Noting the issues that continue in countries previously subject to Temporary Recommendations such as the Ukraine and Somalia, the Committee requested the secretariat to continue to monitor these and other previously infected countries, and highlight to the Committee issues that pose a risk of international spread. The Committee requested an update on the situation in Somalia at its next meeting.",
          "Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports made by Afghanistan, DR Congo, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Syrian Arab Republic, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 13 February 2018 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 13 February 2018."

      "description": "The sixteenth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director General on 7 February 2018 at WHO headquarters with members, advisers and invited member states attending via teleconference.\r\nThe Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV). The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations. The following IHR States Parties presented an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 14 November 2017: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), Nigeria, Pakistan and Syrian Arab Republic.\r\nWild polio\r\nOverall the Committee was encouraged by continued progress in WPV1 eradication, with the number of cases globally falling to an all-time low in 2017. In addition, there has been no international spread of WPV since the fifteenth meeting in November 2017.\r\nThe Committee commended the continued high level commitment seen in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the high degree of cooperation and coordination, particularly targeting the high risk mobile populations that cross the international border, such as nomadic groups, local populations straddling the border, seasonal migrant workers and their families, repatriating refugees (official and informal), and guest children (children staying with relatives across the border). Stopping transmission in these populations remains a major challenge that cannot be under-estimated, underlining the critical continuing need for cross border activities in surveillance and vaccination.\r\nThe Committee commended the achievements in Pakistan that have resulted in the number of cases falling to just eight cases in 2017 and no cases so far in 2018; these achievements included the improved accessibility, improved communication to reduce missed children and better quality supplementary immunization activities (SIA). However, environmental surveillance continues to detect WPV1 transmission in many high risk areas of the country, with the highest rates of positive samples in Karachi, Peshawar and the Quetta Block. Orphan viruses (viruses that are not closely related to any other virus based on genetic analysis) were detected in Karachi, Kila Abdullah, Pishin and Punjab, indicating missed transmission and gaps in surveillance. The Committee was very saddened to learn of the murder of two front line polio workers in Quetta, and acknowledged the extraordinary commitment of the Pakistan program to carry on with eradication activities.\r\nThe Committee was concerned by the stagnation in progress in Afghanistan and the ongoing risks to eradication posed by the number of inaccessible and missed children, particularly in the southern region, resulting in fourteen cases in 2017, and already three cases in 2018. While inaccessibility can fluctuate over time, approximately 23,000 children are chronically unreached by the polio program. The current increase in violence and insecurity in parts of the country with consequent impact on all international program operations was of grave concern.\r\nThe Committee commended the innovations that continue to be made in Nigeria to reach children in Borno. While the number of inaccessible settlements has fallen, there still remains a substantial population in Borno state that is totally inaccessible, including around 160,000 children aged under five. While certain cross border activities are being undertaken, such as international synchronization of vaccination campaigns, these efforts appeared to be insufficient to ensure no poliovirus still circulating undetected is exported to neighboring Lake Chad basin countries. There also seemed to be signs of decreasing political commitment and increasing fatigue in fighting polio; the Federal Government only released 2017 funding for polio in early 2018, the Presidential Task Team had not met regularly, and the Nigeria Governors’ Forum is no longer actively involved in the polio programme. The Committee also noted that routine immunization coverage is low, particularly in high risk areas of northern Nigeria. The country however has declared routine immunization a national public health emergency and is actively planning for Gavi transition. Although it is over 16 months since the last detection of WPV1, the recent outbreak response assessment by global polio experts concluded ongoing undetected transmission could not be ruled out.\r\nThere is ongoing concern about the districts of the neighboring countries of the Lake Chad basin region that have been affected by the Boko Haram insurgency, with the consequent lack of services and presence of IDPs and refugees. The risk of international spread from Nigeria to the Lake Chad basin countries or further afield in sub-Saharan Africa remains substantial. The Committee was encouraged that the Lake Chad basin countries, Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), Niger and Nigeria continued to be committed to sub-regional coordination of immunization and surveillance activities. However, there are widespread persistent gaps in population immunity across these countries, and the ongoing population movement in the sub-region and insecurity are major challenges.\r\nVaccine derived poliovirus\r\nIn DR Congo, there has been further transmission particularly in Tanganyika province, necessitating further rounds with mOPV2. Risks are compounded by poor surveillance in many areas, and widespread gaps in population immunity. The Committee was particularly concerned that the response had not been put on a sufficient emergency footing, and there was a lack of urgency in some aspects of the response, including apparent lack of attention to minimizing the risk of international spread. It was noted that upcoming elections with the possibility of civil unrest posed an additional risk to the ability of the country to halt the outbreak.\r\nThe Committee remains concerned by the size of cVDPV2 outbreak in Syrian Arab Republic but was encouraged by the efforts being made, noting the great difficulty in reaching all target populations because of the ongoing conflict. Although there is ongoing cross border coordination particularly with Lebanon, it remains unclear whether similar efforts are required and are being undertaken with other neighbouring countries. This is particularly important as poliovirus type 2 population immunity rapidly wanes globally, and the risk of spread beyond Syria’s borders will increase substantially, meaning urgent action is needed to stop transmission.\r\nThe Committee remained concerned about the recent detection of three highly diverged type 2 VDPV viruses in the sewage in Mogadishu in Somalia . With substantial areas inaccessible to vaccination, the mOPV2 and IPV response in December, January and February will need to be carefully assessed to determine if transmission has been interrupted.\r\nSince the last committee meeting, there has been no new detection of cVDPV2 in Pakistan. As it is now over 16 months since the most recent cVDPV2 was detected, Pakistan no longer meets the criteria for a cVDPV2 infected country. However, based on the outbreak assessment in Nigeria, ongoing transmission could not be ruled out.\r\nConclusion\r\nThe Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:\r\n\r\n    The potential risk of further spread through population movement, whether for family, social or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity, returning refugees, or nomadic populations, and the need for international coordination to address these risks, particularly between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Nigeria and its Lake Chad neighbors, and countries bordering the Syrian Arab Republic.\r\n    The current special and extraordinary context of being closer to polio eradication than ever before in history, with the incidence of WPV1 cases in 2017 the lowest ever recorded.\r\n    The risk and consequent costs of failure to eradicate globally a highly debilitating vaccine preventable disease. Even though global transmission of WPV1 has fallen dramatically and with it the likelihood of international spread, the consequences and impact of international spread should it occur now would be even more grave and a major set-back to achieving eradication.\r\n    The risk of global complacency developing as the numbers of polio cases continues to fall and eradication becomes a tangible reality soon.\r\n    The outbreak of WPV1 (and cVDPV) in Nigeria highlighting that there are high-risk areas where surveillance is compromised by inaccessibility, resulting in ongoing circulation of WPV for several years without detection. The risk of transmission in the Lake Chad sub-region appears considerable.\r\n    The serious consequences of further international spread for the increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. Outbreaks in fragile states are exceedingly difficult to control and threaten the completion of global polio eradication during its end stage.\r\n    The importance of a regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders, while also recognizing that the risk of distant international spread remains from zones with active poliovirus transmission.\r\n    Additionally with respect to cVDPV:\r\n\r\nRisk categories\r\nThe Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:\r\n\r\n    States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread.\r\n    States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread.\r\n    States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.\r\n\r\nCriteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:\r\n\r\n    Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.\r\n    Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period.\r\n    These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (eg Borno)\r\n\r\nOnce a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months. After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report.\r\nTEMPORARY RECOMMENDATIONS\r\nStates infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread\r\n\r\n    Afghanistan\r\n    Pakistan\r\n    Nigeria\r\n\r\nThese countries should:\r\n\r\n    Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained.\r\n    Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. > four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.\r\n    Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers..\r\n    Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.\r\n    Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea).\r\n    Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.\r\n    Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication.\r\n    Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected.\r\n    Provide to the Director-General a regular report on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel.\r\n\r\nStates infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread\r\n\r\n    Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\n    Nigeria\r\n    Syrian Arab Republic\r\n\r\nThese countries should:\r\n\r\n    Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained.\r\n    Noting the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections, consider requesting vaccines from the global mOPV2 stockpile based on the recommendations of the Advisory Group on mOPV2\r\n    Encourage residents and long­term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel; those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure.\r\n    Ensure that travelers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status.\r\n    Intensify regional cooperation and cross­border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus, and vaccinate refugees, travelers and cross­border populations, according to the advice of the Advisory Group.\r\n    Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication.\r\n    Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without the detection of circulation of VDPV2 in the country from any source, and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the criteria of a ‘state no longer infected’.\r\n    At the end of 12 months without evidence of transmission, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.\r\n\r\nStates no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV\r\n\r\n    Cameroon (last case 9 Jul 2014)\r\n    Central African Republic (last case 8 Dec 2011)\r\n    Chad (last case 14 Jun 2012)\r\n    Niger (last case 15 Nov 2012)\r\n\r\nThese countries should:\r\n\r\n    Urgently strengthen routine immunization to boost population immunity.\r\n    Enhance surveillance quality, including considering introducing supplementary methods such as environmental surveillance, to reduce the risk of undetected WPV1 and cVDPV transmission, particularly among high risk mobile and vulnerable populations.\r\n    Intensify efforts to ensure vaccination of mobile and cross­border populations, Internally Displaced Persons, refugees and other vulnerable groups.\r\n    Enhance regional cooperation and cross border coordination to ensure prompt detection of WPV1 and cVDPV, and vaccination of high risk population groups.\r\n    Maintain these measures with documentation of full application of high quality surveillance and vaccination activities.\r\n    At the end of 12 months* without evidence of reintroduction of WPV1 or new emergence and circulation of cVDPV, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.\r\n\r\n*For the Lake Chad countries, this will be linked to when Nigeria is considered no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV2.\r\nAdditional considerations\r\nThe Committee noted that in all the infected and vulnerable countries, routine immunization was generally quite poor, if not nationally, then in sub-national pockets. The Committee also noted that surveillance in these areas may also be sub-optimal, particularly where access is compromised by conflict. The Committee strongly encourages all these countries to make further efforts to improve routine immunization and strengthen surveillance in such areas, and requested international partners to support these countries in rapidly improving routine immunization coverage to underpin eradication.\r\nThe Committee also urged that Nigeria and the Lake Chad countries increase cross border efforts and joint planning and response. Intensified effort is needed to identify and reach vulnerable populations in the sub-region, particularly in the Lake Chad islands. Noting the low number of international travelers being vaccinated in Nigeria, the committee again recommended that the country needs to improve implementation of the Temporary Recommendations regarding traveler vaccination, including reporting of achievements, and requests the secretariat to report back on this aspect of Nigeria’s response to the next Committee meeting. Nigeria should ensure continuing political commitment and take measures to counter fatigue in the fight against polio. Similarly, the DR Congo government needs to regard the current outbreak of cVDPV2 as a public health emergency and pay more attention to prevention of international spread of cVDPV2 from DR Congo, noting that neighboring countries are affected by the global shortage of IPV.\r\nNoting the issues that continue in countries previously subject to Temporary Recommendations such as the Ukraine and Somalia, the Committee requested the secretariat to continue to monitor these and other previously infected countries, and highlight to the Committee issues that pose a risk of international spread. The Committee requested an update on the situation in Somalia at its next meeting.\r\nBased on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports made by Afghanistan, DR Congo, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Syrian Arab Republic, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 13 February 2018 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 13 February 2018.",

    "content_html": "<p>WHO’s first release of surveillance data on antibiotic resistance reveals high levels of resistance to a number of serious bacterial infections in both high- and low-income countries.</p>\n<p>WHO’s new Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System (GLASS) reveals widespread occurrence of antibiotic resistance among 500 000 people with suspected bacterial infections across 22 countries.</p>\n<p>The most commonly reported resistant bacteria were <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, followed by <em>Salmonella</em> spp. The system does not include data on resistance of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, which causes tuberculosis (TB), as WHO has been tracking it since 1994 and providing annual updates in the <em>Global tuberculosis report</em>.</p>\n<p>Among patients with suspected bloodstream infection, the proportion that had bacteria resistant to at least one of the most commonly used antibiotics ranged tremendously between different countries – from zero to 82%. Resistance to penicillin – the medicine used for decades worldwide to treat pneumonia – ranged from zero to 51% among reporting countries. And between 8% to 65% of <em>E. coli</em> associated with urinary tract infections presented resistance to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used to treat this condition.</p>\n<p>“The report confirms the serious situation of antibiotic resistance worldwide,” says Dr Marc Sprenger, director of WHO’s Antimicrobial Resistance Secretariat.</p>\n<p>“Some of the world’s most common – and potentially most dangerous – infections are proving drug-resistant,” adds Sprenger. “And most worrying of all, pathogens don’t respect national borders. That’s why WHO is encouraging all countries to set up good surveillance systems for detecting drug resistance that can provide data to this global system.”</p>\n<p>To date, 52 countries (25 high-income, 20 middle-income and 7 low-income countries) are enrolled in WHO’s Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System. For the first report, 40 countries provided information about their national surveillance systems and 22 countries also provided data on levels of antibiotic resistance.</p>\n<p>“The report is a vital first step towards improving our understanding of the extent of antimicrobial resistance. Surveillance is in its infancy, but it is vital to develop it if we are to anticipate and tackle one of the biggest threats to global public health,” says Dr Carmem Pessoa-Silva, who coordinates the new surveillance system at WHO.</p>\n<p>Data presented in this first GLASS report vary widely in quality and completeness.

      "description": "WHO’s first release of surveillance data on antibiotic resistance reveals high levels of resistance to a number of serious bacterial infections in both high- and low-income countries.\r\nWHO’s new Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System (GLASS) reveals widespread occurrence of antibiotic resistance among 500 000 people with suspected bacterial infections across 22 countries.\r\nThe most commonly reported resistant bacteria were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Salmonella spp. The system does not include data on resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes tuberculosis (TB), as WHO has been tracking it since 1994 and providing annual updates in the Global tuberculosis report.\r\nAmong patients with suspected bloodstream infection, the proportion that had bacteria resistant to at least one of the most commonly used antibiotics ranged tremendously between different countries – from zero to 82%. Resistance to penicillin – the medicine used for decades worldwide to treat pneumonia – ranged from zero to 51% among reporting countries. And between 8% to 65% of E. coli associated with urinary tract infections presented resistance to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used to treat this condition.\r\n“The report confirms the serious situation of antibiotic resistance worldwide,” says Dr Marc Sprenger, director of WHO’s Antimicrobial Resistance Secretariat.\r\n“Some of the world’s most common – and potentially most dangerous – infections are proving drug-resistant,” adds Sprenger. “And most worrying of all, pathogens don’t respect national borders. That’s why WHO is encouraging all countries to set up good surveillance systems for detecting drug resistance that can provide data to this global system.”\r\nTo date, 52 countries (25 high-income, 20 middle-income and 7 low-income countries) are enrolled in WHO’s Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System. For the first report, 40 countries provided information about their national surveillance systems and 22 countries also provided data on levels of antibiotic resistance.\r\n“The report is a vital first step towards improving our understanding of the extent of antimicrobial resistance. Surveillance is in its infancy, but it is vital to develop it if we are to anticipate and tackle one of the biggest threats to global public health,” says Dr Carmem Pessoa-Silva, who coordinates the new surveillance system at WHO.\r\nData presented in this first GLASS report vary widely in quality and completeness. Some countries face major challenges in building their national surveillance systems, including a lack of personnel, funds and infrastructure.\r\nHowever, WHO is supporting more countries to set up national antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems that can produce reliable, meaningful data. GLASS is helping to standardize the way that countries collect data and enable a more complete picture about antimicrobial resistance patterns and trends.\r\nSolid drug resistance surveillance programmes in TB, HIV and malaria have been functioning for many years and have helped estimate disease burden, plan diagnostic and treatment services, monitor the effectiveness of control interventions, and design effective treatment regimens to address and prevent future resistance. GLASS is expected to perform a similar function for common bacterial pathogens.\r\nThe rollout of GLASS is already making a difference in many countries. For example, Kenya has enhanced the development of its national antimicrobial resistance system; Tunisia started to aggregate data on antimicrobial resistance at national level; the Republic of Korea completely revised its national surveillance system to align with the GLASS methodology, providing data of very high quality and completeness; and countries such as Afghanistan or Cambodia that face major structural challenges have enrolled in the system and are using the GLASS framework as an opportunity for strengthening their AMR surveillance capacities. In general, national participation in GLASS is seen as a sign of growing political commitment to support global efforts to control antimicrobial resistance.\r\nNote to editors\r\nThe need for a global surveillance system was highlighted by WHO in 2014 in the Antimicrobial resistance global report on surveillance.\r\nIn October 2015, WHO launched the Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System (GLASS) working closely with WHO Collaborating Centres and existing antimicrobial resistance surveillance networks and based on the experience of other WHO surveillance programmes.

    "content_html": "<div><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The Director-General of WHO has outlined his vision for a Madagascar free of plague epidemics during a three-day visit to the island nation that started on 7 January 2018.</span></div>\n<p>\n<span>\"Madagascar can make plague epidemics a thing of the past through strategic investments in its health system – including better access to healthcare, improving preparedness, surveillance and response capabilities, and implementing the International Health Regulations,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>During his first visit to Madagascar since his election as Director-General of WHO last year, Dr Tedros is due to meet with plague survivors and affected families, key Ministers and officials leading response efforts, the President and First Lady, and representatives of UN agencies and health partners. He will also visit a plague treatment centre, and the National Operational and Strategic Centre for Epidemiological Surveillance.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>On the first day of the visit, the WHO Director-General thanked national authorities for their leadership and partners for their support during the recent nationwide outbreak of pneumonic and bubonic plague that caused more than 200 deaths over four months.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"This unprecedented pneumonic plague outbreak was contained due to the tireless efforts of Malagasy health workers and partners. WHO will continue to support plague preparedness, control and response, and we call on our international development partners to help us end human outbreaks. This will include better understanding of the wider factors that allow plague to spread, and strengthening national capacities to manage similar emergencies in the future,\" said Dr Tedros.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Although the acute phase of the epidemic was declared over by health authorities in late November 2017, plague occurs seasonally in Madagascar, usually between September and April each year. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Dr Tedros was accompanied by WHO Regional Director for Africa Dr Matshidiso Moeti who cautioned that the response must be sustained until the end of the plague season and beyond.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"We must sustain a strong alert and response system to rapidly detect and respond to new plague cases as they emerge,\" said Dr Moeti. \"WHO urgently requires an additional US$ 4 million to sustain response operations over the next three months and until April 2018.\"</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>When the outbreak was detected in August 2017, WHO rapidly mobilised financial, operational and technical support to Madagascar and neighbouring countries – releasing emergency funds, delivering medicines and supplies, sharing guidelines on case management and safe burials, supporting surveillance and laboratory testing, and strengthening public health measures at ports and airports. More than 4400 people were trained to identify, refer and care for close contacts of plague patients to prevent the disease from spreading. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"With support from WHO and other partners we provided treatment to nearly all identified plague patients and more than 7300 contacts free of charge,\" said Dr Lalatiana Andriamanarivo, Minister of Health of Madagascar. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Through its Health Emergencies programme, financial support for WHO’s response to the plague outbreak in Madagascar has been provided by the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) and the governments of Italy, Norway and the Republic of Korea. WHO and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) staff deployed more than 135 staff to Madagascar to respond to the outbreak.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Note to editors</h2>\n<p class=\"section_head1\">The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Malagasy Red Cross, Institut Pasteur Madagascar, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Medecins du Monde (MdM), the United Nations country team (including UNICEF, UNFPA, UNDP), USAID, Action Contre la Faim, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners, including the alumni network (EAN) of the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET), the Indian Ocean Commission (OIC), Public Health England, the Robert Koch Institute, Santé Public France, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other partners are actively supporting the government and health authorities in Madagascar.<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"> </span></p>",
