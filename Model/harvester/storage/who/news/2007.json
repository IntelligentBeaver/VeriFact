    "content_html": "<p> </p><p>New data show global HIV prevalence—the percentage of people living with HIV—has levelled off and that the number of new infections has fallen, in part as a result of the impact of HIV programmes. However, in 2007 33.2 million [30.6 – 36.1 million] people were estimated to be living with HIV, 2.5 million [1.8 – 4.1 million] people became newly infected and 2.1 million [1.9 – 2.4 million] people died of AIDS.</p><p>There were an estimated 1.7 million [1.4 – 2.4 million] new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa in 2007—a significant reduction since 2001. However, the region remains most severely affected. An estimated 22.5 million [20.9 – 24.3 million] people living with HIV, or 68% of the global total, are in sub-Saharan Africa. Eight countries in this region now account for almost one-third of all new HIV infections and AIDS deaths globally.</p><p>Since 2001, when the United Nations Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS was signed, the number of people living with HIV in Eastern Europe and Central Asia has increased by more than 150% from 630 000 [490 000 – 1.1 million] to 1.6 million [1.2 – 2.1 million] in 2007. In Asia, the estimated number of people living with HIV in Viet Nam has more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 and Indonesia has the fastest growing epidemic.</p><p>These findings were released today by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in the report <em>2007 AIDS Epidemic Update.</em></p><h4>Continuing improvements to latest estimates</h4><p>The new report reflects improved and expanded epidemiological data and analyses that present a better understanding of the global epidemic. These new data and advances in methodology have resulted in substantial revisions from previous estimates.</p><p>While the global prevalence of HIV infection—the percentage of people infected with HIV— has levelled off, the total number of people living with HIV is increasing because of ongoing acquisition of HIV infection, combined with longer survival times, in a continuously growing general population.</p><p>Global HIV incidence—the number of new HIV infections per year—is now estimated to have peaked in the late 1990s at over 3 million [2.4 – 5.1 million] new infections per year, and is estimated in 2007 to be 2.5 million [1.8 – 4.1 million] new infections, an average of more than 6 800 new infections each day. This reflects natural trends in the epidemic, as well as the result of HIV prevention efforts.</p><p>The number of people dying from AIDS-related illnesses has declined in the last two years, due in part to the life prolonging effects of antiretroviral therapy. AIDS is among the leading causes of death globally and remains the primary cause of death in Africa.</p><p>“These improved data present us with a clearer picture of the AIDS epidemic, one that reveals both challenges and opportunities,” said UNAIDS Executive Director Dr Peter Piot. “Unquestionably, we are beginning to see a return on investment—new HIV infections and mortality are declining and the prevalence of HIV levelling. But with more than 6 800 new infections and over 5 700 deaths each day due to AIDS we must expand our efforts in order to significantly reduce the impact of AIDS worldwide.”</p><h4>Revision of estimates</h4><p>UNAIDS, WHO and the Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections have recently undertaken the most comprehensive review of their methodologies and monitoring systems since 2001. The epidemic estimates presented in this year’s report reflect improvements in country data collection and analysis, as well as a better understanding of the natural history and distribution of HIV infection. This information is vital in helping countries understand their epidemics and respond to them more effectively.</p><p>UNAIDS and WHO are now working with better information from many more countries. In the past few years a number of countries, most notably in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, have expanded and improved their HIV surveillance systems, conducting new, more accurate studies that provide more precise information about HIV prevalence than earlier studies. In addition, 30 countries mostly in Africa have conducted national representative population-based household surveys. These have also informed adjustments for other countries with similar epidemics that have not conducted these surveys. New assumptions have also been made as a result of a better understanding of the natural history of untreated HIV infection.</p><p>The current estimate of 33.2 million [30.6 – 36.1 million] people living with HIV replaces the 2006 estimate of 39.5 million [24.5 – 47.1 million]. Applying the improved methodology retrospectively to the 2006 data, the 2007 report revises that figure, now estimating that in 2006 there were 32.7 million [30.2 – 35.3 million] people living with HIV. The single biggest reason for the reduction in global HIV prevalence figures in the past year was the recent revision of estimates in India after an intensive reassessment of the epidemic in that country. The revised estimates for India, combined with important revisions of estimates in five sub- Saharan African countries (Angola, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe) account for 70% of the reduction in HIV prevalence as compared to 2006 estimates.</p><p>\"Reliable public health data are the essential foundation for an effective response to HIV/AIDS\", said WHO's HIV/AIDS Director Dr Kevin De Cock. \"While these new estimates are of better quality than those of the past, we need to continue investing more in all countries and all aspects of strategic information relating to health.\"</p><p>\"The data for measuring the HIV epidemic used by UNAIDS/WHO has considerably expanded and improved in recent years,” said Ron Brookmeyer, Professor of Biostatistics and Chair of the Master of Public Health Program, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Nevertheless, there is a need to further improve the representativeness of the underlying data. There is a need to expand disease surveillance systems to better track the sub-epidemics in risk populations within each country.\"</p><p>\"More accurate estimates and trends will ultimately lead to improvements in the design and evaluation of prevention programmes,\" added Professor Brookmeyer, who was also the Chair of the Independent Review Panel at the recent International Consultation on epidemiological estimates convened by UNAIDS and WHO.</p><p>UNAIDS and WHO will continue to update their methodology as new data becomes available from research studies and surveillance data from countries.</p><h4>Progress seen but more needs to be done</h4><p>HIV prevalence among young pregnant women (15 – 24) attending antenatal clinics has declined since 2000/2001 in 11 of the15 most-affected countries. Preliminary data also show favourable changes in risk behaviour among young people in a number of countries, (Botswana, Cameroon, Chad, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Togo, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). These trends suggest that prevention efforts are having an impact in several of the most affected countries.</p><p>In sub-Saharan Africa, continued treatment scale-up and HIV prevention efforts are also bringing results in some countries, but mortality from AIDS remains high in Africa due to the extensive unmet treatment need. Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya and Zimbabwe, among others, have all seen downward trends in their national prevalence. Beyond sub-Saharan Africa, declines in new HIV infections have also occurred in South and South-East Asia, notably in Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand.</p><p>There is a need to adapt and revive HIV prevention efforts as some countries are seeing a reversal of declining trends. Burundi’s declining trend from the late 1990’s did not continue beyond 2005 and HIV prevalence started to increase again at most surveillance sites. Despite achievements in reversing the epidemic in Thailand, HIV prevalence is rising among men who have sex with men and has remained high among injecting drug users over the past 15 years, ranging between 30% to 50%.</p><p>UNAIDS and WHO officials point out that the new estimates do not change the need for immediate action and increased funding to scale up towards universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services.</p>",

Scientists have recently discovered they can reduce the amount of antigen used to produce pandemic influenza vaccines by using water-in-oil substances that enhance the immune response.The progress was reported Friday at the first meeting of a WHO Advisory Group on pandemic influenza vaccine production and supply.The Global Action Plan Advisory Group, an independent, international committee of 10 members, met at WHO headquarters one year after eight new strategies to increase pandemic influenza vaccine were identified and published in the WHO Global pandemic influenza action plan to increase vaccine supply.At the Advisory Group meeting, other progress on the Global Action Plan was discussed. WHO reported it is setting up a training hub that would serve as a source of technology transfer to developing countries.The Advisory Group also discussed a new business plan which assessed options for further increasing vaccine production capacity and reviewed priority next steps. The three most valuable options include continuing to promote seasonal influenza vaccine programmes, supporting the industry to sustain production capacity beyond seasonal demand and enabling some vaccine production facilities to change, at the onset of a pandemic, from producing inactivated vaccines to live attenuated vaccines. Due to the higher yields obtained with live attenuated influenza vaccine technology, facility conversion could, by 2012, bridge the expected supply-demand gap and produce enough vaccine to protect the global population within six months of the declaration of a pandemic.",

At its heart is a checklist of age-friendly features. For example, an age-friendly city has sufficient public benches that are well-situated, well-maintained and safe, as well as sufficient public toilets that are clean, secure, accessible by people with disabilities and well-indicated. Other key features of an age-friendly city include:</p><ul><li>well-maintained and well-lit sidewalks;</li><li>public buildings that are fully accessible to people with disabilities;</li><li>city bus drivers who wait until older people are seated before starting off and priority seating on buses;</li><li>enough reserved parking spots for people with disabilities;</li><li>housing integrated in the community that accommodates changing needs and abilities as people grow older;</li><li>friendly, personalized service and information instead of automated answering services;</li><li>easy-to-read written information in plain language;</li><li>public and commercial services and stores in neighbourhoods close to where people live, rather than concentrated outside the city; and</li><li>a civic culture that respects and includes older persons.</li></ul><p>The growing proportion of older people in our population is an established trend. Their share in the global population is predicted to double from 11% in 2006 to 22% in 2050. At the same time, our world is growing increasingly urban: as of 2007, more than half of the global population are urban dwellers and by 2030 about three out of every five people in the world are expected to live in cities.</p><p>These trends are occurring at a much faster rate in the developing world: currently, the number of older people in developing countries is about twice the number in developed countries. By 2050, some 80% of the older people will be living in less developed regions.</p><p>\"Older people are concentrated in cities and will become even more so,\" said Dr Alex Kalache, Director of the WHO Ageing and Life Course Programme. \"Today around 75% of all older people living in the developed world are urban dwellers - expected to increase to 80% in 2015. More spectacularly, in developing countries the number of older people in cities will increase from 56 million in 2000 to over 908 million in 2050.\"</p><p>The guide is already being used in several parts of the world to initiate age-friendly city development.

      "description": "WHO today releases the first guide on age-friendly cities. The guide, which is based on consultations with older people in 33 cities in 22 countries, has identified the key physical, social and services attributes of age-friendly urban settings. Istanbul, London, Melbourne, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Shanghai, and Tokyo were part of the consultation along with many other regional centres and towns.The publication titled Global age-friendly cities: a guide is being launched in London and in Geneva on the occasion of International Day of Older Persons. Other events will take place over the next 10 days in Buenos Aires, New York and Rio de Janeiro. Cities that collaborated in the consultation are planning to address the barriers that have been identified and many others want to adopt the guide. Led by New York, other cities are exploring what makes cities more age-friendly for increasing older migrant populations.\"Age-friendly cities benefit people of all ages, not just older people, and WHO is committed to disseminating and promoting the implementation of the guide worldwide,\" said Mrs Daisy Mafubelu, WHO Assistant Director-General for Family and Community Health.Aimed at urban plannersThe guide is aimed primarily at urban planners, but older citizens can use it to monitor progress towards more age-friendly cities. At its heart is a checklist of age-friendly features. For example, an age-friendly city has sufficient public benches that are well-situated, well-maintained and safe, as well as sufficient public toilets that are clean, secure, accessible by people with disabilities and well-indicated. Other key features of an age-friendly city include:well-maintained and well-lit sidewalks;public buildings that are fully accessible to people with disabilities;city bus drivers who wait until older people are seated before starting off and priority seating on buses;enough reserved parking spots for people with disabilities;housing integrated in the community that accommodates changing needs and abilities as people grow older;friendly, personalized service and information instead of automated answering services;easy-to-read written information in plain language;public and commercial services and stores in neighbourhoods close to where people live, rather than concentrated outside the city; anda civic culture that respects and includes older persons.The growing proportion of older people in our population is an established trend. Their share in the global population is predicted to double from 11% in 2006 to 22% in 2050. At the same time, our world is growing increasingly urban: as of 2007, more than half of the global population are urban dwellers and by 2030 about three out of every five people in the world are expected to live in cities.These trends are occurring at a much faster rate in the developing world: currently, the number of older people in developing countries is about twice the number in developed countries. By 2050, some 80% of the older people will be living in less developed regions.\"Older people are concentrated in cities and will become even more so,\" said Dr Alex Kalache, Director of the WHO Ageing and Life Course Programme. \"Today around 75% of all older people living in the developed world are urban dwellers - expected to increase to 80% in 2015.

In the case of children, even more factors come into play. The main challenge is the lack of clinical data. This results in fewer medicines being developed, produced and marketed specifically for children. Often, children are given medicines that have only been tested in adults and are not officially approved for use in child populations (this is known as \"off-label use\").</p><p>Non-availability of appropriate paediatric formulations forces health care providers to resort to administering portions of crushed or dissolved tablets or the powder contained inside a capsule without any specific indication of the required dosage. For that reason, according to the report, potentially harmful medication errors may be three times more common in children than in adults.</p><p>An appropriate format or structure for a child's medicine is also important. Small children sometimes choke or asphyxiate while trying to swallow big tablets. For instance, earlier this year four children under 36 months died from choking on albendazole tablets (used to combat worms) during a de-worming campaign in Ethiopia.</p><p>New and innovative medicines on the market provide indications for children but still lack evidence of long-term benefit and risk. Side effects associated with antiretroviral medicines, for example, have been reported to occur in up to 30% of HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy. Most of those side effects could be reversed by modifying the dosage or changing to an alternative medicine.</p><p>The report estimates that less than 10% of all serious adverse reactions to medicines are reported globally. In part, this is due to the fact that many developing countries have not yet established medicine safety monitoring and reporting systems; and when they have these are usually under-resourced. Because children - particularly very young ones - are less articulate in describing symptoms and their non-verbal communication is often misunderstood or ignored, even serious adverse reactions in children often go unreported to health practitioners or authorities.</p><p>Intended for policy-makers, manufacturers, medicines control bodies and researchers, <em>Promoting safety of medicines for children</em> provides a series of recommendations to address medicine safety for children.</p><p>For instance, all countries should establish national and regional monitoring systems for the detection of serious adverse medicine reactions and medical errors in children. When such reporting systems exist, it is crucial that manufacturers follow up on adverse reactions to their products once they are on the market.</p><p>In addition, regulatory authorities need to make an effort to refine the science of clinical trials in children, create an active post-marketing surveillance programme and develop public databases of up to date information about efficacy and safety in paediatric medicines.</p><p>To assist countries, WHO will:</p><ul><li>publish an official WHO List of Essential Medicines for Children;</li><li>continue to create awareness in countries and in the research community on the urgent need to monitor the use of medicines in children;</li><li>identify research gaps in children's medicines; and</li><li>create protocols on monitoring adverse effects for child-specific medicines.</li></ul><h5>Note for editors/reporters</h5><p>To ensure that a medicine works and that its adverse effects are limited, pharmaceutical companies are required by law in most countries to have tested their medicines in healthy volunteers and patients before making them widely available. The trials need to be approved by ethics committees and competent regulatory authorities. Volunteers must be made aware of the risks involved in the trials and must give their informed consent. However, ethical and regulatory approvals are much stricter for children and there is also the problem of obtaining informed consent from children and/or their carers. This results in fewer clinical trials conducted on children than on adults.</p><p>Clinical trials generally do tell a good deal about how well a medicine works for a defined disease and what potential harm it may cause. But they provide no information for populations with different characteristics from the trial group, such as age, gender, state of health, co-treatment with other medicines and ethnic origin.</p><p>Therefore, for many medicines, and particularly new, complex products, safety monitoring does not stop after launching the product; it must be followed by careful patient monitoring and by further scientific data collection.</p><p>WHO promotes medicine safety through its International Drug Monitoring Programme, which began to operate in 1968. Initially a pilot project in 10 countries with established national reporting systems for adverse reactions to medicines, the network has expanded significantly as more countries worldwide develop national pharmacovigilance centres. Currently, over 100 countries participate in the programme.</p><p> </p>",

Most of those side effects could be reversed by modifying the dosage or changing to an alternative medicine.",
          "The report estimates that less than 10% of all serious adverse reactions to medicines are reported globally. In part, this is due to the fact that many developing countries have not yet established medicine safety monitoring and reporting systems; and when they have these are usually under-resourced. Because children - particularly very young ones - are less articulate in describing symptoms and their non-verbal communication is often misunderstood or ignored, even serious adverse reactions in children often go unreported to health practitioners or authorities.",

          "For instance, all countries should establish national and regional monitoring systems for the detection of serious adverse medicine reactions and medical errors in children. When such reporting systems exist, it is crucial that manufacturers follow up on adverse reactions to their products once they are on the market.",
          "In addition, regulatory authorities need to make an effort to refine the science of clinical trials in children, create an active post-marketing surveillance programme and develop public databases of up to date information about efficacy and safety in paediatric medicines.",
          "To assist countries, WHO will:",

          "To ensure that a medicine works and that its adverse effects are limited, pharmaceutical companies are required by law in most countries to have tested their medicines in healthy volunteers and patients before making them widely available. The trials need to be approved by ethics committees and competent regulatory authorities. Volunteers must be made aware of the risks involved in the trials and must give their informed consent. However, ethical and regulatory approvals are much stricter for children and there is also the problem of obtaining informed consent from children and/or their carers. This results in fewer clinical trials conducted on children than on adults.",

      "description": "The lack of thorough and reliable clinical data on the way medicines affect children requires strengthened safety monitoring and vigilance of medicinal products. This is the fundamental message of Promoting safety of medicines for children, released today by the World Health Organization (WHO).The publication gives an overview of the problem and offers solutions on how best to address side effects from medicines in children; namely, through improved reporting systems and collaboration between governments, regulatory authorities, research institutions and the pharmaceutical industry. The publication is part of a broad effort WHO is initiating to expand children's access to quality-assured, safe and effective medicines.\"We need to learn more about the way children's bodies react to medicines so we can improve global child health. That's why it's extremely important to keep track of potential side effects in child populations. Ultimately, this will save lives and build up a knowledge base for the future,\" said Dr Howard Zucker, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Technology and Pharmaceuticals.A large proportion of side effects or adverse reactions to medicines in the adult population are due to irrational use or human error and are therefore preventable. In the case of children, even more factors come into play. The main challenge is the lack of clinical data. This results in fewer medicines being developed, produced and marketed specifically for children. Often, children are given medicines that have only been tested in adults and are not officially approved for use in child populations (this is known as \"off-label use\").Non-availability of appropriate paediatric formulations forces health care providers to resort to administering portions of crushed or dissolved tablets or the powder contained inside a capsule without any specific indication of the required dosage. For that reason, according to the report, potentially harmful medication errors may be three times more common in children than in adults.An appropriate format or structure for a child's medicine is also important.

Demonstration projects in Mexico and Viet Nam will help significantly decrease the death, injury and disability resulting from road traffic crashes - an area of public health which has been underfunded in the past.</p><p>Road traffic crashes kill nearly 1.2 million people annually and injure up to 50 million more, with the majority of deaths and injuries occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death globally for 10-to-24 year-olds. Most of these young lives are lost while walking, riding on their bicycles or motorcycles, or using public transport.</p><p>In addition to the human suffering they cause, road traffic crashes place a huge burden on national economies; their cost in low- and middle-income countries amounts to more than the annual development assistance the countries receive. Unless action is taken, the number of road traffic injuries and deaths is likely to get worse in most regions of the world as motorization increases; road traffic injuries are predicted to be the eighth leading cause of death by 2030.</p><p>The new initiative for road traffic injury prevention will provide US$ 9 million to WHO over the next two years to implement some of the practical measures that have resulted in a sharp decline in road traffic deaths and injuries in many countries. Prevention programmes will be piloted in Mexico and Viet Nam, with a focus on increasing the use of motorcycle helmets, seat-belts and child restraints; reducing drink-driving; and improving the visibility of pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists.</p><p>Strategies used will include building capacity for law-makers and public health officials, training the police to improve enforcement of legislation and supporting nongovernmental organizations in their prevention work. There will be a focus on increasing public awareness of road traffic injuries and their prevention, as well as on providing incentives to encourage the use of protective measures, such as helmets and child restraints.</p><p>Implementing such broad-based road safety initiatives in these two countries has the potential to save many lives: in addition, by working in two pilot countries to test the effects of intensive road safety programmes, there are likely to be spill-over effects with an impact on other countries facing similar road safety concerns in the two regions.</p><p>The new funding also provides support for a global road safety report describing on a country-by-country basis the situation based on a standard list of items, such as crash incidence; existence of legislation on seat-belts, motorcycle helmets, speed and blood alcohol concentration; seat-belt and motorcycle helmet-wearing rates; and the existence of a national plan of action on road safety. Data will be collected in countries through governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations and academic institutions. The report will serve as a useful tool in advocating for increased focus and investment on road safety at both national and international levels.</p><p>WHO acknowledges with thanks the importance of this gift from the Bloomberg Family Foundation and the potential of the planned initiative to save lives. With this support, WHO is enabled to accelerate its assistance to countries to enhance their road safety work, in particular to implement the recommendations of the 2004 <em>World report on road traffic injury prevention.</em></p><p> </p>",

These estimates are more accurate than those of previous years, as they are based on an expanded surveillance system and a revised and enhanced methodology.",
    "content_html": "<p>The new 2006 estimates released today by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), supported by UNAIDS and WHO, indicate that national adult HIV prevalence in India is approximately 0.36%, which corresponds to an estimated 2 million to 3.1 million people living with HIV in the country. These estimates are more accurate than those of previous years, as they are based on an expanded surveillance system and a revised and enhanced methodology.</p>\n<p>As part of its continuing effort to know its epidemic better, the Indian Government has greatly expanded and improved its surveillance system in recent years and increased the number of population groups covered. In 2006, the government created 400 new sentinel surveillance sites and facilitated National Family Health Survey-3, which is a population-based survey.</p>\n<p>Launching the third phase of the National Programme, Dr Anbumani Ramadoss, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare said, “Revision of estimates based on more data and improved methodology marks a significant improvement in systems and capabilities to monitor the spread of HIV, a sign of the progress we have made in understanding the epidemic better. This is welcome progress. Unfortunately, the new figures still point towards a serious epidemic with potential to expand if the prevention efforts identified in the NACP III are not scaled up rapidly and implemented in the desired manner. We must remember that India has nearly 3 million people living with HIV. These are people facing stigma, discrimination and irrational prejudice everyday of their lives and need all our support and understanding.” The Minister called upon his colleagues in the medical profession and civil society organizations to fight stigma and discrimination.</p>\n<p>Resulting from a more robust and enhanced methodology, the revised estimates will be used to improve planning for prevention, care and treatment efforts. “While it is good news that the total number of HIV infections is lower than previously thought, we cannot be complacent. The steady and slow spread of the HIV infection is a worrying factor. The better understanding of India’s epidemic has certainly enabled us to have more focused HIV prevention and treatment strategies and more effective deployment of resources,” said Mr Naresh Dayal, Secretary of Health and Chair of the National AIDS Control Board.</p>\n<p>The new methods developed for the revised estimates have also been used to “back-calculate” the prevalence for years since 2002 based on the new set of assumptions and measures. These figures allow a fair comparison of year-on-year trends in HIV prevalence. They show an epidemic that is stable over time with marginal decline in 2006.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the new estimates and guarding against their misinterpretation, Sujatha Rao, Additional Secretary and Director General, National AIDS Control Organization said, “The calculation of figures for several years using the new model helps us understand that the new lower estimates do not mean a sharp decline in the epidemic.” Cautioning against an easing-off the momentum of the HIV response she added, “Using a similar methodology led to downward revision in estimates in some countries such as Zambia and Rwanda. We will convince all stakeholders to stay energized and to retain the hard-fought gains of the last decade.”</p>\n<p>Showing confidence in the commitment of the Indian leadership, Dr Denis Broun, UNAIDS Country Coordinator said, “The trends evident from the latest estimates validate India’s national AIDS strategy. Taking encouragement from the new lower estimates, the national authorities should increase the strength of their HIV programmes. We must scale up efforts to reach universal access to HIV prevention, care and treatment. Though the proportion of people living with HIV is lower than previously estimated, India’s epidemic continues to be substantial in numbers. Despite the lower prevalence estimate, the cost of prevention efforts required to control the epidemic remains the same.”</p>\n<p>WHO Representative, Dr Salim Habayeb commended the vision of the Government of India in the last 15 years for addressing the HIV epidemic. He also commended the efforts of the states, civil society, partner agencies as well as the valuable role of the media in facilitating the creation of an enabling environment. “The HIV burden remains substantial.

      "description": "The new 2006 estimates released today by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), supported by UNAIDS and WHO, indicate that national adult HIV prevalence in India is approximately 0.36%, which corresponds to an estimated 2 million to 3.1 million people living with HIV in the country. These estimates are more accurate than those of previous years, as they are based on an expanded surveillance system and a revised and enhanced methodology.As part of its continuing effort to know its epidemic better, the Indian Government has greatly expanded and improved its surveillance system in recent years and increased the number of population groups covered. In 2006, the government created 400 new sentinel surveillance sites and facilitated National Family Health Survey-3, which is a population-based survey.Launching the third phase of the National Programme, Dr Anbumani Ramadoss, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare said, “Revision of estimates based on more data and improved methodology marks a significant improvement in systems and capabilities to monitor the spread of HIV, a sign of the progress we have made in understanding the epidemic better. This is welcome progress. Unfortunately, the new figures still point towards a serious epidemic with potential to expand if the prevention efforts identified in the NACP III are not scaled up rapidly and implemented in the desired manner. We must remember that India has nearly 3 million people living with HIV. These are people facing stigma, discrimination and irrational prejudice everyday of their lives and need all our support and understanding.” The Minister called upon his colleagues in the medical profession and civil society organizations to fight stigma and discrimination.Resulting from a more robust and enhanced methodology, the revised estimates will be used to improve planning for prevention, care and treatment efforts. “While it is good news that the total number of HIV infections is lower than previously thought, we cannot be complacent. The steady and slow spread of the HIV infection is a worrying factor. The better understanding of India’s epidemic has certainly enabled us to have more focused HIV prevention and treatment strategies and more effective deployment of resources,” said Mr Naresh Dayal, Secretary of Health and Chair of the National AIDS Control Board.The new methods developed for the revised estimates have also been used to “back-calculate” the prevalence for years since 2002 based on the new set of assumptions and measures. These figures allow a fair comparison of year-on-year trends in HIV prevalence. They show an epidemic that is stable over time with marginal decline in 2006.Commenting on the new estimates and guarding against their misinterpretation, Sujatha Rao, Additional Secretary and Director General, National AIDS Control Organization said, “The calculation of figures for several years using the new model helps us understand that the new lower estimates do not mean a sharp decline in the epidemic.” Cautioning against an easing-off the momentum of the HIV response she added, “Using a similar methodology led to downward revision in estimates in some countries such as Zambia and Rwanda. We will convince all stakeholders to stay energized and to retain the hard-fought gains of the last decade.”Showing confidence in the commitment of the Indian leadership, Dr Denis Broun, UNAIDS Country Coordinator said, “The trends evident from the latest estimates validate India’s national AIDS strategy. Taking encouragement from the new lower estimates, the national authorities should increase the strength of their HIV programmes. We must scale up efforts to reach universal access to HIV prevention, care and treatment. Though the proportion of people living with HIV is lower than previously estimated, India’s epidemic continues to be substantial in numbers. Despite the lower prevalence estimate, the cost of prevention efforts required to control the epidemic remains the same.”WHO Representative, Dr Salim Habayeb commended the vision of the Government of India in the last 15 years for addressing the HIV epidemic. He also commended the efforts of the states, civil society, partner agencies as well as the valuable role of the media in facilitating the creation of an enabling environment. “The HIV burden remains substantial. India’s efforts, especially those in prevention, are noteworthy and should be further scaled up along with provision of universal access to treatment for those who need it.”HIV prevalence shows signs of slight decline among general populationWhile overall the HIV epidemic shows a stable trend in the recent years, there is variation between states and population groups. The good news is that in Tamil Nadu and other southern states with a high HIV burden, where effective interventions have been in place for several years, HIV prevalence has begun to decline or stabilize.New pockets of high HIV prevalence identifiedHIV continues to emerge in new areas.

The strategy is designed to answer key questions about the treatment and control of Chagas disease, and to coordinate global efforts towards the prevention of transmission through a new Global Network for Chagas Elimination.</p><p>\"The establishment of the WHO Global Network to combat Chagas disease occurs in the broader context of the WHO’s renewed fight against neglected tropical diseases. The prospects for reducing the burden caused by these diseases have changed dramatically in the past few years. While Chagas disease is controlled in many countries in the Americas, commitment must be strengthened as elimination of the disease is now attainable. Cases identified in non-endemic countries have demonstrated the need to globalize our efforts,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General.</p><p>Chagas disease is a serious, potentially life-threatening illness caused by a protozoan parasite called <em>T. cruzi</em>. Early symptoms can include fever, fatigue, swollen glands and heart pain, but in later years the infection can lead to chronic debilitation caused by progressive destruction of the heart muscle. It occurs mainly in Latin America where, during the 1980s, over 20 million people were thought to be infected. Since then, Latin American countries have made enormous efforts to control the infection, such that current estimates suggest that less than 8 million people remain infected. However, the infection is no longer confined to the Americas because of blood transmission and organ transplantation. Cases have been identified in non-endemic countries in Europe, and in Canada and the United States.</p><h4>Remarkable success</h4><p>\"Remarkable success has been achieved in the WHO Region of the Americas in eliminating vectorial transmission of Chagas. Much remains to be done, however, to reduce the risk of transmission to recipients of blood or blood products obtained from migrants from Chagas endemic areas, and to ensure screening and diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease,” said Dr Mirta Roses, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and Regional Director of the WHO Americas Region. PAHO has worked with the countries on sub-regional initiatives to prevent, control and treat Chagas with key partners, including Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Agence Canadienne de Développement International (ACDI), Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional (AECI), Médecins sans Frontières (MSF), and International Development Research Centre (IDRC).</p><p>\"PAHO's successes in Chagas control are a significant contribution to the global strategy to eliminate this debilitating disease,\" said Dr David L.

But the parasite can also be transmitted by blood transfusion or organ transplant from infected donors, and occasionally by transplacental passage from infected mother to new-born baby. In some regions, particularly in the southern cone countries of South America, the chronic infection can also give rise to severe intestinal problems requiring complex corrective surgery.</p><p>Comprised of technical groups of experts, the WHO Global Network for Chagas Elimination will focus on several key aspects of the Chagas problem including:</p><ul><li>strengthening epidemiological surveillance and information systems;</li><li>preventing transmission by blood transfusion and organ transplantation in endemic and non-endemic countries;</li><li>identifying a diagnostic test(s) for screening and diagnosis of infections;</li><li>expanding secondary prevention of congenital transmission and case management of congenital and non-congenital infections; and</li><li>promoting a consensus on adequate case management.</li></ul><p>In keeping with the goal of eliminating Chagas disease by 2010, the network will develop a five-pillar strategy before the end of this year.

      "description": "New measures to ensure safer powdered infant formulae and hygienic egg production will be discussed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), which opens a six-day meeting today attended by representatives from more than 100 countries.The commission, in its annual session, is considering the adoption of several food safety and quality standards that countries depend on to safeguard the health of consumers, improve food quality and ensure fair practices in food trade. The commission is a body jointly set up by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and WHO.More nutritious infant formulaCodex will reconsider the 1981 standard on infant formulae, which was based on scientific knowledge from the 1970s.The revised standard for infant formulae and those for special medical purposes is based on the latest scientific understanding of the composition of breast milk.“It is important to support breastfeeding and promote its benefits to infants and young children,\" said Dr Jorgen Schlundt, director of the WHO department of food safety, zoonoses and food-borne diseases. \"However, in some instances, breastfeeding is either not possible or not appropriate. In these cases, one of the dietary options is the use of powdered formulae”.“Powdered infant formula is not a sterile product and can be contaminated with life threatening bacteria,” said Dr Schlundt. “It is extremely important that these formulae are safe and properly labelled. The proposed standard will help save many infant lives in countries around the world.”Eggs and egg productsThe commission will also be looking at a revised code of hygienic practice for eggs and egg products. They are a major source of food for people in all countries and there is significant international trade in these products.However, eggs and egg products are a significant contributor to salmonellosis - a major food borne disease worldwide. Adoption of the revised code would improve countries' capacity to produce safer product.Making wine saferAnother draft code up for adoption would prevent or reduce Ochratoxin A contamination in wine. Ochratoxin A is a mycotoxin known to be toxic to the kidneys. The code would address all measures that have been proven to prevent and reduce contamination of wine across the production chain.Regional Codex standardsThe meeting will also consider new quality standards for three regional food products from the Middle East. Draft codes would, if adopted, set standards for canned tehina, a sesame seed paste, and hummus with tehina - a sesame seed and chickpea mixture common throughout the region. Another standard would apply to canned ful medammes, a popular broad-bean dish.Technical assistanceThe FAO/WHO Codex Trust Fund supported some 34 developing countries to attend the Codex Commission.\"FAO and WHO supports the efforts of developing countries to strengthen their national food safety systems to protect local consumers and to take advantage of international food trade opportunities.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a blood clot, or thrombus, develops in a deep vein - usually in the lower leg. Symptoms of DVT are principally pain, tenderness and swelling of the affected part. DVT can be detected through medical testing and can be treated. It can be life-threatening when associated with thromboembolism.</p><p>Thromboembolism occurs when a blood clot (from a deep vein thrombosis) in a leg vein breaks off and travels through the body to the lungs where it becomes lodged and blocks blood flow. This is known as pulmonary embolism, and symptoms include chest pain and breathing difficulties. VTE can be treated, but if it is not, it can lead to death.</p><p>The study showed that plane, train, bus or automobile passengers are at higher risk of VTE when they remain seated and immobile on journeys of more than four hours. This is due to a stagnation of blood in the veins caused by prolonged immobility, which can promote blood clot formation in veins.</p><p>One study within the project examining flights in particular found that those taking multiple flights over a short period of time are also at higher risk. This is because the risk of VTE does not go away completely after a flight is over, and the risk remains elevated for about four weeks.</p><h4>Other factors of influence</h4><p>The report shows that a number of other factors increase the risk of VTE during travel, including obesity, being very tall or very short (taller than 1.9 meters or shorter than 1.6 meters), use of oral contraceptives, and inherited blood disorders leading to increased clotting tendency.</p><p>\"The study does confirm that there is an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during travel where the passenger is seated and immobile for over four hours, whether in a plane, train, bus or car.

However, experts recognize that blood circulation can be promoted by exercising the calf muscles with up-and-down movements of the feet at the ankle joints. Moving feet in this manner encourages blood flow in the calf muscle veins, thus reducing blood stagnation.

It is an ambitious plan that must be fully supported if we are to keep a stranglehold on drug-resistant TB,\" said Dr Mario Raviglione, Director of the WHO Stop TB Department.The world first became aware of XDR-TB in March 2006 after researchers reported on an emerging global threat of highly resistant TB strains. Concerns were heightened six months later by a cluster of 'virtually untreatable' XDR-TB cases in an area of South Africa with high prevalence of HIV. All but one of the 53 patients died in an average of 25 days after samples were taken for drug resistance tests. Last month, the case of an air passenger from the United States infected with XDR-TB also focused attention on the need to address the TB epidemic as an immediate international priority.\"A highly important element of the plan is a steady supply of quality drugs to treat MDR-TB and XDR-TB in underserved countries,\" said Dr Marcos Espinal, Executive Secretary of the Stop TB Partnership. \"The Partnership's Global Drug Facility is ensuring supply of these drugs to a growing number of countries, after our Green Light Committee has verified that applicant countries meet its technical standards and will use the drugs correctly.\"The Global MDR-TB and XDR-TB Response Plan 2007-2008 details activities to be carried out in all six WHO regions. Its eight main objectives are those recommended by the WHO Global Task Force on XDR-TB, which met in October 2006.The total budget for the two-year plan is US$ 2.15 billion, of which 80% is for country-specific needs. US$ 102 million is for essential support functions to fight TB drug resistance by international partners, including WHO and the Stop TB Partnership, at global, regional and national levels.Note to editorsMDR-TB is a form of TB that does not respond to the standard treatments and is defined as TB resistant to the main first-line drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. There are an estimated 424 000 new cases of MDR-TB every year. Multidrug resistance emerges when there is mismanagement of drugs and under-investment in quality TB control. It can also be spread from one person to another. The cost of treating MDR-TB can be 1000 times more than treating standard TB.XDR-TB occurs when there is resistance to all of the most effective anti-TB drugs, and is defined as TB with MDR-TB resistance as well as resistance to any one of the fluoroquinolone drugs and to at least one of the three injectable second-line drugs, amikacin, capromycin and kanamycin. Extensive drug resistance emerges through mismanagement of MDR-TB and can also spread from one person to another. There are an estimated 25 000 to 30 000 new cases of XDR-TB every year. So far, 37 countries have confirmed cases of XDR-TB.",

      "description": "The revised International Health Regulations (IHR) enter into force on Friday, 15 June. The Regulations consist of a comprehensive and tested set of rules and procedures which will help to make the world more secure from threats to global health. They were agreed by the World Health Assembly in 2005 and represent a major step forward in international public health security.The Regulations establish an agreed framework of commitments and responsibilities for States and for WHO to invest in limiting the international spread of epidemics and other public health emergencies while minimizing disruption to travel, trade and economies. Under the revised IHR, States will be required to report all events that could result in public health emergencies of international concern, including those caused by chemical agents, radioactive materials and contaminated food.In the early 21st Century, demographic, economic and environmental pressures have created a unique combination of conditions that allow new and re-emerging infectious diseases to spread as never before. The experience of recent decades shows that no individual country can protect itself from diseases and other public health threats. All countries are vulnerable to the spread of pathogens and their economic, political and social impact.The emergence of SARS in 2003 demonstrated as no previous disease outbreak ever had how interconnected the world has become and how rapidly a new disease can spread. This shared vulnerability has also created a need for collective defences and for shared responsibility in making these defences work. This is the underlying principle of the International Health Regulations.\"SARS was a wake-up call for all of us. It spread faster than we had predicted and was only contained through intensive cooperation between countries which prevented this new disease from gaining a foothold,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization. \"Today, the greatest threat to international public health security would be an influenza pandemic. The threat of a pandemic has not receded, but implementation of the IHR will help the world to be better prepared for the possibility of a pandemic.\"The Regulations build on the recent experience of WHO and its partners in responding to and containing disease outbreaks. Recent experience shows that addressing public health threats at their source is the most effective way to reduce their potential to spread internationally. The Regulations will help to ensure that outbreaks and other public health emergencies of international concern are detected and investigated more rapidly and that collective international action is taken to support affected States to contain the emergency, save lives and prevent its spread.WHO has already developed and built an improved events management system to manage potential public health emergencies. WHO has also built strategic operations centres at its Geneva Headquarters and in Regional Offices around the world, which are available round-the-clock to manage emergencies. WHO has also been working with its partners to strengthen the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), which brings together experts from around the world to respond to disease outbreaks.\"Implementing the IHR is a collective responsibility and depends on the capacity of all countries to fulfil the new requirements,\" said Dr David Heymann, WHO Assistant Director-General for Communicable Diseases. \"WHO will help countries to strengthen the necessary capacities to fully implement the Regulations. This is our responsibility and we expect that the entire international community is committed to the same goal of improving international public health security.\"WHO exercise to test global systemOn Friday, WHO will hold the first exercise to sharpen its preparedness under the terms of the revised International Health Regulations. The exercise will verify new procedures for receiving, analysing and responding to information about potential public health emergencies. It will also ensure the effectiveness of policy direction and coordination, information management and risk assessment capacity and communications between the Regional and Country Offices and Headquarters of WHO.The exercise is the first of a series meant to test and improve the mechanisms in place in and between Member States and at different levels of WHO.Note to editors/reporters: The revised IHR requirementsNotification. Greater openness demanded by a world in which serious disease events are increasingly visible.The Regulations recognize that media and other unofficial reports often appear in advance of official notification of a public health emergency of international concern. To expedite the flow of timely and accurate information, countries are required to notify all events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within 24 hours of assessment.Designation of National IHR Focal Points: world on 24-hour alert.Under the IHR every country is required to designate a National IHR Focal Point, charged with providing to and receiving information from WHO on a 24 hour basis, seven days a week.Establishment of core public health capacities to maximize surveillance and response.Under the IHR, each country is committed to develop and maintain core public health capacities for surveillance and response. These capacities also include outbreaks of chemical, radiological and food origin. States are required to establish such core capacities as soon as possible, with a deadline of five years after entry into force of the revised IHR.New recognized rights for international travellers.The IHR for the first time include express requirements that international travellers be treated with respect for their dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms when health measures are applied. At the same time, they provide for examinations and other health measures as necessary to protect against the international spread of disease.Cross-sectoral international collaboration key to implementing IHR.WHO needs the support of all stakeholders to ensure international public health security. The IHR foster multi-sectoral global partnership to respond collectively in the face of epidemics and other major health emergencies.Threat-specific international programmes to improve international health security.The IHR provide for strengthening existing international disease control programmes, addressing infectious diseases, food safety and environmental safety. These programmes make a vital contribution to the global alert and response system as they allow development of generic and threat-specific capacities.",

The initiative is the beginning of a broader blood safety agenda redefined in Ottawa this week and aims to work towards universal access to safe blood transfusion in support of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).WHO is also releasing data collected from 172 countries on trends in blood donation, access and testing.Globally, more than 500 000 women die each year during pregnancy, childbirth or in the postpartum period – 99% of them in the developing world. About 25% of those deaths are caused by severe bleeding during childbirth, making this the most common cause of maternal mortality.Severe bleeding during delivery or after childbirth contributes to around 34% of maternal deaths in Africa, 31% in Asia and 21% in Latin America and the Caribbean.As pregnant women are one of the main groups of patients requiring blood transfusion in developing countries, together with children they are particularly vulnerable to blood shortages and to HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections through unsafe blood.\"If current trends continue, the world will fail to meet target 5 of the MDGs to reduce maternal mortality,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \"We must do everything we can to improve the chances of women during and after childbirth.\"Key life-saving interventionBlood transfusion has been identified as one of the eight key life-saving interventions in healthcare facilities providing emergency obstetric care. Timely, appropriate and safe blood transfusion during and after labour and delivery can make the difference between life and death for many women and their newborns.The Global Initiative on Safe Blood for Safe Motherhood aims to improve access to safe blood to manage pregnancy-related complications as part of a comprehensive approach to maternal care. This includes good antenatal care, prevention and timely treatment of anaemia, assessment of the need for transfusion and safe blood transfusion given only when really required.WHO will strengthen the capacity of blood banks and district hospitals for improving maternal health through the provision of technical support in the areas of voluntary blood donation, safe blood collection, quality assured testing and best clinical practices. WHO will train clinicians, nurses, technicians and other key health personnel at district level facilities through its regional networks across the world.The lack of access to safe blood for women reflects the general situation in developing countries. Developing countries are home to more than 80% of the world's population, yet they currently represent only 45% of the global blood supply.Out of 80 countries that have donation rates of less than 1% of the population (fewer than 10 donations per thousand people), 79 are in developing regions; it is generally recommended that 1-3% of the population give blood to meet a country's needs.Progress towards safe blood supplyThe WHO survey, conducted in 172 countries covering 95% of the world's population and based on 2004 data, shows that some progress has been made since the beginning of the millennium towards ensuring a safer, more adequate supply of blood.One of the survey's indicators was the implementation of voluntary, unpaid blood donation, which remains a mainstay of WHO recommendations to ensure a safe and sufficient blood supply.In 2004, 50 countries had achieved 100% voluntary unpaid blood donation, compared with 39 countries in 2002. Three of the 11 new countries achieving this are categorized as least developed. More and more countries are moving towards voluntary blood donation. In 2002, 63 countries were collecting less than 25% of their blood from voluntary unpaid donors. By 2004, this had fallen to 46 countries.Testing of blood for major infections such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C is also increasing, although in many countries there are few indicators showing if the testing is carried out according to quality assured procedures.Out of 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 28 countries have yet to establish national quality systems. Of 148 countries (28%) that provided data on screening for transfusion-transmissible infections, 41 were not able to screen the donated blood for one or more of the markers.From 9 to 11 June, Ottawa was the venue for a global consultation organized by WHO with the collaboration and support of the Government of Canada and the Canadian and French blood services. Around 100 experts in transfusion called on governments, international agencies and nongovernmental organizations to work together towards universal access to safe blood transfusion by 2015 in support of the MDGs to reduce maternal and child mortality and prevent the transmission of HIV, hepatitis and other life-threatening infections through unsafe blood and blood products.Note to editors/reportersWhile most countries will celebrate World Blood Donor Day on 14 June, this year's main event is hosted by the Government of Canada. Festivities will take place in Ottawa, in the presence of the Canadian Minister of Health and guests from WHO and other international partners.WHO works with partners internationally and in countries to promote better blood collection practices, 100% voluntary, unpaid blood donation policies, quality assured blood testing and rational use of blood.WHO, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International Society of Blood Transfusion and the International Federation of Blood Donor Organizations joined forces in 2004 to celebrate for the first time World Blood Donor Day — a tribute to voluntary, unpaid blood donors who altruistically give of themselves to improve and save lives. In 2005 the World Health Assembly voted a resolution to make World Blood Donor Day an annual event. Since then, the Day has become a vehicle to launch national and regional awareness and advocacy campaigns to encourage blood donation and safer practices in blood transfusion.Blood safety data are collected biennially by WHO through a comprehensive survey addressed to national governments.",

Testing will take place in Mali, The Gambia, and at least one other African country. An additional clinical study is planned for this summer in India, where the vaccine will be licensed. “Serum Institute of India is dedicated to developing safe, effective, and affordable products for the poorest countries in the world,” said Dr. Cyrus Poonawalla, Chairman of SIIL. “These results confirm and extend the observations made last year in our Phase 1 study in India. The new conjugate vaccine has an excellent safety profile in young children, and it is immunologically superior to the polysaccharide vaccine.”</p><p>A conjugate vaccine joins (or “conjugates”) sugars from the meningococcal bacterium with a protein, which in turn stimulates immune cells. These cells then produce antibodies to meningitis, protecting the individual from infection. A total of 600 toddlers participated in the Phase 2 study. They were enrolled at two clinical sites in Africa: Center for Vaccine Development (CVD)-Mali and the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratories in The Gambia. Dr. Brown Okoko, principal investigator at the MRC site in Basse, said, “The clinical teams at MRC and CVD-Mali identify with the vision, mission, and mandate of the Meningitis Vaccine Project. We are all highly motivated and very proud to be able to contribute to the development of a vaccine that is critically needed in Africa.”</p><p>Dr. Samba Sow, principal investigator at CVD-Mali, said, “Some of the families who participated in the study have lost several members of their family to meningococcal meningitis.

If all continues to go well in testing and during the demonstration study, the new vaccine, which will be priced at about 40 cents per dose, could be introduced in Africa within the next two to three years.”</p><p>Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the thin lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.

The technology to produce RUTFs is relatively simple and could be used in all countries with high levels of severe acute malnutrition.</p><p>The traditional response to severe acute malnutrition has been to refer children to a hospital or specialized in-patient treatment unit, to be fed special milk-based diets. Though this treatment is effective, families may not have easy access to health facilities that could provide such care in the poorest countries where the majority of children with severe acute malnutrition live. In-patient treatment may not be an option for parents who simply cannot leave their homes for several weeks. In addition, severely malnourished children are vulnerable to infections as a result of weak immunity and could be at risk in crowded hospital wards.</p><p>When implemented on a large scale, and properly combined with hospital treatment for children with complications, community-based management of severe acute malnutrition could prevent the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children each year. The approach has already greatly improved survival rates for severely malnourished children in emergencies in such countries as Ethiopia, Malawi, Niger and Sudan. The aim is to expand the approach to reach the larger numbers of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, who live in communities untouched by emergencies.</p><p>Severe acute malnutrition kills at least an estimated one million children each year - an average of one child every thirty seconds. These children are up to 20 times more likely to die than well-nourished children.</p><p>\"The 20 million children under five in the world today who are suffering from severe acute malnutrition urgently need treatment. This integrated approach should provide a new impetus,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \"It is urgent that this approach, along with preventive action, be added to the list of cost-effective interventions being used to improve nutrition and reduce child mortality.\"</p><p>Emphasizing the importance of the three UN agencies partnering in this endeavour, Josette Sheeran, WFP Executive Director, said: \"With this new approach, we have the right product composition to save millions of young lives – this is an example of the new technology and capacity which bring us closer to achieving the first Millennium Development Goal.”</p><p>The community-based approach brings services close to people's homes, so that families can identify children with severe acute malnutrition before the onset of life-threatening complications. Children are treated by health workers with basic oral medication and given a weekly supply of RUTF. Meanwhile, parents learn how to help malnourished children and pinpoint danger signs.</p><p>“Ready-to-use therapeutic foods have proven very effective in addressing severe acute malnutrition in children,” said UNICEF Executive Director and Chair of the SCN, Ann M. Veneman. “Malnutrition plays a part in some 53 per cent of the deaths of children under five years old, so these interventions are an important tool in reducing child mortality.”</p><p>The joint statement stresses the importance of measures including optimal infant and young child feeding, ensuring access to quality foods, improved water and sanitation systems and hygienic practices, and strengthening and improving access to health services.</p>",

Though this treatment is effective, families may not have easy access to health facilities that could provide such care in the poorest countries where the majority of children with severe acute malnutrition live. In-patient treatment may not be an option for parents who simply cannot leave their homes for several weeks. In addition, severely malnourished children are vulnerable to infections as a result of weak immunity and could be at risk in crowded hospital wards.",
          "When implemented on a large scale, and properly combined with hospital treatment for children with complications, community-based management of severe acute malnutrition could prevent the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children each year.

The aim is to expand the approach to reach the larger numbers of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, who live in communities untouched by emergencies.",
          "Severe acute malnutrition kills at least an estimated one million children each year - an average of one child every thirty seconds. These children are up to 20 times more likely to die than well-nourished children.",
          "\"The 20 million children under five in the world today who are suffering from severe acute malnutrition urgently need treatment.

      "description": "An innovative approach is showing progress in addressing severe acute malnutrition, which affects an estimated 20 million children under the age of five worldwide. The approach combines community-based care for severely malnourished children with traditional hospital-based treatment.A statement by the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN) and UNICEF issued today highlights new evidence that about three-quarters of children with severe acute malnutrition – those who have a good appetite and no medical complications – can be treated at home with highly fortified, ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs).These are palatable, soft and crushable nutrient- and energy-rich foods that can be eaten by children over the age of six months without adding water, thereby reducing the risk of bacterial infection. RUTFs provide the nutrients required to treat a severely malnourished child at home, without refrigeration, and even where hygiene conditions are not perfect. The technology to produce RUTFs is relatively simple and could be used in all countries with high levels of severe acute malnutrition.The traditional response to severe acute malnutrition has been to refer children to a hospital or specialized in-patient treatment unit, to be fed special milk-based diets. Though this treatment is effective, families may not have easy access to health facilities that could provide such care in the poorest countries where the majority of children with severe acute malnutrition live.

      "description": "WHO and UNAIDS today issued new guidance on informed, voluntary HIV testing and counselling in the world's health facilities, with a view to significantly increasing access to needed HIV treatment, care, support and prevention services. The new guidance focuses on provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (recommended by health care providers in health facilities).Today, approximately 80% of people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries do not know that they are HIV-positive. Recent surveys in sub-Saharan Africa showed on average just 12% of men and 10% of women have been tested for HIV and received their test results.Increased access to HIV testing and counselling is essential to promoting earlier diagnosis of HIV infection, which in turn can maximize the potential benefits of life-extending treatment and care, and allow people with HIV to receive information and tools to prevent HIV transmission to others.\"Scaling up access to HIV testing and counselling is both a public health and a human rights imperative,\" said WHO HIV/AIDS Director Dr Kevin De Cock. \"We hope that the new guidance will provide an impetus to countries to greatly increase availability of HIV testing services in health care settings, through realistic approaches that both improve access to services and, at the same time, protect the rights of individuals. Without a major increase in HIV testing and counselling in health facilities, universal access to HIV prevention, treatment and care will remain just a noble goal.\"Additional approaches needed to expand accessUntil recently, the primary model for providing HIV testing and counselling has been client-initiated HIV testing and counselling - also known as voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) - in which individuals must actively seek an HIV test at a health or community-based facility. But uptake of client-initiated HIV testing and counselling has been limited by low coverage of services, fear of stigma and discrimination, and the perception by many people - even in high prevalence areas - that they are not at risk.Current evidence also suggests many opportunities to diagnose HIV in clinical settings are being missed, even in places with serious HIV epidemics. While, therefore, expanded access to client-initiated HIV testing and counselling is still necessary, other approaches are also required if coverage of HIV testing and counselling is to increase and, ultimately, universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support is to be achieved.The new WHO/UNAIDS guidance was prepared in light of increasing evidence that provider-initiated testing and counselling can increase uptake of HIV testing, improve access to health services for people living with HIV, and may create new opportunities for HIV prevention. Provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling involves the health care provider specifically recommending an HIV test to patients attending health facilities. In these circumstances, once specific pre-test information has been provided, the HIV test would ordinarily be performed unless the patient declines.Provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling has already been implemented in a range of clinical settings in several low- and middle-income countries, including Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda and Zambia, as well as in pre-natal settings in parts of Canada, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\"If we are going to get ahead of this epidemic, rapidly scaled up HIV treatment and prevention efforts are critical - and increased uptake of HIV testing will be fundamental to making this a reality,\" said Dr Paul De Lay, Director of Monitoring and Evaluation, UNAIDS. \"At the same time, and in all cases of HIV testing and counselling, the 3 Cs - that is consent, confidentiality and counselling - must be respected,\" he added.Guidance tailored to different types of epidemics and health facilitiesThe new WHO/UNAIDS guidance advises that health care providers globally should recommend HIV testing and counselling to all patients who present with conditions that might suggest underlying HIV disease.Additional guidance is tailored to local circumstances. In generalized HIV epidemics1, HIV testing and counselling should be recommended to all patients attending all health facilities, whether or not the patient has symptoms of HIV disease and regardless of the patient's reason for attending the health facility. In concentrated2 and low-level3 HIV epidemics, depending on the epidemiological and social context, countries should consider recommending HIV testing and counselling to all patients in selected health facilities (e.g. antenatal, tuberculosis, sexual health, and health services for most-at-risk populations). The guidance also includes special considerations for HIV testing and counselling for adolescents and children.WHO and UNAIDS recognize that resource and other constraints may prevent immediate implementation of the guidance. The document therefore provides advice about how to prioritize implementation in different types of health facilities.The new guidance builds on previous policy positions of WHO and UNAIDS and responds to a growing demand from countries for more detailed policy and operational advice in this area. Its recommendations were developed following a review of available evidence and a broad consultative process with experts and implementers, including submissions received from over 150 organizations and individuals.Other key recommendationsOther key WHO/UNAIDS recommendations for provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling in health facilities include:All HIV testing must be voluntary, confidential, and undertaken with the patient's consent.Patients have the right to decline the test. They should not be tested for HIV against their will, without their knowledge, without adequate information or without receiving their test results.Pre-test information and post-test counselling remain integral components of the HIV testing process.Patients should receive support to avoid potential negative consequences of knowing and disclosing their HIV status, such as discrimination or violence.Testing must be linked to appropriate HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services.Decisions about HIV testing in health facilities should always be guided by what is in the best interests of the individual patient.Provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling is not, and should not be construed as, an endorsement of coercive or mandatory HIV testing.Implementation of provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling should be undertaken in consultation with key stakeholders, including civil society groups, acknowledging that what works and is ethical will inevitably differ across countries.When implementing provider-initiated HIIV testing and counselling, equal efforts must be made to ensure that a supportive social, policy and legal framework is in place to maximize positive outcomes and minimize potential harms to patients.A system that monitors and evaluates the implementation and scale-up of provider-initiated testing and counselling should be developed and implemented concurrently.As countries work towards universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, the new guidance on provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling offers an important opportunity to introduce new approaches and improve the standards of HIV testing and counselling in both public and private health facilities. Together with their partners, WHO and UNAIDS will continue to help countries expand access to the full range of HIV testing and counselling services, as well as to other needed health sector interventions against HIV/AIDS.1 HIV is firmly established in the general population. Numerical proxy: HIV prevalence consistently over 1% in pregnant women.2 HIV has spread rapidly in a defined sub-population, but is not well-established in the general population. Numerical proxy: HIV prevalence is consistently over 5% in at least one defined sub-population, but is below 1% in pregnant women in urban areas.3 HIV has never spread to significant levels in any sub-population. Numerical proxy: HIV has not consistently exceeded 5% in any sub-population.",

It also procures anti-TB drugs for countries that have the means to buy them and can ship drugs on short notice in the event of a humanitarian or natural disaster, armed conflict, or other situation where life-saving anti-TB drugs are unavailable.The Stop TB Partnership, which is hosted by WHO in Geneva, Switzerland, is a network of more then 500 international organizations, countries, donors from the public and private sectors, and nongovernmental and governmental organizations that are working together to eliminate TB.",

More than 2400 people from WHO's 193 Member States, nongovernmental organizations and other observers attended the meeting which took place from 14-23 May.</p><p>The Assembly approved the largest-ever budget for the Organization and adopted a record number of resolutions on public health issues and on the technical and administrative work of WHO.</p><p>Member States agreed a resolution which will help all countries better prepare for the global public health threat which an <strong>influenza pandemic</strong> presents. The resolution, \"Sharing of Influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits,\" restates the general principles of the necessity of sharing both in the preparations for an influenza pandemic and the benefits that will flow from improved international cooperation and preparation, such as greater quantities of and equitable access to H5N1 and pandemic vaccines.</p><p>In her closing remarks, the Director-General Dr Margaret Chan told the delegates, \"All countries need to be aware of their obligations under the revised International Health Regulations. When collective security is at stake, public opinion can carry great weight. After very considerable discussion, you have adopted a resolution on the sharing of influenza viruses and access to pandemic vaccines and other benefits. I want to underscore the importance of this decision. My responsibilities in implementing the IHR depend on this sharing.\"</p><p>The resolution requests WHO to establish an international stockpile of vaccines for H5N1 or other influenza viruses of pandemic potential, and to formulate mechanisms and guidelines aimed at ensuring fair and equitable distribution of pandemic-influenza vaccines at affordable prices in the event of a pandemic.</p><p>It also tasks an interdisciplinary working group with drawing up new Terms of Reference (TORs) for the WHO Influenza Collaborating Centre Network, and its H5 reference laboratories, for the sharing of influenza viruses. The new TORs will take into account the origin of influenza viruses going into the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network, and will make their use more transparent. Once finalized, these TORs will be submitted to a special Intergovernmental Meeting of WHO Member States and regional economic organizations.</p><p>The Assembly reached a last-minute agreement on <strong>public health, innovation and intellectual property.</strong> The resolution expressed appreciation to the Director-General for her commitment to the process of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the issue and encouraged her to guide the process to draw up a global strategy and plan of action. The resolution also requested the Director-General to provide technical and policy support to countries.</p><p>Dr Chan said, \"I am fully committed to this process and have noted your desire to move forward faster ... We must make a tremendous effort. We know our incentive: the prevention of large numbers of needless deaths and suffering.\"</p><p><strong>Summary of additional decisions and issues discussed at the 60th World Health Assembly</strong></p><p>The Assembly approved a <strong>budget</strong> for 2008-2009 of $4.2 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion from the $3.3 billion approved for 2006-2007. The new budget highlights the continued trend of increased investment in global public health. For WHO it means being able to provide more support to countries, in close collaboration with UN and other partners. For the first time, this budget is part of a six-year strategic plan for the Organization, which Member States also adopted at the Assembly.</p><p>Member States expressed their concern that <strong>malaria</strong> continues to cause more than one million preventable deaths every year. The Assembly passed a resolution to intensify access to affordable, safe and effective antimalarial combination treatments, to intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancies, to insecticide treated mosquito nets, and indoor residual spraying for malaria control with suitable and safe insecticide. Member States requested that donors adjust their policies so as to progressively cease to fund the provision and distribution of oral artemisinin monotherapies, and to join in campaigns to prohibit the marketing, distribution and use of counterfeit antimalarial medicines.</p><p>All Member States were urged to develop and implement long-term plans for <strong>tuberculosis</strong> (TB) prevention and control, in line with the WHO Stop TB Strategy. The actions the resolution are aimed at accelerating progress towards halving TB deaths and prevalence by 2015, through the full implementation of the Global Plan to Stop TB, 2006-2015. WHO is requested to strengthen its support to countries affected by TB, in particular those heavily affected by Multidrug-resistant and Extensively Drug-Resistant TB (MD/XDR-TB) as well as TB/HIV.</p><p>Indigenous <strong>polio</strong> survives in parts of only four countries. Member States resolved to step up their efforts to eradicate the virus swiftly, while taking steps to minimize the risk of its international spread. Stressing the financial and humanitarian gains to be made from completing eradication and the ongoing dividends of the highly-developed polio infrastructure, the Director-General presented the 'Case for Completing Polio Eradication', outlining a clear justification for the international donor community to rapidly fill a global funding gap of US$540 million for 2007-2008. Insufficient funding is currently imperilling the 20-year, US$5.3 billion international effort.</p><p>The Assembly adopted a resolution on <strong>integrating gender</strong> analysis and actions into the work of WHO, demonstrating the importance Member States place on including gender perspectives such as disaggregation of data based on sex in all publications and reports.</p><p>The WHA adopted a resolution expressing concern over the continuous deterioration of the health and economic conditions of the populations in the <strong>occupied Palestinian territory.</strong> The need for universal coverage of health services was reaffirmed while recognizing that the acute shortage of financial and medical resources is jeopardizing access of the population to curative and preventive services. The Assembly requested the WHO Director-General to report on the health and economic situation in the occupied Palestinian territory and to continue to provide the necessary technical assistance to meet the health needs of the Palestinians.</p><p>The Assembly passed a resolution on <strong>better medicines for children,</strong> requesting the Director-General to undertake a program of work to improve access to essential medicines for children. This year, WHO will develop a Model List of Essential Medicines for Children, as well as evidence-based medicines information for prescribers and carers, and identify key research and development requirements for producing better medicines for children.</p><p>In a resolution on <strong>health technologies,</strong> in particular medical devices, the Assembly urged Member States to draw up national guidelines and plans for the assessment, procurement and management of technologies used in healthcare.</p><p>A resolution on <strong>rational use of medicines</strong> promotes an integrated, health systems approach to promoting more appropriate use of medicines - specifically, national multidisciplinary bodies to monitor medicines use and promote rational use. The Assembly agreed that a comprehensive review of all research undertaken on the <strong>variola virus,</strong> which causes smallpox, be undertaken beginning in 2010. The WHA asked that the results of that research - and conclusions concerning the need for any further research - be presented to the 64th World Health Assembly in 2011. The economic burden of <strong>oral disease</strong> is predicted to grow rapidly worldwide, particularly in disadvantaged and poor populations, unless oral preventive programmes are implemented. The WHA resolution urges WHO to provide advice and technical support for strengthening oral health programmes at country, regional and global levels, in collaboration with other UN organizations, WHO collaborating centres and NGOs.</p><p>The WHA passed a resolution urging Member States and the Secretariat to increase investment in, and strengthen efforts towards <strong>health promotion</strong> as the cornerstone of primary health care and a core function of public health.</p><p>The Assembly adopted a resolution on <strong>emergency trauma care systems,</strong> which draws the attention of governments to the need to strengthen pre-hospital and emergency trauma care systems (including mass casualty management efforts) and describes a number of steps governments could take. It also invites WHO to scale up its efforts to support countries.</p><p>Member States approved the resolution on strengthening of <strong>health information systems</strong> and enhancing WHO's work on health statistics in general. They also called on the DG to strengthen the information and evidence culture of WHO itself, and ensure the use of accurate and timely health statistics in order to generate evidence for major policy decisions and recommendations within WHO.</p><p>Member States approved a resolution and reiterated the importance of a coherent <strong>research strategy</strong> for WHO which will help to disseminate the outcomes of research and its utilization in decision- and policy-making for more effective health policies.</p><p>Member States approved a resolution on the control of <strong>leishmaniasis,</strong> which is recognized as one of the most neglected tropical diseases. Member States were urged to encourage research on leishmaniasis control, to identify appropriate and effective methods of control of vectors and reservoirs and find alternative safe, effective and affordable medicines.</p><p>The Assembly endorsed the <strong>Global Plan of Action on Workers' Health,</strong> which aims to devise policy instruments on workers health; protect and promote health at the workplace; improve the performance of and access to occupational health services; provide and communicate evidence for preventive action; and incorporate workers health into other policies. During this year's opening plenary, the United Nations declared the Palais des Nations a smoke-free environment indoors, recognizing the major contribution of tobacco use to non-communicable diseases and preventable, premature death. A progress report to the Assembly describes <strong>noncommunicable disease</strong> activities in advocacy, surveillance and population-based prevention since the year 2000. A resolution urges Member States to strengthen national efforts in noncommunicable disease (NCD) prevention and control and also calls for an action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs to be presented to the 61st WHA in 2008.</p><p>The Assembly held lengthy discussions on public-health problems caused by the harmful use of <strong>alcohol.</strong> Delegates agreed that the issue will be discussed again at the WHO Executive Board in January, 2008.</p><p>Keynote speakers at the Assembly were the Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg, and the Executive Director of UNFPA, Thoraya Obaid. The Prime Minister spoke of Norway's focus on Millennium Development Goals 4 (child mortality) and 5 (maternal mortality), and announced the establishment of a \"Global Business Plan\", to accelerate the progress towards these MDGs. The UNFPA Executive Director Thoraya Obaid underlined the areas of cooperation with WHO and urged delegates to focus on improving the sexual and reproductive health of their populations.</p><p>Ms Jane Halton, Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing, Australia was the Assembly President. The Chair of Committee A was Dr Robinson Jean-Louis, Minister of Health and Family Planning, Madagascar and the Chair of Committee B was Mr Thomas Zeltner, Secretary of State and Director of the Federal Office of Public Health, Switzerland.</p>",

Launched during the World Health Assembly currently meeting in Geneva, the new initiative will support special immunization campaigns in a dozen West African countries at high risk of yellow fever epidemics.</p><p>Between the 1940s and 1960s, widespread mass vaccination campaigns in some African countries had resulted in the almost-complete disappearance of yellow fever. However, as immunization campaigns waned, a generation of people grew up with no immunity to the disease, and by the 1990s the number of annual cases had risen to an estimated 200 000 per year, with 30 000 deaths, and urban outbreaks were starting to occur.</p><p>Yellow fever had returned as a major scourge and, as urbanization progresses across Africa, the threat of a major epidemic looms ever larger. WHO estimates, for example, that this highly transmissible disease could infect around one third of the urban population, or up to 4.5 million people, in Lagos, Nigeria alone.</p><p>Now, thanks to the US$ 58 million GAVI Alliance grant, immunization against yellow fever will be kick-started. Over the next four years, the world's 12 highest-burden countries, all of which are in West Africa, will be able to implement special vaccination campaigns to immunize more than 48 million people.</p><h5>Groundbreaking initiative</h5><p>\"The Initiative is a groundbreaker from many perspectives. Existing routine immunization programmes target children. If we were to do only routine child immunization for yellow fever, we would need decades to reduce the risk of epidemics and the international spread of the disease,\" said Dr David Heymann, WHO Assistant Director-General for Communicable Diseases.</p><p>\"Now, however, thanks to the generous grant from GAVI, the Yellow Fever Initiative will be able to vaccinate at-risk populations and thus quickly reduce the risk of devastating outbreaks that could otherwise threaten the region and the world. With this initiative, we will be working in the short and long term to strengthen primary health care systems in the world's most vulnerable region – Africa,\" added Dr Mike Ryan, Director of the WHO Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response (EPR) in Geneva.</p><p>“Yellow fever is a particularly dangerous disease which kills up to 50% of those with severe illness. Every age group is at risk, and vaccination is our crucial weapon to prevent cases and epidemics.

In Nigeria, for example, the coverage rate in 2005 was an estimated 36%. However, it is recommended that, to stop yellow fever infections from spreading into an epidemic, immunization coverage must be at least 60–80%.</p><p>\"Immunization against yellow fever is all the more critical now because of increased population movements in Africa. As we see more people moving to cities for work, but returning to their rural villages from time to time, we also see the possibility of yellow fever epidemics multiplying,\" said Dr Sylvie Briand, Project Manager of the Yellow Fever Initiative in WHO's EPR Department.</p><p>A recent vaccination campaign in Togo has shown how, under the umbrella of the Yellow Fever Initiative, it is possible to quickly and effectively reach even remote populations and consequently prevent isolated cases from spreading into an epidemic. In December 2006, WHO received notification of three cases of yellow fever in northern Togo. As the last mass vaccination there had taken place in 1987, the population was considered to be highly susceptible. By February 2007, the Togo Ministry of Health and WHO, with financial support from GAVI and from the Humanitarian Office of the European Commission (ECHO), and with the technical support of UNICEF and various NGOs, had vaccinated more than 1.5 million people. A similar campaign was then conducted in two districts in southern Togo after two cases of yellow fever had been reported there at the end of January.</p><p>GAVI's grant to the Yellow Fever Initiative will cover the 12 countries which are at the highest risk from the disease – Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo – and will help create a stockpile of 11 million doses of vaccine. Within the framework of the Initiative, the 12 Member States and WHO will identify specific target populations to vaccinate, with the aim of both preventing outbreaks and managing epidemics, and consequently increasing immunization coverage.</p><h5>About yellow fever</h5><p>Yellow fever is an acute, haemorrhagic, viral disease that is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. Infection may result in anywhere from no to severe illness; 20–50% of those with severe illness will die of the disease. There is no known specific antiviral therapy, although the disease can be prevented by the \"17D\" vaccine, which provides immunity for at least 10 years.</p><p>Yellow fever is endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America, where 44 countries (33 in Africa and 11 in South America) are considered to be at risk. Currently, 610 million people are considered to be at risk from the disease in Africa.</p><h5>Note to journalists</h5><p>The 12 countries taking part in the Yellow Fever Initiative are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.</p><p>The Ministries of Health of these 12 countries are being supported financially and technically by a Yellow Fever partnership which was launched in February 2006 and now includes WHO, UNICEF, GAVI, Médecins Sans Frontières, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Association pour la Médecine Préventive (AMP), the Programme for Appropriate Technology (PATH), the European Union Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and the Institut Pasteur.

They aim to stop an event at source, before it has a chance to become an international threat.\"The Director-General then addressed the threat of a pandemic of influenza and the efforts she is personally making to resolve some of the issues linked to preparing for a pandemic.\"I am personally engaged in several efforts to ensure access to vaccines in all countries,\" Dr Chan said. She then highlighted agreements to transfer technology to vaccine manufacturers in the developing world, work on establishing a stockpile of H5N1 vaccine and advance procurement mechanisms for pandemic vaccine. \"I am in dialogue with development partners and with executives from all the leading influenza vaccine companies. I am greatly encouraged by their commitment.\"",

Millions of workers run the risk of developing cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma (a malignant cancer of the internal lining of the chest cavity) from inhaling asbestos fibres and from tobacco smoke, or leukemia from exposure to benzene at their workplaces. Yet, the risks for occupational cancer are preventable.</p>\n<p>Lung cancer, mesothelioma, and bladder cancer are among the most common types of occupational cancers. Every tenth lung cancer death is closely related to risks in the workplace. Currently about 125 million people around the world are exposed to asbestos at work, and at least 90 000 people die each year from asbestos-related diseases. Thousands more die from leukemia caused by exposure to benzene, an organic solvent widely used by workers, including in the chemical and diamond industries.</p>\n<p>The rates of occupational cancer exposure are highest among workers whose workplaces do not meet the requirements for health and safety protection and do not have the necessary engineering measures to prevent the pollution of air with carcinogenic substances. For example, workers who are heavily exposed to second hand tobacco smoke at their workplaces have double the risk of developing lung cancer compared to those working in a smoke-free environment.</p>\n<p>\"The tragedy of occupational cancer resulting from asbestos, benzene and other carcinogens is that it takes so long for science to be translated into protective action,\" said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director of Public Health and Environment. \"Known and preventable exposures are clearly responsible for hundreds of thousands of excess cancer cases each year. In the interests of protecting our health, we must adopt an approach rooted in primary prevention, that is to make workplaces free from carcinogenic risks.\"</p>\n<h3>Unregulated carcinogen use</h3>\n<p>Currently, most cancer deaths caused by occupational risk factors occur in the developed world. This is a result of the wide use of different carcinogenic substances such as blue asbestos, 2-naphthylamine and benzene 20-30 years ago. Today, there are much tighter controls on these known carcinogens in the workplace in developed countries. However, work processes involving the use of carcinogens such as chrysotile asbestos and pesticides, and those used in tyre production and dye manufacturing, are moving to countries with less stringent enforcement of occupational health standards. If the current unregulated use of carcinogens in developing countries continues, a significant increase in occupational cancer can be expected in the coming decades.</p>\n<p>\"The control of carcinogens in the workplace should be a key component of every national cancer control programme,\" said Dr Andreas Ullrich, WHO Medical Officer for cancer control. \"To achieve this, WHO supports countries in developing comprehensive national cancer prevention and control plans, which are essential to prevent millions of cancer deaths each year.\"</p>\n<p>To protect workers from occupational cancer, WHO urges governments and industry to ensure that workplaces are equipped with adequate measures to meet health and safety standards and that they be free from dangerous pollutants. The most efficient way to prevent occupational cancer is to avoid exposure to carcinogens. Some of the simple interventions that can prevent hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths and suffering from occupational cancer are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stop the use of asbestos;</li>\n<li>introduce benzene-free organic solvents and technologies that convert the carcinogenic chromium into a non-carcinogenic form;</li>\n<li>ban tobacco use at the workplace; and</li>\n<li>provide protective clothes for people working in the sun</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WHO provides policy recommendations to help countries stop the use of carcinogens in the workplace, and provides health ministries with the latest information to frame health arguments and legislation to rid workplaces of carcinogens. Recently, WHO issued an official statement warning countries to stop using asbestos or face a cancer epidemic in the coming years. There are safer alternative materials to replace asbestos, for example using pine fibres in producing cement building materials.</p>\n<p>In October this year, WHO with support from the National Cancer Institute of France will be convening a global workshop with participation of public health policy makers, scientists and major international stakeholders to elaborate recommendations for strengthening national and international policies on preventing occupational and environmental cancer.</p>\n<p>28 April is the World Day for Safety and Health at Work.

Such cooperation is welcome and is consistent with the International Health Regulations, which soon come into force.\"Meeting at WHO headquarters on 25 April, countries that have experienced human H5N1 infections, donor countries, and vaccine manufacturers from industrialized and developing countries agreed that both scientific evidence and international political commitment support further efforts to examine whether and how to establish a stockpile of H5N1 vaccine and a mechanism for broader access to pandemic vaccine when the next influenza pandemic occurs.Participants heard that the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization had concluded last week that recent scientific studies on H5 vaccines had shown them to be safe and immunogenic, and that it was realistic to expect that vaccines offering cross protection (against immunologically related but different viruses not contained in the vaccine) could be developed.The meeting also heard from representatives of vaccine manufacturers in developed and developing countries that they were willing to work with WHO to pursue the possibility of an H5N1 vaccine stockpile and a mechanism for broader access to pandemic vaccine.

    "content_html": "<p>WHO and key partners are meeting on Thursday and Friday to demonstrate an unprecedented commitment to combat the so-called neglected tropical diseases. This commitment comes from political leaders and ministries of health in affected countries, from development agencies and banks, foundations, scientists, and some of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>Most of the neglected diseases are caused by parasites that thrive in impoverished settings, where water supply, sanitation, and housing are poor. Apart from this strong link to poverty, the diseases form a group because they permanently deform and disable large numbers of poor people, trapping them in poverty.</p><p>Worldwide, an estimated 1 billion people – one sixth of the world’s population – are affected by one or more of these diseases. Recent evidence of their severe impact on socioeconomic development has spurred unprecedented commitment to reduce this burden. Control of these diseases is now considered part of the global drive to reduce poverty.</p><p>“This event marks a turning point in the long and notorious history of some of humanity’s oldest diseases,” the WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, said in her opening address. “The burden imposed by these diseases, measured in terms of human misery alone, is unacceptable. We are committed to take action.”</p><h4>Safe and effective drugs available</h4><p>Most of these diseases were once present across a wide area, but gradually disappeared as standards of living and hygiene improved. The availability of safe and effective drugs in large quantities makes it possible, for the first time in history, to take immediate action against these diseases, without having to wait for gradual improvements.</p><p>The Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania, His Excellency Dr Ali Mohamed Shein, told the meeting, \"I would like to emphasize that all these diseases are not neglected, in any way, by the developing countries… We, in Tanzania, for example have recognized, since the dawn of independence, that health status and health service delivery are the core of socio-economic development. We have waged a protracted war against all diseases, which are regarded as a hindrance to development, alongside poverty and ignorance.\"</p><p>As these diseases affect large numbers of very poor people, the decision by industry to supply drugs for prevention or treatment at low or no cost has also been decisive in turning the tide.</p><p>During the meeting on Thursday, Dr Chan and Merck KGaA's Executive Board Member, Mr Elmar Schnee, signed an agreement aimed at fighting schistosomiasis.</p><p>A donation of 200 million tablets of the drug praziquantel will be given to WHO, with an estimated market value of US$80 million. The agreement could potentially protect millions of children from schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm disease which affects about 180 million people, most of them children in Africa. The 10-year collaboration will boost WHO's schistosomiasis treatment efforts targeted at least developed countries where the disease is highly endemic.</p><p>\"This disease is one of the biggest health risks to African children after malaria and this collaboration ensures the chance of a healthy life in countries marked by diseases of poverty,\" said Mr Schnee.</p><h4>New drug strategy</h4><p>Cost-effective tools to eliminate several of the neglected tropical diseases exist, some costing as little as 50 US cents per person.

      "description": "WHO and key partners are meeting on Thursday and Friday to demonstrate an unprecedented commitment to combat the so-called neglected tropical diseases. This commitment comes from political leaders and ministries of health in affected countries, from development agencies and banks, foundations, scientists, and some of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies.Most of the neglected diseases are caused by parasites that thrive in impoverished settings, where water supply, sanitation, and housing are poor. Apart from this strong link to poverty, the diseases form a group because they permanently deform and disable large numbers of poor people, trapping them in poverty.Worldwide, an estimated 1 billion people – one sixth of the world’s population – are affected by one or more of these diseases. Recent evidence of their severe impact on socioeconomic development has spurred unprecedented commitment to reduce this burden. Control of these diseases is now considered part of the global drive to reduce poverty.“This event marks a turning point in the long and notorious history of some of humanity’s oldest diseases,” the WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, said in her opening address. “The burden imposed by these diseases, measured in terms of human misery alone, is unacceptable. We are committed to take action.”Safe and effective drugs availableMost of these diseases were once present across a wide area, but gradually disappeared as standards of living and hygiene improved. The availability of safe and effective drugs in large quantities makes it possible, for the first time in history, to take immediate action against these diseases, without having to wait for gradual improvements.The Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania, His Excellency Dr Ali Mohamed Shein, told the meeting, \"I would like to emphasize that all these diseases are not neglected, in any way, by the developing countries… We, in Tanzania, for example have recognized, since the dawn of independence, that health status and health service delivery are the core of socio-economic development.

    "content_html": "<p>Road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death among young people between 10 and 24 years, according to a new report published by WHO. The report, <cite>Youth and Road Safety</cite>, says that nearly 400 000 young people under the age of 25 are killed in road traffic crashes every year. Millions more are injured or disabled.</p><p>The vast majority of these deaths and injuries occur in low- and middle-income countries. The highest rates are found in Africa and the Middle East. Young people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds are at greatest risk in every country. Young males are at higher risk for road traffic fatalities than females in every age group under 25 years.</p><p>Unless more comprehensive global action is taken, the number of deaths and injuries is likely to rise significantly. Road traffic collisions cost an estimated US$ 518 billion globally in material, health and other expenditure. For many low- and middle-income countries, the cost of road crashes represents between 1-1.5% of GNP and in some cases exceeds the total amount the countries receive in international development aid.</p><p><cite>Youth and Road Safety</cite> stresses that the bulk of these crashes are predictable – and preventable. Many involve children playing on the street, young pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, novice drivers and passengers of public transport.</p><p>The report points out that children are not just little adults. Their height, level of maturity, their interests, as well as their need to play and travel safely to school, mean that they require special safety measures. Also, the report says, protecting older youth requires other measures such as lower blood alcohol limits for young drivers and graduated license programmes.</p><h4>Special safety measures for children</h4><p>As part of the First United Nations Global Road Safety Week (23-29 April 2007), WHO is launching the report to draw attention to the high global rates of death, injury and disability among young people caused by road traffic crashes. <em>Youth and Road Safety</em> highlights examples in countries where improved measures such as lowering speed limits, cracking down on drink-driving, promoting and enforcing the use of seat-belts, child restraints, and motorcycle helmets, as well as better road infrastructure and creating safe areas for children to play have significantly reduced the number of deaths and injuries.</p><p>\"The lack of safety on our roads has become an important obstacle to health and development,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \"Our children and young adults are among the most vulnerable. Road traffic crashes are not 'accidents'. We need to challenge the notion that they are unavoidable and make room for a pro-active, preventive approach. \"</p><p><cite>Youth and Road Safety</cite> is accompanied by a second and more personal document, <cite>Faces behind the figures: voices of road traffic crash victims and their families</cite>. Developed jointly by WHO and the Association for Safe International Road Travel, this book presents first-hand accounts of the experiences of victims, their families and friends following road crashes. The stories place a highly moving human face on the statistics provided by many road safety reports around the world. They reveal the physical, psychological, emotional and economic devastation that occurs during the aftermath of road traffic deaths and injuries. In particular, these accounts deepen our understanding of the enormous suffering that occurs behind each death and injury every year. They also highlight some of the initiatives undertaken by groups and individuals to improve road safety by sharing their concern, frustration and anger in order to prevent the same from happening again.</p><p><cite>Faces behind the figures</cite> include:</p><ul><li>On 16 September 2002, Jane Njawe, 42, was travelling by car with two other people from Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, to Douala in the north. An hour into the journey, a bus driving in the opposite direction tried to overtake a truck on a curve at high speed. Unable to see any oncoming traffic, the driver smashed into the car, injuring everyone in it. While Jane's companions were taken to a nearby hospital, she was inexplicably driven to a poorly equipped bush clinic. A mother of four children, including a three-year-old son, Jane died five hours later from lack of blood. Jane's husband, Pius Njawe, formed an organization called Justice and Jane to keep her memory alive and to promote road safety.<br/><br/></li><li>On 29 August 2003, Balazs Geszti, a 24-year-old Hungarian butcher, returned home with his step-brother, Peter, in the early hours of the morning from a wedding. Both had been drinking heavily. Shortly after arriving home, Balazs received a phone call from his girlfriend asking him to attend another party. Racing over in his car, he smashed into a concrete barrier at 140 km an hour in a 50 km zone. Balazs was killed on impact. Peter is now a volunteer coordinator for Habitat for Humanity. He believes that if Balazs had not been drinking – or speeding – he might still be alive today.<br/><br/></li><li>In May 2002, Sateni Luangpitak, a motorcycle taxi driver in Thailand, collided into another vehicle. Sateni, now 28, was driving at 80 km per hour. The collision threw him on to the pavement, where he hit his head and left shoulder. Despite wearing a helmet, Sateni lost consciousness. When Prayoon Muangme, a friend, realized it would take too long for the emergency services to come, he evacuated Sateni to a nearby hospital. On arrival, however, he learned that no trauma facilities were available. Prayoon took his friend to yet another clinic. Sateni was lucky his helmet had protected his head and had suffered only light injuries. Nevertheless, his collision kept him out of work and reduced his ability to earn a living.</li></ul><p>The First United Nations Global Road Safety Week is being organized by WHO, the UN Regional Commissions and partners in a bid to promote greater awareness of road traffic incidents and to give young people a voice. Spearheading the global campaign, a World Youth Assembly will be held in Geneva, Switzerland, where young delegates from over 100 countries will gather on 23-24 April 2007 to share their experience and plan joint activities for better road safety. World leaders including the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair and stars including Moby will be giving messages to the opening of the World Youth Assembly.</p><p>\"The World Youth Assembly is our opportunity to step forward and take responsibility.

      "description": "Road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death among young people between 10 and 24 years, according to a new report published by WHO. The report, Youth and Road Safety, says that nearly 400 000 young people under the age of 25 are killed in road traffic crashes every year. Millions more are injured or disabled.The vast majority of these deaths and injuries occur in low- and middle-income countries. The highest rates are found in Africa and the Middle East. Young people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds are at greatest risk in every country. Young males are at higher risk for road traffic fatalities than females in every age group under 25 years.Unless more comprehensive global action is taken, the number of deaths and injuries is likely to rise significantly. Road traffic collisions cost an estimated US$ 518 billion globally in material, health and other expenditure. For many low- and middle-income countries, the cost of road crashes represents between 1-1.5% of GNP and in some cases exceeds the total amount the countries receive in international development aid.Youth and Road Safety stresses that the bulk of these crashes are predictable – and preventable. Many involve children playing on the street, young pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, novice drivers and passengers of public transport.The report points out that children are not just little adults. Their height, level of maturity, their interests, as well as their need to play and travel safely to school, mean that they require special safety measures. Also, the report says, protecting older youth requires other measures such as lower blood alcohol limits for young drivers and graduated license programmes.Special safety measures for childrenAs part of the First United Nations Global Road Safety Week (23-29 April 2007), WHO is launching the report to draw attention to the high global rates of death, injury and disability among young people caused by road traffic crashes. Youth and Road Safety highlights examples in countries where improved measures such as lowering speed limits, cracking down on drink-driving, promoting and enforcing the use of seat-belts, child restraints, and motorcycle helmets, as well as better road infrastructure and creating safe areas for children to play have significantly reduced the number of deaths and injuries.\"The lack of safety on our roads has become an important obstacle to health and development,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \"Our children and young adults are among the most vulnerable. Road traffic crashes are not 'accidents'. We need to challenge the notion that they are unavoidable and make room for a pro-active, preventive approach. \"Youth and Road Safety is accompanied by a second and more personal document, Faces behind the figures: voices of road traffic crash victims and their families. Developed jointly by WHO and the Association for Safe International Road Travel, this book presents first-hand accounts of the experiences of victims, their families and friends following road crashes. The stories place a highly moving human face on the statistics provided by many road safety reports around the world. They reveal the physical, psychological, emotional and economic devastation that occurs during the aftermath of road traffic deaths and injuries. In particular, these accounts deepen our understanding of the enormous suffering that occurs behind each death and injury every year. They also highlight some of the initiatives undertaken by groups and individuals to improve road safety by sharing their concern, frustration and anger in order to prevent the same from happening again.Faces behind the figures include:On 16 September 2002, Jane Njawe, 42, was travelling by car with two other people from Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, to Douala in the north. An hour into the journey, a bus driving in the opposite direction tried to overtake a truck on a curve at high speed. Unable to see any oncoming traffic, the driver smashed into the car, injuring everyone in it. While Jane's companions were taken to a nearby hospital, she was inexplicably driven to a poorly equipped bush clinic. A mother of four children, including a three-year-old son, Jane died five hours later from lack of blood. Jane's husband, Pius Njawe, formed an organization called Justice and Jane to keep her memory alive and to promote road safety.On 29 August 2003, Balazs Geszti, a 24-year-old Hungarian butcher, returned home with his step-brother, Peter, in the early hours of the morning from a wedding. Both had been drinking heavily. Shortly after arriving home, Balazs received a phone call from his girlfriend asking him to attend another party. Racing over in his car, he smashed into a concrete barrier at 140 km an hour in a 50 km zone. Balazs was killed on impact. Peter is now a volunteer coordinator for Habitat for Humanity. He believes that if Balazs had not been drinking – or speeding – he might still be alive today.In May 2002, Sateni Luangpitak, a motorcycle taxi driver in Thailand, collided into another vehicle. Sateni, now 28, was driving at 80 km per hour. The collision threw him on to the pavement, where he hit his head and left shoulder. Despite wearing a helmet, Sateni lost consciousness. When Prayoon Muangme, a friend, realized it would take too long for the emergency services to come, he evacuated Sateni to a nearby hospital. On arrival, however, he learned that no trauma facilities were available. Prayoon took his friend to yet another clinic. Sateni was lucky his helmet had protected his head and had suffered only light injuries. Nevertheless, his collision kept him out of work and reduced his ability to earn a living.The First United Nations Global Road Safety Week is being organized by WHO, the UN Regional Commissions and partners in a bid to promote greater awareness of road traffic incidents and to give young people a voice. Spearheading the global campaign, a World Youth Assembly will be held in Geneva, Switzerland, where young delegates from over 100 countries will gather on 23-24 April 2007 to share their experience and plan joint activities for better road safety. World leaders including the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair and stars including Moby will be giving messages to the opening of the World Youth Assembly.\"The World Youth Assembly is our opportunity to step forward and take responsibility. The time has come to make our voices heard. The Youth Declaration for Road Safety is only a first step in a long journey towards safer transportation for youth around the world,\" said Nelly Ghossaini from Lebanon, the 21-year-old Chair of the World Youth Assembly.Countries and communities will mark the event throughout the world. Governments, the UN and other international agencies, as well as private sector companies, foundations and groups working towards better road safety are expected to organize hundreds of local, national and international initiatives.",

These include the analysis of the general health situation of population groups and monitoring of the incidence and prevalence of diseases and other health problems in relation to variables such as the characteristics and circumstances of the individuals affected.The categories are also useful to support decision making, reimbursement systems and for independent documentation of medical information. ICD 10 is used to classify diseases and other health problems recorded on many types of health and vital records including death certificates and hospital records. In addition to enabling the storage and retrieval of diagnostic information for clinical and epidemiological purposes, these records also provide the basis for the compilation of national mortality and morbidity statistics by WHO Member States.The Internet-based workspace will document systematic reviews that obtain evidence from analysis of available data. WHO has established various Topic Advisory Groups to serve as the planning and coordinating advisory body for specific issues in the update and revision process.These Groups are composed of renowned international health leaders and chaired by:Mental Health: S. Hyman (USA)External Causes: J. Harrison (Australia)Rare Diseases: S. Ayme (France)Internal Medicine: K. Sugano (Japan)More groups are under construction. A Revision Steering Group will oversee the coordination and the overarching tasks and will be chaired by Professor Christopher G. Chute of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in the United States of America.WHO will run this platform in English. A Global Network of WHO Collaborating Centres will be able to run this Internet application in Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish (UN Official Languages), while other languages may be supported by partners (such as in Japanese) to enable participation of all interested parties. These centres will also channel their national or regional proposals to the system.WHO will collaborate through this platform with all interested parties, including governments and non-governmental agencies, academia, industry and public to make the new classification system best fit their needs. It is envisaged that there will be three distinct versions of the new ICD: a succinct version for use in primary care, a detailed version for use in specialty settings and an advanced version for use in research.The web site will be available as of 16 April 2007 to anyone to enter suggestions.",

The international consultation, which was held 6-8 March 2007 in Montreux, Switzerland, was attended by participants representing a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, civil society, researchers, human rights and women's health advocates, young people, funding agencies and implementing partners.</p><p>\"The recommendations represent a significant step forward in HIV prevention,\" said Dr Kevin De Cock, Director, HIV/AIDS Department in WHO. \"Countries with high rates of heterosexual HIV infection and low rates of male circumcision now have an additional intervention which can reduce the risk of HIV infection in heterosexual men. Scaling up male circumcision in such countries will result in immediate benefit to individuals. However, it will be a number of years before we can expect to see an impact on the epidemic from such investment.\"</p><p>There is now strong evidence from three randomized controlled trials undertaken in Kisumu, Kenya; Rakai District, Uganda (funded by the US National Institutes of Health); and Orange Farm, South Africa (funded by the French National Agency for Research on AIDS) that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60%. This evidence supports the findings of numerous observational studies that have also suggested that the geographical correlation long described between lower HIV prevalence and high rates of male circumcision in some countries in Africa, and more recently elsewhere, is, at least in part, a causal association. Currently, 665 million men, or 30 % of men worldwide, are estimated to be circumcised.</p><h5>Male circumcision should be part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package</h5><p>Male circumcision should always be considered as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package, which includes</p><ul><li>the provision of HIV testing and counselling services;</li><li>treatment for sexually transmitted infections;</li><li>the promotion of safer sex practices; and</li><li>the provision of male and female condoms and promotion of their correct and consistent use.</li></ul><p>Counselling of men and their sexual partners is necessary to prevent them from developing a false sense of security and engaging in high-risk behaviours that could undermine the partial protection provided by male circumcision. Furthermore, male circumcision service provision was seen as a major opportunity to address the frequently neglected sexual health needs of men.</p><p>\"Being able to recommend an additional HIV prevention method is a significant step towards getting ahead of this epidemic,\" said Catherine Hankins, Associate Director, Department of Policy, Evidence and Partnerships at UNAIDS. \"However, we must be clear: Male circumcision does not provide complete protection against HIV. Men and women who consider male circumcision as an HIV preventive method must continue to use other forms of protection such as male and female condoms, delaying sexual debut and reducing the number of sexual partners.\"</p><h5>Need for quality and safe services</h5><p>Health services in many developing countries are weak and there is a shortage of skilled health professionals. There is a need, therefore, to ensure that male circumcision services for HIV prevention do not unduly disrupt other health care programmes, including other HIV/AIDS interventions. In order to both maximize the opportunity afforded by male circumcision and ensure longer-term sustainability of services, male circumcision should, wherever possible, be integrated with other services.</p><p>The risks involved in male circumcision are generally low, but can be serious if circumcision is undertaken in unhygienic settings by poorly trained providers or with inadequate instruments. Wherever male circumcision services are offered, therefore, training and certification of providers, as well as careful monitoring and evaluation of programmes, will be necessary to ensure that these meet their objectives and that quality services are provided safely in sanitary settings, with adequate equipment and with appropriate counselling and other services.</p><p>Male circumcision has strong cultural connotations implying the need also to deliver services in a manner that is culturally sensitive and that minimizes any stigma that might be associated with circumcision status. Countries should ensure that male circumcision is undertaken with full adherence to medical ethics and human rights principles, including informed consent, confidentiality and absence of coercion.</p><h5>Maximizing public health benefit</h5><p>A significant public health impact is likely to occur most rapidly if male circumcision services are first provided where the incidence of heterosexually acquired HIV infection is high. It was therefore recommended that countries with high prevalence, generalized heterosexual HIV epidemics that currently have low rates of male circumcision consider urgently scaling up access to male circumcision services. A more rapid public health benefit will be achieved if age groups at highest risk of acquiring HIV are prioritized, although providing male circumcision services to younger age groups will also have public health impact over the longer term. Modelling studies suggest that male circumcision in sub-Saharan Africa could prevent 5.7 million new cases of HIV infection and 3 million deaths over 20 years.</p><p>Experts at the meeting agreed that the cost-effectiveness of male circumcision is acceptable for an HIV prevention measure and that, in view of the large potential public health benefit of expanding male circumcision services, countries should also consider providing the services free of charge or at the lowest possible cost to the client, as for other essential services.</p><p>In countries where the HIV epidemic is concentrated in specific population groups such as sex workers, injecting drug users or men who have sex with men, there would be limited public health impact from promoting male circumcision in the general population. However, there may be an individual benefit for men at high risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection.</p><h5>More research needed</h5><p>Experts at the meeting identified a number of areas where additional research is required to inform the further development of male circumcision programmes. These included</p><ul><li>the impact of male circumcision on sexual transmission from HIV-infected men to women;</li><li>the impact of male circumcision on the health of women for reasons other than HIV transmission (e.g. lessened rates of cancer of the cervix);</li><li>the risks and benefits of male circumcision for HIV-positive men;</li><li>the protective benefit of male circumcision in the case of insertive partners engaging in homosexual or heterosexual anal intercourse; and</li><li>research into the resources needed for, and most effective ways, to expand quality male circumcision services.</li></ul><p>Research to determine whether there are modifications in perceptions and HIV risk behaviour over the longer term in men who are circumcised for HIV prevention, and in their communities, will also be essential.</p>",

However, it will be a number of years before we can expect to see an impact on the epidemic from such investment.\"",
          "There is now strong evidence from three randomized controlled trials undertaken in Kisumu, Kenya; Rakai District, Uganda (funded by the US National Institutes of Health); and Orange Farm, South Africa (funded by the French National Agency for Research on AIDS) that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60%. This evidence supports the findings of numerous observational studies that have also suggested that the geographical correlation long described between lower HIV prevalence and high rates of male circumcision in some countries in Africa, and more recently elsewhere, is, at least in part, a causal association. Currently, 665 million men, or 30 % of men worldwide, are estimated to be circumcised.",
          "Male circumcision should always be considered as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package, which includes",
          "the provision of HIV testing and counselling services;",
          "treatment for sexually transmitted infections;",
          "the promotion of safer sex practices; and",
          "the provision of male and female condoms and promotion of their correct and consistent use.",
          "Counselling of men and their sexual partners is necessary to prevent them from developing a false sense of security and engaging in high-risk behaviours that could undermine the partial protection provided by male circumcision. Furthermore, male circumcision service provision was seen as a major opportunity to address the frequently neglected sexual health needs of men.",
          "\"Being able to recommend an additional HIV prevention method is a significant step towards getting ahead of this epidemic,\" said Catherine Hankins, Associate Director, Department of Policy, Evidence and Partnerships at UNAIDS. \"However, we must be clear: Male circumcision does not provide complete protection against HIV. Men and women who consider male circumcision as an HIV preventive method must continue to use other forms of protection such as male and female condoms, delaying sexual debut and reducing the number of sexual partners.\"",
          "Health services in many developing countries are weak and there is a shortage of skilled health professionals. There is a need, therefore, to ensure that male circumcision services for HIV prevention do not unduly disrupt other health care programmes, including other HIV/AIDS interventions. In order to both maximize the opportunity afforded by male circumcision and ensure longer-term sustainability of services, male circumcision should, wherever possible, be integrated with other services.",
          "The risks involved in male circumcision are generally low, but can be serious if circumcision is undertaken in unhygienic settings by poorly trained providers or with inadequate instruments. Wherever male circumcision services are offered, therefore, training and certification of providers, as well as careful monitoring and evaluation of programmes, will be necessary to ensure that these meet their objectives and that quality services are provided safely in sanitary settings, with adequate equipment and with appropriate counselling and other services.",
          "Male circumcision has strong cultural connotations implying the need also to deliver services in a manner that is culturally sensitive and that minimizes any stigma that might be associated with circumcision status. Countries should ensure that male circumcision is undertaken with full adherence to medical ethics and human rights principles, including informed consent, confidentiality and absence of coercion.",
          "A significant public health impact is likely to occur most rapidly if male circumcision services are first provided where the incidence of heterosexually acquired HIV infection is high. It was therefore recommended that countries with high prevalence, generalized heterosexual HIV epidemics that currently have low rates of male circumcision consider urgently scaling up access to male circumcision services. A more rapid public health benefit will be achieved if age groups at highest risk of acquiring HIV are prioritized, although providing male circumcision services to younger age groups will also have public health impact over the longer term. Modelling studies suggest that male circumcision in sub-Saharan Africa could prevent 5.7 million new cases of HIV infection and 3 million deaths over 20 years.",
          "Experts at the meeting agreed that the cost-effectiveness of male circumcision is acceptable for an HIV prevention measure and that, in view of the large potential public health benefit of expanding male circumcision services, countries should also consider providing the services free of charge or at the lowest possible cost to the client, as for other essential services.",
          "In countries where the HIV epidemic is concentrated in specific population groups such as sex workers, injecting drug users or men who have sex with men, there would be limited public health impact from promoting male circumcision in the general population. However, there may be an individual benefit for men at high risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection.",

      "description": "A new international Task Force was launched and met for the first time today to tackle the global shortage of health workers. With a shortfall of 4.3 million health workers worldwide, including more than 1 million in Africa alone, there is an urgent need to increase the number of doctors, nurses, health managers and other health care workers needed to face immediate health crises.Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), welcomed the new Task Force: \"The simple fact is that the world needs many more health workers. The world faces global as well as local threats to health. Infectious diseases have staged a dramatic comeback, and chronic diseases are on the rise.We cannot improve people's health without staff to deliver health care.The new global Task Force, chaired by Lord Nigel Crisp, former Chief Executive of the National Health Service in England, and Bience Gawanas, the African Union Commissioner for Social Affairs, has been set up under the auspices of the Global Health Workforce Alliance (GHWA). The Task Force includes two African Ministers of Health – Dr Stephen Mallinga of Uganda and Marjorie Ngaunje of Malawi - and senior health policy makers from across the globe, from the public and private sectors, and both developing and developed countries.Together these leaders in health and education will champion the need for significantly increased investment in the education and training of health workers in developing countries, and will build international commitment to practical action.The Joint Learning Initiative (2004) and the World Health Report 2006 brought this shortage of health workers to the world’s attention, and the World Health Assembly called for urgent action. Fifty-seven countries have critical shortages of health workers, and 36 of these are in sub-Saharan Africa. If the crisis is not tackled, these countries will not be able to provide their population with basic health care.“HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB, and maternal and child mortality – which together kill many millions of people annually across the world, will not be significantly reduced unless the crisis in health workers is tackled,” said Lord Crisp. “There is an urgent need for a massive international effort to train more health care workers, including doctors, nurses, managers and community health workers.”The Task Force will focus on practical solutions. It will also consider the need and scope for financial and technical support internationally, as well as links between training institutions and universities in the developed and developing world, and innovative use of technology for distance-learning.Already some countries are beginning to address the problem. Countries such as Ethiopia (a GHWA ‘pathfinder’ country), India and Malawi are rapidly increasing the production of health workers through education and training. The Ethiopian government, for example, has an ambitious programme to train 30 000 community health workers (Health Extension Workers) by 2009, so that people in villages have access to basic essential health services. The Malawi government, with support from the Global Fund and the UK Department for International Development, is doubling the number of nurses and tripling the number of doctors in training, through a six-year Emergency Human Resources Programme.The Task Force will look at the impact of such programmes, and assess the scope to replicate these and the resources needed to do so.GHWA Executive Director Dr Francis Omaswa welcomed the Task Force. \"GHWA has identified a need for some type of ‘fast-track’ training initiative to address the health worker shortage. This new GHWA Task Force will make practical recommendations for action. The Task Force will also work closely with other programmes which address issues such as health worker migration, health financing, and access to HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention and care.\"The Task Force is due to present its initial recommendations to the GHWA Forum in Autumn 2007.Notes to editors:The Global Health Workforce Alliance (GHWA) was set up in May 2006, with a secretariat provided by WHO.

The 34-member Board will discuss a range of issues including measles, malaria, polio, the prevention and control of chronic diseases, avian and pandemic influenza, and implementation of the International Health Regulations.</p><p>In her opening speech, Dr Chan told the Board members, \"We begin our discussions in what I believe are optimistic times for health.\" She outlined what she called the \"spectacular success story\" of measles. WHO announced last week that global deaths from measles have been reduced by 60 per cent since 2000, exceeding the already ambitious target of a 50% cut.</p><p>Dr Chan set out the wider health gains linked to measles immunisation. \"The news gets even better. Increasingly, this initiative is delivering a bundle of life-saving and health-promoting interventions: bed nets for malaria, vitamin A to boost the immune system, de-worming tablets that help keep children in school, polio vaccine, and tetanus vaccine for pregnant women.\"</p><p>\"I view this initiative as a model of what can be achieved through integrated service delivery,\" she said. \"This is a value-added approach that amplifies the power of public health.\"</p><p>Dr Chan then returned to one of her key themes: the work of the World Health Organization should be judged by the impact it has on the health of women and of people in Africa. \"Much of what we are already doing has an impact on women and the African people. This is not surprising. The threats to these two groups are numerous. Many of these threats are receiving high-level attention as we strive to meet the Millennium Development Goals, to which I am fully committed.\"</p><p>Dr Chan addressed another potentially huge gain for children around the world: the eradication of polio. She reported the conclusion of the advisory committee on polio eradication that “it is technically feasible to interrupt polio transmission worldwide.\" However, she said the world now faces a key question: \"Are we now in a position to overcome the operational and financial obstacles? I believe we need to assess the country-level operations very carefully to ensure that we can indeed interrupt transmission globally.”</p><p>She told the Board that she will convene an \"urgent high-level consultation\" from 27 to 28 February: \"The expected outcome is a set of milestones that must be met if transmission is to be interrupted in the four remaining endemic countries. The consultation will also consider the funding required to meet these milestones.\"</p><p>Dr Chan also re-emphasized her focus on evidence. \"As I have said, what gets measured gets done … If we want to set out a compelling health agenda, we must look not only at the needs we are addressing, but also at the results of our efforts. We must keep track to stay on track.\"</p><p>She went on to address avian influenza and the threat of an influenza pandemic. \"The message is straightforward: we must not let down our guard,\" she said. \"The whole world has lived under the imminent threat of an influenza pandemic for more than three years. These years of experience have taught us just how tenacious this H5N1 virus is in birds.\"</p><p>The Board also heard a report from Dr Anders Nordström, acting WHO Director-General until January 3, on the work of the Organization since May. Dr Nordström told the Board that since the death in May of the previous Director-General, Dr LEE Jong-wook, WHO has been “continually focusing on improving the health of people across the world.”</p><p>Dr Nordström outlined key areas in which progress has been made since May, including collaboration with other UN agencies and with the World Bank, direct engagement in the G8 summit in July, engaging in and providing leadership in health partnerships, advancing work on chronic, non-communicable diseases and on communicable diseases, including the neglected tropical diseases. Dr Nordström also outlined important developments in the areas of health systems development and the management of WHO. A report to the Executive Board on implementation of the global strategy for the prevention and control of chronic diseases concludes that much has been done but more progress is still needed. The global epidemic of chronic diseases continues. Last year, 35 million people died as a result of chronic diseases, equivalent to 60% of all deaths globally. These deaths are projected to increase by a further 17% over the next decade.</p><p>Other issues on the Board's agenda include: tuberculosis; gender, women and health; oral health; health systems; and the rational use of medicines, including better medicines for children. 10.5 million children under the age of five years die every year. Most of these deaths are from treatable conditions. Treatments exist, but some are not available in dosages that are suitable for children; of those that do exist in appropriate dosages, many are not available in low- and middle-income countries.</p><p>Also on the agenda at next week's Board meeting are: health promotion; progress reports on public health, innovation and intellectual property; cancer prevention and control; public health problems caused by the harmful use of alcohol and the Commission on Social Determinants of Health.</p><p>The Executive Board is comprised of representatives from 34 WHO Member States. The individuals are designated by Member States elected to do so by the World Health Assembly. The main functions of the Executive Board are to give effect to the decisions and policies of the Assembly, to advise it and generally facilitate its work. This session of the Board is scheduled to last from 22-30 January.</p><h4>Information for journalists wishing to cover the event</h4><p><strong>For accreditation</strong>, journalists are invited to contact the WHO Media Centre at +41 22 791 2222 or email: <a href=\"mailto:mediainquiries@who.int\">mediainquiries@who.int</a>.</p><p>For journalists wishing to cover the public meetings of the Executive Board, there is a clearly marked press gallery on level SS1 on the left-hand side of the Executive Board Room.
