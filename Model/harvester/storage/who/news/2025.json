Nonetheless, in 2025,\r\n        SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate globally, causing severe disease, post\r\n        COVID-19 condition, and death. Globally, the majority of COVID-19\r\n        deaths continue to occur in individuals aged 65 years and older and\r\n        those with underlying comorbidities.</li><li>As of early December 2025,\r\n        most circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants worldwide remain derived from JN.1.\r\n        In most regions, SARS-CoV-2 Variant Under Monitoring (VUM) XFG is the\r\n        predominant variant among SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted to GISAID,\r\n        typically accounting for 70-80% of all variants reported. In contrast,\r\n        in several countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region in which\r\n        SARS-CoV-2 sequencing continues, VUM NB.1.8.1 has been the most recent\r\n        predominant variant, with XFG detected at lower levels. VUM BA.3.2,\r\n        first detected in November 2024, continues to be detected at low levels\r\n        globally; however, higher levels have been reported in limited\r\n        geographic areas, particularly in wastewater and clinical samples in\r\n        Western Australia. The proportions of JN.1 (Variant of Interest) and all\r\n        other VUMs (KP.3.1.1 and LP.8.1) are declining and are now detected at\r\n        low levels.</li><li>Published and unpublished neutralization data using\r\n        antisera from naïve mice and hamsters infected with JN.1 or XFG, as well\r\n        as mice immunized with mRNA vaccine antigens JN.1, LP.1.8.1, NB.1.8.1\r\n        or XFG, indicate that recent JN.1-derived variants are antigenically\r\n        closely related. These variants differ by approximately 1 antigenic unit\r\n        in cartographic analyses, corresponding to a two-fold-difference in\r\n        neutralization, with XFG often the most antigenically distant from JN.1\r\n        within the JN.1 cluster. In contrast, these antisera showed limited\r\n        neutralization activity against BA.3.2, indicating that BA.3.2 is\r\n        antigenically distinct from circulating JN.1-derived variants.</li><li>Sera\r\n collected in 2025 from individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or\r\n        COVID-19 vaccination showed a moderate reduction in neutralizing\r\n        antibody titers against BA.3.2, as compared to those against JN.1 and\r\n        LP.8.1.</li><li>Published and unpublished human serological data of pre-\r\n        and post-vaccination sera from individuals immunized with JN.1 or KP.2\r\n        demonstrated significant increases in neutralizing activity against JN.1\r\n        and its descendent lineages. Post-vaccination neutralizing antibody\r\n        titers against NB.1.8.1 and XFG were lower than those against the\r\n        homologous JN.1 or KP.2 antigens, with even larger reductions observed\r\n        for BA.3.2.</li><li>Pre- and post-vaccination sera from individuals\r\n        immunized with LP.8.1 demonstrated significant increases in neutralizing\r\n        activity against JN.1 and its descendent lineages, including NB.1.8.1\r\n        and XFG. Post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers against BA.3.2\r\n        were lower than against the homologous LP.8.1 antigen and other\r\n        JN.1-derived variants.</li><li>Contemporary vaccine effectiveness (VE)\r\n        estimates are relative (rVE), rather than absolute (comparing vaccinated\r\n        to unvaccinated individuals), and demonstrate the added or incremental\r\n        protection of recent vaccination over and above pre-existing infection-\r\n        and vaccine-derived immunity. Monovalent JN.1 and KP.2 mRNA vaccines\r\n        demonstrated additional protection—relative to pre-existing\r\n        immunity—against symptomatic and severe COVID-19. There are currently no\r\n        studies reporting VE or rVE estimates using monovalent LP.8.1 vaccines.</li><li>Data shared confidentially with the TAG-CO-VAC by vaccine manufacturers showed that:<ul><li>Immunization\r\n of naïve mice and mice previously immunized with SARS-CoV-2 variants\r\n                with monovalent JN.1 elicited high neutralizing antibody titers\r\n                against JN.1, XEC, LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1. Neutralization titers against XFG\r\n                were typically lower than those against the homologous immunizing\r\n                antigen, with further reductions observed against BA.3.2.</li><li>Immunization\r\n of naïve mice and mice previously immunized with SARS-CoV-2 variants\r\n                with monovalent LP.8.1 induced high neutralizing antibody titers\r\n                against the homologous antigen, JN.1, NB.1.8.1 and XFG. Reductions in\r\n                antibody titers were consistently observed against BA.3.2.</li><li>In\r\n humans, vaccination with monovalent JN.1 elicited robust neutralizing\r\n                antibody responses against JN.1, XEC, LP.8.1 and NB.1.8.1. As observed\r\n                in mice, post-monovalent JN.1 vaccination neutralizing antibody titers\r\n                against XFG and BA.3.2 were lower than those against the homologous JN.1\r\n                antigen. Vaccination with 8.1 induced strong increases in neutralizing\r\n                antibody titers against JN.1, LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1 and XFG. As in mice,\r\n                post-monovalent LP.8.1 vaccination neutralizing antibody titers\r\n                against BA.3.2 were lower than those against the homologous LP.8.1\r\n                antigen.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Overall, LP.8.1 as a vaccine antigen\r\n    offers modestly but significantly increased cross-reactive antibody\r\n    responses to currently circulating JN.1-derived variants, as compared to\r\n    monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 vaccines.</p><p>The TAG-CO-VAC acknowledges several limitations of available data: </p><ul><li>There\r\n are persistent and increasing gaps in the reporting of cases,\r\n        hospitalizations and deaths, from WHO Member States, as well as in\r\n        genetic/genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 globally, including low\r\n        numbers of samples sequenced and limited geographic diversity. The\r\n        TAG-CO-VAC strongly supports the ongoing work of the WHO <a data-mce-href=\"https://www.who.int/groups/who-coronavirus-network\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/groups/who-coronavirus-network\">Coronavirus Network</a> (CoViNet) and the <a data-mce-href=\"https://www.who.int/initiatives/global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/initiatives/global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system\">Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System</a> (GISRS) to address this information gap.</li></ul><ul><li>The\r\n timing, specific mutations and antigenic characteristics of emerging\r\n        and future variants are difficult to predict, and the potential public\r\n        health impact of these variants remain unknown. While most circulating\r\n        variants are currently derived from JN.1, there are long branch\r\n        saltation variants, such as BA.3.2, that are currently detected in low\r\n        proportions of SARS-CoV-2 variants sequenced globally. <a data-mce-href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/05122025_ba.3.2_ire.pdf?sfvrsn=a29c3612_4\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/05122025_ba.3.2_ire.pdf?sfvrsn=a29c3612_4\">Available data</a>\r\n indicate that BA.3.2 does not currently exhibit a clear fitness\r\n        advantage over JN.1-derived variants; however, its future evolutionary\r\n        potential remains uncertain.

In contrast,\r\n        in several countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region in which\r\n        SARS-CoV-2 sequencing continues, VUM NB.1.8.1 has been the most recent\r\n        predominant variant, with XFG detected at lower levels. VUM BA.3.2,\r\n        first detected in November 2024, continues to be detected at low levels\r\n        globally; however, higher levels have been reported in limited\r\n        geographic areas, particularly in wastewater and clinical samples in\r\n        Western Australia.

To help close the knowledge and research gaps, WHO is launching the Traditional Medicine Global Library, the first of its kind, featuring more than 1.6 million scientific records spanning research, policies, regulations and thematic collections on diverse TM applications. </p><p>Developed in response to calls by Heads of State during G20 and BRICS meetings in 2023, the Library also provides equitable online access to peer-reviewed content for institutions in lower-income countries through the Research4Life initiative. It also supports countries in documenting TM with intellectual property protections and in building scientific capacity to drive innovation. </p><p>“Advancing traditional medicine is an evidence-based, ethical and environmental imperative,” said Dr Shyama Kuruvilla, Director a.i. of WHO’s Global Traditional Medicine Centre. “The Global Summit fosters the conditions and collaborations required for TM to contribute at scale to the flourishing of all people and the planet.”<br/></p><p>The Summit (17–19 December 2025, New Delhi) will also announce new commitments from governments and other stakeholders, alongside a call for a global consortium to address systemic gaps and accelerate implementation of the Global TM Strategy at scale.</p><p> </p>",

To help close the knowledge and research gaps, WHO is launching the Traditional Medicine Global Library, the first of its kind, featuring more than 1.6 million scientific records spanning research, policies, regulations and thematic collections on diverse TM applications.",
          "Developed in response to calls by Heads of State during G20 and BRICS meetings in 2023, the Library also provides equitable online access to peer-reviewed content for institutions in lower-income countries through the Research4Life initiative. It also supports countries in documenting TM with intellectual property protections and in building scientific capacity to drive innovation.",
          "“Advancing traditional medicine is an evidence-based, ethical and environmental imperative,” said Dr Shyama Kuruvilla, Director a.i. of WHO’s Global Traditional Medicine Centre. “The Global Summit fosters the conditions and collaborations required for TM to contribute at scale to the flourishing of all people and the planet.”",
          "The Summit (17–19 December 2025, New Delhi) will also announce new commitments from governments and other stakeholders, alongside a call for a global consortium to address systemic gaps and accelerate implementation of the Global TM Strategy at scale."

NCDs are often driven by preventable risk factors such as unhealthy diets, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and air pollution – many of which also negatively impact mental health. Both NCDs and mental health conditions are increasing in every country, affecting every community. That makes them urgent issues not only for public health, but also for productivity and sustainable economic growth.</p><h3>A new era with measurable targets<strong> </strong><br/></h3><p>Marking a significant evolution from previous commitments, the new political declaration establishes three first-ever global \"fast-track\" outcome targets to be achieved by 2030:<br/></p><ul><li>150 million fewer tobacco users;</li><li>150 million more people with hypertension under control; and</li><li>150 million more people with access to mental health care.<br/></li></ul><p>To ensure countries can reach these goals, the declaration also sets ambitious, measurable process targets for national systems by 2030, including:<br/></p><ul><li>at least 80% of countries with policy, legislative, regulatory and fiscal measures in place;</li><li>at least 80% of primary health care facilities with access to affordable, WHO-recommended essential medicines and basic technologies for NCDs and mental health;</li><li>at least 60% of countries implementing financial protection policies or measures that cover or limit the cost of essential NCD and mental health services;</li><li>at least 80% of countries with operational, multisectoral national plans for NCDs and mental health; and</li><li>at least 80% of countries with robust surveillance and monitoring systems for NCDs and mental health.</li></ul><p>\"The adoption of these bold targets to control noncommunicable diseases and promote mental health is a testament to the commitment of Member States to protect the health of their people,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Together, we can change the trajectory of NCDs and mental health, and deliver health, well-being and opportunity for all.\"<br/></p><h3>The most far-reaching declaration yet for scope and commitments</h3><p>This political declaration is the most comprehensive to date, integrating lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and responding to new global challenges.

In systematic reviews, databases are searched to ensure comprehensive capture of published studies and the quality of all included studies is evaluated according to well accepted methodologies. When reviewing the evidence to inform causality, the greatest weight is put on the high-quality well-designed studies with low risk of bias and little weight is given to those with methodological flaws and high risk of bias. </p><p>The first systematic review examined the relationship between thiomersal-containing vaccines and ASD, as well as the association between vaccines in general and ASD. This review was an update to a previous systematic review conducted in 2012, and encompassed publications in English from January 2010 to August 2025. In total, 31 primary research studies were included:16 specifically on vaccines containing thiomersal and ASD and 15 on vaccines and ASD more broadly. In addition, five meta-analyses (one on thiomersal and ASD, three on vaccines and ASD, and one that examined both) that summarized research also published before 2010 were included. </p><p>Twenty of the 31 primary research papers originating from 11 different countries and including studies that were the most methodologically rigorous, as well as all five meta-analyses, found no evidence supporting an association between vaccines, irrespective of thiomersal content, and ASD. The other eleven studies (with nine originating from one single research group in the United States) suggested a potential association; however, these had multiple and significant methodological issues, and all had very low strength of evidence and a high risk of bias.

These two indicators are the foundation of universal health coverage (UHC) – the global commitment that everyone, everywhere can access the care they need without financial hardship by 2030.</p><p>The <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240117815\">UHC Global Monitoring Report 2025</a> shows that health service coverage, measured by the Service Coverage Index (SCI), rose from 54 to 71 points between 2000 and 2023. Meanwhile, the share of people experiencing financial hardship due to large and impoverishing out-of-pocket (OOP) health payments declined from 34% to 26% between 2000 and 2022.</p><p>However, the report cautions that the poorest populations continue to bear the greatest burden of unaffordable health costs, with 1.6 billion people further pushed into poverty. Overall, an estimated 4.6 billion people worldwide still lack access to essential health services and 2.1 billion people experience financial hardship to access health care, including the 1.6 billion people living in poverty or pushed deeper into it due to health expenses.</p><p>\"Universal health coverage is the ultimate expression of the right to health, but this report shows that for billions of people who cannot access or afford the health services they need, that right remains out of reach,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “In the context of severe cuts to international aid, now is the time for countries to invest in their health systems, to protect the health of their people and economies. WHO is supporting them to do that.”</p><p>Financial hardship in health is defined as household spending more than 40% of its discretionary budget on OOP health expenses. Cost of medicines is a major driver of financial hardship: in three-quarters of countries with available data, medicines account for at least 55% of people’s OOP health expenses. The burden is even greater among people living in poverty who allocate a median of 60% of their OOP health expenses on medicines diverting their scarce resources from other essential needs.</p><p>While the burden of OOP health costs falls mostly on poorer people, it also affects better-off segments of the population that allocate a large share of their budgets to health expenses, particularly in middle-income countries where this group of people is growing.</p><p>Without faster progress, full-service coverage without financial hardship will remain out of reach for many: the global SCI is projected to reach only 74 out of 100 by 2030, with nearly 1 in 4 people worldwide still facing financial hardship at the end of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) era.</p><h2>Encouraging progress in low-income countries with largest gaps</h2><p>Despite positive direction, the global progress rate has slowed since 2015 with only one-third of countries improving in both increasing health coverage and reducing financial hardship. All WHO regions have improved service coverage, but only half – Africa, South-East Asia, the Western Pacific – also reduced financial hardship. Low-income countries achieved the fastest gains in both areas but are still facing  the largest gaps.</p><p>The global increase in health service coverage has been driven largely by advances in infectious disease programmes. Coverage for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) has shown steady improvement, while gains in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health have been modest.</p><p>The report notes that improved sanitation has supported service coverage gains. At the same time, inclusive economic growth, rising incomes, and stronger social protection mechanisms have driven poverty reduction, especially in low-income countries, contributing to declines in financial hardship. However, health costs have increasingly become a source of financial hardship among the poor.</p><h2>Inequalities are getting starker</h2><p>Despite progress, persistent gaps and inequalities are on the rise. In 2022, 3 out of 4 people among the poorest segment of the populations faced financial hardship from health costs, compared with fewer than 1 in 25 among the richest.</p><p>Women, people living in poverty, or in rural areas, or with less education, reported greater difficulty accessing essential health services. The gap between women in the richest and poorest quintiles narrowed slightly, from about 38 to 33 percentage points over the past decade. Even in high-performing regions such as Europe, vulnerable groups – including the poorest and people with disabilities – continue to report higher unmet health needs.</p><p>These findings likely underestimate the true extent of health inequalities, as the most vulnerable groups – such as displaced populations and people living in informal settlements – are often missing in data sources used to monitor progress toward UHC.</p><h2>Actions leading to 2030</h2><p>Achieving the UHC goal by 2030 is central to realizing the human right to health. With five years remaining on the SDG agenda, urgent action is now needed to  drive progress. The report underscores the critical role of political commitment in every country and community, and calls for action in six core areas:</p><ul><li>ensure essential health care is free at the point of care for people living in poverty and vulnerable situations;</li><li>expand public investments in health systems;</li><li>address high out-of-pocket spending on medicines;</li><li>accelerate access to essential NCD services, especially as the disease burden rises;</li><li>strengthen primary health care to promote equity and efficiency; and </li><li>adopt multisectoral approaches, recognizing that determinants of health and UHC drivers extend beyond the health sector.</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Editor’s note</h2><p>This edition of the UHC Global Monitoring Report 2025 reflects the first round of UHC tracking to incorporate revised SDG indicators for health service coverage (SDG 3.8.1) and financial hardship (SDG 3.8.2), introduced in 2025.

    "content_html": "<p>Wider use of new tools against malaria, including dual-ingredient nets and WHO-recommended vaccines helped to prevent an estimated 170 million cases and 1 million deaths in 2024, according to WHO's annual <em><a href=\"/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2025\">World malaria report</a></em>. </p><p>WHO-recommended tools are increasingly being integrated into broader health systems. Since WHO approved the world's first malaria vaccines in 2021, 24 countries have introduced the vaccines into their routine immunization programmes. Seasonal malaria chemoprevention has also been expanded and is now being implemented in 20 countries, reaching 54 million children in 2024, an increase from about 0.2 million in 2012. </p><p>Progress is also being made in eliminating malaria. To date, a total of 47 countries and 1 territory have been certified malaria-free by WHO – Cabo Verde and Egypt were certified malaria-free in 2024, and Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste joined them in 2025. Despite this significant progress, there were an estimated 282 million malaria cases and 610 000 deaths in 2024 – roughly 9 million more cases than the previous year. </p><p>An estimated 95% of these deaths were in the WHO African Region, with most occurring among children under 5. The report shows that antimalarial drug resistance is growing and stands in the way of achieving malaria elimination. </p><p>\"New tools for prevention of malaria are giving us new hope, but we still face significant challenges,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"Increasing numbers of cases and deaths, the growing threat of drug resistance and the impact of funding cuts all threaten to roll back the progress we have made over the past two decades. However, none of these challenges is insurmountable. With the leadership of the most-affected countries and targeted investment, the vision of a malaria-free world remains achievable.\"</p><p>The <em>World malaria report </em>spotlights evidence on partial resistance to artemisinin derivatives, which became the backbone of malaria treatments after failures of chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Antimalarial drug resistance has now been confirmed or suspected in at least 8 countries in Africa, and there are potential signs of declining efficacy of the drugs that are combined with artemisinin. </p><p>Progress in reducing the malaria deaths – a key target of the <em><a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240031357\">Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030</a></em> – remains far off track. In 2024, there were 610 000 deaths. This corresponds to 13.8 malaria deaths per 100 000 population, more than 3 times the global target of 4.5 deaths per 100 000.</p><h2>Complex challenges to progress</h2><p>This year’s report underscores a growing array of risks to malaria elimination efforts in addition to the threat of antimalarial drug resistance. </p><p>Malaria parasites with <em>pfhrp2</em> gene deletions remain prevalent, undermining the reliability of rapid diagnostic tests, while confirmed pyrethroid resistance in 48 countries is reducing the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets. At the same time, <em>Anopheles stephensi</em> mosquitoes – resistant to many commonly used insecticides – have now invaded 9 African countries, posing a serious challenge to urban malaria control efforts.</p><p>Beyond biological threats, extreme weather events are also contributing to increased outbreaks of malaria. Changes in temperature and rainfall are altering habitats for mosquitoes and thus transmission patterns. </p><p>Conflict and instability in affected regions are also leading to widespread disruptions of health services, limiting access to care and delaying timely diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>The challenge is further exacerbated by the plateauing of global funding over the last decade limiting the reach of life-saving interventions. In 2024, US$3.9 billion was invested in the malaria response, yet it reached less than half of the 2025 funding target of US$9.3 billion set by the Global technical strategy. </p><p>Recent reductions in Official Development Assistance (ODA) have severely disrupted health systems, weakening routine surveillance and forcing the cancellation or postponement of most planned malaria surveys. These cuts have also heightened the risk of stock-outs and delays in malaria interventions campaigns, undermining programme impact. </p><h2>Country led, partner enabled response<strong> </strong></h2><p>“The World Malaria Report is clear: drug resistance is advancing. Our response must be equally clear – new medicines with new mechanisms of action,” said Dr Martin Fitchet CEO of Medicines for Malaria Venture. “The development of the first non-artemisinin combination therapy, Ganaplacide–Lumefantrine, is proof that this is possible, and it represents the beginning of a new chapter in malaria resilience. Together with a global partnership of expertise, commitment and funding, we can stay ahead of resistance and deliver new medicines to ensure malaria is no longer a threat.”</p><p align=\"left\">Political commitments need to be translated into resources and actions with sustainable and equitable impact.

    "content_html": "<p>To address the growing global health challenge of obesity, which affects more than 1 billion people, the World Health Organization (WHO) has released its <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://app.magicapp.org/#/guideline/LrRxrL\">first guideline</a> on the use of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) therapies for treating obesity as a chronic, relapsing disease.</p><p>Obesity affects people in every country and was associated with 3.7 million deaths worldwide in 2024. Without decisive action, the number of people with obesity is projected to double by 2030.</p><p>In September 2025, WHO added GLP-1 therapies to its Essential Medicines List for <a href=\"/news/item/05-09-2025-who-updates-list-of-essential-medicines-to-include-key-cancer--diabetes-treatments\">managing type 2 diabetes</a> in high-risk groups. With the new guideline, WHO issues conditional recommendations for using these therapies to support people living with obesity in overcoming this serious health challenge, as part of a comprehensive approach that includes healthy diets, regular physical activity and support from health professionals.</p><p>“Obesity is a major global health challenge that WHO is committed to addressing by supporting countries and people worldwide to control it, effectively and equitably. Our new guidance recognizes that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “While medication alone won’t solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms.”</p><p>Obesity is a complex, chronic disease and a major driver of noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer. It also contributes to poorer outcomes of patients who have infectious diseases.</p><p>Beyond its health impacts, the global economic cost of obesity is predicted to reach US$ 3 trillion annually by 2030. The guideline can help efforts to reduce skyrocketing health costs associated with managing the condition and associated health complications.</p><h2>Landmark policy change</h2><p>The new WHO guidance contains two key conditional recommendations:</p><ul><li>GLP-1 therapies may be used by adults, but excluding pregnant women, for the long-term treatment of obesity. While the efficacy of these therapies in treating obesity and improving metabolic and other outcomes was evident, the recommendation is conditional due to limited data on their long-term efficacy and safety, maintenance and discontinuation, their current costs, inadequate health-system preparedness, and potential equity implications.</li><li>Intensive behavioural interventions, including structured interventions involving healthy diet and physical activity, may be offered to adults living with obesity prescribed GLP-1 therapies. This is based on low-certainty evidence suggesting it may enhance treatment outcomes.</li></ul><h2>Medication alone won’t reverse the obesity challenge</h2><p>While GLP-1 therapies represent the first efficacious treatment option for adults with obesity, the WHO guideline emphasizes that medicines alone will not solve the problem. Obesity is not only an individual concern but also a societal challenge that requires multisectoral action. Addressing obesity requires a fundamental reorientation of current approaches to a comprehensive strategy built with three pillars:</p><ul><li>Creating healthier environments through robust population-level policies to promote health and prevent obesity;</li><li>Protecting individuals at high risk of developing obesity and related comorbidities through targeted screening and structured early interventions; and</li><li>Ensuring access to lifelong, person-centred care.</li></ul><h2>Implementation considerations</h2><p>The guideline emphasizes the importance of fair access to GLP-1 therapies and preparing health systems for use of these medicines. Without deliberate policies, access to these therapies could exacerbate existing health disparities. WHO calls for urgent action on manufacturing, affordability, and system readiness to meet global needs.</p><p>Even with rapid expansion in production, GLP-1 therapies are projected to reach fewer than 10% of those who could benefit by 2030.

LEN, a highly effective, long-acting alternative to oral pills and other options, is a transformative intervention for people who face challenges with regular adherence and stigma in accessing health care. WHO released in July this year  <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240111608\">new guidelines recommending the use of lenacapavir</a> as an additional pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) option for HIV prevention.</p><p>Sharp and sudden reductions in international funding this year led to disruptions in HIV prevention, treatment and testing services, with essential community-led programmes, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and harm reduction initiatives for people who inject drugs, being scaled back or shut down entirely in some countries. </p><p>“We face significant challenges, with cuts to international funding, and prevention stalling,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “At the same time, we have significant opportunities, with exciting new tools with the potential to change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic.

    "content_html": "<p>Global immunization efforts have led to an 88% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2024, according to a <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://iris.who.int/items/67dbaffa-8d6e-4f22-a2fc-5efd51b62cea\">new report</a> from the World Health Organization (WHO). Nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine since 2000. </p><p>However, an estimated 95 000 people, mostly children younger than 5 years of age, died due to measles in 2024. While this is among the lowest annual tolls recorded since 2000, every death from a disease that could be prevented with a highly effective and low-cost vaccine is unacceptable. </p><p>Despite fewer deaths, measles cases are surging worldwide, with an estimated 11 million infections in 2024 – nearly 800 000 more than pre-pandemic levels in 2019. </p><p>“Measles is the world's most contagious virus, and these data show once again how it will exploit any gap in our collective defences against it,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Measles does not respect borders, but when every child in every community is vaccinated against it, costly outbreaks can be avoided, lives can be saved, and this disease can be eliminated from entire nations.” </p><p>Measles cases in 2024 increased by 86% in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, 47% in the European Region, and 42% in South-East Asian Region compared with 2019. Notably, the African Region experienced a 40% decline in cases and 50% decline in deaths over this period, partly due to increasing immunization coverage. </p><p>While recent measles surges are occurring in countries and regions where children are less likely to die due to better nutrition and access to health care, those infected remain at risk of serious, lifelong complications such as blindness, pneumonia, and encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage). </p><h2>Immunization coverage insufficient to protect all communities </h2><p>In 2024, an estimated 84% of children received their first dose of the measles vaccine, and only 76% received the second, according to WHO/UNICEF estimates. This is a slight improvement from the previous year, with 2 million more children immunized. According to WHO guidance, at least 95% coverage with two measles vaccine doses is required to stop transmission and protect communities from outbreaks. </p><p>More than 30 million children remained under-protected against measles in 2024. Three-quarters of them live in the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions, often in fragile, conflict-affected or vulnerable settings. </p><p>The Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) Mid-Term Review, also released today, stresses that measles is often the first disease to resurge when vaccination coverage drops. Growing measles outbreaks are exposing weaknesses in immunization programmes and health systems globally, and threatening progress towards IA2030 targets, including measles elimination. </p><h2>Rising number of outbreaks </h2><p>In 2024, 59 countries reported large or disruptive measles outbreaks – nearly triple the number reported in 2021 and the highest since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. All regions except the Americas had at least one country experiencing a large outbreak in 2024. The situation changed in 2025 with numerous countries in the Americas battling outbreaks. </p><p>Efforts to scale up measles surveillance have improved WHO and countries' abilities to identify and respond to outbreaks, and for some countries to achieve elimination. In 2024, more than 760 laboratories participating in the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN) tested over 500 000 samples, an increase of 27% from the previous year.</p><p>However, deep funding cuts affecting GMRLN and country immunization programmes are feared to widen immunity gaps and drive further outbreaks in the coming year.

While demand for services is rising worldwide, access to care remains severely limited. In many countries, tests and treatments for infertility are largely funded out-of-pocket – often resulting in catastrophic financial expenditures. In some settings, even a single round of <em>in vitro </em>fertilization (IVF) can cost double the average annual household income.</p><p>“Infertility is one of the most overlooked public health challenges of our time and a major equity issue globally,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Millions face this journey alone – priced out of care, pushed toward cheaper but unproven treatments, or forced to choose between their hopes of having children and their financial security. We encourage more countries to adapt this guideline, giving more people the possibility to access affordable, respectful, and science-based care.”</p><p>The guideline includes 40 recommendations that seek to strengthen the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infertility. It promotes cost-effective options at every stage, while advocating for the integration of fertility care into national health strategies, services and financing.</p><h2>People-centered, evidence-based care</h2><p>Infertility, defined by the failure to achieve pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse, can cause significant distress, stigma, and financial hardship, affecting people’s mental and psychosocial well-being.</p><p>The guideline provides guidance on steps for the effective clinical management of infertility. It also calls for increased investment in prevention, including information on fertility and infertility, factors such as age, in schools, primary health care and reproductive health facilities.</p><p>It stresses the need to tackle leading risk factors for infertility, including untreated sexually transmitted infections and tobacco use. Lifestyle interventions – such as healthy diet, physical activity, and tobacco cessation – are recommended for individuals and couples planning or attempting pregnancy. Informing people about fertility and infertility early can assist them in making reproductive plans.</p><p>The guideline outlines clinical pathways to diagnose common biological causes of male and female infertility. Considering the findings from clinical tests as well as patient preferences, it provides guidance on how to progressively advance treatment options from simpler management strategies – where clinicians first provide advice on fertile periods and fertility promotion without active treatment – to more complex treatment courses such as intrauterine insemination or IVF.</p><p>Recognizing the emotional toll of infertility, which can lead to depression, anxiety and feelings of social isolation, the guideline emphasizes the need to ensure ongoing access to psychosocial support for all those affected.</p><h2>Fertility in a changing world</h2><p>WHO is encouraging countries to adapt the recommendations to their local contexts and to monitor progress. Successful implementation will require collaboration across Ministries of Health, health professional societies, civil society, and patient groups.</p><p>Implementation should also align with comprehensive, rights-based approaches to sexual and reproductive health – including fertility care – that empower people throughout their lives to make informed, individual decisions about whether and when to have children.</p><p>“The prevention and treatment of infertility must be grounded in gender equality and reproductive rights,” said Dr Pascale Allotey, Director of WHO’s Department of Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing and the United Nations’ Special Programme on Human Reproduction (HRP). “Empowering people to make informed choices about their reproductive lives is a health imperative and a matter of social justice.”</p><p>While comprehensive, the guideline acknowledges current gaps in evidence as well as areas for future research and additional recommendations.

    "content_html": "<p>Violence against women remains one of the world’s most persistent and under-addressed human rights crises, with very little progress in two decades, according to a <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240116962\">landmark report</a> released today by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UN partners.</p><p>Nearly 1 in 3 women – estimated 840 million globally – have experienced partner or sexual violence during their lifetime, a figure that has barely changed since 2000. In the last 12 months alone, 316 million women – 11% of those aged 15 or older – were subjected to physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Progress on reducing intimate partner violence has been painfully slow with only 0.2% annual decline over the past two decades.</p><p>For the first time, the report includes national and regional estimates of sexual violence by someone other than a partner. It finds 263 million women have experienced non-partner sexual violence since age 15, a figure experts caution is significantly under-reported due to stigma and fear.</p><p>\"Violence against women is one of humanity’s oldest and most pervasive injustices, yet still one of the least acted upon,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"No society can call itself fair, safe or healthy while half its population lives in fear. Ending this violence is not only a matter of policy; it is a matter of dignity, equality and human rights. Behind every statistic is a woman or girl whose life has been forever altered.  Empowering women and girls is not optional, it's a prerequisite for peace, development and health. A safer world for women is a better world for everyone.\"</p><h3>Efforts face funding cuts amidst mounting needs</h3><p>The new report, released ahead of the <em>International day for the elimination of violence against women and girls</em> observed on 25 November, represents the most comprehensive study on the prevalence of these two forms of violence against women. It updates 2018 estimates released in 2021. It analyses data between 2000 and 2023 from 168 countries, revealing a stark picture of a deeply neglected crisis and critically underfunded response.</p><p>Despite mounting evidence on effective strategies to prevent violence against women, the report warns that funding for such initiatives is collapsing – just as when humanitarian emergencies, technological shifts, and rising socio-economic inequality are further increasing risks for millions of women and girls. For instance, in 2022, only 0.2% of the global development aid was allocated to programmes focused on prevention of violence against women, and funding has further fallen in 2025.</p><h3>Widespread and lifelong risks</h3><p>Women subjected to violence face unintended pregnancies, a higher risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections and experiencing depression. Sexual and reproductive health services are an important entry point for survivors to receive the high-quality care they need.</p><p>The report underscores the reality that violence against women begins early and risks persist throughout life. For example, in the past 12 months alone, 12.5 million adolescent girls 15-19 years of age or 16% have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner.</p><p>While violence occurs in every country, women in least-developed, conflict-affected, and climate-vulnerable settings are disproportionately affected. For example, Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) reports 38% prevalence of intimate partner violence in the past year – more than 3 times the global average of 11%.</p><h3>A call for action – and accountability</h3><p>More countries than ever are now collecting data to inform policies, yet significant gaps remain – particularly on non-partner sexual violence, marginalized groups such as indigenous women, migrants, and women with disabilities, as well as data from fragile and humanitarian settings. </p><p>Progress has been achieved in countries where there is political commitment to do so. For example, Cambodia is implementing a national project that will update legislation on domestic violence, improve service delivery, quality and access, refurbish shelters and leverage digital solutions in schools and communities to promote prevention especially with adolescents.</p><p>Ecuador, Liberia, Trinidad and Tobago and Uganda have developed costed national action plans.

The release of the new data coincides with  <a href=\"/campaigns/world-amr-awareness-week/2025\">World Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Awareness Week</a>, reinforcing the importance of global action against drug-resistant infections.  <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240021341\">EGASP,</a> launched by WHO in 2015, collects laboratory and clinical data from sentinel sites around the world to track AMR and inform treatment guidelines.<br/></p><p>“This global effort is essential to tracking, preventing, and responding to drug-resistant gonorrhoea and to protecting public health worldwide,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of the WHO Department for HIV, TB, Hepatitis &amp; STIs. “WHO calls on all countries to address the rising levels of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and integrate gonorrhoea surveillance into national STI programmes.” <br/></p><p>Between 2022 and 2024, resistance to ceftriaxone and cefixime, the primary antibiotics used to treat gonorrhoea, rose sharply from 0.8% to 5% and from 1.7% to 11% respectively, with resistant strains detected in more countries. Resistance to azithromycin remained stable at 4%, while resistance to ciprofloxacin reached 95%. Cambodia and Viet Nam reported the highest resistance rates.<br/></p><p>In 2024, 12 EGASP countries in five WHO regions provided data, an increase from just four countries in 2022. This is a positive development reflecting growing commitment to track and contain drug-resistant infections in countries and regions. The countries- Brazil, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malawi, the Philippines, Qatar, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, Uganda and Viet Nam reported 3615 cases of gonorrhoea.<br/></p><p>Over half of all cases of symptomatic gonorrhoea in men (52%) were reported from countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region, including the Philippines (28%), Viet Nam (12%), Cambodia (9%) and Indonesia (3%). Countries of the WHO African Region accounted for 28% of cases, followed by countries in the South-East Asia Region (13%, Thailand), the Eastern Mediterranean Region (4%, Qatar) and the Region of the Americas (2%, Brazil).<br/></p><p>The median patient age was 27 years (range: 12–94). Among cases, 20% were men who have sex with men, and 42% reported multiple sexual partners within the past 30 days. Eight percent reported recent antibiotic use, and 19% had travelled recently.<strong> </strong></p><h3>Strengthening and expanding global surveillance<br/></h3><p>In 2024, WHO advanced genomic surveillance, with nearly 3000 samples sequenced from eight countries.

This day of action builds on powerful momentum, with countries and partners uniting to launch ambitious vaccination campaigns, expand screening and treatment services, and accelerate progress toward eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem. </p><p>The annual commemoration highlights a critical opportunity: cervical cancer – the fourth most common cancer in women – claims over 350 000 lives each year, yet it is a disease that we have the tools to eliminate.</p><p>The Day supports the core pillars of the WHO’s global elimination strategy: vaccinating 90% of girls against human papillomavirus (HPV), screening 70% of women, and treating 90% of those with pre-cancer and invasive cancer. It serves as a critical platform to strengthen advocacy, accelerate service delivery, and mobilize resources to ensure every woman and girl has access to life-saving care.</p><p>\"In 2018, I was proud to launch the global call to action on cervical cancer elimination, and I'm even prouder now to see what was once a distant dream becoming a reality,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"More and more countries are scaling up HPV vaccination, improving screening, and expanding treatment, bringing us closer to a future free of cervical cancer.\"</p><p>This momentum is underscored by the announcement from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and its partners, who estimate that the ambitious goal to reach 86 million girls by the end of 2025 has been met, reflecting a broader wave of country action to advance national elimination plans and expand access to screening and treatment.</p><p>Countries are marking World Cervical Cancer Elimination Day with a wave of actions on multiple fronts.

Screening efforts are also intensifying, with Sierra Leone planning a mass campaign across all 16 districts, followed by an awareness walk.

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is marking its first official observance of World Prematurity Day with the launch of a new global clinical practice guide for Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) – a simple, proven and life-saving intervention that significantly improves survival for preterm and low birth weight babies.</p><p>Each year, an estimated 15 million babies are born too soon (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), and complications from preterm birth are the leading cause of death among children under five years of age. In the poorest countries, most extremely preterm babies die within days – whereas in high-income countries, almost all survive.</p><p>KMC – which combines prolonged skin to skin contact with breast-milk feeding – has been shown to dramatically improve outcomes for small and preterm newborns, and to be feasible and cost-effective in all settings. Among other positive impacts, it is associated with a more than 30% reduction in newborn deaths, a close to 70% reduction in hypothermia and a 15% reduction in severe infections – as well as improved weight gain and better longer-term health and cognitive development. </p><p>“KMC is not just a clinical intervention – it empowers mothers and families and transforms newborn care,” said Dr Jeremy Farrar, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Care. “It should now be universal clinical practice for all small and preterm babies, ensuring they have the best chance to survive and thrive.”</p><h2>A lifesaving intervention for all babies born early or small</h2><p>Geared at health workers, facility managers as well as caregivers, the new WHO guide offers detailed, step-by-step, adaptable guidance for initiating, maintaining, and monitoring KMC. It states that all preterm or low birth weight newborns should receive KMC starting immediately after birth - unless they are unable to breathe on their own or their blood pressure and circulation drops to dangerously low levels, requiring urgent treatment. </p><p>While mothers should typically be the primary providers, fathers and other family members can also give KMC if the mother is unable – as well as providing critical emotional and practical support. KMC can be practiced at all levels of health facilities – from the labour room or the operating theatre to postnatal wards and special or intensive newborn care units – and can be continued at home. </p><p>The guide includes practical tips on how to secure the baby in the KMC position, whether using simple cloth wraps, elastic binders or specially designed garments. It also outlines how health facilities create enabling environments for KMC through supportive policies and training staff. Family-friendly approaches are crucial for successful implementation, the guide notes – including ensuring mothers can always be together in the same room as their babies.</p><h2>All small and sick newborns need dedicated medical care and attention</h2><p>On this World Prematurity Day, with the theme ‘<em>A strong start for a hopeful future’</em>, WHO is calling on governments, health systems and partners to prioritize quality care for preterm and low birth weight babies. This means ensuring dedicated wards or facilities with specially trained neonatal staff providing round-the-clock care for small and sick newborns, as well as universal access to essential equipment and medicines like antibiotics. </p><p>Because they have less time in the womb, many preterm babies have underdeveloped lungs, brains, immune systems and capacity for temperature regulation. This increases risks from infections, hypothermia, heart problems, respiratory distress, and other life-threatening complications. </p><p>“No newborn should die from preventable causes,” said Dr Per Ashorn, WHO’s Unit Head for Newborn and Child Health and Development. “It’s time to ensure every baby gets the attention they need, by investing in special care for small or sick babies, alongside quality maternity services that can prevent many occurrences of preterm birth.”</p><p></p>",

    "content_html": "<p>Climate change is already driving a global health emergency, with over 540 000 people dying from extreme heat each year and 1 in 12 hospitals worldwide at risk of climate-related shutdowns, warns a new special report, released today jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Government of Brazil (COP30 Presidency) and the Brazilian Ministry of Health. </p><p>The <em><a href=\"/publications/m/item/cop30-special-report-on-climate-and-health\">COP30 Special report on health and climate change: <em>delivering the Belém Health Action Plan</em></a></em>, notes that rising temperatures and collapsing health systems are claiming more lives, and calls for immediate and coordinated action to protect health in a rapidly warming world. It follows the launch of the Belém Health Action Plan, a flagship initiative of Brazil’s COP 30 Presidency, unveiled on the dedicated Health Day of COP30 – 13 November 2025. </p><p>“The climate crisis is a health crisis - not in the distant future, but here and now,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This special report provides evidence on the impact of climate change on individuals and health systems, and real-world examples of what countries can do - and are doing - to protect health and strengthen health systems.”</p><p>With global temperatures now exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the world is already experiencing mounting health impacts. The report finds that 3.3 to 3.6 billion people already live in areas highly vulnerable to climate change, and hospitals are facing 41% higher risk of damage from extreme weather-related impact compared to 1990. This underscores the urgent need to strengthen and adapt health systems to protect communities from climate-related shocks. </p><p>Without rapid decarbonization, the number of health facilities at risk could double by mid-century, which stresses the critical importance of implementing adaptation measures to safeguard health infrastructure. The health sector itself contributes around 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and needs rapid transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient systems. </p><p>The report identifies persistent gaps that require urgent attention. Only 54% of national health adaptation plans assess risks to health facilities, and fewer than 30% of health adaptation studies consider income, 20% consider gender, and less than 1% include people with disabilities.</p><p>“The evidence is clear: protecting health systems is one of the smartest investments any country can make,” said Professor Nick Watts, Chair of the Expert Advisory Group and Director, NUS Centre for Sustainable Medicine. “Allocating just 7% of adaptation finance to health would safeguard billions of people and keep essential services operating during climate shocks – when our patients most need them.”</p><p>There is progress being made; between 2015 and 2023, the number of countries with national Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems (MHEWS) doubled to 101, now covering about two-thirds of the global population. However, only 46% of Least Developed Countries and 39% of Small Island Developing States have effective systems in place.</p><p>The report’s central message is clear: there is now more than enough evidence to scale up action, today. Cost-effective, high-impact, and no-regret interventions exist for each component of the Belém Health Action Plan.  But adaptation strategies could ultimately fail unless they address the root causes of health inequity – both within health systems and across society. </p><p>The report calls on governments to:</p><ul><li><strong>Integrate health objectives</strong> into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs);</li><li>Harness the financial savings from decarbonization to <strong>fund health adaptation</strong> and workforce capacity;</li><li><strong>Invest in resilient infrastructure</strong>, prioritizing health facilities and essential services; and </li><li><strong>Empower communities</strong> and local knowledge systems to shape responses that reflect lived realities.</li></ul><p>The Government of Brazil also released a companion report, <em><a href=\"/publications/m/item/cop30-special-report-on-social-participation\">Social participation, climate and health: a special report to support implementation of the Belém Health Action Plan</a></em>, which focuses on social participation, governance, and community engagement as a critical dimension of the Belém Health Action Plan. The report highlights that climate change poses profound risks to human health, particularly for vulnerable and historically marginalized populations, and that effective adaptation requires the active involvement of communities in designing, implementing, and monitoring health policies. </p><p>“By releasing this report, Brazil and WHO reaffirm the importance of COP30 as the COP of Truth. The report provides clear data and evidence that climate change is already directly affecting health systems around the world,” says Dr Alexandre Padilha, Minister of Health, Brazil. “Recent tragedies show that now is the time to implement policies and actions that address the impacts of climate change on health. The Belém Health Action Plan and this report offer countries the tools they need to turn scientific evidence into concrete action.”</p><p>Together, the two reports provide complementary pathways for translating the Plan’s objectives into practice - one focused on evidence and implementation, the other on inclusive participation and leadership across societies. </p><h2>About the Belém Health Action Plan</h2><p>The Belém Health Action Plan, a flagship outcome of Brazil’s COP 30 Presidency, is structured around two cross cutting principles and concepts: health equity and ‘climate justice’ and leadership and governance on climate and health with social participation.</p><p>The Plan also outlines three lines of action for climate-resilient health systems: </p><ul><li><strong>Surveillance and monitoring</strong>, focused on strengthening integrated and climate-informed health surveillance;</li><li><strong>Evidence-based policies, strategies and capacity-building</strong>, aimed at enhancing the ability of national and local systems to implement effective, equity-driven solutions; and </li><li><strong>Innovation, production, and digital health</strong>, which promotes research, development, and access to technologies that meet the health needs of diverse populations. </li></ul><p>The <em>COP30 special report</em> was prepared under the guidance of an Expert Advisory Group of global public health leaders, chaired by the NUS Centre for Sustainable Medicine and with the leadership of the WHO and the Brazilian Ministry of Health.

Among the 30 high TB burden countries, social protection coverage remains highly unequal, ranging from 3.1% in Uganda to 94% in Mongolia.

Confronting these drivers, alongside structural determinants such as poverty, requires coordinated multisectoral action.</p><h3>Funding gaps endanger progress and research</h3><p>Despite many gains, global progress levels remain far from meeting the End TB Strategy targets. A major obstacle is global funding for TB, which has stagnated since 2020. In 2024, only US$5.9 billion was available for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment--just over a quarter of the US$22 billion annual target set for 2027.</p><p>Cuts to international donor funding from 2025 onward pose a serious challenge.

As of August 2025, 63 diagnostic tests were in development and 29 drugs were in clinical trials--up from just 8 in 2015.

It is the seventh country in WHO EMR to achieve this milestone. The validation of Egypt’s achievement brings the total number of countries that have eliminated trachoma as a public health problem worldwide to 27.<br/></p><p>“I congratulate Egypt for reaching this milestone and liberating its people from trachoma,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.  “This demonstrates the effectiveness of sustained national leadership, strong surveillance and community engagement in ending a disease that has afflicted humanity since antiquity.”<br/></p><p>Following Egypt’s success, Trachoma remains a public health problem in 30 countries and is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people. Blindness from trachoma is difficult to reverse. Based on April 2025 data, 103 million people live in trachoma endemic areas and are at risk of trachoma blindness.<br/></p><h3>A century-long journey against trachoma<br/></h3><p>Trachoma has been documented in Egypt for over 3,000 years. Public health efforts to address its burden began in the early 20th century, when pioneering ophthalmologist Arthur Ferguson MacCallan established Egypt’s first mobile and permanent eye hospitals and laid the groundwork for organized trachoma control globally.

    "content_html": "<p>The 43rd meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR or Regulations) on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO Director-General on 01 October 2025 with eight out of nine Committee members and the adviser meeting via video conference with affected countries, supported by the WHO Secretariat. The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in the context of the global target of interruption and certification of WPV1 eradication by 2027 and interruption and certification of cVDPV2 elimination by 2029. Technical updates were received about the situation in the following countries: Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Germany, Israel, and Pakistan. The Committee reviewed detailed written updates on the situation in Afghanistan.</p><p>Amendments to the IHR, adopted by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly, through resolution WHA77.17 in June 2024, entered into force on 19 September 2025 for 182 of 196 States Parties.[1] The 43rd meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on polioviruses, held on 01 October 2025, was the first under the amended Regulations. Key amendments to the IHR include, <em>inter alia</em>, broader poliovirus notification requirements; the introduction of the determination of “pandemic emergency”[2], a higher level of global public health alert with respect to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC); measures to strengthen equitable access to relevant health products; and recognition of health documents in non-digital and digital formats.</p><h2>Wild poliovirus</h2><p>Since the last Emergency Committee meeting (18 June 2025), 15 new WPV1 cases have been reported from the two endemic countries, Afghanistan (2) and Pakistan (13). The cases in Afghanistan were reported from the South and East Regions of the country, while in Pakistan the cases were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh provinces. In 2025 (as of 17 September), 28 WPV1 cases have been reported: 4 in Afghanistan and 24 in Pakistan. This compares to 99 WPV1 cases reported in all of 2024. For environmental surveillance, a total of 443 WPV1 positive samples have been reported so far in 2025 (53 from Afghanistan and 390 from Pakistan), compared to 741 positive samples reported during all of 2024 (113 from Afghanistan and 628 from Pakistan).</p><p>The Committee noted with concern the ongoing WPV1 transmission in both endemic countries, particularly along the southern (South Afghanistan – Quetta Block) and central (Northwest Pakistan/South KP – Southeast Afghanistan) cross-border epidemiological corridors.</p><p>In Pakistan, WPV1 continues to be detected in environmental samples across all four major provinces. Transmission remains most intense in South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), as indicated by continued reporting of WPV1 cases and positive environmental isolates. Although Karachi in Sindh Province has not reported any WPV1 cases in 2025, ongoing detections in environmental samples indicate continued transmission within the city. A decline in both WPV1 cases and environmental detections has been observed in the Quetta Block and Peshawar. Active WPV1 transmission is also being detected in 2025 in Lahore, Punjab Province, and several districts within the Central Pakistan epidemiological block. In Afghanistan, intense transmission continues in the southern region, detected through both acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance. WPV1 transmission in Afghanistan’s eastern region has declined significantly in 2025, indicating improvement in population immunity levels.</p><p>Regarding molecular epidemiology, there has been an overall decrease in genetic biodiversity between 2020 and 2023. However, an increase in the genetic biodiversity was observed in 2024, necessitating a split of two genetic clusters into eight genetic clusters, three of which are active in 2025. The remaining chains of transmission continue to circulate in populations and geographies with persistently low immunization coverage, including the bordering districts of the southern and northern epidemiological corridors across the two endemic countries.</p><p>Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to implement an intensive and mostly synchronized campaign schedule, with a focus on achieving high vaccination coverage in core reservoirs and ensuring timely, effective response to WPV1 detections in other areas of each country. Afghanistan implemented two nationwide and three sub-national vaccination rounds while Pakistan implemented three nationwide and one sub-national vaccination during the first half of 2025.</p><p>In Afghanistan, campaigns are being conducted using the site-to-site strategy, with focused efforts to strengthen operational and communication approaches to maximize coverage of target children under this modality. House-to-house campaigns are not being implemented since October 2024 due to security concerns, limiting full campaign access to all the children. The Committee expressed concern that site-to-site campaigns often fail to reach all children, particularly younger children, which could contribute to further geographic spread within Afghanistan and beyond. In Pakistan, the programme is facing challenges in consistently and effectively reaching all target children in South KP, the area currently experiencing the most intense WPV1 transmission in the country; more than 250 000 children remain unreached, primarily due to access constraints caused by insecurity.</p><p>The Committee noted with appreciation the strong leadership and high-level commitment to polio eradication in Pakistan at all levels, including the direct engagement of the Prime Minister, the Federal Minister for Health, and the Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication. The Committee also acknowledged the consistently high reported coverage and Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) pass rates at the national and provincial levels. However, the Committee observed variability in campaign quality at the district and sub-district levels, attributed to operational challenges and prevailing insecurity, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan provinces. The Committee also noted the continued detection of WPV1 in Karachi despite high reported vaccination coverage during recent campaigns. Stopping WPV1 transmission will require translating Pakistan’s strong political and programmatic commitment into high-quality implementation of vaccination plans, in line with the recommendations of the Technical Advisory Group, during the upcoming low-transmission season. Particular focus will be needed on core reservoirs and areas of persistent transmission.</p><p>In addition to seasonal population movement within and between the two endemic countries, the ongoing return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan continues to compound the programme’s operational challenges. This population displacement increases the risk of cross-border and internal poliovirus transmission in both countries. The Committee noted that this risk is being mitigated through vaccination at border crossing points and by updating micro-plans in areas of origin and return. The Committee also recognized the strong coordination mechanisms between the Afghanistan and Pakistan programmes at both national and subnational levels and encouraged the continuation of these collaborative efforts. It will be essential to maintain synchronized campaigns between Afghanistan and Pakistan and to achieve uniformly high vaccination coverage in border areas of both countries to interrupt WPV1 transmission in a comprehensive manner.</p><p>In summary, available data indicate that global WPV1 transmission remains geographically confined to the two endemic countries. However, during 2024 and 2025, there has been geographic spread alongside continued transmission within core reservoir areas in both the endemic countries.</p><h2>Circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV)</h2><p>In 2025, a total of 143 cVDPV cases have been reported (as of 17 September), 136 of which are cVDPV2, five are cVDPV3 and two are cVDPV1 cases. Additionally, 141 environmental samples have tested positive for cVDPV, including 11 cVDPV1, 121 cVDPV2 and nine environmental samples that tested positive for both cVDPV1 and cVDPV2. In 2024, a total of 463 cVDPV cases were reported, including 448 cVDPV2, 11 cVDPV1, and 4 cVDPV3 cases. During the same year, 291 environmental samples tested positive for cVDPV, 288 cVDPV2 and three cVDPV3. Since the last Emergency Committee meeting, new cVDPV1 outbreaks have been reported in Algeria, Djibouti, and Israel. Recently, Cameroon and Chad have reported cVDPV3 outbreaks, while the 2024 cVDPV3 outbreak in Guinea has continued into 2025.</p><p>Nigeria and Chad in the Lake Chad Basin, along with Yemen and Ethiopia in the Horn of Africa, are the major contributors to the global cVDPV2 caseload in 2025. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia, which previously experienced intense cVDPV2 transmission, have shown a significant decline in transmission intensity in 2025. However, challenges persist in ensuring operational quality and reaching all children during polio vaccination campaigns.</p><p>A total of 20 circulating cVDPV2 emergence groups have been detected so far in 2025, compared to 31 in 2024, and 27 in 2023. Of the 20 emergence groups identified in 2025, five are newly detected this year: two derived from the novel OPV2 vaccine, while the origin of the other three is under investigation. Since its introduction in 2021, approximately 2 billion doses of nOPV2 have been administered and a total of 32 cVDPV2 emergences have been associated with nOPV2. The Committee noted that nOPV2 continues to demonstrate significantly greater genetic stability and a substantially lower risk of reversion to neurovirulence compared to Sabin OPV2.</p><p>In 2025, two cVDPV1 cases have been reported to date, one each from Algeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). In addition, cVDPV1 outbreaks have been confirmed in Djibouti and Israel, based on environmental surveillance detections (nine from Djibouti and ten from Israel).</p><p>Cameroon and Chad reported co-circulation of type 2 and type 3 cVDPV in 2025. The same cVDPV3 emergence caused outbreaks in both countries, with one cVDPV3 case in Cameroon (paralysis onset in May 2025) and two in Chad (onsets in June and July 2025). The cVDPV3 outbreak in Guinea, first detected in 2024, has continued into 2025. In total, Guinea reported six cVDPV3 cases during 2024–2025.</p><p>The Committee noted that although global transmission of cVDPV1 and cVDPV3 remains at lower levels compared to cVDPV2, the upward trend observed in 2025 is a concern. This underscores the critical importance of sustaining high population immunity against type 1 and type 3 polioviruses through robust routine immunization, as well as ensuring timely and high-quality response activities in the event of any detections.</p><p>The Committee noted that the risk of cVDPV outbreaks is largely driven by a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, high concentrations of zero-dose and under-immunized children, and ongoing population displacement.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><ol><li>The Committee unanimously concluded that the risk of international spread of poliovirus continues to constitute a <em>Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)</em> and recommended extending the Temporary Recommendations for a further three months.</li><li>The Committee, after a thorough review of the epidemiological and programmatic situation, unanimously concluded that the event does not constitute a <em>pandemic emergency</em>.</li></ol><p>In reaching the conclusion that the risk of international spread of poliovirus continues to constitute a <em>PHEIC</em>, the Committee considered the following factors:</p><h3>Ongoing risk of WPV1 international spread</h3><p>The Committee noted that the risk of international spread of WPV1 persists due to the following factors:</p><ul><li>Re-established and intense WPV1 transmission in the core reservoirs, particularly in the southern region of Afghanistan and Karachi and South KP in Pakistan.</li><li>Geographical expansion and established transmission of WPV1 in epidemiologically critical areas, including Central Pakistan and parts of Punjab Province.</li><li>Persistent inconsistencies in campaign quality and a substantial number of unimmunized and under-immunized children in some key areas, driven by access constraints due to insecurity (e.g. South KP), sub-optimal operational performance (e.g. site-to-site vaccination modality in Afghanistan and uneven quality in parts of Pakistan), and vaccine hesitancy in certain communities (e.g. South KP, Quetta Block, Southeast Afghanistan), all contributing to gaps in the population immunity.</li><li>Ongoing population movement between the two endemic countries, including the returnees from Pakistan to Afghanistan, leading to cross-border WPV1 transmission.</li><li>Population movement from the two endemic countries to other neighbouring and distant countries, constituting risk of international spread.</li></ul><h3>Ongoing risk of cVDPV international spread</h3><p>Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of cVDPV appears to remain high:</p><ul><li>Continued cVDPV2 transmission in Lake Chad Basin, particularly in high-risk areas of Nigeria, with continued potential for amplification of spread.</li><li>Intense cVDPV2 transmission in the Horn of Africa, especially in Ethiopia. The Horn of Africa countries continue to experience overlapping humanitarian and health emergencies, making it challenging to implement high-quality vaccination campaigns in a timely manner.</li><li>A large pool of unimmunized and susceptible children in the northern governorates of Yemen, where a proper OPV response to the ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak has not yet been implemented due to insecurity and lack of access. Challenges also persist regarding timely shipment of AFP stool specimens from these areas. Full access to all children in southern and central Somalia also remains a significant challenge.</li><li>A widening gap in intestinal mucosal immunity among young children since the global withdrawal of OPV2 in 2016, as well as high concentration of zero dose children in certain areas.</li><li>New cVDPV1 outbreaks in Algeria, Djibouti, and Israel, and cVDPV3 outbreaks in Cameroon, Chad and Guinea indicate continued low routine immunization and IPV coverage in several countries and associated immunity gap. The risk of new and expanding cVDPV1 and cVDPV3 outbreaks appears to have increased in 2025.</li><li>Ongoing cross-border transmission, including spread into newly re-infected countries and territories — with Cameroon and Chad reporting new cVDPV3 outbreaks, and Algeria, Djibouti, and Israel reporting new cVDPV1 outbreaks.</li></ul><p><strong>Additional contributing factors include:</strong></p><ul><li>Sub-optimal routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by humanitarian emergencies including conflict and protracted complex emergencies. This growing vulnerability leaves populations in fragile states at increased risk of polio outbreaks.</li><li>Ongoing insecurity and conflict in several areas that serve as persistent source of cVDPV transmission.</li><li>Lack of access: Inaccessibility remains a major risk, particularly in northern Yemen and Somalia, where sizable populations have remained unreached with polio vaccine for extended periods of more than a year.</li><li>The current resource-constrained environment further challenges the full and effective implementation of critical eradication activities.</li></ul><h2>Risk categories</h2><p>The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:</p><ol><li>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3.</li><li>States infected with cVDPV2, with or without evidence of local transmission.</li><li>States previously infected by WPV1 or cVDPV within the last 24 months (last detection &gt; 13 months).</li></ol><p>Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:</p><ul><li>Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the date of onset of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.</li><li>Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period.</li><li>These criteria may be varied for the WPV1 endemic countries and countries with longstanding persistent polio outbreaks, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance quality.</li></ul><p>Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will remain on a ‘watch list’ for a further 12 months as a period of heightened monitoring. After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations.</p><h2>Temporary recommendations</h2><p><strong>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread</strong><br/><em>(as of data available at WHO HQ on 04 June 2025)</em><br/></p><table style=\"margin-right:auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\"><strong>WPV1</strong></td><td style=\"width:50%;\"> </td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\">Afghanistan</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 24 Aug 2025</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\">Pakistan </td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 07 Aug 2025</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\"> </td><td style=\"width:50%;\"> </td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\"><strong>cVDPV1</strong></td><td style=\"width:50%;\"> </td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\">Algeria</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 17 Mar 2025</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\">DR Congo</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 25 Jun 2025</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\">Djibouti </td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 04 May 2025</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\">Israel</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 09 Jul 2025</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\"> </td><td style=\"width:50%;\"> </td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\"><strong>cVDPV3</strong></td><td style=\"width:50%;\"> </td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\">Cameroon</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 30 May 2025</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\">Chad</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 22 Jul 2025</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:50%;\">Guinea</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 07 Mar 2025</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p>These countries should:</p><ul><li>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.</li><li>Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (&gt; four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.</li><li>Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers.</li><li>Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in accordance with the Model International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP), contained in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.

The Committee appreciated the comprehensive and consultative process undertaken by the GPEI in formulating the plan. However, the Committee expressed concern that the current financial shortfall, estimated at nearly 30%, poses a significant risk to all components of the programme, including the ability to maintain sensitive poliovirus surveillance. These risks are further compounded by concurrent funding constraints across WHO, international partners, and national governments, reflecting wider fiscal pressures across the global health landscape. The Committee therefore urged donor countries and partner organizations to strengthen their financial support, emphasizing that the consequences of underfunding could be substantial and far-reaching. The Committee also called on national governments to prioritize polio eradication within their domestic frame mechanisms to safeguard the gains made and sustain progress toward global eradication.</p><p>The Committee emphasized the critical importance of robust monitoring of the implementation of the GPEI Action Plan to enable early identification and timely mitigation of emerging risks and gaps. This monitoring should comprehensively cover all programme components, including immunization activities as well as field and laboratory surveillance.</p><p>The Committee noted that WPV1 transmission has persisted with a generally high force of infection in the two endemic countries during the high transmission season. While transmission remains widespread, it continues to be driven by core reservoirs and persistent transmission zones—particularly South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Karachi in Pakistan, and the Southern Region of Afghanistan. The Committee recognized that the current momentum of the Pakistan programme, together with the forthcoming low transmission season, presents a critical opportunity to interrupt WPV1 transmission during the first half of 2026. Achieving this goal will depend heavily on progress in South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Karachi, and Southern Afghanistan. The Committee urged the Afghanistan polio programme to explore feasible options for transitioning to house-to-house vaccination, noting that site-to-site campaigns have not yet achieved the level of coverage and quality required for eradication. </p><p>The Committee emphasized the need for a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach in both endemic countries, extending to the district level, to achieve the quality required in polio eradication activities to stop WPV1 transmission. Such an approach is more critical than ever to sustain global confidence and continued support for the polio eradication effort.</p><p>The Committee noted the continued transmission of cVDPV2 in the African Region, particularly in the Lake Chad Basin and the Horn of Africa. While the overall number of cVDPV2 cases has declined over the past two years, the Committee expressed concern about ongoing transmission in Algeria, Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Although Nigeria has recently reported a decrease in cVDPV2 cases, transmission persists in several critical areas, posing a risk to the progress achieved elsewhere in the country. In Somalia, a downward trend in cVDPV2 detections appears to be emerging; however, given the persistent challenges in accessing children in south and central Somalia, this must be interpreted with caution, and heightened vigilance must be maintained. The Committee also acknowledged the ongoing difficulties in implementing immunization responses in the northern governorates of Yemen, where cVDPV2 transmission continues.</p><p>The Committee noted the initiation of vaccination activities in response to the cVDPV2 outbreak in Papua New Guinea. Given the very low population immunity against type 2 poliovirus, the Committee emphasized the need to ensure high-quality implementation of the vaccination response. The Committee stressed that urgent measures are required to strengthen surveillance, including addressing silent areas for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, to minimize the risk of undetected cVDPV2 circulation and to effectively monitor progress.</p><p>Although the risk of international spread of cVDPV1 and cVDPV3 is considerably lower than that of cVDPV2, the Committee expressed concern over the recent cVDPV1 outbreaks in Algeria, Djibouti, and Israel, and the cVDPV3 outbreaks in Cameroon, Chad, and Guinea, which warrant continued vigilance. These outbreaks highlight the existence of population pockets with low immunity to type 1 and type 3 polioviruses and underscore the need to strengthen routine immunization. The Committee recommended ensuring high-quality response to these outbreaks to prevent further geographical spread.</p><p>The Committee noted that many countries affected by cVDPV continue to experience conflict and insecurity, disrupting both routine immunization services and polio vaccination campaigns. The Committee also noted that concurrent health emergencies and disease outbreaks in several countries further complicate the timely and effective implementation of vaccination response. Acknowledging the diverse and often complex operating environments at national and sub-national levels, the Committee emphasized the importance of context-specific operational and social mobilization interventions to ensure high-quality campaign delivery and ultimately interrupt cVDPV transmission. The Committee also highlighted the need for coordinated sub-regional strategies and strengthened cross-border collaboration to overcome challenges posed by porous borders and shared operational constraints across the polio outbreak affected countries.</p><p>The Committee noted the continued cross-border spread of cVDPV2 in the African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, the detection of cVDPV2 in multiple countries of the European Region, and the detection of cVDPV2 in Papua New Guinea linked to the 2024 transmission in Indonesia. The Committee also noted the shared cVDPV3 transmission in Chad and Cameroon. These developments underscore that polio remains a global threat until eradication is fully achieved. The Committee emphasized the critical importance of maintaining sensitive surveillance systems in polio-affected and high-risk countries and recommended that the GPEI provide all necessary support under the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan. The Committee underscored the importance of preserving the capacity of the Global Polio Laboratory Network to continue supporting eradication efforts through timely and accurate detection of polioviruses. The Committee noted the need for high-income countries to sustain high-quality poliovirus surveillance, given the persistent risk of importation, as recently demonstrated by detections in the European Region. Robust surveillance remains essential for early detection and timely response to both importations and newly emerging outbreaks. The Committee recommended that programme messaging on the international spread of polioviruses be tailored to the specific context and setting, including ensuring appropriate communication in high-income countries, with the aim of fostering understanding and sustained support for global polio eradication efforts.</p><p>The Committee recognized the critical role that mobile and migrant populations play in sustaining WPV1 transmission in endemic countries, as well as cVDPV transmission in the African Region and globally. The Committee urged that vaccinating populations on the move be treated as a top priority, emphasizing the importance of identifying different categories of mobile populations such as seasonal, economic, and agricultural migrants, and reaching them through country-specific, tailored strategies and approaches.</p><p>The Committee noted that novel OPV2 continues to demonstrate greater genetic stability compared to Sabin OPV2. However, the risk of new cVDPV2 emergences increases when the interval between outbreak response campaigns exceeds four weeks or when vaccination quality is suboptimal, underscoring the need for timely and high-quality immunization efforts. </p><p>The Committee noted that the amendments to the IHR, adopted by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly through resolution WHA77.17, entered into force on 19 September 2025 for 182 of the 196 States Parties. The Committee took the amended International Health Regulations into account during its deliberations and in reviewing and advising on the Temporary Recommendations.</p><p>Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPVs, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment, and on 10 November 2025 determined that the poliovirus situation continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The poliovirus situation, however, does not constitute a pandemic emergency. </p><p>The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States previously infected by WPV1 or cVDPV within the last 24 months’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective, 10 November 2025.<br/></p><p>--------</p><p>[1] The text of the International Health Regulations (2005), as amended in 2014, 2022 and 2024 is available at <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/bd/pdf_files/IHR_2014-2022-2024-en.pdf\">https://apps.who.int/gb/bd/pdf_files/IHR_2014-2022-2024-en.pdf</a> [accessed on 21 October 2025].</p><p>[2] Under amended Article 1 of the IHR, “pandemic emergency” is defined as “a public health emergency of international concern that is caused by a communicable disease and:<br/>(i) has, or is at high risk of having, wide geographical spread to and within multiple States; and<br/>(ii) is exceeding, or is at high risk of exceeding, the capacity of health systems to respond in those States; and<br/>(iii) is causing, or is at high risk of causing, substantial social and/or economic disruption, including disruption to international traffic and trade; and<br/>(iv) requires rapid, equitable and enhanced coordinated international action, with whole-of government and whole-of-society approaches.</p><p> </p>",

          "Since the last Emergency Committee meeting (18 June 2025), 15 new WPV1 cases have been reported from the two endemic countries, Afghanistan (2) and Pakistan (13). The cases in Afghanistan were reported from the South and East Regions of the country, while in Pakistan the cases were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh provinces. In 2025 (as of 17 September), 28 WPV1 cases have been reported: 4 in Afghanistan and 24 in Pakistan. This compares to 99 WPV1 cases reported in all of 2024. For environmental surveillance, a total of 443 WPV1 positive samples have been reported so far in 2025 (53 from Afghanistan and 390 from Pakistan), compared to 741 positive samples reported during all of 2024 (113 from Afghanistan and 628 from Pakistan).",
          "The Committee noted with concern the ongoing WPV1 transmission in both endemic countries, particularly along the southern (South Afghanistan – Quetta Block) and central (Northwest Pakistan/South KP – Southeast Afghanistan) cross-border epidemiological corridors.",
          "In Pakistan, WPV1 continues to be detected in environmental samples across all four major provinces. Transmission remains most intense in South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), as indicated by continued reporting of WPV1 cases and positive environmental isolates. Although Karachi in Sindh Province has not reported any WPV1 cases in 2025, ongoing detections in environmental samples indicate continued transmission within the city. A decline in both WPV1 cases and environmental detections has been observed in the Quetta Block and Peshawar. Active WPV1 transmission is also being detected in 2025 in Lahore, Punjab Province, and several districts within the Central Pakistan epidemiological block. In Afghanistan, intense transmission continues in the southern region, detected through both acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance. WPV1 transmission in Afghanistan’s eastern region has declined significantly in 2025, indicating improvement in population immunity levels.",
          "Regarding molecular epidemiology, there has been an overall decrease in genetic biodiversity between 2020 and 2023. However, an increase in the genetic biodiversity was observed in 2024, necessitating a split of two genetic clusters into eight genetic clusters, three of which are active in 2025. The remaining chains of transmission continue to circulate in populations and geographies with persistently low immunization coverage, including the bordering districts of the southern and northern epidemiological corridors across the two endemic countries.",
          "Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to implement an intensive and mostly synchronized campaign schedule, with a focus on achieving high vaccination coverage in core reservoirs and ensuring timely, effective response to WPV1 detections in other areas of each country. Afghanistan implemented two nationwide and three sub-national vaccination rounds while Pakistan implemented three nationwide and one sub-national vaccination during the first half of 2025.",
          "In Afghanistan, campaigns are being conducted using the site-to-site strategy, with focused efforts to strengthen operational and communication approaches to maximize coverage of target children under this modality. House-to-house campaigns are not being implemented since October 2024 due to security concerns, limiting full campaign access to all the children. The Committee expressed concern that site-to-site campaigns often fail to reach all children, particularly younger children, which could contribute to further geographic spread within Afghanistan and beyond. In Pakistan, the programme is facing challenges in consistently and effectively reaching all target children in South KP, the area currently experiencing the most intense WPV1 transmission in the country; more than 250 000 children remain unreached, primarily due to access constraints caused by insecurity.",
          "The Committee noted with appreciation the strong leadership and high-level commitment to polio eradication in Pakistan at all levels, including the direct engagement of the Prime Minister, the Federal Minister for Health, and the Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication. The Committee also acknowledged the consistently high reported coverage and Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) pass rates at the national and provincial levels. However, the Committee observed variability in campaign quality at the district and sub-district levels, attributed to operational challenges and prevailing insecurity, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan provinces. The Committee also noted the continued detection of WPV1 in Karachi despite high reported vaccination coverage during recent campaigns. Stopping WPV1 transmission will require translating Pakistan’s strong political and programmatic commitment into high-quality implementation of vaccination plans, in line with the recommendations of the Technical Advisory Group, during the upcoming low-transmission season. Particular focus will be needed on core reservoirs and areas of persistent transmission.",
          "In addition to seasonal population movement within and between the two endemic countries, the ongoing return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan continues to compound the programme’s operational challenges. This population displacement increases the risk of cross-border and internal poliovirus transmission in both countries. The Committee noted that this risk is being mitigated through vaccination at border crossing points and by updating micro-plans in areas of origin and return. The Committee also recognized the strong coordination mechanisms between the Afghanistan and Pakistan programmes at both national and subnational levels and encouraged the continuation of these collaborative efforts. It will be essential to maintain synchronized campaigns between Afghanistan and Pakistan and to achieve uniformly high vaccination coverage in border areas of both countries to interrupt WPV1 transmission in a comprehensive manner.",
          "In summary, available data indicate that global WPV1 transmission remains geographically confined to the two endemic countries. However, during 2024 and 2025, there has been geographic spread alongside continued transmission within core reservoir areas in both the endemic countries."

          "Nigeria and Chad in the Lake Chad Basin, along with Yemen and Ethiopia in the Horn of Africa, are the major contributors to the global cVDPV2 caseload in 2025. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia, which previously experienced intense cVDPV2 transmission, have shown a significant decline in transmission intensity in 2025. However, challenges persist in ensuring operational quality and reaching all children during polio vaccination campaigns.",
          "A total of 20 circulating cVDPV2 emergence groups have been detected so far in 2025, compared to 31 in 2024, and 27 in 2023. Of the 20 emergence groups identified in 2025, five are newly detected this year: two derived from the novel OPV2 vaccine, while the origin of the other three is under investigation. Since its introduction in 2021, approximately 2 billion doses of nOPV2 have been administered and a total of 32 cVDPV2 emergences have been associated with nOPV2. The Committee noted that nOPV2 continues to demonstrate significantly greater genetic stability and a substantially lower risk of reversion to neurovirulence compared to Sabin OPV2.",
          "In 2025, two cVDPV1 cases have been reported to date, one each from Algeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). In addition, cVDPV1 outbreaks have been confirmed in Djibouti and Israel, based on environmental surveillance detections (nine from Djibouti and ten from Israel).",
          "Cameroon and Chad reported co-circulation of type 2 and type 3 cVDPV in 2025. The same cVDPV3 emergence caused outbreaks in both countries, with one cVDPV3 case in Cameroon (paralysis onset in May 2025) and two in Chad (onsets in June and July 2025). The cVDPV3 outbreak in Guinea, first detected in 2024, has continued into 2025. In total, Guinea reported six cVDPV3 cases during 2024–2025.",
          "The Committee noted that although global transmission of cVDPV1 and cVDPV3 remains at lower levels compared to cVDPV2, the upward trend observed in 2025 is a concern. This underscores the critical importance of sustaining high population immunity against type 1 and type 3 polioviruses through robust routine immunization, as well as ensuring timely and high-quality response activities in the event of any detections.",
          "The Committee noted that the risk of cVDPV outbreaks is largely driven by a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, high concentrations of zero-dose and under-immunized children, and ongoing population displacement."

        "content": [
          "The Committee noted that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has developed an Action Plan aimed at sustaining and enhancing programme operations to achieve the goals of the GPEI Strategy, within the limits of available resources. The Committee appreciated the comprehensive and consultative process undertaken by the GPEI in formulating the plan. However, the Committee expressed concern that the current financial shortfall, estimated at nearly 30%, poses a significant risk to all components of the programme, including the ability to maintain sensitive poliovirus surveillance. These risks are further compounded by concurrent funding constraints across WHO, international partners, and national governments, reflecting wider fiscal pressures across the global health landscape. The Committee therefore urged donor countries and partner organizations to strengthen their financial support, emphasizing that the consequences of underfunding could be substantial and far-reaching. The Committee also called on national governments to prioritize polio eradication within their domestic frame mechanisms to safeguard the gains made and sustain progress toward global eradication.",
          "The Committee emphasized the critical importance of robust monitoring of the implementation of the GPEI Action Plan to enable early identification and timely mitigation of emerging risks and gaps. This monitoring should comprehensively cover all programme components, including immunization activities as well as field and laboratory surveillance.",
          "The Committee noted that WPV1 transmission has persisted with a generally high force of infection in the two endemic countries during the high transmission season. While transmission remains widespread, it continues to be driven by core reservoirs and persistent transmission zones—particularly South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Karachi in Pakistan, and the Southern Region of Afghanistan. The Committee recognized that the current momentum of the Pakistan programme, together with the forthcoming low transmission season, presents a critical opportunity to interrupt WPV1 transmission during the first half of 2026. Achieving this goal will depend heavily on progress in South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Karachi, and Southern Afghanistan. The Committee urged the Afghanistan polio programme to explore feasible options for transitioning to house-to-house vaccination, noting that site-to-site campaigns have not yet achieved the level of coverage and quality required for eradication.",
          "The Committee emphasized the need for a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach in both endemic countries, extending to the district level, to achieve the quality required in polio eradication activities to stop WPV1 transmission. Such an approach is more critical than ever to sustain global confidence and continued support for the polio eradication effort.",
          "The Committee noted the continued transmission of cVDPV2 in the African Region, particularly in the Lake Chad Basin and the Horn of Africa. While the overall number of cVDPV2 cases has declined over the past two years, the Committee expressed concern about ongoing transmission in Algeria, Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Although Nigeria has recently reported a decrease in cVDPV2 cases, transmission persists in several critical areas, posing a risk to the progress achieved elsewhere in the country. In Somalia, a downward trend in cVDPV2 detections appears to be emerging; however, given the persistent challenges in accessing children in south and central Somalia, this must be interpreted with caution, and heightened vigilance must be maintained. The Committee also acknowledged the ongoing difficulties in implementing immunization responses in the northern governorates of Yemen, where cVDPV2 transmission continues.",
          "The Committee noted the initiation of vaccination activities in response to the cVDPV2 outbreak in Papua New Guinea. Given the very low population immunity against type 2 poliovirus, the Committee emphasized the need to ensure high-quality implementation of the vaccination response. The Committee stressed that urgent measures are required to strengthen surveillance, including addressing silent areas for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, to minimize the risk of undetected cVDPV2 circulation and to effectively monitor progress.",
          "Although the risk of international spread of cVDPV1 and cVDPV3 is considerably lower than that of cVDPV2, the Committee expressed concern over the recent cVDPV1 outbreaks in Algeria, Djibouti, and Israel, and the cVDPV3 outbreaks in Cameroon, Chad, and Guinea, which warrant continued vigilance. These outbreaks highlight the existence of population pockets with low immunity to type 1 and type 3 polioviruses and underscore the need to strengthen routine immunization. The Committee recommended ensuring high-quality response to these outbreaks to prevent further geographical spread.",
          "The Committee noted that many countries affected by cVDPV continue to experience conflict and insecurity, disrupting both routine immunization services and polio vaccination campaigns. The Committee also noted that concurrent health emergencies and disease outbreaks in several countries further complicate the timely and effective implementation of vaccination response. Acknowledging the diverse and often complex operating environments at national and sub-national levels, the Committee emphasized the importance of context-specific operational and social mobilization interventions to ensure high-quality campaign delivery and ultimately interrupt cVDPV transmission. The Committee also highlighted the need for coordinated sub-regional strategies and strengthened cross-border collaboration to overcome challenges posed by porous borders and shared operational constraints across the polio outbreak affected countries.",
          "The Committee noted the continued cross-border spread of cVDPV2 in the African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, the detection of cVDPV2 in multiple countries of the European Region, and the detection of cVDPV2 in Papua New Guinea linked to the 2024 transmission in Indonesia. The Committee also noted the shared cVDPV3 transmission in Chad and Cameroon. These developments underscore that polio remains a global threat until eradication is fully achieved. The Committee emphasized the critical importance of maintaining sensitive surveillance systems in polio-affected and high-risk countries and recommended that the GPEI provide all necessary support under the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan. The Committee underscored the importance of preserving the capacity of the Global Polio Laboratory Network to continue supporting eradication efforts through timely and accurate detection of polioviruses. The Committee noted the need for high-income countries to sustain high-quality poliovirus surveillance, given the persistent risk of importation, as recently demonstrated by detections in the European Region. Robust surveillance remains essential for early detection and timely response to both importations and newly emerging outbreaks. The Committee recommended that programme messaging on the international spread of polioviruses be tailored to the specific context and setting, including ensuring appropriate communication in high-income countries, with the aim of fostering understanding and sustained support for global polio eradication efforts.",
          "The Committee recognized the critical role that mobile and migrant populations play in sustaining WPV1 transmission in endemic countries, as well as cVDPV transmission in the African Region and globally. The Committee urged that vaccinating populations on the move be treated as a top priority, emphasizing the importance of identifying different categories of mobile populations such as seasonal, economic, and agricultural migrants, and reaching them through country-specific, tailored strategies and approaches.",
          "The Committee noted that novel OPV2 continues to demonstrate greater genetic stability compared to Sabin OPV2. However, the risk of new cVDPV2 emergences increases when the interval between outbreak response campaigns exceeds four weeks or when vaccination quality is suboptimal, underscoring the need for timely and high-quality immunization efforts.",
          "The Committee noted that the amendments to the IHR, adopted by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly through resolution WHA77.17, entered into force on 19 September 2025 for 182 of the 196 States Parties. The Committee took the amended International Health Regulations into account during its deliberations and in reviewing and advising on the Temporary Recommendations.",
          "Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPVs, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment, and on 10 November 2025 determined that the poliovirus situation continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The poliovirus situation, however, does not constitute a pandemic emergency.",
          "The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States previously infected by WPV1 or cVDPV within the last 24 months’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective, 10 November 2025.",

          "[2] Under amended Article 1 of the IHR, “pandemic emergency” is defined as “a public health emergency of international concern that is caused by a communicable disease and: (i) has, or is at high risk of having, wide geographical spread to and within multiple States; and (ii) is exceeding, or is at high risk of exceeding, the capacity of health systems to respond in those States; and (iii) is causing, or is at high risk of causing, substantial social and/or economic disruption, including disruption to international traffic and trade; and (iv) requires rapid, equitable and enhanced coordinated international action, with whole-of government and whole-of-society approaches."

      "Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.",
      "Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (> four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.",
      "Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers.",
      "Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in accordance with the Model International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP), contained in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination. It is noted that, in accordance with resolution WHA77.17, ICVP issued after 19 September 2025 (date of entry into force of the amendments) by States Parties to which the amendments apply shall conform to the amended Model ICVP contained in Annex 6.",
      "Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of transport (road, air and/or sea).",
      "Further enhance cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional, and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.",
      "Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication. Countries which have not yet introduced a second dose of IPV into their routine immunization schedules should urgently implement this.

          "In an important step, Member States started discussing for the first time the proposed draft text of the annex to the WHO Pandemic Agreement that establishes the Pathogen Access and Benefit Sharing (PABS) system. The PABS system is a key part of the global agreement adopted earlier in 2025 to make the world safer from future pandemics.",
          "The draft PABS annex was discussed at the Third meeting of the Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) that took place over 3–7 November in Geneva. The World Health Assembly established the IGWG to undertake several tasks, including, as a priority, to draft and negotiate the PABS annex to the WHO Pandemic Agreement.",
          "“I thank Member States for their vital efforts to negotiate the first draft of the PABS annex and commend them on the progress made in finding shared positions and solutions to the shared risks and challenges posed by future pandemics,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Solidarity is our best immunity. Finalizing the Pandemic Agreement, through a commitment to multilateral action, is our collective promise to protect humanity.”",
          "To enable a timely and effective response to future pandemics, countries must be able to quickly identify pathogens that have pandemic potential and share their genetic information and material so scientists can develop tools like tests, treatments, and vaccines. The PABS system will facilitate the rapid and timely sharing of materials and sequence information from pathogens with pandemic potential. It will also, on an equal footing, enable the rapid, timely, fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from such materials and sequence information.",
          "The draft text under consideration outlines provisions designed to operationalize the commitments made in Article 12 of the WHO Pandemic Agreement on equitable access to life-saving tools during health crises.",

    "content_html": "<p>On World Cities Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) calls on national and city leaders to transform urban areas into engines of health, equity and sustainability.</p><p>More than 4.4 billion people, over half of humanity, now live in urban areas, a figure projected to rise to nearly 70% by 2050. In cities health, inequality, environment and economy intersect in powerful and dramatic ways, creating both complex risks and unique opportunities for progress. While health challenges loom in all urban settings, the worst health outcomes are often concentrated in slums and informal settlements, with residents enduring unsafe housing, inadequate sanitation, food insecurity, and rising exposure to floods and heat. Today, 1.1 billion people live in these conditions, a number expected to triple by 2050.</p><p>With the new guide for decision-makers launched today \"<a href=\"/teams/social-determinants-of-health/urban-health/strategic-approach\">Taking a strategic approach to urban health</a><em>\"</em> WHO provides concrete ideas to usher in a new era of urban health action. The Guide responds to the growing demand for integrated solutions that address health challenges and promote health more broadly in urban settings. It is the first comprehensive framework of its kind to help governments plan urban health strategically, integrating evidence into policy and practice.</p><p>“This is a moment for decision-makers at every level to act together,” said Jeremy Farrar, Assistant Director General, for Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Care, WHO. “The guide gives national and municipal leaders, planners, partners and communities a framework to work together, across sectors and scales, to build fairer, healthier, and more resilient futures.”</p><p>Health risks and inequities are seen in all urban areas: a study of 363 cities in nine Latin American countries found life expectancy gaps of up to 14 years for men and 8 years for women between the healthiest and least healthy cities. Urban residents everywhere face multiple, overlapping risks – from air pollution and unsafe transport to poor housing, noise and climate hazards. Air pollution alone kills around 7 million people annually, and nearly every city dweller breathes <a href=\"/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health\">air that fails to meet WHO air quality guideline values</a>. Dense populations heighten risks for infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19 and dengue and limited access to green spaces increases the risk for noncommunicable diseases.</p><p>Urban environments have now become the dominant day-to-day influence on human health – while also driving global challenges such as climate change, resource scarcity, and growing inequality. This makes them not only the front line for today’s health challenges, but the greatest hope for transformative change.</p><p>Strategic action on urban health can foster equity and create resilient, attractive urban environments that are conducive to economic development, environmental sustainability, and better lives. People and businesses increasingly seek environments that offer safety, livability and opportunity.</p><p>​​Decision-makers are bringing community voices directly into urban design for health in the Dandora neighbourhood of Nairobi, Kenya; Suva, Fiji; Makassar, Indonesia; Coimbra, Portugal and many others.</p><p>“Cities are key to advancing public health,” said Dr Etienne Krug, Director of Health Determinants, Prevention and Promotion. “This Guide offers governments a roadmap to act strategically, making operational links with other major global policy issues like climate change, transport, digital transformation and migration.”</p><p>The Guide emphasizes that health is not the responsibility of one sector alone, nor limited to the decisions of city officials. From clean air and safe housing to active mobility and digital access, to broader financing and regulatory action, decisions made every day by urban authorities across multiple sectors and scales affect the health of billions. Taking strategic action means aligning these choices to build healthier and fairer futures, where urban systems work together to advance equity, sustainability and resilience.</p><p>\"Taking a Strategic Approach to Urban Health\" outlines practical steps for governments to:</p><ul><li>understand the complexity of urban systems and how they shape health and equity;</li><li>identify entry points for action, recognizing opportunities to build urban health across policy and practice agendas in other sectors and issues;</li><li>strengthen the means of implementation for urban health, including governance, financing, data, analytics, innovation, capacity-strengthening, partnerships and participation; and</li><li>develop comprehensive urban health strategies at both national and city levels.</li></ul><p>WHO calls on municipal and national leaders to adopt a more strategic approach to urban health, recognizing the crucial role that local and national governments play in creating coherent health action that aligns with other societal goals, and making urban areas not only more livable, but more just and sustainable.</p><p>Alongside the Guide, WHO is launching the first three modules of an Urban Health E-learning course, hosted by the WHO Academy, to strengthen capacities for collaborative work in urban contexts.<br/> </p><h3>Note to editors</h3><p>Developed with input from a wide range of global experts, \"Taking a strategic approach to urban health: A guide for decision makers\"<em> </em>builds on decades of WHO’s work on urban health, showing that when health is tackled in a strategic way, it can drive healthier, more resilient societies.</p><p> </p>",

Eleven (11) of the 16 Committee Members, and the two Advisors to the Committee participated in the meeting.</p><p>The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) joined in person and welcomed the participants, including Government Officials designated to present their views to the Committee on behalf of the two invited States Parties – the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sierra Leone, Uganda, and the United Kingdom. The opening remarks by the Director-General are available <a href=\"/news-room/speeches/item/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-ihr-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024---4-september-2025\">here</a>.</p><p>The Representative of the Office of Legal Counsel then briefed the Members and Advisors on their roles and responsibilities and identified the mandate of the Committee under the relevant articles of the IHR. The Ethics Officer from the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics proceeded with the rollcall and provided the Members and Advisors with an overview of the WHO Declaration of Interests process. The Members and Advisors were made aware of their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature that may give rise to a perceived or actual conflict of interest. They were additionally reminded of their duty to maintain the confidentiality of the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee. Each Member and Advisor was surveyed, with no conflicts of interest identified.</p><p>The meeting was handed over to the Chair who introduced the objectives of the meeting, which were to provide views to the WHO Director-General on whether the event continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and to provide views on the proposed temporary recommendations.</p><h2>Session open to representatives of States Parties invited to present their views</h2><p>The WHO Secretariat presented the comparative assessment (August 2024 vs September 2025) of the indicators – categorized under five domains –, each associated with one or more of the three criteria defining a PHEIC, as per <em>Article 1 - Definitions</em> of the IHR.</p><p>Those domains, with related indicators, were discussed by the Committee and the WHO Secretariat during their informal meeting, agreed upon at the fourth meeting of the Committee, which was held on 25 July 2025, and they were subsequently refined further by the WHO Secretariat. The criteria defining a PHEIC, and the related domains and indicators are presented below, with that order reflected by the level of the indents.</p><h3>Extraordinary</h3><p style=\"margin-left:30px;\"><em>Growth rate and incidence</em><br/>Evidence of recent higher than previously observed effective reproduction number (Rt)/growth rate and incidence for mpox given clade and geography beyond what a country can respond to.</p><p>Over the past 12 months, mpox cases reported in the WHO African Region accounted for over 80% of those reported globally, with the highest incidence reported from Burundi, the DRC, Sierra Leone, and Uganda, all of which showed sustained declining trends, with occasional flare ups in other countries as reported from Guinea and Liberia at the time of the meeting. Travel-related clusters of mpox cases, within and beyond the WHO African Region, continued to be observed and controlled (e.g., United Kingdom), their frequency mostly reflecting the incidence trends in countries of origin. MPXV clade IIb activity has been declining globally since August 2024 and stabilizing at lower levels in recent months. In August 2024, the risk related to this domain was assessed as “high”, with “moderate” confidence. By September 2025, the assessment improved to “low”, with confidence remaining “moderate”, indicating a sustained reduction of MPXV transmission over the period considered.</p><p style=\"margin-left:30px;\"><em>Demographics affected and transmission risk</em><br/>Evidence of newly affected population groups or high incidence in certain population groups (high-risk groups, internally displaced people, children, etc.) or evidence of transmission by routes not currently understood.</p><p>Over the past 12 months, a clearer picture has emerged of the population groups affected by mpox clade Ib and MPXV routes of transmission, with close, intimate contact driving transmission and the highest secondary attack rate being associated with sexual contact. As such, the vast majority of settings are seeing the highest incidence among young male and female adults – mostly reflecting heterosexual sexual contact transmission – while the incidence among children is lower and largely reflects household transmission. The secretariat noted however that in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu in the DRC, a higher proportion of paediatric mpox cases has been reported than what has been seen in other settings as the outbreak continued to decline – a situation that warrants further investigation. MPXV clade IIb outbreaks in West Africa predominantly involve young adults of both sexes. Outside the African continent, travel-related introductions of MPXV clade I have all been linked to adults travelling back from countries with community transmission, while the reports of MPXV clade IIb continue to be associated with transmission among men who have sex with men. In August 2024, the risk related to this domain was assessed as “high”, with “moderate” confidence. By September 2025, the assessment improved to “low”, with confidence remaining “moderate”, allowing for targeted risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) interventions.</p><p style=\"margin-left:30px;\"><em>Severity</em><br/>Evidence of (i) increasing severity and mortality over time, (ii) significantly higher-than-expected mortality in a given setting and/or (iii) large proportion of mortality not associated with risk factors (suppressed immunity).</p><p>Uncertainties and unknowns present at the time the PHEIC was determined in August 2024, have been progressively elucidated. While there was uncertainly around the severity and case fatality rate (CFR) for MPXV clade Ib at the time of the PHEIC declaration, more data has since shown that the mortality remains low, in line with the CFR documented for clade IIb, and is linked to known vulnerabilities, mainly immunodeficiency – often associated with uncontrolled HIV in the context of mpox. The secretariat also highlighted that a higher CFR continues to be observed in endemic provinces of the DRC where MPXV clade Ia is circulating, although with a trend from &gt;3% at the time of the PHEIC declaration, to ~1.6% in 2025, and ~1% in August 2025. The main documented complications are ophthalmic and dermatological (e.g., scarring after extensive lesions). In August 2024, the risk related to this domain was assessed as “moderate”, with “low” confidence. By September 2025, the assessment improved to “low”, together with level confidence regarded as “high”, indicating that risk factors for severe or fatal outcome are better characterized.</p><h3>International spread</h3><p style=\"margin-left:30px;\"><em>Geographical spread</em><br/>Evidence of rapid geographical expansion of community transmission in the last 3 months and/or high numbers of importations that suggest undetected/uncontrolled community transmission in origin countries.</p><p>In late 2024 and early 2025, the expansion of MPVX clade Ib activity across countries in East and Southern Africa was observed along trucking corridors, followed by within-country spread. In 2025, MPXV clade II activity has intensified or emerged in countries in West Africa. Noting that the number of travel-related cases has declined in recent months, the observed exportation patterns from countries in the African continent broadly match modelled expectations, supporting the view that surveillance is detecting cases where probability is highest. Travel-related case counts have fallen in recent months, likely reflecting reduced transmission at source, though transmission may persist in select locations. In August 2024, the risk related to this domain was assessed as “high”, with “moderate” confidence. By September 2025, the assessment improved to “low”, together with the level confidence regarded as “high”, signalling advances in surveillance capacity and transparency in international reporting and information sharing.</p><h3>International cooperation / Extraordinary</h3><p style=\"margin-left:30px;\"><em>Response capacity and access to countermeasures</em><br/>Evidence of case incidence beyond what a country has capacity to respond to, including access to and capacity to deploy testing, vaccines, clinical management, community engagement, etc.</p><p>Advances in surveillance in countries in the African continent observed since August 2024 are underpinned by expanded diagnostics capacity, including through decentralization of testing (e.g., in the DRC, the number of testing sites has increased from nine to 28). Six in vitro diagnostic products for MPXV are approved for emergency use (i.e., are included in the WHO Emergency Use List (EUL)), and eight are under assessment for prospective inclusion in the EUL, including antigen rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). RCCE interventions scaled up significantly, with nine countries implementing community feedback and social listening, and 13 countries having conducted social and/or behavioural studies. Vaccine access has grown with ~1.6 million doses of MVA-BN vaccine delivered to 13 countries in the African continent, and approximately 1 million doses administered in ten of those countries. Through bilateral arrangements, the DRC accessed LC16m8 vaccine, with approximately 40 000 doses administered. While mathematic modelling suggests that vaccination in the early phases of fast-growing outbreaks has the greatest impact, in the context of the observed declining trends in number of mpox cases, vaccine needs are expected to decrease. Despite progress, funding constraints and competing health emergencies and priorities continue to limit scale and pace of the response. In August 2024, the risk related to this domain was assessed as “moderate”, with “moderate” confidence, with no changes assessed by September 2025, reflecting persisting challenges in maintaining the desired level of intensity of mpox control interventions.</p><p>The WHO Secretariat signalled to the Committee that, considering the assessment of the aforementioned five domains; as well as the <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240092907\">WHO Strategic framework for enhancing prevention and control of mpox: 2024–2027</a>; the <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/international-health-regulations/en_extension-mpox-sr_2025-2026.pdf?sfvrsn=47e8d0e7_15\">standing recommendations for mpox</a>, valid until 20 August 2026; and the <em>Mpox Transition Roadmap: From Emergency Response to Integration into Routine Health Systems</em> (being finalised), a strategic transition for mpox control would be warranted – from an emergency response posture to programmatic, health system-integrated sustained efforts, also preserving the readiness capacity. Such strategic transition would focus high-level advocacy and resource mobilization; maintaining a vaccine stockpile to respond to localized upsurges of mpox; continuous efforts to counter stigma and misinformation, as well as to promote timely care-seeking behaviour; and integrating mpox prevention and control services within existing HIV/STI platforms. The WHO Secretariat also offered to the Committee some considerations concerning the following regulatory aspects in case the WHO Director-General decide to terminate the PHEIC: no impact on MVA-BN vaccine as it is prequalified; mpox-related products currently in the EUL would remain unchanged until further notice; new mpox-related products may be ineligible for inclusion in the EUL unless the WHO Director-General authorises the continued use of the EUL assessment in the public-health interest. </p><p>Representatives of the DRC, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and the United Kingdom updated the Committee on the mpox epidemiological situation in their countries, their current control and response efforts, needs, challenges, and plans in the medium term.</p><p>Members of, and Advisors to, the Committee then engaged in <strong>questions and answers</strong> with the presenters from States Parties and the WHO Secretariat.</p><h2>Deliberative session</h2><p>Following the session open to invited States Parties, the Committee reconvened in a closed session to examine the questions in relation to whether the event constitutes a PHEIC and to consider the temporary recommendations drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.</p><p>The Chair reminded the Committee Members of their mandate and recalled that a PHEIC is defined in the IHR as an <em>“extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated international response”</em>.</p><p><strong>Except for one Member, who expressed concerns regarding future access to vaccine, the Committee expressed the views that the upsurge of mpox no longer meets the criteria of a PHEIC and that the Director-General be advised accordingly.

The opening remarks by the Director-General are available here .",
          "The Representative of the Office of Legal Counsel then briefed the Members and Advisors on their roles and responsibilities and identified the mandate of the Committee under the relevant articles of the IHR. The Ethics Officer from the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics proceeded with the rollcall and provided the Members and Advisors with an overview of the WHO Declaration of Interests process. The Members and Advisors were made aware of their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature that may give rise to a perceived or actual conflict of interest. They were additionally reminded of their duty to maintain the confidentiality of the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee. Each Member and Advisor was surveyed, with no conflicts of interest identified.",
          "The meeting was handed over to the Chair who introduced the objectives of the meeting, which were to provide views to the WHO Director-General on whether the event continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and to provide views on the proposed temporary recommendations."

          "Growth rate and incidence Evidence of recent higher than previously observed effective reproduction number (Rt)/growth rate and incidence for mpox given clade and geography beyond what a country can respond to.",
          "Over the past 12 months, mpox cases reported in the WHO African Region accounted for over 80% of those reported globally, with the highest incidence reported from Burundi, the DRC, Sierra Leone, and Uganda, all of which showed sustained declining trends, with occasional flare ups in other countries as reported from Guinea and Liberia at the time of the meeting. Travel-related clusters of mpox cases, within and beyond the WHO African Region, continued to be observed and controlled (e.g., United Kingdom), their frequency mostly reflecting the incidence trends in countries of origin. MPXV clade IIb activity has been declining globally since August 2024 and stabilizing at lower levels in recent months. In August 2024, the risk related to this domain was assessed as “high”, with “moderate” confidence. By September 2025, the assessment improved to “low”, with confidence remaining “moderate”, indicating a sustained reduction of MPXV transmission over the period considered.",
          "Demographics affected and transmission risk Evidence of newly affected population groups or high incidence in certain population groups (high-risk groups, internally displaced people, children, etc.) or evidence of transmission by routes not currently understood.",
          "Over the past 12 months, a clearer picture has emerged of the population groups affected by mpox clade Ib and MPXV routes of transmission, with close, intimate contact driving transmission and the highest secondary attack rate being associated with sexual contact. As such, the vast majority of settings are seeing the highest incidence among young male and female adults – mostly reflecting heterosexual sexual contact transmission – while the incidence among children is lower and largely reflects household transmission. The secretariat noted however that in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu in the DRC, a higher proportion of paediatric mpox cases has been reported than what has been seen in other settings as the outbreak continued to decline – a situation that warrants further investigation. MPXV clade IIb outbreaks in West Africa predominantly involve young adults of both sexes. Outside the African continent, travel-related introductions of MPXV clade I have all been linked to adults travelling back from countries with community transmission, while the reports of MPXV clade IIb continue to be associated with transmission among men who have sex with men. In August 2024, the risk related to this domain was assessed as “high”, with “moderate” confidence. By September 2025, the assessment improved to “low”, with confidence remaining “moderate”, allowing for targeted risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) interventions.",
          "Severity Evidence of (i) increasing severity and mortality over time, (ii) significantly higher-than-expected mortality in a given setting and/or (iii) large proportion of mortality not associated with risk factors (suppressed immunity).",
          "Uncertainties and unknowns present at the time the PHEIC was determined in August 2024, have been progressively elucidated. While there was uncertainly around the severity and case fatality rate (CFR) for MPXV clade Ib at the time of the PHEIC declaration, more data has since shown that the mortality remains low, in line with the CFR documented for clade IIb, and is linked to known vulnerabilities, mainly immunodeficiency – often associated with uncontrolled HIV in the context of mpox. The secretariat also highlighted that a higher CFR continues to be observed in endemic provinces of the DRC where MPXV clade Ia is circulating, although with a trend from >3% at the time of the PHEIC declaration, to ~1.6% in 2025, and ~1% in August 2025. The main documented complications are ophthalmic and dermatological (e.g., scarring after extensive lesions). In August 2024, the risk related to this domain was assessed as “moderate”, with “low” confidence. By September 2025, the assessment improved to “low”, together with level confidence regarded as “high”, indicating that risk factors for severe or fatal outcome are better characterized."

On 28 October, six health workers, four doctors, a nurse and a pharmacist, were abducted. On the same day, more than 460 patients and their companions were reportedly shot and killed in the hospital.  <br/>  <br/>Since the conflict began, 46 health workers have been killed in El Fasher – among them the Director of Primary Health Care in the State Ministry of Health – and another 48 injured. The status of personnel working in three nongovernmental organizations in El Fasher remains unknown. WHO condemns these horrific attacks on health care in the strongest terms and calls for the respect of the sanctity of health care as mandated under International Humanitarian Law. </p></div><div><p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{ca2869ca-d159-4b1e-a2ed-b2d88000d578}{59}\" paraid=\"704733380\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">More than 260 000 people remain trapped in El Fasher with almost no access to food, clean water, or medical care. Escalating violence has forced about 28 000 people to flee El Fasher Town in recent days, 26 000 of them to rural areas of El Fasher and up to 2000 to Tawila. Over 100 000 more people are expected to move to Tawila in the coming days and weeks, adding to the 575 000 already displaced from El Fasher who are sheltering there and other areas. Many of the displaced are women and unaccompanied children facing acute shortages of shelter, protection, food, water, and health care.  </span></p></div><div><p paraeid=\"{1d33b04e-ade0-4fb9-99a2-b206670708c3}{93}\" paraid=\"448353163\">In addition to violence, and the lack of basic essentials for life and health, cholera continues to spread rapidly in El Fasher as people lack access to safe water. Disease surveillance and response activities are reduced as a result of the deteriorating security situation. This year alone, El Fasher has reported 272 suspected cases of cholera and 32 deaths, an alarming case fatality rate of nearly 12%. Across Darfur, 18 468 cases and 662 deaths have been recorded in 40 localities.   <br/>  <br/>El Fasher has been cut off from humanitarian aid since February 2025, and malnutrition is rising sharply, especially among children and pregnant women, weakening immunity and heightening vulnerability to cholera, malaria, and other infectious diseases. Many families have exhausted food stocks or lost access to markets. <br/> <br/>Despite access restrictions to El Fasher, WHO teams are working around the clock to keep health services running where possible, particularly in areas where people displaced by insecurity arrive. Twenty metric tons of WHO medicines and emergency kits, including supplies for cholera and management of severe acute malnutrition with medical complications, are being moved from Nyala to Tawila to support medical and rapid-response teams providing care for displaced people. Health supplies handed over to partners at Abeche, Chad, are being fast-tracked for delivery to Tawila and other gathering locations.   <br/><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span></p><p paraeid=\"{1d33b04e-ade0-4fb9-99a2-b206670708c3}{93}\" paraid=\"448353163\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">WHO is coordinating with health partners at reception sites in Korma, located between El Fasher and Tawila, to stabilize critically ill and injured people and facilitate referrals to Tawila. WHO is also preparing to deploy rapid response teams within Tawila and surrounding localities to respond to the urgent health needs of those arriving from El Fasher. WHO trucks are on standby in Darfur to join a UN aid convoy carrying food, medicines, and lifesaving health supplies into El Fasher as soon as access opens.  </span></p></div><div><p paraeid=\"{1d33b04e-ade0-4fb9-99a2-b206670708c3}{143}\" paraid=\"783183882\">WHO calls for an immediate end to hostilities in El Fasher and all of Sudan; for the protection of civilians, humanitarian workers, and health care; and safe, rapid, and unimpeded humanitarian access to deliver lifesaving aid.  </p></div>",

From clean energy growth to city adaptation, action is underway and delivering real health benefits – but we must keep up the momentum,” said Dr Marina Romanello, Executive Director of the Lancet Countdown at University College London. “Rapidly phasing out fossil fuels in favour of clean renewable energy and efficient energy use remains the most powerful lever to slow climate change and protect lives. At the same time, shifting to healthier, climate-friendly diets and more sustainable agricultural systems would massively cut pollution, greenhouse gases and deforestation, potentially saving over ten million lives a year.”</p><div><h2>Health-promoting climate action</h2></div><p>While some governments have slowed their climate commitments, the report shows that cities, communities and the health sector are leading the way. Nearly all reporting cities (834 of 858) have completed or plan to complete climate risk assessments. The energy transition is delivering cleaner air, healthier jobs, measurable economic growth and inward investment.</p><div><p>The health sector itself has shown impressive climate leadership, with health-related greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions falling 16% globally between 2021 and 2022, while improving care quality.</p></div><p>Data submitted by WHO show that a growing number of health systems are assessing risks and preparing for the dangerous future that's coming. Fifty-eight per cent of Member States have completed a health Vulnerability and Adaptation assessment and 60% have completed a Health National Adaptation Plan. </p><div><h2>Looking ahead to COP30: placing health at the centre of climate action</h2></div><p>As the world prepares for COP30 in Belém, Brazil, the findings of the 2025 Global Report of the Lancet Countdown provide a key evidence base for accelerating health-centered climate action. WHO will build on this momentum through the forthcoming COP30 Special Report on Climate Change and Health, a collaborative effort highlighting the policies and investments needed to protect health, equity, and deliver the Belém Action Plan that is the expected landmark outcome of COP30.</p><div><p>The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change was established in partnership with Wellcome, which continues to provide core financial support. The Lancet Countdown is led by University College London, in partnership with WHO and 71 academic institutions and UN agencies worldwide.

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) today warns that less than one in three countries around the world has a national policy to address the growing burden of neurological disorders, responsible for over 11 million deaths globally each year. The WHO’s new <em><a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240116139\">Global status report on neurology</a></em> released today shows that neurological conditions now affect more than 40% of the global population – over 3 billion people.</p><p>The top 10 neurological conditions contributing to death and disability as of 2021 were stroke, neonatal encephalopathy, migraine, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, diabetic neuropathy, meningitis, idiopathic epilepsy, neurological complications linked to preterm birth, autism spectrum disorders, and cancers of the nervous systems.</p><p>Low-income countries have more than 80 times fewer neurologists compared to high-income nations despite the high burden of these diseases. Many low- and middle-income countries lack national plans, budgets and workforce. WHO is calling for urgent, evidence-based and coordinated global action to prioritize brain health and expand neurological care.</p><p>“With more than 1 in 3 people in the world living with conditions affecting their brain we must do all we can to improve the health care they need,” said Dr Jeremy Farrar, WHO Assistant Director-General, Division of Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Control. “Many of these neurological conditions can be prevented or effectively treated, yet services remain out of reach for most – especially in rural and underserved areas – where people too often face stigma, social exclusion and financial hardship. We must work together to ensure we put patients and their families first and that brain health is prioritized and properly invested in.”</p><h2>Key findings from the report</h2><p>The first-of-its-kind report highlights that only 53% of WHO Member States (102 countries out of 194) contributed to this report – an indicator of the limited attention given to neurology. Just 32% of Member States (63 countries) have a national policy addressing neurological disorders, and only 18% (34 countries) report having dedicated funding to address them.</p><p>Without strong policy frameworks, health systems remain fragmented, under-resourced and ill-equipped to meet the needs of patients and families. While public awareness-raising campaigns and advocacy efforts are making progress, there is still significant room to strengthen them – reducing stigma, accelerating reform, and ensuring millions receive the care, and recognition they deserve.</p><p>Essential services are out of reach for most people. Only 25% of Member States (49 countries) include neurological disorders in their universal health coverage benefit packages. Critical services such as stroke units, pediatric neurology, rehabilitation, and palliative care are frequently lacking or concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural and underserved populations without access to lifesaving and life-sustaining care.</p><p>The report reveals a severe lack of qualified health professionals, with low-income countries facing up to 82 times fewer neurologists per 100 000 people compared to high-income nations. This shortage means that for many patients, timely diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing care are simply out of reach.</p><p>Neurological conditions often require lifelong care. Yet only 46 Member States offer carer services and just 44 Member States have legal protections in place for carers. As a result, informal carers – most often women – are left without recognition or support, reinforcing social inequities and placing a significant financial strain on families.</p><p>Weak health information systems and chronic underfunding of research – particularly in low- and middle-income countries – limit evidence-based decision-making and prevent the design of effective policies on neurological disorders.</p><h2>Roadmap for action</h2><p>In response to these growing public health challenges, Member States adopted the<a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240076624\"> <em>Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders</em></a> in 2022 to reduce the burden and impact of neurological conditions.</p><p>The action plan provides countries with a roadmap to strengthen policy prioritization, ensure timely and effective care including health promotion and disease prevention, improve data systems, and engage people with lived experience in shaping more inclusive policies and services.</p><p>Without action, the burden of neurological disorders will continue to rise, deepening global health inequalities.

The report covers 8 common bacterial pathogens – <em>Acinetobacter spp.</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>, non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella spp.</em>, <em>Shigella spp.</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>–<em> </em>each linked to one or more of these infections.<br/></p><h2>The risk of antibiotic resistance varies across the world </h2><p>WHO estimates that antibiotic resistance is highest in the WHO South-East Asian and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, where 1 in 3 reported infections were resistant. In the African Region, 1 in 5 infections was resistant. Resistance is also more common and worsening in places where health systems lack capacity to diagnose or treat bacterial pathogens. </p><p>“Antimicrobial resistance is outpacing advances in modern medicine, threatening the health of families worldwide,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “As countries strengthen their AMR surveillance systems, we must use antibiotics responsibly, and make sure everyone has access to the right medicines, quality-assured diagnostics, and vaccines. Our future also depends on strengthening systems to prevent, diagnose and treat infections and on innovating with next-generation antibiotics and rapid point-of-care molecular tests.”</p><h2>Gram-negative bacterial pathogens are posing the greatest threat<br/></h2><p>The new report notes that drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are becoming more dangerous worldwide, with the greatest burden falling on countries least equipped to respond. Among these, <em>E. coli</em> and <em>K. pneumoniae</em> are the leading drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria found in bloodstream infections. These are among the most severe bacterial infections that often result in sepsis, organ failure, and death. Yet more than 40% of <em>E. coli</em> and over 55% of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> globally are now resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, the first-choice treatment for these infections. In the African Region, resistance even exceeds 70%. </p><p>Other essential life-saving antibiotics, including carbapenems and fluoroquinolones, are losing effectiveness against <em>E. coli</em>, <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, and <em>Acinetobacter</em>. Carbapenem resistance, once rare, is becoming more frequent, narrowing treatment options and forcing reliance on last-resort antibiotics. And such antibiotics are costly, difficult to access, and often unavailable in low- and middle-income countries.<br/></p><h2>Welcome progress in AMR surveillance – <span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">but more action needed</span></h2><p>Country participation in GLASS has increased over four-fold, from 25 countries in 2016 to 104 countries in 2023. However, 48% of countries did not report data to GLASS in 2023 and about half of the reporting countries still lacked the systems to generate reliable data. In fact, countries facing the largest challenges lacked the surveillance capacity to assess their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) situation. </p><p>The <a href=\"/news/item/26-09-2024-world-leaders-commit-to-decisive-action-on-antimicrobial-resistance\">political declaration on AMR</a> adopted at the United Nations General Assembly in 2024 set targets to address AMR through strengthening health systems and working with a ‘One Health’ approach coordinating across human health, animal health, and environmental sectors. To combat the growing challenge of AMR, countries must commit to strengthening laboratory systems and generating reliable surveillance data, especially from underserved areas, to inform treatments and policies.<br/></p><p>WHO calls on all countries to report high-quality data on AMR and antimicrobial use to GLASS by 2030. Achieving this target will require concerted action to strengthen the quality, geographic coverage, and sharing of AMR surveillance data to track progress. Countries should scale up coordinated interventions designed to address antimicrobial resistance across all levels of healthcare and ensure that treatment guidelines and essential medicines lists align with local resistance patterns.</p><p>The report is accompanied by expanded digital content available in the WHO’s <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/glass-dashboard/_w_3b6af0083a344c0b8a95743744e34736/#!/home\">GLASS dashboard</a>, which provides global and regional summaries, country profiles based on unadjusted surveillance coverage and AMR data, and detailed information on antimicrobial use.</p><p> </p>",

          "“Antimicrobial resistance is outpacing advances in modern medicine, threatening the health of families worldwide,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “As countries strengthen their AMR surveillance systems, we must use antibiotics responsibly, and make sure everyone has access to the right medicines, quality-assured diagnostics, and vaccines. Our future also depends on strengthening systems to prevent, diagnose and treat infections and on innovating with next-generation antibiotics and rapid point-of-care molecular tests.”"

          "The new report notes that drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are becoming more dangerous worldwide, with the greatest burden falling on countries least equipped to respond. Among these, E. coli and K. pneumoniae are the leading drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria found in bloodstream infections. These are among the most severe bacterial infections that often result in sepsis, organ failure, and death. Yet more than 40% of E. coli and over 55% of K. pneumoniae globally are now resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, the first-choice treatment for these infections. In the African Region, resistance even exceeds 70%.",
          "Other essential life-saving antibiotics, including carbapenems and fluoroquinolones, are losing effectiveness against E. coli , K. pneumoniae , Salmonella , and Acinetobacter . Carbapenem resistance, once rare, is becoming more frequent, narrowing treatment options and forcing reliance on last-resort antibiotics. And such antibiotics are costly, difficult to access, and often unavailable in low- and middle-income countries."

However, 48% of countries did not report data to GLASS in 2023 and about half of the reporting countries still lacked the systems to generate reliable data. In fact, countries facing the largest challenges lacked the surveillance capacity to assess their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) situation.",
          "The political declaration on AMR adopted at the United Nations General Assembly in 2024 set targets to address AMR through strengthening health systems and working with a ‘One Health’ approach coordinating across human health, animal health, and environmental sectors. To combat the growing challenge of AMR, countries must commit to strengthening laboratory systems and generating reliable surveillance data, especially from underserved areas, to inform treatments and policies.",
          "WHO calls on all countries to report high-quality data on AMR and antimicrobial use to GLASS by 2030. Achieving this target will require concerted action to strengthen the quality, geographic coverage, and sharing of AMR surveillance data to track progress. Countries should scale up coordinated interventions designed to address antimicrobial resistance across all levels of healthcare and ensure that treatment guidelines and essential medicines lists align with local resistance patterns.",

These meetings are timed to balance the availability of the latest epidemiological, immunological, and virological data, with the kinetics of vaccine-induced protection and the lead time manufacturers need to update the antigen composition of authorized COVID-19 vaccines. </p><p>The purpose of this statement is to guide the scientific community and vaccine manufacturers as to which data should be generated ahead of the December 2025 TAG-CO-VAC deliberations. It is an update to the previous statement on the types of data requested in March 2025.<sup>1</sup> </p><p>To inform decisions on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition,<sup>2-7</sup> the TAG-CO-VAC reviews data (see Table) on the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the antigenic characteristics of previously and currently circulating variants. This includes the analysis of animal antisera following primary infection or vaccination in one-way and two-way neutralization tests, as well as immunogenicity data that assess the breadth and durability of immune responses, including neutralizing antibody responses, using sera from sequentially immunized or infected animals and pre-and post-vaccination human sera. The TAG-CO-VAC also considers vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates of currently approved COVID-19 vaccines, particularly those that control for time since vaccination and that provide variant-specific estimates across different vaccine platforms for protection against any infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease. Further examples of published data reviewed by TAG-CO-VAC and used to inform decisions on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition can be found in the annexes accompanying each of the previous statements.<sup>2-7</sup></p><p>In addition, the TAG-CO-VAC reviews available data from vaccine manufacturers, including animal and human studies demonstrating the breadth and durability of immune responses elicited by currently authorized vaccines, as well as any vaccine candidates in development. For vaccine candidates in development, the TAG-CO-VAC highlights the utility of both non-clinical and clinical immunogenicity data for decision-making on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. The TAG-CO-VAC also notes that comparable immunogenicity data (i.e. to the same variants) from previous vaccine compositions are especially useful. Vaccine manufacturers are also asked to provide observational epidemiological data that demonstrate the efficacy or effectiveness of their authorized COVID-19 vaccines, as well as any vaccine candidates in development. </p><p>At this stage, the key antisera and antigens of interest for the December 2025 decision-making meeting for demonstrating breadth include antisera to: XBB.1.5, JN.1, KP.2, XEC, LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1, XFG and potentially emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including BA.3.2. Antisera of interest are animal sera after single or sequential exposure and human sera after a boost with monovalent LP.8.1, JN.1, KP.2 or XBB.1.5 vaccines. Both pre- and post-vaccination sera should be included and, for all antisera, neutralizing antibody titers should be analyzed against at least one variant that emerged after the vaccine antigen, and at multiple timepoints to assess durability, where feasible. Analysis of these antisera against the same panel of virus antigens as well as other new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants will provide insight into antigenic characteristics of previous and emerging variants. Emerging variants include the list of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest (VOI) and Variants Under Monitoring (VUM) maintained on the WHO <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants\">website</a>.

Where available, the underlying rates of disease outcomes used to derive the relative VE estimates should also be provided.</p><p>In preparation for the December 2025 meeting, the TAG-CO-VAC encourages the scientific community and vaccine manufacturers to prioritize generating and sharing the data outlined in the Table below to ensure evidence-informed deliberations on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition; please contact the TAG-CO-VAC Secretariat: [<a href=\"mailto:tagcovac@who.int\">tagcovac@who.int</a>]. </p><table border=\"1\" style=\"border-color:#000000;\"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup>\n<thead><tr><th>Type of data </th><th>Comments </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SARS-CoV-2 genetic evolution </td><td>Key variants include the list of Variants of Interest (VOI) and Variants Under Monitoring (VUM).

          "The WHO Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) continues to closely monitor the genetic and antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination, and the performance of COVID-19 vaccines against circulating variants. Based on these evaluations, WHO advises vaccine manufacturers and regulatory authorities on the implications for future updates to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. The next decision-making meeting of the TAG-CO-VAC is scheduled for December 2025, after which a statement on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition and an accompanying data annex will be published on the WHO website. These meetings are timed to balance the availability of the latest epidemiological, immunological, and virological data, with the kinetics of vaccine-induced protection and the lead time manufacturers need to update the antigen composition of authorized COVID-19 vaccines.",
          "The purpose of this statement is to guide the scientific community and vaccine manufacturers as to which data should be generated ahead of the December 2025 TAG-CO-VAC deliberations. It is an update to the previous statement on the types of data requested in March 2025. 1",
          "To inform decisions on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition, 2-7 the TAG-CO-VAC reviews data (see Table) on the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the antigenic characteristics of previously and currently circulating variants. This includes the analysis of animal antisera following primary infection or vaccination in one-way and two-way neutralization tests, as well as immunogenicity data that assess the breadth and durability of immune responses, including neutralizing antibody responses, using sera from sequentially immunized or infected animals and pre-and post-vaccination human sera. The TAG-CO-VAC also considers vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates of currently approved COVID-19 vaccines, particularly those that control for time since vaccination and that provide variant-specific estimates across different vaccine platforms for protection against any infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease. Further examples of published data reviewed by TAG-CO-VAC and used to inform decisions on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition can be found in the annexes accompanying each of the previous statements. 2-7",
          "In addition, the TAG-CO-VAC reviews available data from vaccine manufacturers, including animal and human studies demonstrating the breadth and durability of immune responses elicited by currently authorized vaccines, as well as any vaccine candidates in development. For vaccine candidates in development, the TAG-CO-VAC highlights the utility of both non-clinical and clinical immunogenicity data for decision-making on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. The TAG-CO-VAC also notes that comparable immunogenicity data (i.e. to the same variants) from previous vaccine compositions are especially useful. Vaccine manufacturers are also asked to provide observational epidemiological data that demonstrate the efficacy or effectiveness of their authorized COVID-19 vaccines, as well as any vaccine candidates in development.",
          "At this stage, the key antisera and antigens of interest for the December 2025 decision-making meeting for demonstrating breadth include antisera to: XBB.1.5, JN.1, KP.2, XEC, LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1, XFG and potentially emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including BA.3.2. Antisera of interest are animal sera after single or sequential exposure and human sera after a boost with monovalent LP.8.1, JN.1, KP.2 or XBB.1.5 vaccines. Both pre- and post-vaccination sera should be included and, for all antisera, neutralizing antibody titers should be analyzed against at least one variant that emerged after the vaccine antigen, and at multiple timepoints to assess durability, where feasible. Analysis of these antisera against the same panel of virus antigens as well as other new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants will provide insight into antigenic characteristics of previous and emerging variants. Emerging variants include the list of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest (VOI) and Variants Under Monitoring (VUM) maintained on the WHO website . Relative VE estimates should be calculated during periods of circulation of JN.1 and its descendent variants in human populations across age groups, with separate VE estimates for each of the following vaccine antigen compositions: monovalent LP.8.1, monovalent JN.1, monovalent KP.2 or monovalent XBB.1.5. Where available, the underlying rates of disease outcomes used to derive the relative VE estimates should also be provided.",
          "In preparation for the December 2025 meeting, the TAG-CO-VAC encourages the scientific community and vaccine manufacturers to prioritize generating and sharing the data outlined in the Table below to ensure evidence-informed deliberations on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition; please contact the TAG-CO-VAC Secretariat: [ tagcovac@who.int ].",

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) today released its second <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240115569\">Global hypertension report</a>, showing that 1.4 billion people lived with hypertension in 2024, yet just over one in five have it under control either through medication or addressing modifiable health risks. </p><p>The new report – released at an event co-hosted by WHO, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and Resolve to Save Lives during the 80<sup>th</sup> United Nations General Assembly – also reveals that only 28% of low-income countries report that all WHO-recommended hypertension medicines are generally available in pharmacies or primary care facilities. </p><p>Hypertension is a leading cause of heart attack, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. It is both preventable and treatable – but without urgent action, millions of people will continue to die prematurely, and countries will face mounting economic losses. From 2011 to 2025, cardiovascular diseases – including hypertension – are projected to cost low- and middle-income countries approximately US$ 3.7 trillion, equivalent to around 2% of their combined GDP. </p><p>\"Every hour, over 1000 lives are lost to strokes and heart attacks from high blood pressure, and most of these deaths are preventable,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"Countries have the tools to change this narrative. With political will, ongoing investment, and reforms to embed hypertension control in health services, we can save millions and ensure universal health coverage for all.\"</p><p>“Uncontrolled high blood pressure claims more than 10 million lives every year, despite being both preventable and treatable. Countries that integrate hypertension care into universal health coverage and primary care are making real progress, but too many low- and middle-income countries are still left behind,” said Dr Kelly Henning, who leads the Bloomberg Philanthropies Public Health Program. “Strong policies that raise awareness and expand access to treatment are critical to reducing cardiovascular disease and preventable deaths.”</p><h2>Persistent barriers</h2><p>Analysis of data from 195 countries and territories shows that 99 of them have national hypertension control rates below 20%. The majority of the affected people live in low- and middle-income countries, where health systems face resource constraints.</p><p>The report highlights major gaps in hypertension prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and long-term care. Key barriers include weak health promotion policies (on risk factors such as alcohol, tobacco use, physical inactivity, salt, and trans fats), limited access to validated blood pressure devices, lack of standardized treatment protocols and trained primary care teams, unreliable supply chains and costly medicines, inadequate financial protection for patients, and insufficient information systems to monitor trends.</p><h2>Access to medicines: a cornerstone of progress</h2><p>Blood pressure medication is one of the most cost-effective public health tools. Yet only 7 out of 25 (28%) of low-income countries report general availability of all WHO-recommended medicines, compared to 93% of high-income countries. The report explores the barriers and strategies for improving access to hypertension medication through better regulatory systems, pricing and reimbursement, procurement and supply chain management, and improved prescribing and dispensing of these medicines. </p><p>“Safe, effective, low-cost medicines to control blood pressure exist, but far too many people can’t get them,” said Dr Tom Frieden, President &amp; CEO, Resolve to Save Lives. “Closing that gap will save lives — and save billions of dollars every year.”</p><h2>Country-level progress</h2><p>Despite barriers, progress is possible. Bangladesh, the Philippines, and the Republic of Korea have made significant progress by integrating hypertension care into universal health coverage (UHC), investing in primary care, and engaging communities:</p><ul><li>Bangladesh increased hypertension control from 15% to 56% in some regions between 2019-2025 through embedding hypertension treatment services in its essential health service package and strengthening screening and follow-up care.</li><li>The Philippines has effectively incorporated the <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240001367\">WHO’s HEARTS technical package</a> into community-level services nationwide.</li><li>The Republic of Korea has integrated health reforms, including low costs for antihypertensive medications and limiting patient fees, which have resulted in the high rate of blood pressure control nationally: 59% in 2022. </li></ul><p>WHO calls on all countries to embed hypertension control in UHC reforms. Implementing the measures recommended in the report could prevent millions of premature deaths and ease the massive social and economic toll of uncontrolled high blood pressure.</p><h2>Editor’s note:<strong> </strong></h2><p>WHO defines <em>clinical hypertension</em> in adults as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg on two different days. By contrast, <em>high blood pressure</em> can increase the risk of heart and kidney disease even at levels below this threshold. For example, systolic blood pressure under 130 mmHg — though not classified as hypertension — still raises health risks.<strong> </strong></p><h3>About the World Health Organization</h3><p>Dedicated to the well-being of all people and guided by science, the World Health Organization leads and champions global efforts to give everyone, everywhere an equal chance at a safe and healthy life.

This reflects a renewed global commitment to cooperation in the face of public health emergencies, shaped by hard-earned lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The IHR are global regulations that guide 196 States Parties, including all 194 WHO Member States, on their rights and obligations concerning public health risks. They recognize that infectious diseases and other public health risks do not respect borders, and that coordinated global action is critical.</p><p>The origins of the IHR can be traced back to the 19<sup>th</sup> century, when the expansion of travel and trade accelerated the spread of disease from port to port, prompting the introduction of quarantine measures. Initially governed by bilateral and regional treaties, these efforts were made global under the International Sanitary Regulations in 1951 following the founding of WHO. These regulations were later renamed the IHR and have since evolved to meet the changing landscape of global health.</p><p>In 2024, <a href=\"/news/item/01-06-2024-world-health-assembly-agreement-reached-on-wide-ranging--decisive-package-of-amendments-to-improve-the-international-health-regulations--and-sets-date-for-finalizing-negotiations-on-a-proposed-pandemic-agreement\">WHO Member States adopted amendments</a> by consensus at the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly in Geneva. One of the changes is the introduction of a new level of global alert – a “pandemic emergency” – to trigger stronger international collaboration when a health risk escalates beyond a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and poses the risk of becoming, or has already become, a pandemic, with widespread impact on the health system and disruption to societies. The amendments also introduce the establishment of National IHR Authorities by governments to coordinate IHR implementation, and include provisions to strengthen access to medical products and financing based on equity and solidarity.</p><p>These changes were driven by lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. The last major revisions were adopted in 2005 following the SARS outbreak.</p><p>“The strengthening of the International Health Regulations represents a historic commitment to protect future generations from the devastating impact of epidemics and pandemics,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We know that no one is safe until everyone is safe. The IHR amendments reaffirm our shared responsibility and solidarity in the face of global health risks.”</p><p>Alongside the amended IHR, Member States also adopted the WHO Pandemic Agreement at this year’s World Health Assembly and are actively negotiating an annex to the agreement on Pathogen Access and Benefit Sharing.</p><p>States have the sovereign right to implement legislations related to health policies. Under the IHR, WHO serves as the Secretariat, without authority to compel action by countries.</p><p>Eleven of the 196 IHR States Parties rejected the 2024 amendments. For them, previous versions of IHR continue to apply, though rejections may be withdrawn at any time. WHO will support IHR States Parties, as requested, in integrating the amendments to the regulations into national legal frameworks and strengthening institutional capacities to work together to build a safer, healthier future for all.<br/> </p><h3>Note to editors</h3><p>The text of the IHR, as amended in 2024, is published on the <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/bd/pdf_files/IHR_2014-2022-2024-en.pdf\">WHO website</a>.

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) today released a new report titled <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240115859\">“Saving lives, spending less”</a>, revealing that an additional investment of just US$3 per person annually in tackling noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) could yield economic benefits of up to US$1 trillion by 2030.</p><p>Alongside the report, WHO shared new analysis of country-level progress in reducing NCD mortality between 2010 and 2019. While 82% of countries achieved reductions during this period, the rate of progress has slowed significantly across most regions, with some countries even experiencing a resurgence in NCD-related deaths. </p><p>NCDs are responsible for the majority of global deaths, while more than one billion people live with mental health conditions. Alarmingly, nearly 75% of deaths related to NCDs and mental health conditions occur in low- and middle-income countries, accounting for 32 million lives lost each year.</p><p>In just a few days—on 25 September 2025—Heads of State and Government will convene in New York for the Fourth United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting (HLM4) on prevention and control of NCDs and the promotion of mental health and well-being. The meeting aims to adopt an ambitious Political Declaration to accelerate global action and investment in these critical health and development areas.</p><p>\"Noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions are silent killers, robbing us of lives and innovation,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"We have the tools to save lives and reduce suffering. Countries like Denmark, South Korea, and Moldova are leading the way, while others stalling. Investing in the fight against NCDs isn't just smart economics—it's an urgent necessity for thriving societies.\"</p><p>NCDs include cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma), and diabetes, among others. Mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression, are also highly prevalent across all countries and communities, affecting people of all ages and income levels. Without urgent and sustained action to tackle these, millions more lives will be lost prematurely.</p><h2>Low progress, lives at risk<strong></strong><strong></strong></h2><p>While the majority of countries made progress in reducing the risk of dying prematurely from an NCD between 2010 and 2019, 60% experienced a slowdown in progress compared to the previous decade. Denmark recorded the largest improvements for both sexes. Among countries in other regions, NCD mortality also declined for both sexes in China, Egypt, Nigeria, Russia, and Brazil.</p><p>The biggest gains were driven by declines in cardiovascular disease and certain cancers—such as stomach and colorectal cancers for both sexes, cervical and breast cancers for women, and lung and prostate cancers for men. In contrast, pancreatic, liver cancers and neurological conditions contributed to rising mortality in many countries. </p><h2>Solutions are affordable and cost effective<strong></strong><strong></strong></h2><p>Solutions to tackle NCDs and promote mental health and well-being are both affordable and highly cost-effective. Yet, governments often face intense lobbying from powerful industries whose products contribute to disease. Tobacco, alcohol, and ultra-processed food companies frequently attempt to block, weaken, or delay life-saving policies—ranging from health taxes to marketing restrictions aimed at protecting children.</p><p>“It is unacceptable that commercial interests are profiting from increasing deaths and disease,” said Dr Etienne Krug, Director of WHO’s Department of Health Determinants, Promotion and Prevention. “Governments must put people before profits and ensure evidence-based policy is not derailed by corporate pressure.”</p><p>Scaling up implementation of WHO’s ‘Best Buys’, a set of high impact interventions including tobacco and alcohol taxation, protecting children from harmful marketing, managing hypertension, and scaling up cervical cancer screening would cost just an additional US$3 per person per year on average. The return on investment is substantial: by 2030, full implementation could save 12 million lives, prevent 28 million heart attacks and strokes, add 150 million healthy life years, and generate over US$1 trillion in economic benefits.</p><h2>Political will to change the future<strong> </strong><strong></strong></h2><p>The upcoming Fourth UN General Assembly High-Level Meeting (HLM4) on NCDs and mental health is the most significant political opportunity of the decade to drive transformative change.

          "While the majority of countries made progress in reducing the risk of dying prematurely from an NCD between 2010 and 2019, 60% experienced a slowdown in progress compared to the previous decade. Denmark recorded the largest improvements for both sexes. Among countries in other regions, NCD mortality also declined for both sexes in China, Egypt, Nigeria, Russia, and Brazil.",
          "The biggest gains were driven by declines in cardiovascular disease and certain cancers—such as stomach and colorectal cancers for both sexes, cervical and breast cancers for women, and lung and prostate cancers for men. In contrast, pancreatic, liver cancers and neurological conditions contributed to rising mortality in many countries."

Yet, governments often face intense lobbying from powerful industries whose products contribute to disease. Tobacco, alcohol, and ultra-processed food companies frequently attempt to block, weaken, or delay life-saving policies—ranging from health taxes to marketing restrictions aimed at protecting children.",
          "“It is unacceptable that commercial interests are profiting from increasing deaths and disease,” said Dr Etienne Krug, Director of WHO’s Department of Health Determinants, Promotion and Prevention. “Governments must put people before profits and ensure evidence-based policy is not derailed by corporate pressure.”",
          "Scaling up implementation of WHO’s ‘Best Buys’, a set of high impact interventions including tobacco and alcohol taxation, protecting children from harmful marketing, managing hypertension, and scaling up cervical cancer screening would cost just an additional US$3 per person per year on average. The return on investment is substantial: by 2030, full implementation could save 12 million lives, prevent 28 million heart attacks and strokes, add 150 million healthy life years, and generate over US$1 trillion in economic benefits."

Medicines for cystic fibrosis, psoriasis, haemophilia and blood-related disorders are among the other additions.</p><p>WHO EML and EMLc include medicines for priority health needs of populations. They are adopted in over 150 countries, serving as a basis for public sector procurement, supply of medicines and health insurance, reimbursement schemes. The revisions mark the 24<sup>th</sup> edition of WHO EML and 10<sup>th</sup> edition of EMLc. </p><p>“The new editions of essential medicines lists mark a significant step toward expanding access to new medicines with proven clinical benefits and with high potential for global public health impact,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, Assistant Director-General for Health Systems, Access and Data.</p><p>Launched in 1977 largely to promote better access to medicines in developing countries, the WHO Model Lists have become a trusted global policy tool for decisions related to the selection and universal coverage of medicines within all health systems.</p><p>The WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines reviewed 59 applications, including 31 proposals for the addition of new medicines or medicine classes. As a result, 20 new medicines were added to the EML and 15 to the EMLc, along with new use indications for seven already-listed products. The updated lists now include a total of 523 essential medicines for adults and 374 for children, reflecting the most pressing public health needs. </p><h2>Cancer medicines<strong> </strong></h2><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, claiming nearly 10 million lives each year and responsible for almost one in three premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases. Cancer treatments have been a major focus of the WHO EML for the past decade. With cancer medicines accounting today for about half of all new drug approvals by regulatory agencies, the Expert Committee applies rigorous criteria to recommend only those therapies that offer the greatest clinical benefit. As a result, few approved cancer medicines are included – only those proven to prolong life by at least 4-6 months.</p><p>Seven applications encompassing 25 cancer medicines were evaluated. As part of broader efforts to reduce inequities in cancer care, the Committee recommended increasing access to PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, a class of immunotherapy medicines that help the body’s immune system recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. Pembrolizumab was added to the EML as a first-line monotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. For the latter, atezolizumab and cemiplimab are included as therapeutic alternatives.</p><p>The Committee also considered several expert-recommended strategies – highlighted in the <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/2025-eml-expert-committee/comments/cancer-expert-report.pdf?sfvrsn=41918b2d_1\">cancer experts report</a> – aimed at improving access to and affordability of cancer treatments. It endorsed evidence-based clinical and health system strategies, including dose optimisation approaches, to improve access. The Committee emphasized that while health system reforms require time and government action, clinical strategies can be implemented immediately to deliver faster benefits, especially in resource-limited settings. </p><h2>Medicines for diabetes and obesity</h2><p>Diabetes and obesity are two of the most urgent health challenges facing the world today. Over 800 million people were living with diabetes in 2022, with half going untreated. At the same time, more than 1 billion people worldwide are affected by obesity, and rates are rising especially fast in low- and middle-income countries. These two conditions are closely linked and can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease and kidney failure.</p><p>The WHO Expert Committee reviewed strong scientific evidence showing that a group of medicines called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists can help people with type 2 diabetes – especially those who also have heart or kidney disease – by improving blood sugar control, reducing the risk of heart and kidney complications, supporting weight loss, and even lowering the risk of early death. </p><p>GLP-1 receptor agonists – semaglutide, dulaglutide and liraglutide – and the GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) dual receptor agonist (tirzepatide) have been added to the EML. They are used as glucose lowering therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease and obesity (defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30kg/m<sup>2</sup>). This provides clear guidance to countries on which patients can benefit most from these therapies.</p><p>High prices of medicines like semaglutide and tirzepatide are limiting access to these medicines. Prioritizing those who would benefit most, encouraging generic competition to drive down prices and making these treatments available in primary care – especially in underserved areas – are key to expanding access and improving health outcomes. WHO will continue monitoring developments, support fair pricing strategies, and help countries improve access to these life-changing treatments.</p><p>“A large share of out-of-pocket spending on noncommunicable diseases goes toward medicines, including those classified as essential and that, in principle, should be financially accessible to everyone,” said Deusdedit Mubangizi, WHO Director of Policy and Standards for Medicines and Health Products. “Achieving equitable access to essential medicines requires a coherent health system response backed by strong political will, multisectoral cooperation, and people-centred programmes that leave no one behind.”</p><p>More details of the Expert Committee’s recommendations, describing the additions, changes and removal of medicines and formulations, and decisions not to recommend medicines are available in the Executive Summary <a href=\"/publications/i/item/B09544\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Note to editors</strong></p><p>The meeting of the 25th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines was held at WHO Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, from 5 to 9 May 2025. The Expert Committee considered a total of 59 applications, assessing the scientific evidence on each medicine’s effectiveness, safety, comparative cost, and overall cost-effectiveness to inform its recommendations. The Committee also considered proposals relating to the definitions and update of the AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification of antibiotics.</p><p>The Model Lists are updated every two years by an Expert Committee, made up of recognized specialists from academia, research and the medical and pharmaceutical professions, to address new health challenges, prioritize highly effective therapeutics and improve affordable access.<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span></p>",

They are used as glucose lowering therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease and obesity (defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30kg/m 2 ). This provides clear guidance to countries on which patients can benefit most from these therapies.",
          "High prices of medicines like semaglutide and tirzepatide are limiting access to these medicines. Prioritizing those who would benefit most, encouraging generic competition to drive down prices and making these treatments available in primary care – especially in underserved areas – are key to expanding access and improving health outcomes. WHO will continue monitoring developments, support fair pricing strategies, and help countries improve access to these life-changing treatments.",
          "“A large share of out-of-pocket spending on noncommunicable diseases goes toward medicines, including those classified as essential and that, in principle, should be financially accessible to everyone,” said Deusdedit Mubangizi, WHO Director of Policy and Standards for Medicines and Health Products. “Achieving equitable access to essential medicines requires a coherent health system response backed by strong political will, multisectoral cooperation, and people-centred programmes that leave no one behind.”",
          "More details of the Expert Committee’s recommendations, describing the additions, changes and removal of medicines and formulations, and decisions not to recommend medicines are available in the Executive Summary here .",
          "Note to editors",
          "The meeting of the 25th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines was held at WHO Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, from 5 to 9 May 2025. The Expert Committee considered a total of 59 applications, assessing the scientific evidence on each medicine’s effectiveness, safety, comparative cost, and overall cost-effectiveness to inform its recommendations. The Committee also considered proposals relating to the definitions and update of the AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification of antibiotics.",
          "The Model Lists are updated every two years by an Expert Committee, made up of recognized specialists from academia, research and the medical and pharmaceutical professions, to address new health challenges, prioritize highly effective therapeutics and improve affordable access."

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has validated Kenya as having eliminated human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness as a public health problem, making it the tenth country to reach this important milestone. HAT is the second neglected tropical disease (NTD) to be eliminated in Kenya: the country was certified free of Guinea worm disease in 2018. </p><p>“I congratulate the government and people of Kenya on this landmark achievement,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Kenya joins the growing ranks of countries freeing their populations of human African trypanosomiasis. This is another step towards making Africa free of neglected tropical diseases”.   </p><p>HAT is a vector-borne disease caused by the blood parasite <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>. It is transmitted to humans through the bites of tsetse flies that have acquired the parasites from infected humans or animals. Rural populations dependent on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting are most at risk of exposure. </p><p>As the name indicates, HAT is transmitted only on the African continent. The disease exists in two forms, <em>gambiense</em> and <em>rhodesiense</em>. The <em>rhodesiense </em>form (r-HAT), which is found in eastern and southern Africa, is the only one present in Kenya. It is caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</em> and progresses rapidly, invading multiple organs including the brain. Without treatment, it is fatal within weeks.</p><h2>Kenya’s progress</h2><p>“This validation marks a major public health milestone for Kenya, as we celebrate the elimination of a deadly disease in our country. The achievement will not only protect our people but also pave the way for renewed economic growth and prosperity,” said Dr Aden Duale, Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Health. “This follows many years of dedication, hard work and collaboration”. </p><p>The first cases of HAT in Kenya were detected in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Since then, Kenya has engaged in consistent control activities, without indigenous new cases reported for over 10 years. The last autochthonous case was detected in 2009, and the last two exported cases, infected in the Masai Mara National Reserve, were detected in 2012. </p><p>Recently, Kenya strengthened HAT surveillance in 12 health facilities in six historically endemic counties to act as sentinel sites. They were equipped with diagnostic tools and had their clinical personnel trained on diagnostic procedures, including the most sensitive and practical tests for r-HAT. The country also actively monitors the control and surveillance of tsetse flies and animal trypanosomiasis, both within and beyond the historical HAT endemic areas, supported by the national veterinary health authorities and the Kenya Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Council (KENTTEC). These activities and the related data provide supplementary backing to the claim of HAT elimination as a public health problem.</p><p>“This key milestone reflects Kenya’s efforts and commitment over many years, as a collaboration between national and county governments, national research institutions, development partners and affected communities,” said Dr Patrick Amoth, EBS, Director General Health, Ministry of Health, Kenya. “The country remains fully committed to sustain the quality of care and surveillance in line with WHO’s recommendations”.</p><p>Supported by WHO and partners, including FIND, Kenya’s HAT elimination programme will now implement a post-validation surveillance plan to detect any potential resurgence or reintroduction of transmission. WHO continues to support ongoing monitoring in previously affected areas and maintains a stock of medicines to ensure rapid treatment of possible future cases, thanks to donations from Bayer AG and Sanofi.</p><p>“This success was made possible by the Ministry of Health’s leadership, the dedication of health workers in areas at risk and the support from key partners,” said Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, WHO Representative to Kenya. “WHO is proud to have contributed to this achievement and encourages all stakeholders to remain involved in post-validation monitoring”. </p><h2>Progress in global HAT elimination</h2><p>A total of 57 countries have eliminated at least one NTD. Of these, 10 (including Kenya) have successfully eliminated HAT as a public health problem. The other countries that have reached this milestone are Benin, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Rwanda, Togo and Uganda.</p><p> </p>",

They were equipped with diagnostic tools and had their clinical personnel trained on diagnostic procedures, including the most sensitive and practical tests for r-HAT. The country also actively monitors the control and surveillance of tsetse flies and animal trypanosomiasis, both within and beyond the historical HAT endemic areas, supported by the national veterinary health authorities and the Kenya Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Council (KENTTEC). These activities and the related data provide supplementary backing to the claim of HAT elimination as a public health problem.",
          "“This key milestone reflects Kenya’s efforts and commitment over many years, as a collaboration between national and county governments, national research institutions, development partners and affected communities,” said Dr Patrick Amoth, EBS, Director General Health, Ministry of Health, Kenya. “The country remains fully committed to sustain the quality of care and surveillance in line with WHO’s recommendations”.",
          "Supported by WHO and partners, including FIND, Kenya’s HAT elimination programme will now implement a post-validation surveillance plan to detect any potential resurgence or reintroduction of transmission. WHO continues to support ongoing monitoring in previously affected areas and maintains a stock of medicines to ensure rapid treatment of possible future cases, thanks to donations from Bayer AG and Sanofi.",
          "“This success was made possible by the Ministry of Health’s leadership, the dedication of health workers in areas at risk and the support from key partners,” said Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, WHO Representative to Kenya. “WHO is proud to have contributed to this achievement and encourages all stakeholders to remain involved in post-validation monitoring”."

Technical updates were received about the situation in the following countries: Afghanistan, Angola, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Papua New Guinea.</p><h2><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Wild poliovirus</strong></h2><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Since the last Emergency Committee meeting, nine new WPV1 cases were reported, one from Afghanistan and eight from Pakistan bringing the total to 13 WPV1 cases in 2025. In 2024, 99 WPV1 cases were reported during the whole year, including 25 from Afghanistan and 74 from Pakistan. A total of 275 WPV1 positive environmental samples have been reported in 2025 so far (as of 04 June), 30 from Afghanistan and 245 from Pakistan. In 2024, 741 WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported during the whole year, including 113 from Afghanistan and 628 from Pakistan.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The upward trend in WPV1 cases and environmental detections has persisted in both endemic countries throughout 2024. In Pakistan, this increase has been evident since mid-2023, initially in environmental samples and later in paralytic polio cases, primarily in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Sindh, and Balochistan. In Afghanistan, the rise in WPV1 detections, both in environmental samples and cases during 2024 and 2025 has been concentrated primarily in the South Region. WPV1 transmission in Afghanistan’s East Region has significantly declined during the first half of 2025, indicating enhanced population immunity. The Committee noted with concern the geographic expansion of WPV1 to new provinces and districts in both endemic countries during 2024 and 2025. Notably, Gilgit-Baltistan province in Pakistan reported its first WPV1 case in over eight years, underscoring the continued risk posed by persistent transmission in core reservoir areas. Currently, the most intense WPV1 transmission is occurring in the southern cross-border epidemiological corridor, encompassing Quetta Block (Pakistan) and the South Region (Afghanistan). The Committee also noted the ongoing WPV1 transmission in the epidemiologically critical blocks of Karachi, South KP and Central Pakistan.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Recent review of the molecular epidemiology shows an increase in the genetic biodiversity in 2024, necessitating a split of two genetic clusters into eight genetic clusters. Three genetic clusters are active in 2025. The remaining chains of transmission continue to circulate in populations and geographic areas with persistently low immunization coverage, including the bordering districts of the southern and northern epidemiological corridors across the two endemic countries. The genetic data analysis also indicates that WPV1 persisted through the low transmission season (October 2024 to April 2025) within the core reservoirs of Southern Afghanistan, Karachi, Peshawar, and the Quetta Block - posing a risk to achieving Goal 1 of the GPEI strategy by end-2025.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to implement an intensive and mostly synchronized campaign schedule, with a focus on achieving high vaccination coverage in core reservoirs and ensuring timely, effective response to WPV1 detections in other areas of each country. Afghanistan implemented two nationwide and two sub-national vaccination rounds while Pakistan implemented three nationwide and one sub-national vaccination round in 2025, so far.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In Afghanistan, campaigns are being conducted using the site-to-site strategy, with focused efforts to strengthen operational and communication approaches to maximize coverage of target children under this modality. The Committee expressed concern that site-to-site campaigns often fail to reach all children, particularly younger children and girls, which could contribute to a resurgence of WPV1 and its further geographic spread within Afghanistan and beyond.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee noted with appreciation the strong leadership and high-level commitment to polio eradication in Pakistan at all levels, including the direct engagement of the Prime Minister, the Federal Minister for Health, and the Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication. The Committee also acknowledged the consistently high reported coverage and Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) pass rates at the national and provincial levels. However, the Committee observed variability in campaign quality at the district and sub-district levels, attributed to operational challenges and prevailing insecurity, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In addition to seasonal population movements within and between the two endemic countries, the continued return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan further compounds the challenges faced by the programme. This ongoing displacement heightens the risk of cross-border poliovirus transmission, as well as transmission within both countries. The Committee noted that this risk is being addressed through vaccination at border crossing points and the revision of micro-plans in districts of origin and return. The programme continues to coordinate closely with IOM and UNHCR. The Committee also acknowledged the ongoing coordination between the Afghanistan and Pakistan programmes at both national and sub-national levels and encouraged the continuation of these collaborative efforts.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In summary, available data indicate that global WPV1 transmission remains geographically confined to the two endemic countries. However, during 2024 and 2025, there has been geographic spread alongside continued transmission within core reservoir areas in both the endemic countries.</span></p><h2><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV)</strong></h2><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In 2025, a total of 67 cVDPV cases have been reported to date, 65 of which are cVDPV2 and two are cVDPV3. No cVDPV1 cases have been reported in 2025. Additionally, 69 environmental samples have tested positive for cVDPV, all of which are type 2. In 2024, a total of 319 cVDPV cases were reported, including 304 cVDPV2, 11 cVDPV1, and 4 cVDPV3 cases. During the same year, 276 environmental samples tested positive for cVDPV, 273 cVDPV2 and three cVDPV3. Since the last meeting of the Emergency Committee, a cVDPV2 outbreak has been reported from Papua New Guinea in the WHO Western Pacific Region.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In 2025, a total of 15 circulating cVDPV2 emergence groups have been detected to date, compared to 30 in 2024, 27 in 2023, 22 in 2022, 29 in 2021, 36 in 2020, and 44 in 2019. Of the 15 emergence groups identified in 2025, two are newly detected this year and are derived from the novel OPV2 (nOPV2) vaccine. Since its introduction in 2021, approximately 1.65 billion doses of nOPV2 have been administered and a total of 30 cVDPV2 emergences have been associated with nOPV2. The Committee noted that nOPV2 continues to demonstrate significantly greater genetic stability and a substantially lower risk of reversion to neurovirulence compared to Sabin OPV2.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">No cVDPV1 cases or positive environmental samples have been reported so far in 2025 (as of 4 June). In 2024, a total of 11 cVDPV1 cases were reported, 10 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and one in Mozambique. The Committee noted the encouraging development of the closure of the cVDPV1 outbreak in Madagascar, following more than 18 months without detection, and supported by vigorous response efforts.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Guinea is the only country to report cVDPV3 cases in 2025 to date, with two cases confirmed. In 2024, cVDPV3 outbreaks were reported in two countries: French Guiana (a French territory in South America) and Guinea. Both outbreaks were attributed to new emergences, resulting in three positive environmental samples in French Guiana (May to August 2024) and four cVDPV3 cases in Guinea (July to November 2024). The Committee noted with concern the continuation of the cVDPV3 outbreak in Guinea from 2024 into 2025, as well as the co-circulation of both cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 in the country.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee noted that the risk of cVDPV outbreaks is largely driven by a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, high concentrations of zero-dose and under-immunized children, and ongoing population displacement.</span></p><h2><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Conclusion</strong></h2><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended extending the Temporary Recommendations for a further three months.

This high environmental surveillance positivity during the low transmission season indicates intense WPV1 transmission and significant gaps in population immunity.</li><li>Lack of house-to-house vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan represents a major risk of further WPV1 spread and intensification of its transmission.</li><li>Certain geographies and population pockets in the epidemiologically critical areas of Pakistan continue to have inconsistent campaign quality and substantial number of unimmunized and under-immunized children due to insecurity, operational gaps, and vaccine hesitancy.</li><li>Ongoing population movement between the two endemic countries, including the returnees from Pakistan to Afghanistan, leading to cross-border WPV1 transmission.</li><li>Ongoing population movement from the two endemic countries to other countries, neighbouring and distant.</li></ul><h3>Ongoing risk of cVDPV international spread</h3><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of cVDPV appears to remain high:</p><ul><li>Ongoing cross border spread including into newly re-infected countries and territories.</li><li>Continued cVDPV2 transmission in Lake Chad Basin particularly the critical areas of Nigeria, and its potential to amplify the transmission.</li><li>The cVDPV2 transmission in the Horn of Africa seems to be intensifying, particularly in Ethiopia. The Horn of Africa countries continue to face humanitarian and health emergencies making it challenging to implement high-quality vaccination campaigns in a timely manner.</li><li>There is a large pool of unimmunized susceptible children in the Northern Governorates of Yemen. There are challenges regarding timely shipping of AFP stool specimens from northern Yemen.</li><li>The widening gap in population intestinal mucosal immunity in young children since the withdrawal of OPV2 in 2016, as well as high concentration of zero dose children in certain areas.</li><li>Despite no cVDPV1 detection for the last nine months, continued low routine immunization and IPV coverage in several countries and associated immunity gap, indicates continued risk of cVDPV1 emergence.</li><li>Continued cVDPV3 transmission in Guinea and risk of its spread, especially to the areas and populations with low immunity against type-3 poliovirus</li></ul><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Contributing factors include:</span></p><ul><li>Sub-optimal routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by humanitarian emergencies including conflict and protracted complex emergencies.

recommendations</span></p><p>The Committee noted with concern that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is revisiting its priorities and reprogramming its operations considering current fiscal constraints. The financial shortfall, estimated at nearly 40%, represents a serious risk to the achievement of eradication goals. All components of the programme, including the capacity to sustain sensitive surveillance for polioviruses, are at considerable risk due to reduced funding levels. These risks are further amplified by the parallel funding constraints faced by WHO, other international health partners, and individual countries, reflecting broader fiscal pressures across the global health landscape. The Committee therefore urged donor countries and partner organizations to strengthen their financial support, stressing that the consequences of falling short would be significant and far-reaching. The Committee further called on national governments to prioritize polio eradication within their domestic funding frameworks to safeguard progress and maintain momentum toward the goal of global polio eradication.</p><p>The Committee expressed concern over the continued transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in the core reservoirs of Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as its spread to additional areas within both countries, including locations that had not reported WPV1 for extended periods, such as the recent case in Gilgit-Baltistan after an eight-year absence. The Committee noted that WPV1 transmission persisted through the low transmission season, underscoring the risk of further intensification during the ongoing high transmission season if high-quality vaccination activities are not effectively implemented. The persistence of WPV1 transmission despite ongoing vaccination campaigns highlights gaps in immunization quality.</p><p>The Committee remains concerned about the continued inability to conduct house-to-house vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan. This challenge places infants and young children at a heightened risk of missing polio vaccination. The Committee urged the Afghanistan polio programme to explore options for transitioning to house-to-house vaccination, noting that site-to-site campaigns do not achieve the level of coverage and quality required to reach eradication. The Committee also recommended recruitment of additional female vaccinators to enhance community acceptance and improve coverage, especially in the South Region of Afghanistan.</p><p>The Committee acknowledged the strong political commitment to polio eradication demonstrated at the national and provincial levels in Pakistan. The Committee emphasized, however, that this commitment must be translated into concrete operational measures to strengthen community engagement and ensure the implementation of high-quality vaccination campaigns, especially in the core reservoirs and epidemiologically critical areas. These efforts are critical to interrupt ongoing intense WPV1 transmission and to reduce the risk of further national and international spread.</p><p>The Committee is encouraged by the improving cVDPV1 situation in the African Region, including the closure of the cVDPV1 outbreak in Madagascar. The Committee noted the continued detection of cVDPV3 in Guinea in 2025 following its emergence in 2024, highlighting the risk of further spread if not contained through high-quality vaccination activities.</p><p>The Committee noted the continued transmission of cVDPV2 in the African Region, particularly in the Lake Chad Basin and the Horn of Africa. While there has been an overall decline in cVDPV2 cases over the past two years, the Committee expressed concern over the increase in reported cases from Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Yemen during the past 12 months. The Committee also noted the concerning cVDPV2 epidemiological situation in Algeria (African Region) and Papua New Guinea (Western Pacific Region) and recommended the immediate implementation of high-quality vaccination campaigns to strengthen population immunity. Additionally, the Committee acknowledged the persistent challenges in conducting effective immunization responses in critical areas of the African Region and northern Yemen.</p><p>The Committee expressed concern over the epidemiological situation in Papua New Guinea, particularly in areas and populations with very low immunity to type 2 poliovirus and sub-optimal surveillance quality. The situation in Papua New Guinea requires urgent surveillance strengthening measures including addressing silent areas for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance to minimize the risk of undetected cVDPV2 circulation, alongside rapid implementation of high-quality immunization activities to build immunity in populations with historically low type 2 poliovirus protection. </p><p>The Committee noted that several countries affected by cVDPV continue to face conflict and insecurity, which disrupt both routine immunization services and polio vaccination campaigns. The Committee further observed that ongoing health emergencies and concurrent disease outbreaks in multiple countries are compounding the challenges for timely and effective implementation of polio vaccination campaigns. Recognizing the diverse and complex operating environments at national and sub-national levels, the Committee emphasized the need for context-specific, tailored interventions to ensure high-quality vaccination activities and ultimately interrupt cVDPV transmission. The Committee underscored the importance of synchronized sub-regional strategies and robust cross-border coordination to address issues related to porous borders and shared operational constraints across affected countries.</p><p>The Committee noted the continued cross-border spread of cVDPV2 within the African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, the detection of cVDPV2 in multiple countries of the European Region, and the recent detection of cVDPV2 in Papua New Guinea, linked to the 2024 transmission in Indonesia. These developments underscore that polio remains a global threat until eradication is fully achieved. The Committee emphasized the critical importance of maintaining sensitive surveillance systems in polio-affected and high-risk countries and recommended that the GPEI provide all necessary support under the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan. The Committee also underscored the need for high-income countries to sustain high-quality poliovirus surveillance, given the persistent risk of importation, as recently demonstrated by detections in the European Region. Robust surveillance remains essential for early detection and timely response to both importations and newly emerging outbreaks.</p><p>The Committee recognized the critical role that mobile and migrant populations play in sustaining WPV1 transmission in endemic countries, as well as cVDPV transmission in the African Region and globally. The Committee urged that vaccinating populations on the move be treated as a top priority, emphasizing the importance of identifying different categories of mobile populations such as seasonal, economic, and agricultural migrants, and reaching them through country-specific, tailored strategies and approaches.</p><p>The Committee noted that novel OPV2 continues to demonstrate greater genetic stability compared to Sabin OPV2. However, the risk of new cVDPV2 emergences increases when the interval between outbreak response campaigns exceeds four weeks or when vaccination quality is suboptimal, underscoring the need for timely and high-quality immunization efforts. </p><p>The Committee expressed concern that several countries are not initiating outbreak response campaigns in a timely manner, as recommended by SAGE and other technical advisory bodies. Such delays increase the risk of prolonged cVDPV outbreaks and the emergence of new ones. The Committee recommended that all countries ensure the prompt initiation of outbreak response campaigns and maintain an interval of no more than four weeks between the two rounds of response campaigns.</p><p>The Committee noted that the amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) through resolution WHA77.17 (2024), were notified to States Parties on 19 September 2024 and that they would come into effect on 19 September 2025 for 192 States Parties.  Regarding any potential effects of these amendments on the Committee, the Secretariat informed the Committee that it would be premature to assess any such effects at this time but would brief the Committee ahead of their entry into force in September 2025, should the Committee continue to be convened under the IHR at this time.</p><p>Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPVs, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment, and on 11 July 2025 determined that the poliovirus situation continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States previously infected by WPV1 or cVDPV within the last 24 months’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective, 11 July 2025.</p>",

          "Since the last Emergency Committee meeting, nine new WPV1 cases were reported, one from Afghanistan and eight from Pakistan bringing the total to 13 WPV1 cases in 2025. In 2024, 99 WPV1 cases were reported during the whole year, including 25 from Afghanistan and 74 from Pakistan. A total of 275 WPV1 positive environmental samples have been reported in 2025 so far (as of 04 June), 30 from Afghanistan and 245 from Pakistan. In 2024, 741 WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported during the whole year, including 113 from Afghanistan and 628 from Pakistan.",
          "The upward trend in WPV1 cases and environmental detections has persisted in both endemic countries throughout 2024. In Pakistan, this increase has been evident since mid-2023, initially in environmental samples and later in paralytic polio cases, primarily in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Sindh, and Balochistan. In Afghanistan, the rise in WPV1 detections, both in environmental samples and cases during 2024 and 2025 has been concentrated primarily in the South Region. WPV1 transmission in Afghanistan’s East Region has significantly declined during the first half of 2025, indicating enhanced population immunity. The Committee noted with concern the geographic expansion of WPV1 to new provinces and districts in both endemic countries during 2024 and 2025. Notably, Gilgit-Baltistan province in Pakistan reported its first WPV1 case in over eight years, underscoring the continued risk posed by persistent transmission in core reservoir areas. Currently, the most intense WPV1 transmission is occurring in the southern cross-border epidemiological corridor, encompassing Quetta Block (Pakistan) and the South Region (Afghanistan). The Committee also noted the ongoing WPV1 transmission in the epidemiologically critical blocks of Karachi, South KP and Central Pakistan.",
          "Recent review of the molecular epidemiology shows an increase in the genetic biodiversity in 2024, necessitating a split of two genetic clusters into eight genetic clusters. Three genetic clusters are active in 2025. The remaining chains of transmission continue to circulate in populations and geographic areas with persistently low immunization coverage, including the bordering districts of the southern and northern epidemiological corridors across the two endemic countries. The genetic data analysis also indicates that WPV1 persisted through the low transmission season (October 2024 to April 2025) within the core reservoirs of Southern Afghanistan, Karachi, Peshawar, and the Quetta Block - posing a risk to achieving Goal 1 of the GPEI strategy by end-2025.",
          "Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to implement an intensive and mostly synchronized campaign schedule, with a focus on achieving high vaccination coverage in core reservoirs and ensuring timely, effective response to WPV1 detections in other areas of each country. Afghanistan implemented two nationwide and two sub-national vaccination rounds while Pakistan implemented three nationwide and one sub-national vaccination round in 2025, so far.",
          "In Afghanistan, campaigns are being conducted using the site-to-site strategy, with focused efforts to strengthen operational and communication approaches to maximize coverage of target children under this modality. The Committee expressed concern that site-to-site campaigns often fail to reach all children, particularly younger children and girls, which could contribute to a resurgence of WPV1 and its further geographic spread within Afghanistan and beyond.",
          "The Committee noted with appreciation the strong leadership and high-level commitment to polio eradication in Pakistan at all levels, including the direct engagement of the Prime Minister, the Federal Minister for Health, and the Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication. The Committee also acknowledged the consistently high reported coverage and Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) pass rates at the national and provincial levels. However, the Committee observed variability in campaign quality at the district and sub-district levels, attributed to operational challenges and prevailing insecurity, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces.",
          "In addition to seasonal population movements within and between the two endemic countries, the continued return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan further compounds the challenges faced by the programme. This ongoing displacement heightens the risk of cross-border poliovirus transmission, as well as transmission within both countries. The Committee noted that this risk is being addressed through vaccination at border crossing points and the revision of micro-plans in districts of origin and return. The programme continues to coordinate closely with IOM and UNHCR. The Committee also acknowledged the ongoing coordination between the Afghanistan and Pakistan programmes at both national and sub-national levels and encouraged the continuation of these collaborative efforts.",
          "In summary, available data indicate that global WPV1 transmission remains geographically confined to the two endemic countries. However, during 2024 and 2025, there has been geographic spread alongside continued transmission within core reservoir areas in both the endemic countries."

During the same year, 276 environmental samples tested positive for cVDPV, 273 cVDPV2 and three cVDPV3. Since the last meeting of the Emergency Committee, a cVDPV2 outbreak has been reported from Papua New Guinea in the WHO Western Pacific Region.",

Of the 15 emergence groups identified in 2025, two are newly detected this year and are derived from the novel OPV2 (nOPV2) vaccine. Since its introduction in 2021, approximately 1.65 billion doses of nOPV2 have been administered and a total of 30 cVDPV2 emergences have been associated with nOPV2. The Committee noted that nOPV2 continues to demonstrate significantly greater genetic stability and a substantially lower risk of reversion to neurovirulence compared to Sabin OPV2.",
          "No cVDPV1 cases or positive environmental samples have been reported so far in 2025 (as of 4 June). In 2024, a total of 11 cVDPV1 cases were reported, 10 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and one in Mozambique. The Committee noted the encouraging development of the closure of the cVDPV1 outbreak in Madagascar, following more than 18 months without detection, and supported by vigorous response efforts.",
          "Guinea is the only country to report cVDPV3 cases in 2025 to date, with two cases confirmed. In 2024, cVDPV3 outbreaks were reported in two countries: French Guiana (a French territory in South America) and Guinea. Both outbreaks were attributed to new emergences, resulting in three positive environmental samples in French Guiana (May to August 2024) and four cVDPV3 cases in Guinea (July to November 2024). The Committee noted with concern the continuation of the cVDPV3 outbreak in Guinea from 2024 into 2025, as well as the co-circulation of both cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 in the country.",
          "The Committee noted that the risk of cVDPV outbreaks is largely driven by a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, high concentrations of zero-dose and under-immunized children, and ongoing population displacement."

The financial shortfall, estimated at nearly 40%, represents a serious risk to the achievement of eradication goals. All components of the programme, including the capacity to sustain sensitive surveillance for polioviruses, are at considerable risk due to reduced funding levels. These risks are further amplified by the parallel funding constraints faced by WHO, other international health partners, and individual countries, reflecting broader fiscal pressures across the global health landscape. The Committee therefore urged donor countries and partner organizations to strengthen their financial support, stressing that the consequences of falling short would be significant and far-reaching. The Committee further called on national governments to prioritize polio eradication within their domestic funding frameworks to safeguard progress and maintain momentum toward the goal of global polio eradication.",
          "The Committee expressed concern over the continued transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in the core reservoirs of Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as its spread to additional areas within both countries, including locations that had not reported WPV1 for extended periods, such as the recent case in Gilgit-Baltistan after an eight-year absence. The Committee noted that WPV1 transmission persisted through the low transmission season, underscoring the risk of further intensification during the ongoing high transmission season if high-quality vaccination activities are not effectively implemented. The persistence of WPV1 transmission despite ongoing vaccination campaigns highlights gaps in immunization quality.",
          "The Committee remains concerned about the continued inability to conduct house-to-house vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan. This challenge places infants and young children at a heightened risk of missing polio vaccination. The Committee urged the Afghanistan polio programme to explore options for transitioning to house-to-house vaccination, noting that site-to-site campaigns do not achieve the level of coverage and quality required to reach eradication. The Committee also recommended recruitment of additional female vaccinators to enhance community acceptance and improve coverage, especially in the South Region of Afghanistan.",
          "The Committee acknowledged the strong political commitment to polio eradication demonstrated at the national and provincial levels in Pakistan. The Committee emphasized, however, that this commitment must be translated into concrete operational measures to strengthen community engagement and ensure the implementation of high-quality vaccination campaigns, especially in the core reservoirs and epidemiologically critical areas. These efforts are critical to interrupt ongoing intense WPV1 transmission and to reduce the risk of further national and international spread.",

While there has been an overall decline in cVDPV2 cases over the past two years, the Committee expressed concern over the increase in reported cases from Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Yemen during the past 12 months. The Committee also noted the concerning cVDPV2 epidemiological situation in Algeria (African Region) and Papua New Guinea (Western Pacific Region) and recommended the immediate implementation of high-quality vaccination campaigns to strengthen population immunity. Additionally, the Committee acknowledged the persistent challenges in conducting effective immunization responses in critical areas of the African Region and northern Yemen.",
          "The Committee expressed concern over the epidemiological situation in Papua New Guinea, particularly in areas and populations with very low immunity to type 2 poliovirus and sub-optimal surveillance quality. The situation in Papua New Guinea requires urgent surveillance strengthening measures including addressing silent areas for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance to minimize the risk of undetected cVDPV2 circulation, alongside rapid implementation of high-quality immunization activities to build immunity in populations with historically low type 2 poliovirus protection.",

Timor-Leste is the third country to be certified in the WHO South-East Asia region, joining Maldives and Sri Lanka which were certified in 2015 and 2016 respectively.</p><p>Certification of malaria elimination is granted by WHO when a country has proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the chain of indigenous transmission has been interrupted nationwide for at least the previous three consecutive years.</p><p>“We did it. Malaria has been one of our most relentless enemies – silent, persistent, and deadly. We lost too many lives to a disease that should be preventable. But our health workers never gave up, our communities held strong, and our partners, like WHO, walked beside us. From 223 000 cases to zero – this elimination honours every life lost and every life now saved. We must safeguard this victory with continued vigilance and community action to prevent malaria's re-entry,” said Dr Élia António de Araújo dos Reis Amaral, SH, Minister of Health, Government of Timor-Leste. </p><h2>A rapid shift from high burden country to malaria-free</h2><p>Since gaining independence in 2002, Timor-Leste has made remarkable strides in the fight against malaria – reducing cases from a peak of more than 223 000 clinically diagnosed cases in 2006 to zero indigenous cases from 2021 onwards.</p><p>Timor-Leste’s success in eliminating malaria was driven by the Ministry of Health’s swift action in 2003 to establish the National Malaria Programme, a dedicated programme for planning, implementing, and monitoring malaria control efforts nationwide. With only two full-time officers initially, the programme was able to lay the foundation for progress early on through strong technical leadership, managerial capacity and attention to detail.</p><p>Within a few years, the country introduced rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin-based combination therapy as part of the National Malaria Treatment Guidelines and began distributing free long-lasting insecticide treated nets to communities most at risk.</p><p>In 2009, with support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Timor-Leste scaled up nationwide vector control efforts through the distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying. Malaria diagnosis was also expanded using microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests at the point of care across all local health posts.</p><p>Facing the challenges of severe shortages of health workers and doctors, Timor-Leste made investments and developed its three-tier health system – comprising national hospitals, reference hospitals, community health centers (CHCs), and health posts – to ensure most residents can access care within an hour's walk. Additionally, citizens are provided with free health services at the point of care, as part of the government’s policy on free universal health care. Monthly mobile clinics and community outreach programmes further enhance health services in rural areas.</p><p>Timor-Leste’s success in combating malaria highlights the importance of country leadership and strong collaboration between the Ministry of Health, WHO, local communities, non-governmental organizations, donors, and multiple government sectors. A real-time integrated case-based surveillance system ensures rapid data collection and response, while trained health workers ensure timely detection and screening of malaria cases, including at borders. These integrated efforts have paved the way for the country to be officially certified malaria-free.</p><p>\"Timor-Leste’s malaria-free certification is a defining national triumph – driven by bold leadership, tireless efforts of health workers, and the resolve of its people. As a young nation, Timor-Leste stayed focused – testing, treating, and investigating swiftly. Ending transmission and maintaining zero deaths takes more than science; it takes grit.

Staff and their families, including children, were exposed to grave danger and traumatized after airstrikes caused a fire and significant damage. Israeli military entered the premises, forcing women and children to evacuate on foot toward Al-Mawasi amid active conflict. Male staff and family members were handcuffed, stripped, interrogated on the spot, and screened at gunpoint. Two WHO staff and two family members were detained. Three were later released, while one staff member remains in detention. Thirty-two people, including women and children, were collected and evacuated to the WHO office in a high-risk mission, once access became possible. The office itself is close to the evacuation zone and active conflict.</p><p>WHO demands continuous protection of its staff and the immediate release of the remaining detained staff member.</p><p>The latest evacuation order has affected several WHO premises. As the United Nations’s (UN) lead health agency, WHO’s operational presence in Gaza is now compromised, crippling efforts to sustain a collapsing health system and pushing survival further out of reach for more than two million people. </p><p>Most of WHO’s staff housing is now inaccessible. Last night, due to intensified hostilities, 43 staff and their families were already relocated from several staff residences to the WHO office, under darkness and at significant risk.</p><p>WHO’s main warehouse located in Deir al Balah is within the evacuation zone, and was damaged yesterday after an attack caused explosions and fire inside - part of a pattern of systematic destruction of health facilities. It was later looted by desperate crowds.</p><p>With the main warehouse nonfunctional and the majority of medical supplies in Gaza depleted, WHO is severely constrained in adequately supporting hospitals, emergency medical teams and health partners, already critically short on medicines, fuel, and equipment. WHO urgently calls on Member States to help ensure a sustained and regular flow of medical supplies into Gaza. </p><p>The geographical coordinates of all WHO premises, including offices, warehouses, and staff housing, are shared with the relevant parties. These facilities are the backbone of WHO’s operations in Gaza and must always be protected, regardless of evacuation or displacement orders. Any threat to these premises is a threat to the entire humanitarian health response in Gaza.  </p><p>In line with the UN’s decision, WHO will remain in Deir al Balah, deliver and expand its operations.</p><p>With 88% of Gaza now under evacuation orders or within Israeli-militarized zones, there is no safe place to go.</p><p>WHO is appalled by the dangerous conditions under which humanitarians and health workers are forced to operate. As the security situation and access continue to deteriorate, red lines are repeatedly crossed, and humanitarian operations pushed into an ever-shrinking space to respond. </p><p>WHO calls for the immediate release of the WHO staff member detained today, and the protection of all our staff and premises. We reiterate our call for the active protection of civilians, health care and health-care premises and for rapid and unimpeded flow of aid, including food, fuel and health supplies, at scale into and across Gaza. WHO also calls for the unconditional release of hostages. </p><p>Life in Gaza is being relentlessly squeezed, and the chance to prevent loss of lives and reverse immense damage to the health system slips further out of reach each day. A ceasefire is not just necessary, it is overdue. <span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span></p>",

          "WHO’s main warehouse located in Deir al Balah is within the evacuation zone, and was damaged yesterday after an attack caused explosions and fire inside - part of a pattern of systematic destruction of health facilities. It was later looted by desperate crowds.",
          "With the main warehouse nonfunctional and the majority of medical supplies in Gaza depleted, WHO is severely constrained in adequately supporting hospitals, emergency medical teams and health partners, already critically short on medicines, fuel, and equipment. WHO urgently calls on Member States to help ensure a sustained and regular flow of medical supplies into Gaza.",
          "The geographical coordinates of all WHO premises, including offices, warehouses, and staff housing, are shared with the relevant parties. These facilities are the backbone of WHO’s operations in Gaza and must always be protected, regardless of evacuation or displacement orders. Any threat to these premises is a threat to the entire humanitarian health response in Gaza.",
          "In line with the UN’s decision, WHO will remain in Deir al Balah, deliver and expand its operations.",
          "With 88% of Gaza now under evacuation orders or within Israeli-militarized zones, there is no safe place to go.",
          "WHO is appalled by the dangerous conditions under which humanitarians and health workers are forced to operate. As the security situation and access continue to deteriorate, red lines are repeatedly crossed, and humanitarian operations pushed into an ever-shrinking space to respond.",
          "WHO calls for the immediate release of the WHO staff member detained today, and the protection of all our staff and premises. We reiterate our call for the active protection of civilians, health care and health-care premises and for rapid and unimpeded flow of aid, including food, fuel and health supplies, at scale into and across Gaza. WHO also calls for the unconditional release of hostages.",
          "Life in Gaza is being relentlessly squeezed, and the chance to prevent loss of lives and reverse immense damage to the health system slips further out of reach each day. A ceasefire is not just necessary, it is overdue."

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has validated Senegal as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. Senegal becomes the ninth country in WHO’s African Region to have achieved this feat.</p><p>“I commend Senegal for freeing its population from this disease”, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This milestone is yet another sign of the remarkable progress being made against neglected tropical diseases globally, and offers hope to other countries still working to eliminate trachoma.” </p><p>Trachoma has been known in Senegal since the early 1900s and was confirmed as a major cause of blindness through surveys in the 1980s and 1990s. Senegal joined the WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma in 1998, conducted its first national survey in 2000, and completed full disease mapping by 2017 with support from the Global Trachoma Mapping Project and Tropical Data. Trachoma control was consistently integrated into national eye health programmed, first under the National Program for Blindness Prevention (PNLC) and later through the National Program for the Promotion of Eye Health (PNPSO) – maintaining its commitment to trachoma elimination.</p><p>“Today we celebrate our victory against trachoma, 21 years after the one against dracunculiasis” said Dr Ibrahima Sy, Senegal’s Minister of Health and Social Action. “This new milestone reminds us that our overarching goal remains a Senegal free from neglected tropical diseases. We are fully committed to this, and we are making good progress, notably against human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and onchocerciasis”.</p><p>Senegal implemented the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy to eliminate trachoma with the support of partners, reaching 2.8 million people who needed them across 24 districts. These activities included provision of surgery to treat the late blinding stage of the disease, conducting antibiotic mass drug administration of azithromycin donated by Pfizer through the International Trachoma Initiative, carrying out public awareness campaigns to promote facial cleanliness, and improvement in access to water supply and sanitation. </p><p>Trachoma is the second neglected tropical disease to be eliminated in Senegal. In 2004, the country was certified free of dracunculiasis (Guinea-worm disease) transmission. Globally, Senegal joins 24 other countries that have been validated by WHO for having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. These are Benin, Burundi, Cambodia, China, Gambia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Ghana, India, Iraq, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Togo, Vanuatu and Viet Nam. These countries are part of a wider of group of 57 countries that have eliminated one or more neglected tropical diseases.</p><p>WHO is supporting Senegal’s health authorities to closely monitor communities in which trachoma was previously endemic to ensure there is no resurgence of the disease.</p><p>“Trachoma has cast a shadow over communities in Senegal for more than a century. This long-awaited validation is not only a milestone for public health but a powerful tribute to the tireless dedication of frontline health workers, communities, government leaders, and partners who never gave up,” said Dr Jean-Marie Vianny Yameogo, WHO Representative in Senegal. “Today, we close a chapter that began over a hundred years ago, united with pride, gratitude and resolve. WHO remains committed to supporting Senegal as the country continues to lead in sustaining this hard-earned achievement.”</p><h2>Disease prevalence</h2><p>Trachoma remains a public health problem in 32 countries, with an estimated 103 million people living in areas requiring interventions against the disease. Trachoma is found mainly in the poorest and most rural areas of Africa, Central and South America, Asia, the Western Pacific and the Middle East. WHO’s African Region is disproportionately affected by trachoma, with 93 million people living in at-risk areas in April 2024, representing 90% of the global trachoma burden.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in the fight against trachoma over the past few years and the number of people requiring antibiotic treatment for trachoma in the African Region fell by 96 million from 189 million in 2014 to 93 million as of April 2024, representing a 51% reduction.</p><p>There are currently 20 countries (Algeria, Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central Africa Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) in WHO’s African Region that are known to require intervention for trachoma elimination. A further 3 countries in the Region (Botswana, Guinea-Bissau and Namibia) claim to have achieved the prevalence targets for elimination.<br/> </p><p><strong>Editor’s note</strong></p><p>Trachoma is a neglected tropical disease. It is caused by infection with the bacterium <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, which spreads from person to person through contaminated surfaces , fomites and flies that have come into contact with discharge from the eyes or nose of an infected person.</p><p>Environmental risk factors for trachoma transmission include poor hygiene, overcrowded households, and inadequate access to water and sanitation.</p><p>To eliminate trachoma as a public health problem, WHO recommends the SAFE strategy: a comprehensive approach to reduce transmission of the causative organism, clear existing infections and deal with their effects. The SAFE strategy consists of surgery to treat the blinding complication (trachomatous trichiasis); antibiotics to clear the infection, particularly mass drug administration of the antibiotic azithromycin (which has been donated by the manufacturer, Pfizer, to elimination programmes through the International Trachoma Initiative); facial cleanliness; and environmental improvement, particularly improving access to water and sanitation.</p><p>The road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021–2030 targets the prevention, control, elimination and eradication of 20 diseases and disease groups by 2030.

The guidelines are being issued at the 13th International AIDS Society Conference (IAS 2025) on HIV Science, in Kigali, Rwanda.</p><p>LEN, the first twice-yearly injectable PrEP product, offers a highly effective, long-acting alternative to daily oral pills and other shorter-acting options. With just two doses per year, LEN is a transformative step forward in protecting people at risk of HIV – particularly those who face challenges with daily adherence, stigma, or access to health care.</p><p>“While an HIV vaccine remains elusive, lenacapavir is the next best thing: a long-acting antiretroviral shown in trials to prevent almost all HIV infections among those at risk,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “The launch of WHO’s new guidelines, alongside the FDA’s recent approval, marks a critical step forward in expanding access to this powerful tool. WHO is committed to working with countries and partners to ensure this innovation reaches communities as quickly and safely as possible.”</p><p>The new guidelines come at a critical moment as HIV prevention efforts stagnate with 1.3 million new HIV infections occurring in 2024 – with disproportionate impact among key and priority populations, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, people in prisons, and children and adolescents. WHO’s recommendation on LEN signals a decisive move to expand and diversify HIV prevention, giving people more options to take control over their health with choices that fit their lives.</p><h2>Simplified testing: a major barrier removed</h2><p>As part of these guidelines, WHO has recommended a public health approach to HIV testing using HIV rapid tests to support delivery of long-acting injectable PrEP, including LEN and cabotegravir (CAB-LA).

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has validated Burundi as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem, making it the eighth country in WHO’s African Region to reach this important milestone. Trachoma is also the first neglected tropical disease (NTD) to be eliminated in the country. <br/></p>\n<p>“Eliminating a disease like trachoma is a major public health achievement that requires sustained effort and dedication,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “I congratulate the government and the people of Burundi and commend them for their hard work and commitment. It is great to see Burundi join the growing group of countries that have eliminated at least one NTD”.</p><p>Trachoma is caused by the bacterium <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and spreads through personal contact, contaminated surfaces and by flies that have been in contact with eye or nose discharge. Repeated infections can lead to scarring, in-turning of the eyelids, and ultimately blindness. Globally, the disease remains endemic in many vulnerable communities where access to clean water and sanitation is limited.<br/></p><p>“This validation marks a major milestone in our commitment to health equity”, said Dr Lydwine Baradahana, Minister of Public Health and the Fight Against AIDS, Burundi. “It is a collective victory made possible by nearly 20 years of national mobilization and international solidarity. I thank all the partners, community actors and institutions in Burundi and beyond who made this historic achievement possible”.</p><h2>Burundi’s progress</h2><p>Before 2007, with no reported cases or epidemiological studies, the extent of trachoma endemicity in Burundi was largely unknown. That year, the country launched an initiative to tackle NTDs, which included integrated mapping of soil-transmitted helminthiases, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis and trachoma. Following the mapping, the Ministry of Public Health and the Fight Against AIDS conducted further investigations. Baseline surveys carried out in 2009–2010 confirmed that trachoma was endemic in parts of the country. This prompted introduction of interventions based on the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy for 2.5 million people who needed them across 12 health districts.</p><p>Burundi’s trachoma elimination programme was supported technically and financially by CBM Christoffel Blindenmission, the END Fund, Geneva Global and WHO. The International Trachoma Initiative at the Task Force for Global Health donated azithromycin (Zithromax, Pfizer, New York NY, USA). WHO continues to support support the country’s health authorities to monitor communities in which trachoma was previously endemic to ensure there is no resurgence of the disease.</p><p>This achievement reflects the government’s resolve to protect its most vulnerable populations. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Public Health and the Fight Against AIDS, and with the dedication of community health workers, support from key partners, and WHO’s technical guidance, this success was made possible” said Dr Xavier Crespin, WHO Representative in Burundi. “This win inspires us to press forward with the same determination to eliminate all remaining neglected tropical diseases.”</p><h2>Disease prevalence</h2><p>Trachoma remains a public health problem in 32 countries with an estimated 103 million people living in areas requiring interventions against the disease. Trachoma is found mainly in the poorest and most rural areas of Africa, Central and South America, Asia, the Western Pacific and the Middle East. </p><p>The African Region is disproportionately affected by trachoma with 93 million people living in at-risk areas in April 2024, representing 90% of the global trachoma burden. Significant progress has been made in the fight against trachoma over the past few years and the number of people requiring antibiotic treatment for trachoma in the African Region fell by 96 million from 189 million in 2014 to 93 million as of April 2024, representing a 51% reduction. </p><p>There are currently 20 countries in WHO’s African Region that are known to require intervention for trachoma elimination. These include: Algeria, Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central Africa Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The seven countries in the region previously validated by WHO as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem are Benin, Gambia, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania and Togo. A further 4 countries in the WHO African Region (Botswana, Guinea-Bissau, Namibia and Senegal) claim to have achieved the prevalence targets for elimination.</p><h2>Global progress<strong> </strong></h2><p>With today’s announcement, a total of 57 countries have now eliminated at least one NTD. Of these, 24— (including Burundi)—have successfully eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. Other countries that have reached this milestone include Benin, Cambodia, China, Gambia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Ghana, India, Iraq, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Togo, Vanuatu and Viet Nam.</p><h2>Editor’s note</h2><p>Elimination of trachoma as a public health problem is defined as: (i) a prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis “unknown to the health system” of &lt;0.2% in adults aged ≥15 years (approximately 1 case per 1000 total population), and (ii) a prevalence of trachomatous inflammation—follicular in children aged 1–9 years of &lt;5%, sustained for at least two years in the absence of ongoing antibiotic mass treatment, in each formerly endemic district; plus (iii) the existence of a system able to identify and manage incident trachomatous trichiasis cases, using defined strategies, with evidence of appropriate financial resources to implement those strategies.</p><p>The WHO SAFE strategy consists of surgery to treat the blinding stage (trachomatous trichiasis); Antibiotics to clear the infection, particularly mass drug administration of the antibiotic azithromycin, which is donated by the manufacturer, Pfizer, to elimination programmes, through the International Trachoma Initiative; Facial cleanliness; and Environmental improvement, particularly improving access to water and sanitation.</p><p> </p>",

Over the past 12 months, the majority of mpox cases have continued to be reported from the African continent, largely driven by outbreaks of MPXV clade Ib in East African countries, including the DRC, where clade Ia is co-circulating. Sierra Leone however is experiencing a rapidly evolving outbreak, which based on available genomic sequencing results, appears to be driven by MPXV clade IIb. Outside of the African region, there continues to be a steady report of monthly cases (between about 500 – 1000 monthly), from all regions, mostly reflecting ongoing circulation of MPXV clade IIb among men who have sex with men (MSM).</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In the DRC, while surveillance- and access to healthcare-related challenges persist, particularly in the eastern part of the country, trends in most Provinces where MPXV clade Ib is circulating, including those of North Kivu and South Kivu, are now appearing to stabilize or decline. Similar trends are also observed in areas endemic for MPXV clade Ia. In the capital Kinshasa, where the upsurge is driven by a co-circulation of MPXV clades Ia and Ib, the disease appears to be clustered geographically and in specific demographic groups, with incidence disproportionately higher among young adults, reflecting dynamics of transmission sustained by sexual networks in key areas of the city.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In Burundi, a steady decline in incidence of mpox cases has been observed since late 2024. Initially concentrated in and around Bujumbura and later spreading to the administrative capital Gitega, with at its peak cases reported in most districts, the upsurge appears to now be concentrated only in a few hotspots.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In Uganda, although national trends indicate a decrease in mpox cases since mid-February 2025, including a clear downward trend in the capital Kampala, limitations in testing capacity warrant cautious interpretation. Clusters are concentrated in urban settings, with transmission primarily among young adults, consistent with sexual contact transmission dynamics.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In Kenya, although the number of mpox cases remains low, recent data suggest an upward trend. Surveillance is likely underestimating the actual incidence of mpox cases. Transmission has been associated with mobile populations, including truck drivers and sex workers.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Sierra Leone has recently faced a significant upsurge of MPXV clade IIb, with a peak reproduction number in the capital Freetown, exceeding that observed in the past in Kinshasa, DRC, or Kampala, Uganda. Over the past three weeks, the number of observed mpox cases has been declining, possibly due to a combination of, increased natural immunity in high-risk groups and public health interventions. Transmission remains concentrated in urban areas and among young adults, likely to be associated with sexual contact.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Travel-associated cases are declining but remain a concern. Notably, recent diagnoses of MPXV clade Ib infection in Australia – linked to exposure in Thailand – highlight the risk of undetected transmission in countries or areas with underperforming surveillance. The majority of secondary transmission resulting from imported mpox cases occurs through close, intimate, or sexual contact.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">MPXV clade Ia continues to show higher mortality, especially in children the DRC with a case fatality rate of 2-3%, although data should be interpreted considering, inter alia, the limitation of syndromic surveillance. Across all clades, individuals with underlying immunosuppression, particularly those with HIV infection, remain at greatest risk of severe outcomes and death. The overall case fatality rate for </span>MPXV<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> clade Ib and clade IIb remains around 0.5%.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The WHO Secretariat presented the assessed risk by MPXV clades and further expressed in terms of overall public health risk where any given clade/s is/are circulating, as: Clade Ib – high public health risk in the DRC and neighbouring countries; Clade Ia – moderate public health risk in the DRC; Clade II – moderate public health risk in Nigeria and countries of West and Central Africa where mpox is endemic; and clade IIb – moderate public health risk globally. It was noted that the above risk assessment corresponds to the one presented during the third meeting of the Committee on 25 February 2025.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The WHO Secretariat subsequently underscored progress in mpox control efforts, attributing gains to partnerships among national governments, communities, and WHO. However, these are now at risk due to a worsening funding shortfall, not only for the response but for global health programs that support mpox prevention and control activities.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">An updated WHO Mpox Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP, available </span> <a href=\"/health-topics/mpox\" style=\"text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;white-space:inherit;\">here</a><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">), covering the period May-August 2025 and integrating lessons from operational reviews conducted in early 2025, was issued in April 2025. While the strategy remains fit for purpose, the funding environment has deteriorated. Despite a $145 million funding requirement to support all partners involved in mpox response efforts, including $47 million for WHO, the Organization has received no new financial commitments since the issuance of the new SPRP, and resource constraints now threaten the sustainability of operations – personnel levels have dropped, and essential supplies, including vaccines, cannot be deployed efficiently.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">WHO has issued updated clinical care and infection prevention and control (IPC) guidance, emphasizing the importance of integrating mpox-related interventions into broader health programs and health services delivery. However, the effective implementation of the guidance remains limited by logistical and financial barriers, and its application at local level requires intensified support. Community-centered care strategies, such as home-based care with IPC integration and linkage to primary care, have been endorsed to alleviate pressure on health facilities.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Seven countries have initiated mpox vaccination (Central African Republic, DRC, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda), with four additional countries (Angola, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, and South Africa) poised to begin. Vaccine supply exists with 2.9 million vaccine doses in countries, but resource limitations hamper distribution and administration, with only approximately 724,000 doses administered to date. Strengthened coordination is essential to ensure equitable and timely delivery to high-risk populations.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">While recent progress in controlling and responding to the spread of mpox are encouraging, sustainability hinges on urgent and sustained resource mobilization, greater integration within health systems, and continued prioritization of community engagement. Without this, current gains risk being reversed.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Representatives of Burundi and the DRC updated the Committee on the mpox epidemiological situation in their countries and their current control and response efforts, needs and challenges, and plans in the medium term.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In Burundi, since the mpox upsurge started in July 2024, cumulatively, approximately 4,000 confirmed cases of mpox, including one death, were observed. The number of cases has been subsiding and, as of 25 May 2025, mpox cases are occurring in 9 districts, including two hotspots. The response in Burundi is focusing on rapid response to alerts and contract tracing. Among the challenges in responding to mpox are insufficient resources to provide food for cases, lack of clean water in some of the hotspots, and the absence of a functional multisectoral One Health platform.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In the DRC, the number of mpox </span>cases is<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> plateauing, with a significant decrease in positivity </span>rate<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">, further corroborating the declining trends. Outside areas considered to be endemic, adults account for the majority of cases, with sexual contact being the most frequent mode of transmission. Overall, as a result of contact tracing activities, 83,000 contacts were identified, with a median of 5 contacts per case. More than two million mpox vaccine doses were received, with approximately 600,000 people vaccinated to date. Efforts are ongoing to make triage more </span>efficient<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> and effective, and improve diagnostics for mpox, including transport of samples from the affected communities. National authorities have developed a plan to intensify the response to the mpox outbreak, focusing on surveillance, contact tracing, risk communication, and vaccination. However, the funding gap is again impacting response activities, particularly in remote areas.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Members of, and Advisors to, the Committee then engaged in </span><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">questions and answers</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> with the presenters from States Parties and the WHO Secretariat, revolving around the issues and challenges enumerated below.</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Global epidemiology, clade distribution, and risk assessment</em><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> – The global epidemiological risk has remained largely unchanged since the Committee last met on 25 February 2025. However, 17 countries in Africa are currently reporting mpox outbreaks (i.e. one case or more in the last six weeks). MPXV clade Ib continues to spread in high-risk groups and has been newly detected in countries including Ethiopia, Malawi, South Sudan, and Zambia. Sierra Leone is experiencing a distinct outbreak, likely due to MPXV clade IIb according to initial evidence. This outbreak poses a specific local and regional risk and is a reminder of the ongoing risk of mpox outbreaks in specific contexts. The Committee asked about progress made towards the elimination of mpox in the WHO European Region. In that respect, the WHO Secretariat indicated that MPXV clade IIb continues to circulate at low levels, predominantly among MSM. Despite the reduced number of cases, elimination has not been achieved, with persistent transmission linked to gaps in immunity, behavioral risk factors, and communication barriers. Given the patterns of international travel, the risk of reintroduction in the WHO European Region persists.</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Surveillance, laboratory testing, and confidence in data </em><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">– On the specific question of confidence in trends in the DRC, while there remain many specific challenges to surveillance, stable or decreasing trends observed in syndromic surveillance, epidemiological case-based surveillance and laboratory-based surveillance, coupled with decreases in test positivity, bring some confidence in the robustness of the assessment. Caution is warranted particularly when interpreting current trends in some areas of the Eastern Provinces of the DRC where access remains constrained, although, overall, Eastern DRC had been seeing a sustained decline in reported cases before the more recent security constraints. Concerns were expressed about the possibility of undetected transmission of MPXV in West Africa, including in Ghana and Togo in relation to MPXV clade Ib, as well as in Sierra Leone, in relation to MPXV clade IIb, despite of the declining trajectory of the number of cases after it peaked in early 2025. Concerns were also expressed regarding the need for enhanced genomic sequencing capacity. Burundi was commended for its strong surveillance performance, including its high testing rate and contact follow-up capacity. National laboratory diagnostic approaches generally report adhering to WHO protocols. However, in Sierra Leone, due to the burden of response activities, only 2% of samples positive for MPXV infection (prior to early May 2025) underwent genomic sequencing.he WHO Secretariat continues to support countries experiencing upsurges of mpox cases by providing technical assistance, including facilitating shipment of specimens to national or international laboratories.</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Patterns of transmission</em><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> – The Committee highlighted that, unlike in most other areas experiencing the MPXV clade Ib outbreaks, an increased number of paediatric mpox cases is observed in the Provinces of North and South Kivu, DRC. While detailed epidemiological data are limited, this age pattern could potentially be explained, inter alia, by the build-up of immunity among adults following sexual exposure, leading to infections due to non-sexual exposure withing households. There have been anecdotical reports of exposure in paediatric healthcare facilities. It was noted that outbreaks of mpox have not otherwise been reported in educational or other settings where children are congregating.</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Contact tracing</em><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> – Approaches to contact tracing differ across countries. In some settings the absence of systematic tracing and access to diagnostics reduces the effectiveness of overall control actions. The need to optimize public health resource allocation was underscored. This would entail reassessing the feasibility of traditional contact tracing in certain settings, as well as the use of mpox vaccine among identified contacts to reduce secondary transmission.</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Vaccination </em><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">– As of June 2025, approximately 2.9 million mpox vaccine doses have been distributed across the African continent, the majority to the DRC, which has received about 2.5 million doses. Of these, approximately 600,000 doses have been administered. The remaining 1.9 million doses comprise 1.5 million LC16m8 vaccine doses donated by Japan (not yet deployed as training of health workers is underway) and 367,000 MVA-BN doses. A further 349,000 doses secured by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) remain undeployed due to funding shortages. An additional 219,000 MVA-BN doses have been pledged by the Government of the United States of America, pending approval for deployment. Strategies for the use of mpox vaccine have evolved in response to supply constraints and emerging epidemiological trends. In the DRC, since February 2025, approximately105,000 doses have been administered to children under 12 and approximately 56,000 doses to adolescents aged 12 to 18. Additional groups targeted by vaccination efforts in the DRC include healthcare workers, individuals at risk of severe disease – such as people living with HIV – and, in more recent phases, key populations in transmission hotspots, including sex workers, and MSM. In Sierra Leone, the vaccination strategy was initially focused on healthcare and frontline workers and people living with HIV. The focus of vaccination efforts then shifted to hotspots and contacts, sex workers, and MSM within those hotspots. Initially, most countries began with a two-dose regimen; however, the majority have now transitioned to a single-dose approach or are preparing to shift toward intradermal fractional dosing. These dose-sparing strategies were endorsed in the WHO position paper, if vaccine resources were limited, published on 23 August 2024, available </span><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/378522/WER9934-eng-fre.pdf?sequence=1\" style=\"text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;white-space:inherit;\">here</a><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">.</span><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/serraor/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/Y9GW1230/Report_Fourth%20EC%20mpox%20upsurge.docx#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" style=\"text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;white-space:inherit;\" title=\"\">[1]</a><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> It was noted that intradermal fractional dosing, where each vial can yield four to five doses, is applicable only to the MVA-BN vaccine and has already been employed in some settings. Overall, the uptake of available vaccines has remained lower than anticipated due to logistical, operational, and financial barriers. Further efforts are needed to optimize the strategic use of available mpox vaccine and maximize its public health impact.</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Mpox and HIV infections and integration of health services</em><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> – Coinfection with HIV presents significant challenges for health services in the management of mpox, especially in countries with high HIV prevalence. In Kinshasa, DRC, 9.3% of mpox cases are reported to be HIV-positive, though this figure likely underrepresents the true burden due to limited HIV testing and integration of health services. In Uganda, 55% of deaths associated with MPXV infection have occurred among people living with HIV. The importance of co-located testing services and data systems was underscored to capture the dual burden of HIV and mpox more effectively. Reference to WHO technical guidance was made in relation to the use of rapid tests for HIV diagnosis, immediate linkage to care for those who test positive, and protocols for clinical management of coinfected individuals. The needs for improving triage systems and refining clinical diagnostic criteria for mpox were highlighted, with emphasis on the misclassification of dermatological conditions, such as chickenpox. Overall, the integration of health care delivery remains uneven across countries.</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Funding </em><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">– Funding gaps remain one of the most critical threats to the mpox response. It was noted that, since the launch of the updated SPRP in April 2025, WHO has not received any additional earmarked contributions, resulting in the scaling back of operations, including surveillance, laboratory support, community outreach, and vaccine-related logistics. Serious concerns were expressed regarding the sustainability of key control interventions, including HIV-related, the interruption of which could lead to the intensification of transmission and, hence, limit the ability of public health systems to adapt and respond to changing transmission patterns. However, it was emphasized that lessons should be learned from the experience of Burundi that, despite operating with limited resources, has made substantial progress in controlling the upsurge of mpox, thanks largely to non-pharmaceutical interventions – a combination of sensitive surveillance, effective contact tracing, strong laboratory testing capacity, and decentralized district-level interventions leveraging on community engagement.</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Anticipated scenarios for controlling and responding to mpox </em><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">– The Committee expressed concerns about the current epidemiological trajectory suggesting that mpox may be moving toward endemicity in some countries, or areas thereof, in the African continent. Although some countries are seeing sustained declining trends, MPXV transmission persists. This is consistent with preliminary modelling work suggesting that the actual case counts may be higher than reported due to diagnostic and surveillance gaps. Such scenario raises concern in terms of future interspersed surges of cases in countries in the African continent, as well as exportation of cases within and beyond the continent. Therefore, the observed epidemiological evolution of mpox since the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) was determined in August 2024, requires the development of adequate definitions to describe the pattern of mpox transmission experienced by countries, or areas thereof, and, consequently, assist in setting the goals for control, and guide control and response interventions accordingly. </span></p><h2>Deliberative session</h2><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Following the session open to invited States Parties, the Committee reconvened in a closed session to examine the questions in relation to whether the event constitutes a PHEIC or not, and if so, to consider the temporary recommendations drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Chair reminded the Committee Members of their mandate and recalled that a PHEIC is defined in the IHR as an </span><em style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">“extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated international response”</em><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">.</span></p><p><strong>The Committee was unanimous in expressing the views that the ongoing upsurge of mpox still meets the criteria of a PHEIC and that the Director-General be advised accordingly.</strong></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The overarching considerations underpinning the advice of the Committee are determined by (a) challenges in accurately describing the multi-faceted epidemiological patterns and profiles associated with multiple circulating MPXV clades, observed and markedly differing from historical experience with the disease; (b) uncertainties related to funding availability in the immediate and medium term, both, domestically and internationally; and (c) the subsequent challenges in defining public health strategic approaches for controlling and responding to the spread of mpox.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">On that basis, the Committee considered that:</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The event is </span><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">“extraordinary”</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> because of (i) the emergence and spread of MPXV clade 1b has introduced new uncertainties regarding virus evolution, and the current and foreseeable dynamics of mpox spread; (ii) the establishment of sustained community transmission of MPXV clade I in additional countries in the African continent, without a full appreciation of the factors driving the rapid evolution of the surge of mpox cases; (iii) the disproportionate burden of mpox cases among children, especially in the Eastern Provinces of the DRC, with not yet fully explained dynamics of transmission; and (iv) the persistent challenges integrating health service delivery to mpox patients, due to the likelihood of comorbidities and heightened vulnerability.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The event </span><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">“constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease”</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> because of (i) sub-optimal surveillance systems in many countries and regions, likely leading to undetected transmission and subsequent spread of MPXV clade I into additional countries in the African continent. Such consideration applies to both countries in West Africa, where MPXV clade I had not previously been identified, but are experiencing significant population movement with central and east African countries where that virus is spreading, as well as to countries outside the African continent (e.g. exported case of MPXV clade Ib infection from Thailand to Australia); and (ii) the continuous exportation of MPXV clade I mpox cases from Africa to other continents, some of which resulting in secondary transmission.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The event </span><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">“requires a coordinated international response”</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> because (i) there is a need for concerted efforts by the international community to supplement domestic funding for mpox control and response activities, as well as those of United Agencies, other international institutions and partnerships operational in the field and/or involved in vaccine procurement and related logistics; (ii) access to vaccine, even when available, remains challenging in terms of delivery capacity at the local level; (iii) in the context of limited funding, there is a need to facilitate the exchange of experience between countries, in particular those of countries like Burundi, that despite operating with limited resources, has made substantial progress in controlling the upsurge of mpox through the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions; and (iv) there is a need to monitor the spread and phylogenetic evolution of MPXV clades through genetic sequencing, not always available or optimally performing, in countries experiencing upsurges of mpox.</span></p><p><strong>The Committee subsequently considered the draft of the temporary recommendations proposed by<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> </span>the WHO Secretariat</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"><strong>.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Anticipating the possibility that the WHO Director-General may determine that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, the Committee had received a proposed set of revised temporary recommendations ahead of the meeting. This reflected the proposal to extend most of the temporary recommendations issued on 27 February 2025. While acknowledging that the standing recommendations for mpox are approaching their expiration (20 August 2025) and could potentially benefit from extension or revision, the Committee reiterated the relevance of the proposed temporary recommendations. However, the Committee emphasized the needs (i) to prioritize temporary recommendations related to non-pharmaceutical interventions, taking into account implementation challenges and successful experiences on the ground; and (ii) to anchor vaccine deployment in evidence-based approaches.</span></p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Considering the complexity of the epidemiological evolution of the spread of mpox, of the distribution of the MPXV clades, the challenges in implementing efficient and effective control and response interventions, as well as issues raised by the Committee in occasion of their previous meetings, the Committee welcomed the proposal by the WHO Secretariat to hold an informal technical meeting aimed at assisting countries to prioritise response measures adapted to the varied epidemiological contexts, ahead of its next formal meeting should the WHO Director-General determine that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee agreed to provide its feedback to the WHO Secretariat on the proposed set of temporary recommendations the day after the meeting (i.e. 6 June 2025), and to finalize the report of the meeting during the week of 9 June 2025.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Acting Director of the Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Threat Management at WHO headquarters, on behalf of the WHO Deputy Director-General, expressed her gratitude to the Committee’s Officers, its Members and Advisors and closed the meeting.</span></p><h3><hr/>References: </h3><div><div id=\"ftn1\"><p><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/serraor/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/Y9GW1230/Report_Fourth%20EC%20mpox%20upsurge.docx#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> On 6 June 2025, after the fourth meeting of the Committee, WHO published the Meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), 10-13 March 2025, including a section on mpox vaccine.

        "content": [
          "The WHO Secretariat presented an overview of the global epidemiological situation of mpox, including all circulating clades of monkeypox virus (MPXV). Over the past 12 months, the majority of mpox cases have continued to be reported from the African continent, largely driven by outbreaks of MPXV clade Ib in East African countries, including the DRC, where clade Ia is co-circulating. Sierra Leone however is experiencing a rapidly evolving outbreak, which based on available genomic sequencing results, appears to be driven by MPXV clade IIb. Outside of the African region, there continues to be a steady report of monthly cases (between about 500 – 1000 monthly), from all regions, mostly reflecting ongoing circulation of MPXV clade IIb among men who have sex with men (MSM).",
          "In the DRC, while surveillance- and access to healthcare-related challenges persist, particularly in the eastern part of the country, trends in most Provinces where MPXV clade Ib is circulating, including those of North Kivu and South Kivu, are now appearing to stabilize or decline. Similar trends are also observed in areas endemic for MPXV clade Ia. In the capital Kinshasa, where the upsurge is driven by a co-circulation of MPXV clades Ia and Ib, the disease appears to be clustered geographically and in specific demographic groups, with incidence disproportionately higher among young adults, reflecting dynamics of transmission sustained by sexual networks in key areas of the city.",
          "In Burundi, a steady decline in incidence of mpox cases has been observed since late 2024. Initially concentrated in and around Bujumbura and later spreading to the administrative capital Gitega, with at its peak cases reported in most districts, the upsurge appears to now be concentrated only in a few hotspots.",
          "In Uganda, although national trends indicate a decrease in mpox cases since mid-February 2025, including a clear downward trend in the capital Kampala, limitations in testing capacity warrant cautious interpretation. Clusters are concentrated in urban settings, with transmission primarily among young adults, consistent with sexual contact transmission dynamics.",
          "In Kenya, although the number of mpox cases remains low, recent data suggest an upward trend. Surveillance is likely underestimating the actual incidence of mpox cases. Transmission has been associated with mobile populations, including truck drivers and sex workers.",
          "Sierra Leone has recently faced a significant upsurge of MPXV clade IIb, with a peak reproduction number in the capital Freetown, exceeding that observed in the past in Kinshasa, DRC, or Kampala, Uganda. Over the past three weeks, the number of observed mpox cases has been declining, possibly due to a combination of, increased natural immunity in high-risk groups and public health interventions. Transmission remains concentrated in urban areas and among young adults, likely to be associated with sexual contact.",
          "Travel-associated cases are declining but remain a concern. Notably, recent diagnoses of MPXV clade Ib infection in Australia – linked to exposure in Thailand – highlight the risk of undetected transmission in countries or areas with underperforming surveillance. The majority of secondary transmission resulting from imported mpox cases occurs through close, intimate, or sexual contact.",
          "MPXV clade Ia continues to show higher mortality, especially in children the DRC with a case fatality rate of 2-3%, although data should be interpreted considering, inter alia, the limitation of syndromic surveillance. Across all clades, individuals with underlying immunosuppression, particularly those with HIV infection, remain at greatest risk of severe outcomes and death. The overall case fatality rate for MPXV clade Ib and clade IIb remains around 0.5%.",
          "The WHO Secretariat presented the assessed risk by MPXV clades and further expressed in terms of overall public health risk where any given clade/s is/are circulating, as: Clade Ib – high public health risk in the DRC and neighbouring countries; Clade Ia – moderate public health risk in the DRC; Clade II – moderate public health risk in Nigeria and countries of West and Central Africa where mpox is endemic; and clade IIb – moderate public health risk globally. It was noted that the above risk assessment corresponds to the one presented during the third meeting of the Committee on 25 February 2025.",
          "The WHO Secretariat subsequently underscored progress in mpox control efforts, attributing gains to partnerships among national governments, communities, and WHO. However, these are now at risk due to a worsening funding shortfall, not only for the response but for global health programs that support mpox prevention and control activities.",
          "An updated WHO Mpox Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP, available here ), covering the period May-August 2025 and integrating lessons from operational reviews conducted in early 2025, was issued in April 2025. While the strategy remains fit for purpose, the funding environment has deteriorated. Despite a $145 million funding requirement to support all partners involved in mpox response efforts, including $47 million for WHO, the Organization has received no new financial commitments since the issuance of the new SPRP, and resource constraints now threaten the sustainability of operations – personnel levels have dropped, and essential supplies, including vaccines, cannot be deployed efficiently.",
          "WHO has issued updated clinical care and infection prevention and control (IPC) guidance, emphasizing the importance of integrating mpox-related interventions into broader health programs and health services delivery. However, the effective implementation of the guidance remains limited by logistical and financial barriers, and its application at local level requires intensified support. Community-centered care strategies, such as home-based care with IPC integration and linkage to primary care, have been endorsed to alleviate pressure on health facilities.",
          "Seven countries have initiated mpox vaccination (Central African Republic, DRC, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda), with four additional countries (Angola, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, and South Africa) poised to begin. Vaccine supply exists with 2.9 million vaccine doses in countries, but resource limitations hamper distribution and administration, with only approximately 724,000 doses administered to date. Strengthened coordination is essential to ensure equitable and timely delivery to high-risk populations.",
          "While recent progress in controlling and responding to the spread of mpox are encouraging, sustainability hinges on urgent and sustained resource mobilization, greater integration within health systems, and continued prioritization of community engagement. Without this, current gains risk being reversed.",
          "Representatives of Burundi and the DRC updated the Committee on the mpox epidemiological situation in their countries and their current control and response efforts, needs and challenges, and plans in the medium term.",
          "In Burundi, since the mpox upsurge started in July 2024, cumulatively, approximately 4,000 confirmed cases of mpox, including one death, were observed. The number of cases has been subsiding and, as of 25 May 2025, mpox cases are occurring in 9 districts, including two hotspots. The response in Burundi is focusing on rapid response to alerts and contract tracing. Among the challenges in responding to mpox are insufficient resources to provide food for cases, lack of clean water in some of the hotspots, and the absence of a functional multisectoral One Health platform.",
          "In the DRC, the number of mpox cases is plateauing, with a significant decrease in positivity rate , further corroborating the declining trends. Outside areas considered to be endemic, adults account for the majority of cases, with sexual contact being the most frequent mode of transmission. Overall, as a result of contact tracing activities, 83,000 contacts were identified, with a median of 5 contacts per case. More than two million mpox vaccine doses were received, with approximately 600,000 people vaccinated to date. Efforts are ongoing to make triage more efficient and effective, and improve diagnostics for mpox, including transport of samples from the affected communities. National authorities have developed a plan to intensify the response to the mpox outbreak, focusing on surveillance, contact tracing, risk communication, and vaccination. However, the funding gap is again impacting response activities, particularly in remote areas.",
          "Members of, and Advisors to, the Committee then engaged in questions and answers with the presenters from States Parties and the WHO Secretariat, revolving around the issues and challenges enumerated below.",
          "Global epidemiology, clade distribution, and risk assessment – The global epidemiological risk has remained largely unchanged since the Committee last met on 25 February 2025. However, 17 countries in Africa are currently reporting mpox outbreaks (i.e. one case or more in the last six weeks). MPXV clade Ib continues to spread in high-risk groups and has been newly detected in countries including Ethiopia, Malawi, South Sudan, and Zambia. Sierra Leone is experiencing a distinct outbreak, likely due to MPXV clade IIb according to initial evidence. This outbreak poses a specific local and regional risk and is a reminder of the ongoing risk of mpox outbreaks in specific contexts. The Committee asked about progress made towards the elimination of mpox in the WHO European Region. In that respect, the WHO Secretariat indicated that MPXV clade IIb continues to circulate at low levels, predominantly among MSM. Despite the reduced number of cases, elimination has not been achieved, with persistent transmission linked to gaps in immunity, behavioral risk factors, and communication barriers. Given the patterns of international travel, the risk of reintroduction in the WHO European Region persists.",
          "Surveillance, laboratory testing, and confidence in data – On the specific question of confidence in trends in the DRC, while there remain many specific challenges to surveillance, stable or decreasing trends observed in syndromic surveillance, epidemiological case-based surveillance and laboratory-based surveillance, coupled with decreases in test positivity, bring some confidence in the robustness of the assessment. Caution is warranted particularly when interpreting current trends in some areas of the Eastern Provinces of the DRC where access remains constrained, although, overall, Eastern DRC had been seeing a sustained decline in reported cases before the more recent security constraints. Concerns were expressed about the possibility of undetected transmission of MPXV in West Africa, including in Ghana and Togo in relation to MPXV clade Ib, as well as in Sierra Leone, in relation to MPXV clade IIb, despite of the declining trajectory of the number of cases after it peaked in early 2025. Concerns were also expressed regarding the need for enhanced genomic sequencing capacity. Burundi was commended for its strong surveillance performance, including its high testing rate and contact follow-up capacity. National laboratory diagnostic approaches generally report adhering to WHO protocols. However, in Sierra Leone, due to the burden of response activities, only 2% of samples positive for MPXV infection (prior to early May 2025) underwent genomic sequencing.he WHO Secretariat continues to support countries experiencing upsurges of mpox cases by providing technical assistance, including facilitating shipment of specimens to national or international laboratories.",
          "Patterns of transmission – The Committee highlighted that, unlike in most other areas experiencing the MPXV clade Ib outbreaks, an increased number of paediatric mpox cases is observed in the Provinces of North and South Kivu, DRC. While detailed epidemiological data are limited, this age pattern could potentially be explained, inter alia, by the build-up of immunity among adults following sexual exposure, leading to infections due to non-sexual exposure withing households. There have been anecdotical reports of exposure in paediatric healthcare facilities. It was noted that outbreaks of mpox have not otherwise been reported in educational or other settings where children are congregating.",
          "Contact tracing – Approaches to contact tracing differ across countries. In some settings the absence of systematic tracing and access to diagnostics reduces the effectiveness of overall control actions. The need to optimize public health resource allocation was underscored. This would entail reassessing the feasibility of traditional contact tracing in certain settings, as well as the use of mpox vaccine among identified contacts to reduce secondary transmission.",
          "Vaccination – As of June 2025, approximately 2.9 million mpox vaccine doses have been distributed across the African continent, the majority to the DRC, which has received about 2.5 million doses. Of these, approximately 600,000 doses have been administered. The remaining 1.9 million doses comprise 1.5 million LC16m8 vaccine doses donated by Japan (not yet deployed as training of health workers is underway) and 367,000 MVA-BN doses. A further 349,000 doses secured by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) remain undeployed due to funding shortages. An additional 219,000 MVA-BN doses have been pledged by the Government of the United States of America, pending approval for deployment. Strategies for the use of mpox vaccine have evolved in response to supply constraints and emerging epidemiological trends. In the DRC, since February 2025, approximately105,000 doses have been administered to children under 12 and approximately 56,000 doses to adolescents aged 12 to 18. Additional groups targeted by vaccination efforts in the DRC include healthcare workers, individuals at risk of severe disease – such as people living with HIV – and, in more recent phases, key populations in transmission hotspots, including sex workers, and MSM. In Sierra Leone, the vaccination strategy was initially focused on healthcare and frontline workers and people living with HIV. The focus of vaccination efforts then shifted to hotspots and contacts, sex workers, and MSM within those hotspots. Initially, most countries began with a two-dose regimen; however, the majority have now transitioned to a single-dose approach or are preparing to shift toward intradermal fractional dosing. These dose-sparing strategies were endorsed in the WHO position paper, if vaccine resources were limited, published on 23 August 2024, available here . [1] It was noted that intradermal fractional dosing, where each vial can yield four to five doses, is applicable only to the MVA-BN vaccine and has already been employed in some settings. Overall, the uptake of available vaccines has remained lower than anticipated due to logistical, operational, and financial barriers. Further efforts are needed to optimize the strategic use of available mpox vaccine and maximize its public health impact.",
          "Mpox and HIV infections and integration of health services – Coinfection with HIV presents significant challenges for health services in the management of mpox, especially in countries with high HIV prevalence. In Kinshasa, DRC, 9.3% of mpox cases are reported to be HIV-positive, though this figure likely underrepresents the true burden due to limited HIV testing and integration of health services. In Uganda, 55% of deaths associated with MPXV infection have occurred among people living with HIV. The importance of co-located testing services and data systems was underscored to capture the dual burden of HIV and mpox more effectively. Reference to WHO technical guidance was made in relation to the use of rapid tests for HIV diagnosis, immediate linkage to care for those who test positive, and protocols for clinical management of coinfected individuals. The needs for improving triage systems and refining clinical diagnostic criteria for mpox were highlighted, with emphasis on the misclassification of dermatological conditions, such as chickenpox. Overall, the integration of health care delivery remains uneven across countries.",
          "Funding – Funding gaps remain one of the most critical threats to the mpox response. It was noted that, since the launch of the updated SPRP in April 2025, WHO has not received any additional earmarked contributions, resulting in the scaling back of operations, including surveillance, laboratory support, community outreach, and vaccine-related logistics. Serious concerns were expressed regarding the sustainability of key control interventions, including HIV-related, the interruption of which could lead to the intensification of transmission and, hence, limit the ability of public health systems to adapt and respond to changing transmission patterns. However, it was emphasized that lessons should be learned from the experience of Burundi that, despite operating with limited resources, has made substantial progress in controlling the upsurge of mpox, thanks largely to non-pharmaceutical interventions – a combination of sensitive surveillance, effective contact tracing, strong laboratory testing capacity, and decentralized district-level interventions leveraging on community engagement.",
          "Anticipated scenarios for controlling and responding to mpox – The Committee expressed concerns about the current epidemiological trajectory suggesting that mpox may be moving toward endemicity in some countries, or areas thereof, in the African continent. Although some countries are seeing sustained declining trends, MPXV transmission persists. This is consistent with preliminary modelling work suggesting that the actual case counts may be higher than reported due to diagnostic and surveillance gaps. Such scenario raises concern in terms of future interspersed surges of cases in countries in the African continent, as well as exportation of cases within and beyond the continent. Therefore, the observed epidemiological evolution of mpox since the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) was determined in August 2024, requires the development of adequate definitions to describe the pattern of mpox transmission experienced by countries, or areas thereof, and, consequently, assist in setting the goals for control, and guide control and response interventions accordingly."

          "Following the session open to invited States Parties, the Committee reconvened in a closed session to examine the questions in relation to whether the event constitutes a PHEIC or not, and if so, to consider the temporary recommendations drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.",
          "The Chair reminded the Committee Members of their mandate and recalled that a PHEIC is defined in the IHR as an “extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated international response” .",
          "The Committee was unanimous in expressing the views that the ongoing upsurge of mpox still meets the criteria of a PHEIC and that the Director-General be advised accordingly.",
          "The overarching considerations underpinning the advice of the Committee are determined by (a) challenges in accurately describing the multi-faceted epidemiological patterns and profiles associated with multiple circulating MPXV clades, observed and markedly differing from historical experience with the disease; (b) uncertainties related to funding availability in the immediate and medium term, both, domestically and internationally; and (c) the subsequent challenges in defining public health strategic approaches for controlling and responding to the spread of mpox.",
          "On that basis, the Committee considered that:",
          "The event is “extraordinary” because of (i) the emergence and spread of MPXV clade 1b has introduced new uncertainties regarding virus evolution, and the current and foreseeable dynamics of mpox spread; (ii) the establishment of sustained community transmission of MPXV clade I in additional countries in the African continent, without a full appreciation of the factors driving the rapid evolution of the surge of mpox cases; (iii) the disproportionate burden of mpox cases among children, especially in the Eastern Provinces of the DRC, with not yet fully explained dynamics of transmission; and (iv) the persistent challenges integrating health service delivery to mpox patients, due to the likelihood of comorbidities and heightened vulnerability.",
          "The event “constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” because of (i) sub-optimal surveillance systems in many countries and regions, likely leading to undetected transmission and subsequent spread of MPXV clade I into additional countries in the African continent. Such consideration applies to both countries in West Africa, where MPXV clade I had not previously been identified, but are experiencing significant population movement with central and east African countries where that virus is spreading, as well as to countries outside the African continent (e.g. exported case of MPXV clade Ib infection from Thailand to Australia); and (ii) the continuous exportation of MPXV clade I mpox cases from Africa to other continents, some of which resulting in secondary transmission.",
          "The event “requires a coordinated international response” because (i) there is a need for concerted efforts by the international community to supplement domestic funding for mpox control and response activities, as well as those of United Agencies, other international institutions and partnerships operational in the field and/or involved in vaccine procurement and related logistics; (ii) access to vaccine, even when available, remains challenging in terms of delivery capacity at the local level; (iii) in the context of limited funding, there is a need to facilitate the exchange of experience between countries, in particular those of countries like Burundi, that despite operating with limited resources, has made substantial progress in controlling the upsurge of mpox through the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions; and (iv) there is a need to monitor the spread and phylogenetic evolution of MPXV clades through genetic sequencing, not always available or optimally performing, in countries experiencing upsurges of mpox.",
          "The Committee subsequently considered the draft of the temporary recommendations proposed by the WHO Secretariat .",
          "Anticipating the possibility that the WHO Director-General may determine that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, the Committee had received a proposed set of revised temporary recommendations ahead of the meeting. This reflected the proposal to extend most of the temporary recommendations issued on 27 February 2025. While acknowledging that the standing recommendations for mpox are approaching their expiration (20 August 2025) and could potentially benefit from extension or revision, the Committee reiterated the relevance of the proposed temporary recommendations. However, the Committee emphasized the needs (i) to prioritize temporary recommendations related to non-pharmaceutical interventions, taking into account implementation challenges and successful experiences on the ground; and (ii) to anchor vaccine deployment in evidence-based approaches."

          "On 25 June, the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded its participation in a 36-hour nuclear emergency exercise organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).",
          "The exercise was part of the IAEA’s Level 3 Convention Exercise (ConvEx-3), the highest and most complex level of its emergency exercises. These large-scale exercises are conducted every three to five years to test emergency preparedness and response capacities and identify areas in need of improvement. The last ConvEx-3 exercise took place in 2021 in cooperation with the United Arab Emirates.",
          "The exercise involved more than 75 countries and 10 international organizations and was based on a simulated accident at a nuclear power plant in Romania, resulting in the release of significant amounts of radioactive material. Participating countries and organizations exchanged information in real time, assessed evolving risks, coordinated communications, and decided on appropriate protective actions, including the medical response.",
          "As part of the simulation, WHO set up an Incident Management Support Team composed of experts from country, regional and headquarters offices. The WHO teams liaised with national authorities to monitor the public health impact, developed public health messages on protective actions, and provided guidance on mental health support for affected communities and emergency responders.",
          "New elements this year included the close coordination of protective measures by neighbouring countries Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldova, the deployment of international assistance missions and the additional challenge of cybersecurity threats. An expanded social media simulator was used to test crisis communication strategies.",
          "By simulating high-risk cross-border nuclear emergencies, these exercises test existing structures and technical readiness, help build trust and strengthen a coordinated global response. WHO’s ongoing work to strengthen radiation protection of the public, patients and workers worldwide includes providing Member States with evidence-based guidance, tools and technical advice on public health issues related to ionizing and non-ionizing radiation.",
          "Following the exercise, the IAEA will compile and publish a detailed review of best practices and areas for improvement. WHO will review the lessons learned and adjust processes accordingly."

This historic milestone follows nearly 70 years of commitment by the government and people of Suriname to eliminate the disease across its vast rainforests and diverse communities.</p><p>“WHO congratulates Suriname on this remarkable achievement,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This certification is a powerful affirmation of the principle that everyone—regardless of nationality, background, or migration status—deserves universal access to malaria diagnosis and treatment. Suriname’s steadfast commitment to health equity serves as an inspiration to all countries striving for a malaria-free future.”</p><p>With today’s announcement, a total of  <a href=\"/teams/global-malaria-programme/elimination/countries-and-territories-certified-malaria-free-by-who\">46 countries and 1 territory</a> have been certified as malaria-free by WHO, including 12 countries in the Region of the Americas.</p><p>“Suriname did what was needed to eliminate malaria—detecting and treating every case quickly, investigating to prevent spread, and engaging communities,” said Dr Jarbas Barbosa, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), WHO’s regional office for the Americas. “This certification reflects years of sustained effort, especially reaching remote areas. It means future generations can grow up free from this potentially deadly disease.”</p><p>Certification of malaria elimination is granted by WHO when a country has proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the chain of indigenous transmission has been interrupted nationwide for at least the previous three consecutive years.</p><p>Dr Amar Ramadhin, Minister of Health of Suriname, stated: \"Being malaria-free means that our population is no longer at risk from malaria. Furthermore, eliminating malaria will have positive effects on our healthcare sector, boost the economy, and enhance tourism.</p><p>“At the same time, we recognize that maintaining this status requires ongoing vigilance. We must continue to take the necessary measures to prevent the reintroduction of malaria. We are proud that our communities are now protected, and we look forward to welcoming more visitors to our beautiful Suriname—while remaining fully committed to safeguarding these hard-won gains.”</p><h2>Suriname’s road to elimination</h2><p>Suriname’s malaria control efforts began in 1950s in the country’s densely-populated coastal areas, relying heavily on indoor spraying with the pesticide DDT and antimalarial treatment. By the 1960s, the coastal areas had become malaria-free and attention turned towards the country’s forested interior, home to diverse indigenous and tribal communities.</p><p>Although indoor spraying was successful in coastal areas, its impact was limited in the country's interior due to the prevalence of traditional open-style homes that offer minimal protection against mosquitoes. In 1974 malaria control in the interior was decentralized to Medische Zending, Suriname’s primary health care service, which recruited and trained healthcare workers from the local communities to provide early diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>The surge in mining activities, particularly gold mining which often involves travel between malaria-endemic areas, led to increases in malaria, reaching a peak of more than 15 000 cases in 2001, the highest transmission rates of malaria in the Americas.</p><p>Since 2005, with support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the capacity to provide diagnosis was greatly expanded with both improvements in microscopy and the use of rapid diagnostic tests, particularly among mobile groups. Artemisinin-based treatments with primaquine were introduced in Suriname and neighboring countries through PAHO-led studies under the Amazon Malaria Initiative (AMI-RAVREDA), supported by the United States. Prevention among high-risk groups was also strengthened through the distribution of insecticide-treated nets funded by the Global Fund.</p><p>By 2006, malaria had drastically decreased among the indigenous populations, prompting Suriname to shift its focus to high-risk mobile populations in remote mining areas. To reach these groups—many of whom were migrants from neighboring endemic countries—the country established a network of Malaria Service Deliverers, recruited directly from the mining communities. These trained and supervised community workers provide free malaria diagnosis, treatment, and prevention services, playing a vital role in closing access gaps in hard-to-reach regions.</p><p>Through ensuring universal access to diagnosis and treatment regardless of legal status, deploying an extensive network of community health workers, and implementing nationwide malaria screening, including at border crossings, Suriname successfully eliminated malaria. The last locally transmitted case of <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> malaria was recorded in 2018, followed by the final <em>Plasmodium vivax</em> case in 2021.</p><h2>Sustained leadership commitment and funding</h2><p>The government of Suriname has shown strong commitment to malaria elimination, including through the National Malaria Elimination Taskforce, Malaria Program, Malaria Elimination Fund, and cross-border collaboration with Brazil, Guyana and French Guiana. For many years PAHO/WHO, with the support of the U.S. Government, has provided technical cooperation throughout Suriname’s anti-malaria campaign. Since 2016 Suriname also participated in the “Elimination 2025” initiative – a group of countries identified by WHO as having the potential to eliminate malaria by 2025.</p><p>This success in Suriname is a demonstration that malaria elimination is possible in challenging contexts in the Amazon basin and in tropical continental countries.

Loneliness is linked to an estimated 100 deaths every hour—more than 871 000 deaths annually. Strong social connections can lead to better health and longer life, <a href=\"/groups/commission-on-social-connection/report\">the report</a> says.<br/></p><p>“In this Report, we pull back the curtain on loneliness and isolation as a defining challenge of our time. Our Commission lays out a road map for how we can build more connected lives and underscores the profound impact this can have on health, educational, and economic outcomes,” said Dr Vivek Murthy, Co-chair of the WHO Commission on Social Connection, and former Surgeon General of the United States of America.</p><p>WHO defines social connection as the ways people relate to and interact with others. Loneliness is described as the painful feeling that arises from a gap between desired and actual social connections, while social isolation refers to the objective lack of sufficient social connections.<br/></p><p>“In this age when the possibilities to connect are endless, more and more people are finding themselves isolated and lonely,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"Apart from the toll it takes on individuals, families and communities, left unaddressed, loneliness and social isolation will continue to cost society billions in terms of health care, education, and employment. I welcome the Commission's report, which shines a light on the scale and impact of loneliness and isolation, and outlines key areas in which we can help people to reconnect in ways that matter most.”<br/></p><h2>Scale and causes of loneliness and social isolation<br/></h2><p>Loneliness affects people of all ages, especially youth and people living in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Between 17–21% of individuals aged 13–29-year-olds reported feeling lonely, with the highest rates among teenagers. About 24% of people in low-income countries reported feeling lonely — twice the rate in high-income countries (about 11%).<br/></p><p>“Even in a digitally connected world, many young people feel alone. As technology reshapes our lives, we must ensure it strengthens—not weakens—human connection. Our report shows that social connection must be integrated into all policies—from digital access to health, education, and employment,” said Chido Mpemba, Co-chair of the WHO Commission on Social Connection and Advisor to the African Union Chairperson. </p><p>While data on social isolation is more limited, it is estimated to affect up to 1 in 3 older adults and 1 in 4 adolescents. Some groups, such as people with disabilities, refugees or migrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and indigenous groups and ethnic minorities, may face discrimination or additional barriers that make social connection harder.<br/></p><p>Loneliness and social isolation have multiple causes. They include, for instance, poor health, low income and education, living alone, inadequate community infrastructure and public policies, and digital technologies.

          "Loneliness affects people of all ages, especially youth and people living in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Between 17–21% of individuals aged 13–29-year-olds reported feeling lonely, with the highest rates among teenagers. About 24% of people in low-income countries reported feeling lonely — twice the rate in high-income countries (about 11%).",
          "“Even in a digitally connected world, many young people feel alone. As technology reshapes our lives, we must ensure it strengthens—not weakens—human connection. Our report shows that social connection must be integrated into all policies—from digital access to health, education, and employment,” said Chido Mpemba, Co-chair of the WHO Commission on Social Connection and Advisor to the African Union Chairperson.",
          "While data on social isolation is more limited, it is estimated to affect up to 1 in 3 older adults and 1 in 4 adolescents. Some groups, such as people with disabilities, refugees or migrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and indigenous groups and ethnic minorities, may face discrimination or additional barriers that make social connection harder.",
          "Loneliness and social isolation have multiple causes. They include, for instance, poor health, low income and education, living alone, inadequate community infrastructure and public policies, and digital technologies. The report underscores the need for vigilance around the effects of excessive screen time or negative online interactions on the mental health and well-being of young people."

Women who received care from trusted midwives are <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27121907/\">statistically more likely</a> to experience healthy vaginal births and report higher satisfaction with the services they receive. </p><p>“Expanding and investing in midwifery models of care is one of the most effective strategies to improve maternal and newborn health globally,” said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director for Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing at WHO. “These approaches improve outcomes, maximize resources, and can be adapted to all countries.

Others have been detained since as far back as 2021. Today, we reiterate our urgent demand for their immediate and unconditional release.</p><p>As of today, 23 UN and five international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) personnel remain arbitrarily detained. Tragically, one UN staff member and another from Save the Children have died in detention. Others have lost loved ones while being held, denied the chance to attend their funerals or say goodbye.   Our arbitrarily detained colleagues have spent at least 365 days – and for some, over 1000 days – isolated from their families, children, husbands, and wives, in flagrant breach of international law. The toll of this detention is also weighing heavily on their families, who continue to endure the unbearable pain of absence and uncertainty as they face another Eid without their loved one.</p><p>Nothing can justify their ordeal. They were doing their jobs, helping people in desperate need: people without food, shelter, or adequate health care.</p><p>Yemen remains one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with over 19 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, many of whom rely on it for survival. A safe and enabling operating environment for humanitarian operations, including the release of detained personnel, is essential to maintaining and restoring assistance to those in need. Humanitarian workers should never be targeted or detained while carrying out their mandates to serve the people of Yemen.</p><p>The prolonged detention of our colleagues has a chilling effect across the international community, undermining support for Yemen and hindering humanitarian response. It has also undermined mediation efforts for lasting peace.</p><p>We acknowledge the release of one UN and two NGO personnel and the recent release of an Embassy staff member. We call on the de facto authorities to deliver on their previous commitments, including those made to the Director-General of the World Health Organization during his mission to Sana'a in December 2024.</p><p>The UN and INGOs will continue to work through all possible channels to secure the safe and immediate release of those arbitrarily detained.</p><p>Signatories:</p></div><ul><li>Achim Steiner, Administrator, UNDP </li><li>Amitabh Behar, OXFAM International Executive Director </li><li>Audrey Azoulay, Director General of UNESCO </li><li>Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director</li><li>Cindy McCain, WFP Executive Director </li><li>Hans Grundberg, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Yemen </li><li>Inger Ashing, Chief Executive Officer, Save the Children International </li><li>Michelle Nunn, President and CEO, CARE </li><li>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO </li><li>Volker Türk, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights<br/></li></ul>",

Immediately after, the WHO Executive Board met for two days, until 29 May, to address the Health Assembly’s outcome, WHO governance reform and the nomination and appointment of regional directors. </p><p>Dr Tedros said Member States demonstrated their commitment to WHO and multilateral action to protect and promote public health. “WHO and many of our Member States and health partners are facing various challenges,” he said. “But the World Health Assembly has sent a clear message: countries want a strong WHO and are committed to working together with WHO to build a healthier, safer and fairer world. These were strong votes of confidence in WHO at this critical time.” </p><h2>Making the world safer from pandemics</h2><p>“The Health Assembly’s adoption of the Pandemic Agreement on 20 May was a landmark in the history of WHO and global health,” said Dr Tedros. “Despite many obstacles, and in the face of significant mis- and disinformation, WHO’s Member States have succeeded in negotiating and adopting a legally binding agreement to make the world safer from pandemics.”</p><p>The Pandemic Agreement sets out a range of measures to prevent pandemics and strengthen health system resilience, including through improving the rapid sharing of pathogens; ensuring fair, equitable and timely access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics; and strengthening technology transfer, financing and supply chains. </p><p>Dr Tedros said adoption of the Pandemic Agreement was not the end of the journey, adding that Member States still must negotiate the annex on pathogen access and benefit sharing for adoption at an upcoming Health Assembly. The next step would be for 60 countries to ratify the agreement, including the annex, before it enters into force as an instrument of international law.</p><p>“But having watched this process over the past three and a half years, I am confident of two things,” the WHO Director-General said. “First, that Member States will finish the job by May next year (2026), as they have committed to doing; and second, that the deception and distortion will continue.”</p><p>In particular, Dr Tedros said while it has been widely acknowledged that the Pandemic Agreement will not infringe on national sovereignty, some quarters will continue to repeat the false claims.</p><p>“Let me be clear once again: the Pandemic Agreement will not infringe on national sovereignty, period. And the Pandemic Agreement does not give WHO any powers, period,” Dr Tedros said. “WHO’s job is to make recommendations to governments, but what governments do with those recommendations is entirely up to them. WHO is not even a party to the Agreement. This is an agreement between sovereign nations, and it will be ratified and implemented by sovereign nations that choose to do so. The intentional distortion of the Pandemic Agreement as ceding power to WHO must stop.”</p><h2>Assessed contributions increase </h2><p>The Assembly’s other major outcome was the approval of WHO’s 2026–27 Programme Budget, including the next 20% increase in assessed contributions, adding US$ 90 million in fully predictable and flexible funds to WHO’s income each year. In 2022, Member States agreed to increase assessed contributions progressively to 50% of our base budget, from just 16% at the time. This rise is the cornerstone of WHO’s transformation of its approach to sustainable financing by diversifying its donor base and receiving increased support from all of its Member States towards WHO’s core budget and programme of work. </p><p>“This is another major step towards making WHO less dependent on earmarked voluntary funds from a handful of traditional donors,” said Dr Tedros. “WHO also held a pledging event at which Member States and philanthropic donors committed at least US$ 210 million in additional funding to the WHO Investment Round.”</p><p>In addition to these two major achievements, the Health Assembly also celebrated several countries for eliminating diseases, and eliminating industrial trans-fat from their manufactured food supplies. </p><p>WHO Member States also adopted several important resolutions, reflecting WHO’s vast mission and mandate, including a new target to halve the health impacts of air pollution by 2040; new targets for nutrition in mothers and young children; to strengthen regulation of digital marketing of formula milk and baby foods; and a new global strategy for traditional medicine.</p><p>Countries for the first time also adopted resolutions on lung health and kidney health, and for a lead-free future, and established World Cervical Cancer Elimination Day and World Prematurity Day as official WHO health campaigns. Resolutions on digital health, Guinea worm disease, health financing, the health and care workforce, medical imaging, nursing and midwifery, rare diseases, sensory impairment, skin diseases, social connection and more were also adopted.</p><p> </p>",

    "content_html": "<p>Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its first-ever position paper on immunization products to protect infants against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) – the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children globally. </p><p>Every year, RSV causes about 100 000 deaths and over 3.6 million hospitalizations in children under the age of 5 years worldwide. About half of these deaths occur in infants younger than 6 months of age. The vast majority (97%) of RSV deaths in infants occur in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited access to supportive medical care, such as oxygen or hydration.</p><p>Published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER), the <a href=\"/publications/i/item/who-wer-10022-193-218\">position paper</a> outlines WHO recommendations for two immunization products: a maternal vaccine that can be given to pregnant women in their third trimester to protect their infant and a long-acting monoclonal antibody that can be administered to infants from birth, just before or during the RSV season.</p><p>“RSV is an incredibly infectious virus that infects people of all ages, but is especially harmful to infants, particularly those born premature, when they are most vulnerable to severe disease,” says Dr Kate O’Brien, Director of Immunization, Vaccines, and Biologicals at WHO. “The WHO-recommended RSV immunization products can transform the fight against severe RSV disease, dramatically reduce hospitalizations, and deaths, ultimately saving many infant lives globally.”</p><p>RSV usually causes mild symptoms similar to the common cold, including runny nose, cough and fever. However, it can lead to serious complications – including pneumonia and bronchiolitis – in infants, young children, older adults and those with compromised immune systems or underlying health conditions.</p><h2>Two immunization products to protect against RSV</h2><p>In response to the global burden of severe RSV disease among infants, WHO recommends that all countries introduce either the maternal vaccine, RSVpreF, or the monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab depending on the feasibility of implementation within each country’s existing health system, cost-effectiveness and anticipated coverage. Both products were recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) for global implementation in September 2024. In addition, the maternal vaccine received WHO prequalification in March 2025, allowing it to be purchased by UN agencies.</p><p>WHO recommends that the maternal vaccine be given to pregnant women during the third trimester of pregnancy, from week 28 onwards, to optimize for the adequate transfer of antibodies to their baby. The vaccine may be given during routine antenatal care, including at one of the 5 WHO-recommended antenatal care visits in the third trimester or any additional medical consultations.</p><p>The second WHO-recommended immunization product, nirsevimab, is given as a single injection of monoclonal antibodies that starts protecting babies against RSV within a week of administration and lasts for at least 5 months, which can cover the entire RSV season in countries with RSV seasonality. </p><p>WHO recommends that infants receive a single dose of nirsevimab right after birth or before being discharged from a birthing facility. If not administered at birth, the monoclonal antibody can be given during the baby's first health visit. If a country decides to administer the product only during the RSV season rather than year-round, a single dose can also be given to older infants just before entering their first RSV season. </p><p>The greatest impact on severe RSV disease will be achieved by administering the monoclonal antibody to infants under 6 months of age. However, there is still a potential benefit among infants up to 12 months of age.</p><p>WHO regularly issues updated position papers on vaccines, combinations of vaccines and other immunization products against diseases that have major public health impact. These papers focus primarily on the use of vaccines in large-scale vaccination programmes. The new position paper aims to inform national public health policymakers and immunization programme managers on the use of RSV immunization products in their national programmes, as well as national and international funding agencies.</p><p> </p>",

While significant progress has been made in strengthening disease surveillance over the past decade, no country can tackle today’s complex health threats alone.</p><p>The Health Security Partnership strengthens disease surveillance and epidemic intelligence across the African continent, enabling countries to better detect and respond to public health threats - whether they are natural, accidental or deliberate.  <a href=\"/news/item/18-07-2023-africa-cdc--who-and-rki-launch-a-health-security-partnership--to-strengthen-disease-surveillance-in-africa\">Launched</a> in 2023 in six countries, The Gambia, Mali, Morocco, Namibia, South Africa and Tunisia, the partnership will expand to Rwanda in its second phase which runs from 2025 to 2028.</p><p>At the heart of the initiative is a  <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240074064\">collaborative surveillance</a> approach that connects health and security sectors to reduce biological risks and strengthen surveillance systems nationally and internationally. HSPA is aligned with the health security objectives of the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction and the Signature Initiative to Mitigate Biological Threats in Africa (SIMBA).<br/><br/>“HSPA represents an important step forward in building stronger partnerships for health security in Africa. By bringing together global, regional and national actors, this initiative supports countries in strengthening Collaborative Surveillance through mutual exchange and practical action. WHO remains committed to working alongside Member States to ensure that these collective efforts are well-coordinated, responsive, and rooted in national priorities,” said Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, Acting WHO Regional Director for Africa; Deputy Executive Director, WHO Health Emergencies Programme.</p><p>The partnership is supporting countries to strengthen capacities in biorisk management, event and indicator-based surveillance, genomic surveillance and epidemic intelligence. This is achieved through training, guidance development, co-creation of implementation roadmaps, and hands-on technical assistance to ensure that implementation is aligned with country priorities, embedded within broader national systems, and built for long-term sustainability.<br/>“Within the framework of this project, Africa CDC will work with the Member States in mobilizing political will for biosecurity and surveillance, establishing regional frameworks for bio-surveillance of high-consequence biological agents and toxins, and coordinating event-based surveillance. The collaboration with other partners and coordination with Member States is crucial especially in the current context of limited resources to strengthen the continent's capacity for early detection, response, and management of biological threats,”<strong> </strong>said Dr Raji Tajudeen, Acting Deputy Director General and Head, Division of Public Health Institutes and Research, Africa CDC.<em></em></p><p>The HSPA initiative has been supported from the start by the Government of Canada’s Weapons Threat Reduction Program, with additional funding in phase two from the Government of the United Kingdom.</p><p>Building on the achievements in phase one, the participating countries, with support from WHO and partners, will accelerate implementation to build a healthier, safer and more resilient Africa. </p><h3><strong>Editor's note</strong></h3><p>On 29 May 2025, a correction was made to this news release, both in the headline and the main text, to reflect the joint announcement of the HSPA expansion with the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom, and to acknowledge HSPA’s alignment with the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction and the Signature Initiative to Mitigate Biological Threats in Africa (SIMBA). </p><p></p>",

An estimated 4.71 million deaths were associated with bacterial AMR as of 2021, according to the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD). The GAP update will offer a practical framework for the next 10 years to achieve the targets and commitments included in the political declaration of the United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting on AMR in 2024 – including a 10% reduction in global deaths associated with bacterial AMR by 2030. Since the global action plan was adopted in 2015, over 170 countries have developed multi-sectoral national action plans to address AMR. The updated plan will ensure the latest guidance is available to help countries accelerate implementation. It will reflect a multisectoral One Health approach, which aims to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems. WHO and the other Quadripartite organizations – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) – will develop this update in consultation with Member States and relevant stakeholders. The Seventy-eighth World Health Assembly also considered progress made in supporting countries to prevent infections; ensure universal access to quality and affordable diagnosis and appropriate treatment; strengthen surveillance, research and innovation; and enhance AMR awareness, governance and financing. Looking ahead, other WHO priorities include supporting countries to achieve efficiencies by integrating AMR interventions in health sector planning and financing, and enhancing coordination and governance of the AMR response at all levels, including with the Quadripartite.

          "Member States at the Seventy-eighth World Health Assembly strongly approved an updated road map for an enhanced global response to the adverse health effects of air pollution, reaffirming their commitment to protect populations from the world’s largest environmental health risk. The decision updates the 2016 strategy endorsed under WHA69/18 and builds on the landmark resolution WHA68.8 adopted in 2015.",
          "Today, 99% of the world’s population breathes air that does not meet WHO air quality guidelines. The health burden from air pollution falls disproportionately on vulnerable and marginalized populations, particularly in low-resource settings where fragile health systems face compound challenges.",
          "Air pollution is responsible for approximately 7 million deaths annually, primarily from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as stroke, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer as well as pneumonia. It is now recognized as the fifth major risk factor for NCDs alongside tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol.",
          "The updated road map sets the first voluntary target to halve the health impacts of air pollution by 2040 through improved surveillance, knowledge synthesis, institutional capacity building, and global leadership. It provides practical guidance for health authorities to advocate for clean air, inform policy, and protect communities – especially those most at risk.",
          "With this new Resolution, WHO and its Member States commit to scaling up action to monitor, prevent, and mitigate the health impacts of air pollution. The decision represents a critical step toward cleaner air, healthier lives, and accelerated progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.",
          "Related documents: A78/4 , EB156/24 , EB156/2025/REC/1, decision EB156(33) Countries commit to regulate the digital marketing of formula milk and baby foods",
          "In a new resolution, Member States agreed to expand the provisions of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (the Code) to tackle the digital marketing of formula milk and baby foods. The Code is a landmark public health agreement passed by the World Health Assembly in 1981, which aims to protect caregivers from aggressive marketing practices by the baby food industry. This advertising often makes misleading claims about the benefits of formula milk products, promotes unhealthy baby foods to parents, and reinforces negative myths about breastfeeding. Over recent years, new tactics for digital marketing have proliferated, for instance through influencer endorsements, virtual “support groups”, and personal targeting of pregnant women and new parents across their social media feeds. Many of these promotions are funded by baby food companies but their sponsorship is undisclosed. Advertisements are widely circulated across national borders – creating new challenges for regulation. In line with recent guidance from WHO, the 2025 Resolution calls for robust efforts to develop, strengthen and coordinate the regulation of digital marketing to protect children’s health. It calls on countries to build effective systems for monitoring and enforcement. Despite the existence of the Code, a major study from WHO and UNICEF found that over half of new parents had been exposed to promotions from formula milk companies. In some countries, this was over 90%. The new Resolution covers the marketing of formula milks, teats and bottles, as well as foods for infants and young children.

          "The Assembly reviewed the Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030 , which highlights a slowdown in progress and an increase in the projected global shortfall in health workers to 11.1 million by 2030 – up from the 2022 estimate of 10.2 million.",
          "Countries adopted a resolution – sponsored by Germany, Morocco, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Thailand – calling for accelerated investment in health professionals’ education, job creation, and retention; improved working conditions; and a harnessing of the potential of digital technologies and AI in support of health workers.",
          "The Assembly also considered new data and recommendations on the international migration of health workers and how to strengthen ethical recruitment in alignment with the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel . A record 105 countries reported on international migration.",
          "The Assembly noted the findings of the Code’s third review and endorsed a decision to hold regional consultations on the draft findings of the Expert Advisory Group in 2025, including on its emphasis on mutual benefits, co-investment and sustainable solutions, alongside better regulation of private recruitment and inclusion of care workers.",
          "Related documents: EB156/CONF./14 EB156/14 Countries approve a landmark resolution for a lead-free future With broad support, countries approved a resolution galvanizing global support for a lead-free future. The Resolution affirms the global health sector’s commitment to tackle exposure to lead, one of WHO’s top 10 chemicals of major public health concern. Member states also acknowledged that exposure to hazardous chemicals and pollution contributes to over 9 million premature deaths annually –  one in six globally – with a disproportionate impact on populations in vulnerable situations, especially children, pregnant women, and communities in low- and middle-income countries. Member States are urged to reduce exposures to hazardous chemicals, such as lead, mercury, persistent organic pollutants and endocrine-disrupting chemicals, by integrating health into environmental policies and regulations and improving waste management systems, including for growing challenges related to plastics and e-waste pollution. Countries committed to implementing WHO’s chemicals roadmap, and enhancing national capacities and global cooperation through multilateral agreements such as the Global Framework on Chemicals, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, and the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions. WHO will consult with countries and translate Resolution EB156(32) into a Global action plan on lead mitigation and continue providing technical assistance and guidance in strengthening health sector leadership, to protect communities from preventable health risks due to hazardous chemicals, waste and pollution. By adopting EB156(32) and acknowledging exposure to lead and other chemicals, waste and pollution as threats to health, Member States have taken a decisive action toward addressing environmental determinants and the root causes of ill health, advancing health equity, and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

In arriving at this Strategy, Member States debated crucial components for inclusion, such as establishing a robust evidence base for traditional medicine practices, developing mechanisms for regulation and safety, creating integrated health-care service delivery models where appropriate, and ensuring qualified practitioners. With this Strategy, the Member States explicitly recognized not only the role of traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples but also the upholding their rights, while promoting environmental sustainability and biodiversity conservation in the context of TCIM. Under the 2025-2034 strategy, WHO will assist Member States in strengthening the evidence base for TCIM, bolstering safety, quality and effectiveness, and, where appropriate, facilitating its integration into health systems while optimizing cross-sector collaboration. Implementation and monitoring of the Strategy are key elements. WHO will support Member States in implementing and adapting the Strategy, providing guidance and technical assistance as needed. This new Strategy aims to unlock the full potential of TCIM to improve global health and well-being in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage (UHC). Related links: EB156(28) World Prematurity Day approved as a mandated global health campaign Endorsing the urgent need for action on preterm births, Member States agreed to announce World Prematurity Day as an official WHO health campaign. The campaign will complement efforts to improve prevention of preterm births and ensure lifesaving health care for babies born early or small. Preterm births are defined as births that occur before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. Related complications, which include difficulties breathing as well as infections and hypothermia, are the leading cause of death amongst children aged under 5 years. Those who survive can face significant and long-term disability and ill health. The Resolution also calls on countries to invest in proven high-impact interventions – like special newborn care units, kangaroo mother care and family support -- that improve outcomes for babies born early or small. The campaign was approved as part of discussions on the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health (2016-2030), and is aligned with last year’s Resolution to accelerate progress in improving maternal, newborn, and child survival.

In arriving at this Strategy, Member States debated crucial components for inclusion, such as establishing a robust evidence base for traditional medicine practices, developing mechanisms for regulation and safety, creating integrated health-care service delivery models where appropriate, and ensuring qualified practitioners.",
          "With this Strategy, the Member States explicitly recognized not only the role of traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples but also the upholding their rights, while promoting environmental sustainability and biodiversity conservation in the context of TCIM.",
          "Under the 2025-2034 strategy, WHO will assist Member States in strengthening the evidence base for TCIM, bolstering safety, quality and effectiveness, and, where appropriate, facilitating its integration into health systems while optimizing cross-sector collaboration.",

It underscores the serious health risks posed by nuclear weapons and reaffirms WHO’s constitutional principle that health is fundamental to peace and security.",

Nuclear war would have catastrophic consequences for human health –  both immediate and long-term. At the UN Summit of the Future in September 2024, Member States raised an alarm on the rising threat of nuclear conflict, calling it an existential risk to humanity, and reaffirmed their commitment to total nuclear disarmament.",
          "The new Resolution requests the WHO Director-General to update earlier reports on nuclear war’s impacts on health and health systems, cooperate with relevant stakeholders and UN bodies, and report back to the World Health Assembly by 2029. It also encourages Member States to support this work, in line with their national contexts and legal frameworks, recognizing that preventing nuclear war is essential for global health, security, and the survival of humanity.

However, it also called for improvements, including regional engagement, broader stakeholder collaboration, and enhanced operational agility.",

    "content_html": "<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:25px;font-weight:700;text-align:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">New guideline calls for improved global access to controlled medicines </span></p><div><div><p paraeid=\"{6cd0c751-273c-4ea2-88df-25db7b6af457}{193}\" paraid=\"315291804\">The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a rapid communication outlining its new guideline on balanced national policies for controlled medicines. The guideline was officially presented during a high-level side event at the Seventy-eighth World Health Assembly. It is designed to support countries in ensuring safe, equitable and affordable access to essential controlled medicines which are critical for treating acute and chronic pain, mental health conditions, substance use disorders and other serious health issues.  </p></div><div><p paraeid=\"{6cd0c751-273c-4ea2-88df-25db7b6af457}{207}\" paraid=\"2104791679\">Controlled medicines, such as opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, amphetamines and dissociative anaesthetics like ketamine, are drugs that have authorized use for medical or scientific purposes. They should be used under careful regulation as they have properties that can increase health risks if used for non-medical purposes and they can be associated with drug use disorders and drug dependence, unless rational use is ensured. But they also have essential life-improving properties, reducing suffering and improving health and well-being when used appropriately for treating specific medical conditions.  </p></div><div><p paraeid=\"{6cd0c751-273c-4ea2-88df-25db7b6af457}{237}\" paraid=\"264417700\">However, the majority of the world’s population lives in countries with limited or no access to affordable, quality-assured controlled medicines, even when they are proven to be safe and effective for treatment. And there is a major access and equity gap; for example, in 2021, over 80% of the world’s morphine was distributed to high-income countries, which leaves out 5.5 million terminal cancer patients and millions of others suffering from acute illness and end-of-life suffering in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Studies show that 75% of people living with epilepsy in LMICs do not receive treatment.  </p></div><div><p paraeid=\"{6cd0c751-273c-4ea2-88df-25db7b6af457}{249}\" paraid=\"1205679280\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The updated WHO guideline offers a clear roadmap for Member States to develop and implement balanced national policies that support the medical and scientific use of controlled medicines while protecting individuals and communities from the risks associated with non-medical use. </span></p></div><div><p paraeid=\"{a407fd5e-52ae-4523-8f6d-b1171e49d461}{4}\" paraid=\"738552090\">Key highlights include: </p><ul paraeid=\"{a407fd5e-52ae-4523-8f6d-b1171e49d461}{4}\" paraid=\"738552090\"><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">ensuring accurate and timely quantification of controlled medicines based on current consumption and projected needs; </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">banning misleading and unethical marketing practices;</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">strengthening procurement and supply chain systems using appropriate tools and technologies to enhance traceability, reduce stockouts and waste, and ensure equitable distribution; </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">enabling local production where feasible; </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">facilitating continuous access to opioid agonist treatment in all clinically needed settings;

The Assembly agreed that social connection, which is characterized as the ways people relate to and interact with others, needs to be addressed as a public health priority, based on growing evidence linking it to improved health outcomes and reduced risk of early death. This phenomenon is becoming increasingly relevant in the context of rapid technological shifts and long-term social trends. </p></div><div><p paraeid=\"{38c8ab70-f8eb-4d28-9f02-e4287ebbf4de}{2}\" paraid=\"2115176143\">Social connection, an important determinant of health, is linked to other social, economic and environmental determinants, and its cumulative effects help shape people’s health across the life course. A lack of social connection is often associated with cardiovascular disease and mental health conditions, including depression, dementia and other types of cognitive decline.

The Resolution – the first in the history of the WHA – urges Member States to develop and implement evidence-based policies, programmes and strategies to raise awareness and promote positive social connection for mental and physical health.

Over the last year, WHO responded to 51 graded emergencies across 89 countries and territories, including global outbreaks of cholera and mpox – a public health emergency of international concern – as well as multiple humanitarian crises. Working with over 900 partners across 28 health clusters, WHO helped provide health assistance for 72 million people in humanitarian settings. Nearly 60% of new emergencies were climate-related, highlighting the growing health impacts of climate change. </p><p>Member States noted the WHO Director-General’s report on the implementation of the health emergency prevention, preparedness, response and resilience (HEPR) framework. The report outlined progress made in the key areas of collaborative disease surveillance, community protection, safe and scalable care, access to medical countermeasures and emergency coordination, and stressed that insufficient and unpredictable funding poses a significant risk to health systems worldwide. </p><p>Delegates noted the report of the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee (IOAC) for WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme. The report presents several recommendations to the Director-General aimed at strengthening WHO’s work in emergencies. The chair of the IOAC commended WHO’s leadership – particularly that of Dr Mike Ryan, the outgoing Executive Director of the Health Emergencies Programme, for his pivotal role and contributions to global health.</p><p>The Director-General also reported on Universal Health and Preparedness Review (UHPR) to the Assembly, a unique process for Member States to assess their health emergency preparedness. UHPR was launched in November 2020 as a voluntary, country-led mechanism, in response to early lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p><strong>Related documents:  </strong></p><ul><li><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA78/A78_13-en.pdf\">A78/13</a> WHO’s work in health emergencies</li><li><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA78/A78_12-en.pdf\">A78/12</a> Health emergencies preparedness and response: The Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee for the WHO Health Emergencies Programme</li></ul><ul><li><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA78/A78_9-en.pdf\">A78/9 </a>Strengthening the global architecture for health emergency prevention, preparedness, response and resilience</li><li><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA78/A78_4-en.pdf\">A78/4</a> Consolidated report by the Director-General (including UHPR)<br/></li></ul><h2>International Health Regulations remain a cornerstone of global health security</h2><p>Member States noted the Director-General’s report on progress made in implementing the International Health Regulations (2005), which outline the rights and obligations of countries in managing public health events and emergencies that have the potential to cross borders. <br/></p><p>In 2024, WHO assessed over 1.2 million raw signals related to public health risks, identifying and verifying 429 events with potential or actual international public health implications. <br/></p><p>All countries but one provided their self-assessment report to the Assembly. Numerous joint external evaluations, after- and intra-action reviews, and training were conducted to strengthen preparedness and response capacities.  <br/></p><p>Member States recommended to the Assembly the adoption of a decision for the Director-General to notify Palestine of the International Health Regulations (2005). This is a step prior to Palestine expressing interest in becoming a States Party to the Regulations. This follows the resolution approved during the World Health Assembly last year on aligning the participation of Palestine in WHO with its participation in the United Nations. <br/></p><p>The Assembly also noted the Standing Recommendations issued by the Director-General on COVID-19 (valid until April 2026) and mpox (valid until August 2025).<br/></p><p>At last year’s World Health Assembly, Member States adopted historic amendments to the Regulations, drawing on lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Public health and social measures are nonpharmaceutical interventions used to reduce the spread of an infectious disease and lower hospitalizations and death. Examples include screening for diseases, personal hygiene measures and changing the way people gather or travel. These measures played an important role in buying time for countries to develop and distribute treatments, diagnostics and vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the evidence base on the effectiveness of these measures remains limited. </p><p><strong>Related documents:</strong></p><ul><li><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA78/B156_REC1_EXT-en.pdf\">EB156/2025/REC/1, decision EB156(31)</a> Strengthening the evidence-base for public health and social measures</li></ul><h2>WHO’s response to health needs in Ukraine and refugee-hosting countries</h2><p>Delegates noted the Director-General’s report on the implementation of a resolution on WHO’s response to the health emergency triggered by the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine. In 2024, WHO reached an estimated 4.7 million people with health support in Ukraine and more than 400 000 refugees in neighbouring countries. WHO delivered over US$ 32.5 million worth of medicines, medical equipment and supplies to health facilities across Ukraine, and over US$ 4.9 million worth of supplies and equipment to refugee-hosting countries. Since 24 February 2022, a total of 2254 attacks on health care have been verified, resulting in 710 injuries and 208 deaths. <br/></p><p>Member States voted on related decisions.

Member States commended the transparency, and the level of detail provided. At the same time, Member States noted with concern that while some important achievements have been realized, progress is insufficient in reaching the SDG targets. In addition, Member States also advocated for more equitable funding across the Organization. The committee approved decision 78/17 Add.1 and 78/17 Add.2.",
          "Delegates welcomed WHO’s Investment Round (IR), which will fund the Organization’s Fourteenth General Programme of Work – 2025–2028 (GPW 14) – its global health strategy for the next four years that has the potential to save 40 million lives if fully funded.  By April 2025, pledges of US$ 1.7 billion had been received. During the Health Assembly at least an additional US $210 million was committed, with further amounts expected. Since the start of the Investment Round, 62 pledges have been made by Member States, with a further 20 pledges by philanthropic organizations. Of the 62 pledgers, 35 had not previously provided voluntary contributions to WHO.",

Working with over 900 partners across 28 health clusters, WHO helped provide health assistance for 72 million people in humanitarian settings. Nearly 60% of new emergencies were climate-related, highlighting the growing health impacts of climate change.",

Data and financing are a natural place to start because that is where ministers are telling us to start.”Dr Tedros said, “From expanding domestic financing to pioneering real-time data systems, many of you are advancing solutions that are scalable, sustainable and rooted in equity. Data and sustainable financing are not just technical matters. They are political choices. They shape who is reached, how quickly, and with what quality of care. And they determine whether we progress or fall behind.\"Ministers from Barbados, Central African Republic, Egypt, Liberia, Malawi, Rwanda and Sierra Leone, and representatives from the African Union and the World Bank, among others, shared experiences and advice on concrete actions to strengthen data systems, health financing and planning – urging intensified collaboration in the future. They also spoke of the need to leverage the digital transformation and thereby increase transparency and accountability.Also discussed: strategies to improve domestic financing capacity while maximizing impact include: strengthening tax administration; exploring revenue sources such as taxes on such items as food, alcohol and tobacco; setting up population-wide mandatory health coverage schemes, coupled with subsidies for low-income households and vulnerable population groups; promoting strategic purchasing of health supplies; prioritizing health in public spending; and integrating externally-funded programmes into domestic financing systems and priorities.Later this week the Assembly will take up the proposed WHA Health Financing Resolution.Related linksWHO Director-General's opening remarks at the Strategic Roundtable: Data and Sustainable Financing: Twin Foundations to Accelerate UHC – 21 May 2025Report on the health conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian GolanOn 21 May 2025, the Seventy-eighth World Health Assembly noted a report from the Director-General, outlining WHO’s humanitarian and emergency health response in the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan, from January 2024 to February 2025.A report on the health conditions in the occupied Syrian Golan couldn’t be provided this year again due to the ongoing situation and the lack of disaggregated health data on the Syrian population.

          "“The world is safer today thanks to the leadership, collaboration and commitment of our Member States to adopt the historic WHO Pandemic Agreement,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “The Agreement is a victory for public health, science and multilateral action. It will ensure we, collectively, can better protect the world from future pandemic threats. It is also a recognition by the international community that our citizens, societies and economies must not be left vulnerable to again suffer losses like those endured during COVID-19.”",
          "Governments adopted the WHO Pandemic Agreement today in a plenary session of the World Health Assembly, WHO’s peak decision-making body. The adoption followed yesterday’s approval of the Agreement by vote (124 in favour, 0 objections, 11 abstentions) in Committee by Member State delegations.",
          "“Starting during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments from all corners of the world acted with great purpose, dedication and urgency, and in doing so exercising their national sovereignty, to negotiate the historic WHO Pandemic Agreement that has been adopted today,” said Dr Teodoro Herbosa, Secretary of the Philippines Department of Health, and President of this year’s World Health Assembly, who presided over the Agreement’s adoption. “Now that the Agreement has been brought to life, we must all act with the same urgency to implement its critical elements, including systems to ensure equitable access to life-saving pandemic-related health products . As COVID was a once-in-a-lifetime emergency, the WHO Pandemic Agreement offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build on lessons learned from that crisis and ensure people worldwide are better protected if a future pandemic emerges.”",
          "The WHO Pandemic Agreement sets out the principles, approaches and tools for better international coordination across a range of areas, in order to strengthen the global health architecture for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. This includes through the equitable and timely access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.",
          "Regarding national sovereignty, the Agreement states that: “Nothing in the WHO Pandemic Agreement shall be interpreted as providing the Secretariat of the World Health Organization, including the Director-General of the World Health Organization, any authority to direct, order, alter or otherwise prescribe the national and/or domestic law, as appropriate, or policies of any Party, or to mandate or otherwise impose any requirements that Parties take specific actions, such as ban or accept travellers, impose vaccination mandates or therapeutic or diagnostic measures or implement lockdowns.”",
          "Notes for editors",
          "The resolution on the WHO Pandemic Agreement adopted by the World Health Assembly sets out steps to prepare for the accord’s implementation. It includes launching a process to draft and negotiate a Pathogen Access and Benefit Sharing system (PABS) through an Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG). The result of this process will be considered at next year’s World Health Assembly.",
          "Once the Assembly adopts the PABS annex, the WHO Pandemic Agreement will then be open for signature and consideration of ratification, including by national legislative bodies. After 60 ratifications, the Agreement will enter into force.",
          "In addition, Member States also directed the IGWG to initiate steps to enable setting up of the Coordinating Financial Mechanism for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, and the Global Supply Chain and Logistics Network (GSCL) to “enhance, facilitate, and work to remove barriers and ensure equitable, timely, rapid, safe, and affordable access to pandemic-related health products for countries in need during public health emergencies of international concern, including pandemic emergencies, and for prevention of such emergencies.”",
          "According to the Agreement, pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in the PABS system will play a key role in equitable and timely access to pandemic-related health products by making available to WHO “rapid access targeting 20% of their real time production of safe, quality and effective vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics for the pathogen causing the pandemic emergency.”  The distribution of these products to countries will be carried out on the basis of public health risk and need, with particular attention to the needs of developing countries.",
          "The WHO Pandemic Agreement is the second international legal agreement negotiated under Article 19 of the WHO Constitution, the first being the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which was adopted in 2003 and entered into force in 2005."

The validation certificate was received by Honorable Abdallahi Sidi Mohamed Wedih, Minister of Health and Aïcha Vall Vergès, Ambassador of Mauritania to Switzerland at the Seventy-eighth World Health Assembly.</p><p>“I congratulate the government and the people of Mauritania for this achievement,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This is another example of the incredible progress we have made against neglected tropical diseases and gives hope to many other nations still fighting against trachoma that they too can eliminate this disease.”</p><p>Mauritania has a long history of a fight against trachoma that dates back to the 1960s. However, it was not until early 2000 that the country conducted population-based epidemiological surveys to map trachoma with the support of the Organization for the Prevention of Blindness (OPC), the Institute of Tropical Ophthalmology of Africa (IOTA) and WHO. Trachoma control activities were integrated into the National Programme for the Fight against Blindness at the Ministry of Health.</p><p>Mauritania implemented the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy to eliminate trachoma with the support of partners. These activities included provision of surgery to treat the late blinding stage of the disease, conducting mass administration of antibiotic treatment with azithromycin donated by Pfizer through the International Trachoma Initiative, carrying out public awareness campaigns to promote facial cleanliness and personal hygiene as well as improvement in access to water supply and sanitation.</p><p>\"Eliminating trachoma is a landmark victory for public health in Mauritania,\" said Dr Charlotte Faty Ndiaye, WHO Representative in Mauritania. \"This success reflects the strong leadership and commitment of the Government, supported by the dedication of health workers, communities, and partners, with the guidance and support of WHO. We will remain vigilant and support the country to preserve this success and protect those most at risk from trachoma.\" </p><p>Trachoma is the second neglected tropical disease to be eliminated in Mauritania. In 2009, the country had already been certified free of dracunculiasis (Guinea-worm disease) transmission. Globally, Mauritania joins 21 other countries that have been validated by WHO for having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. These are Benin, Cambodia, China, Ghana, India, Iraq, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malawi, Mali, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Gambia, Togo, Vanuatu and Viet Nam. These countries are part of a wider group of 55 countries that have eliminated one or more neglected tropical diseases.</p><p>WHO is supporting Mauritania’s health authorities to closely monitor communities where trachoma was previously endemic to ensure there is no resurgence of the disease.</p><h2>Disease prevalence</h2><p>As of April 2024, trachoma remains a public health problem in 37 countries with an estimated 103 million people living in areas requiring interventions against the disease. Trachoma is found mainly in the poorest and most rural areas of Africa, Central and South America, Asia, the Western Pacific and the Middle East. The African Region is disproportionately affected by trachoma with 93 million people living in at-risk areas in April 2024, representing 90% of the global trachoma burden.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in the fight against trachoma over the past few years and the number of people requiring antibiotic treatment for trachoma in the African Region fell by 96 million from 189 million in 2014 to 93 million as of April 2024, representing a 51% reduction.</p><p>Following Mauritania’s success, there are now 20 countries in WHO’s African Region that are targeting trachoma elimination.<br/> </p><p><strong>Note to editors</strong></p><p>Trachoma is a neglected tropical disease. It is caused by infection with the bacterium <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, which spreads from person to person through contaminated fingers, fomites and flies that have come into contact with discharge from the eyes or nose of an infected person. Environmental risk factors for trachoma transmission include poor hygiene, overcrowded households, and inadequate access to water and sanitation.</p><p>Elimination of trachoma as a public health problem is defined as: (i) a prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis “unknown to the health system” of &lt;0.2% in adults aged ≥15 years (approximately 1 case per 1000 total population), and (ii) a prevalence of trachomatous inflammation – follicular in children aged 1–9 years of &lt;5%, sustained for at least two years in the absence of ongoing antibiotic mass treatment, in each formerly endemic district; plus (iii) the existence of a system able to identify and manage incident trachomatous trichiasis cases, using defined strategies, with evidence of appropriate financial resources to implement those strategies.</p><p>To eliminate trachoma as a public health problem, WHO recommends the SAFE strategy: a comprehensive approach to reduce transmission of the causative organism, clear existing infections and deal with their effects.</p><p>The road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021–2030 targets the prevention, control, elimination or eradication of 20 diseases and disease groups.

This year’s gathering comes at a pivotal moment for global health, as Member States confront emerging threats and major shifts in the landscape for global health and international development.</p><p>This year’s theme underscores WHO’s enduring commitment to solidarity and equity, highlighting that even in unprecedented times, everyone, everywhere should have an equal chance to live a healthy life.  </p><h2>A defining moment: the Pandemic Agreement</h2><p>A highly anticipated moment of the WHA78 will be the consideration of the Pandemic Agreement, a landmark proposal developed over three years of intense negotiations by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body, composed of all WHO Member States. The adoption of the agreement is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to safeguard the world from a repeat of the suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposal will be the second ever presented for approval under Article 19 of the WHO Constitution, which gives Member States the authority to reach agreements on global health.</p><p>“This year’s World Health Assembly will be truly historic with countries, after 3 years of negotiations, considering for adoption the first global compact to better protect people from pandemics,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “The Pandemic Agreement can make the world safer by boosting collaboration among countries fairly in the preparedness, prevention and response to pandemics.” </p><h2>Key priorities</h2><p>WHO’s sustainable financing is a key priority of the Health Assembly. Member States will consider a scheduled 20% increase in assessed contributions (membership fees), towards the next Programme Budget 2026–2027 (PB26-27). The PB26–27, also for approval by the Health Assembly,<strong> </strong>is<strong> </strong>the first full biennium under WHO’s <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/about/general-programme-of-work/fourteenth\"></a><a href=\"/about/general-programme-of-work/fourteenth\">Fourteenth General Programme of Work<strong></strong></a> (GPW14), WHO’s strategy for global health for 2025–2028. The Programme Budget for 2026–2027 was under consultation by Member States, to prioritize activities and adjust the budget to the current financial realities, by reducing it by 22%, to US$ 4.267 billion, from the original proposed budget of US$ 5.3 billion. </p><p>Reprioritization of WHO’s work, including cost-saving measures and budget adjustments, will also apply to the current year, 2025. The aim is to focus on WHO’s core work and increase efficiency. The reprioritization is a critical step to aligning WHO’s resources with the most urgent global health needs and getting health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) back on track. </p><p>Sustainable financing was one of several transformation priorities put in place by the WHO Director-General to ensure a more efficient and impactful WHO when he first took office.

They point to critical gaps in access, protection, and investment—especially for women and girls. Health progress is slowing.

An estimated 1.4 billion more people were living healthier by the end of 2024, surpassing the 1 billion target. The progress in healthier lives was driven by reduction in tobacco use, improved air quality and better access to water, hygiene, and sanitation.

Nonetheless, in 2025, \r\nSARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate globally, causing severe disease, post\r\n COVID-19 condition, and death. The majority of COVID-19 deaths continue\r\n to occur in individuals aged 65 years and older and those with \r\ncoexisting conditions. Some countries have reported an increase in \r\nincidence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths among children\r\n under 1 year of age, as compared to young adults, although this group \r\nstill accounts for a small proportion of total COVID-19 hospitalizations\r\n and deaths.</li><li>As of May 2025, currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 \r\nvariants are derived from JN.1. The weekly proportion of Variant Under \r\nMonitoring (VUM) LP.8.1 among all SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted to \r\nGISAID continues to increase. The weekly proportion of JN.1 (Variant of \r\nInterest, VOI) is slowly increasing, largely due to increases in LF.7 \r\nand its descendent variants, while all other VUMs (KP.3, KP.3.1.1, XEC, \r\nand LB.1) are declining. </li><li>Several JN.1 derived variants have \r\nindependently evolved changes in the spike protein at epitopes known to \r\nbe targeted by neutralizing antibodies.</li><li>Published and \r\nunpublished data using antisera from naïve hamsters infected with JN.1, \r\nKP.2, KP.3.1.1, XEC or LP.8.1 or mice immunized with mRNA vaccine \r\nantigens JN.1, KP.2 or KP.3 showed that JN.1, KP.2, KP.3.1.1, XEC, and \r\nLP.8.1 are antigenically closely related to each other (approximately 1 \r\nantigenic unit in cartographic analysis, which corresponds to a \r\ntwo-fold-difference in neutralization).</li><li>In published and \r\nunpublished data from humans, vaccination with monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 \r\nantigens significantly increased neutralizing antibody titers against \r\nall JN.1 descendent lineages tested:<ul><li>Analysis of pre- and \r\npost-vaccination sera from JN.1 lineage (i.e. JN.1 or KP.2) immunized \r\nindividuals demonstrated significant rises in neutralization of JN.1 and\r\n its descendent lineages, including KP.3.1.1, XEC, LF.7.2.1, and LP.8.1.</li><li>Neutralization\r\n titers against LP.8.1 were generally modestly lower (2-fold reduction) \r\nthan those against the homologous JN.1 or KP.2 antigen.</li></ul></li><li>Contemporary\r\n vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates are relative (rVE), rather than \r\nabsolute (comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals), and \r\ndemonstrate the added or incremental protection of recent vaccination \r\nover and above pre-existing infection- and vaccine-derived immunity. \r\nMonovalent JN.1 or KP.2 COVID-19 vaccines were introduced into some \r\nvaccination programmes in the second half of 2024. There are only a few \r\nstudies estimating rVE for the monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 mRNA COVID-19 \r\nvaccines during periods of JN.1 descendent lineage circulation. Both \r\nvaccines demonstrated additional protection—relative to pre-existing \r\nimmunity—against symptomatic and severe COVID-19 during the first three \r\nto four months after vaccination.</li><li>Data shared confidentially with the TAG-CO-VAC by vaccine manufacturers showed that:<ul><li>Immunization\r\n of naïve mice, as well as of mice previously immunized with SARS-CoV-2 \r\nvariants, with monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 vaccines resulted in high \r\nneutralizing antibody titers against JN.1 and its derivatives \r\nincluding KP.2, KP.3.1.1, XEC, LP.8.1, and LF.7.2. However, \r\nneutralization titers against LP.8.1 were typically lower than those \r\nagainst the homologous immunizing antigen.</li><li>Immunization of naïve\r\n mice, as well as of mice previously immunized with SARS-CoV-2 variants,\r\n with monovalent LP.8.1 vaccine candidates elicited high neutralizing \r\nantibody titers against the homologous antigen. Cross-neutralizing \r\nantibody titers elicited against other JN.1 lineage \r\nvariants including JN.1, KP.2, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, XEC, and LF.7.2 were \r\nsimilar or modestly higher than those elicited by JN.1 or KP.2 antigens.</li><li>In\r\n humans, vaccination with monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 antigens resulted in \r\nrobust neutralizing antibody responses to JN.1 and descendent variants, \r\nincluding KP.3.1.1, XEC, LP.8.1, and LF.7.2.</li><li>As in non-clinical \r\ndata, analysis of pre- and post-vaccination sera from JN.1 or KP.2 \r\nimmunized individuals showed some variation in neutralizing antibody \r\ntiters against LP.8.1 and LF.7.2 across different studies. In most \r\ninstances, they were similar or lower than those against the \r\nhomologous JN.1 or KP.2 antigens.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Overall, the \r\ncurrently approved monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 vaccines continue to elicit \r\nbroadly cross-reactive immune responses to circulating JN.1-derived \r\nvariants. LP.8.1 as a vaccine antigen offers similar or modestly \r\nincreased cross-reactive antibody responses to circulating JN.1-derived \r\nvariants, as compared to monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 vaccines. Mathematical \r\nmodeling indicates that an increase in neutralizing antibody titers may \r\ntranslate into an improvement in vaccine effectiveness and duration of \r\nprotection.</p><p>The TAG-CO-VAC acknowledges several limitations of available data: </p><ul><li>There\r\n are persistent and increasing gaps in the reporting of cases, \r\nhospitalizations and deaths, from WHO Member States, as well as in \r\ngenetic/genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 globally, including low \r\nnumbers of samples sequenced and limited geographic diversity. The \r\nTAG-CO-VAC strongly supports the ongoing work of the WHO <a data-mce-href=\"https://www.who.int/groups/who-coronavirus-network\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/groups/who-coronavirus-network\">Coronavirus Network</a> (CoViNet) and the <a data-mce-href=\"https://www.who.int/initiatives/global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/initiatives/global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system\">Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System</a> (GISRS) to address this information gap.</li></ul><ul><li>The\r\n timing, specific mutations and antigenic characteristics of emerging \r\nand future variants are difficult to predict, and the potential public \r\nhealth impact of these variants remain unknown.

    "content_html": "<p>The global nursing workforce has grown from 27.9 million in 2018 to 29.8 million in 2023, but wide disparities in the availability of nurses remain across regions and countries, according to the <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240110236/\">State of the World’s Nursing 2025 report</a><em>,</em> published<em> </em>by the World Health Organization (WHO), International Council of Nurses (ICN) and partners. Inequities in the global nursing workforce leave many of the world’s population without access to essential health services, which could threaten progress towards universal health coverage (UHC), global health security and the health-related development goals.  </p><p>The new report released on International Nurses Day provides a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of the nursing workforce at global, regional and country levels. Consolidating information from WHO’s 194 Member States, the evidence indicates global progress in reducing the nursing workforce shortage from 6.2 million in 2020 to 5.8 million in 2023, with a projection to decline to 4.1 million by 2030. But, the overall progress still masks deep regional disparities: approximately 78% of the world’s nurses are concentrated in countries representing just 49% of the global population.  </p><p>Low- and middle-income countries are facing challenges in graduating, employing and retaining nurses in the health system and will need to raise domestic investments to create and sustain jobs. In parallel, high-income countries need to be prepared to manage high levels of retiring nurses and review their reliance on foreign-trained nurses, strengthening bilateral agreements with the countries they recruit from.   </p><p>\"This report contains encouraging news, for which we congratulate the countries that are making progress,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “However, we cannot ignore the inequalities that mark the global nursing landscape. On International Nurses Day, I urge countries and partners to use this report as a signpost, showing us where we’ve come from, where we are now, and where we need to go – as rapidly as possible.”</p><h2>Key findings</h2><p><em>The State of the World’s Nursing 2025 (SoWN) report</em>, based on data reported by 194 countries through the National Health Workforce Accounts, shows a 33% increase in the number of countries reporting data since the last edition in 2020. It includes detailed country profiles now available for public access online. </p><p>The report reveals complex disparities between and among countries, regions and socio-economic contexts. The data and evidence are intended to support country-led dialogue to contextualize the findings into policies and actions.</p><p>“We welcome the SoWN 2025 report as an important milestone for monitoring progress on strengthening and supporting the nursing workforce towards global health goals,” said Pam Cipriano, President, International Council of Nurses. “The report clearly exposes the inequalities that are holding back the nursing profession and acting as a barrier to achieving universal health coverage (UHC). Delivering on UHC is dependent on truly recognizing the value of nurses and on harnessing the power and influence of nurses to act as catalysts of positive change in our health systems.”</p><p>Gender and equity remain central concerns in the nursing workforce. Women continue to dominate the profession, making up 85% of the global nursing workforce. </p><p>Findings suggest that 1 in 7 nurses worldwide – and 23% in high-income countries – are foreign-born, highlighting reliance on international migration. In contrast, the proportion is significantly lower in upper middle-income countries (8%), lower middle-income countries (1%), and low-income countries (3%).</p><p>Low-income countries are increasing nurse graduate numbers at a faster pace than high-income countries. In many countries, hard-earned gains in the graduation rate of nurses are not resulting in improved densities due to the faster pace of population growth and lower employment opportunities.  To address this, countries should create jobs to ensure graduates are hired and integrated into the health system and improve working conditions. </p><p>Age demographics and retirement trends reveal a mixed picture. The global nursing workforce is relatively young: 33% of nurses are aged under 35 years, compared with 19% who are expected to retire in the next 10 years. However, in 20 countries – mostly high-income – retirements are expected to outpace new entrants, raising concerns about nurse shortfalls, and having fewer experienced nurses to mentor early career nurses. </p><p>Around two thirds (62%) of countries reported the existence of advanced practice nursing roles – marking significant progress since 2020 (where only 53% reported advanced practice nursing roles).  These types of nurses have been shown to expand access to and quality of care in many different settings.  </p><p>The report also highlights improvements in nursing leadership: 82% of countries reported having a senior government nursing official to manage the nursing workforce. However, leadership development opportunities remain uneven. While 66% of countries report having such initiatives in place, only 25% of low-income countries offer structured leadership development.</p><p>Mental health and workforce well-being remain areas of concern. Only 42% of responding countries have provisions for nurses’ mental health support, despite increased workloads and trauma experienced during and since the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing this is essential to retain skilled professionals and ensure quality of care<strong>. </strong></p><h2>Policy priorities for 2026–2030</h2><p>The report introduces forward-looking policy priorities, calling on countries to:</p><ul><li>expand and equitably distribute nursing jobs, especially in underserved regions;</li><li>strengthen domestic education systems and align qualifications with defined roles;</li><li>improve working conditions, pay equity, and mental well-being support;</li><li>further develop nursing regulation and advanced practice nursing roles;</li><li>promote gender equity and protect nurses working in fragile, conflict-affected settings;</li><li>harness digital technologies and prepare nurses for climate-responsive care; and</li><li>advance nursing leadership and ensure leadership development opportunities are equitable. </li></ul><p>The evidence in the report provides an impetus for continued alignment to the policy priorities in the WHO <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240033863#:~:text=The%20WHO%20Global%20Strategic%20Directions%20for%20Nursing%20and,universal%20health%20coverage%20and%20other%20population%20health%20goals.\"></a><a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240033863\">Global Strategic Directions for Nursing and Midwifery 2021–2025</a>, and the actions recommended in the resolution submitted to the 78<sup>th</sup> World Health Assembly:  <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB156/B156_(27)-en.pdf\">Accelerating action on the health and care workforce by 2030</a>. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Note to editors:</strong></p><p>The <em>State of the World’s Nursing 2025</em> report presents the most contemporary evidence on the global nursing workforce, including education, employment, migration, regulation, working conditions, leadership and more.

    "content_html": "<p>A global report published by the World Health Organization (WHO) highlights that the underlying causes of ill health often stem from factors beyond the health sector, such as lack of quality housing, education and job opportunities. </p><p>The new <a href=\"/teams/social-determinants-of-health/equity-and-health/world-report-on-social-determinants-of-health-equity\">World report on social determinants of health equity</a> shows that such determinants can be responsible for a dramatic reduction of healthy life expectancy – sometimes by decades – in high- and low-income countries alike. For example, people in the country with the lowest life expectancy will, on average, live 33 years shorter than those born in the country with the highest life expectancy. The social determinants of health equity can influence people’s health outcomes more than genetic influences or access to health care.</p><p>“Our world is an unequal one. Where we are born, grow, live, work and age significantly influences our health and well-being,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “But change for the better is possible. This world report illustrates the importance of addressing the interlinked social determinants and provides evidence-based strategies and policy recommendations to help countries improve health outcomes for all.”</p><p>The report underscores that inequities in health are closely linked to degrees of social disadvantage and levels of discrimination. Health follows a social gradient whereby the more deprived the area in which people live, the lower their incomes are and they have fewer years of education, poorer health, with less number of healthy years to live. These inequities are exacerbated in populations that face discrimination and marginalization. One of the vivid examples is the fact that Indigenous Peoples have lower life expectancy than non-Indigenous Peoples in high- or low-income countries alike.</p><h2>Social injustice driving inequities</h2><p>The <em>World report on social determinants of health equity</em> is the first of its kind published since 2008 when the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health released its final report laying out targets for 2040 for reducing gaps between and within countries in life expectancy, childhood and maternal mortality. The 2025 world report, shows that these targets are likely to be missed.</p><p>Although data is scarce, there is sufficient evidence to show that health inequities within countries are often widening. WHO data cites that children born in poorer countries are 13 times more likely to die before the age of 5 than in wealthier countries. Modelling shows that the lives of 1.8 million children annually could be saved by closing the gap and enhancing equity between the poorest and wealthiest sectors of the population within low- and-middle-income countries.</p><p>The report shows that while there was a 40% decline in maternal mortality globally between 2000 and 2023, low- and lower-middle-income countries still account for 94% of maternal deaths.</p><p>Women from disadvantaged groups are more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes. In many high-income countries, racial and ethnic inequities in maternal death rates persist, for example, in some areas Indigenous women were up to three times more likely to die during childbirth. There are also strong associations between higher levels of gender inequality, including child marriage, and higher maternal mortality rates.</p><h2>Breaking the cycle</h2><p>WHO emphasizes that measures to address income inequality, structural discrimination, conflict and climate disruptions are key to overcoming deep-seated health inequities. Climate change, for example, is estimated to push an additional 68–135 million people into extreme poverty over the next 5 years.</p><p>Currently, 3.8 billion people worldwide are deprived of adequate social protection coverage, such as child/paid sick leave benefits, with direct and lasting impact on their health outcomes. High debt burdens have been crippling the capacity of governments to invest in these services, with the total value of interest payments made by the world’s 75 poorest countries increasing fourfold over the past decade. </p><p>WHO calls for collective action from national and local governments and leaders within health, academia, research, civil society, alongside the private sector to:</p><ul><li>address economic inequality and invest in social infrastructure and universal public services;</li><li>overcome structural discrimination and the determinants and impacts of conflicts, emergencies and forced migration;</li><li>manage the challenges and opportunities of climate action and the digital transformation to promote health equity co-benefits; and</li><li>promote governance arrangements that prioritize action on the social determinants of health equity, including maintaining cross-government policy platforms and strategies, allocating money, power and resources to the most local level where it can have greatest impact, and empowering community engagement and civil society.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Editor’s note</strong> </p><p>In resolution WHA74.16 (2021), the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly requested the WHO Director-General to prepare an updated report on the social determinants of health, their impact on health and health equity, progress made so far in addressing them, and recommendations for further action.

    "content_html": "<p>The <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://goarn.who.int/\">Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)</a>, an initiative coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO), marks its 25th anniversary today. Since its inception in April 2000, the network has been at the forefront of the global fight against health emergencies. By leveraging the expertise of global partners – facilitating alerts, deploying rapid support capacities, and strengthening capacities – it has significantly enhanced country-level operations and strengthened regional development, playing a critical role in health preparedness and response.</p><p>“GOARN is a vital part of the global health architecture,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Through the network, countries get the expert support they need to respond to health emergencies, and to enhance their own capacities for preparedness and response. This means faster, more effective responses and more lives saved.”</p><p>GOARN was created in response to the need for better coordination during global health emergencies. While many partner organizations were sending teams to assist during emergencies, there was a lack of coordination which hindered the overall effectiveness of these responses. It was also clear that no single institution could address all components of a response alone. GOARN was thus born following an international meeting organized by WHO in Geneva on 26–28 April 2000. Some 121 representatives from 67 partner institutions discussed the growing challenge of epidemic-prone and emerging diseases, and the urgent need to build a global network based on existing partnerships to address these threats.</p><p>In October 2000, GOARN played a key role in responding to the major Ebola outbreak in Gulu, Uganda – marking a significant milestone in what would evolve into a quarter-century of pivotal global health responses.</p><p>“As one of the first responders deployed during the Ebola outbreak in Uganda 25 years ago, I witnessed firsthand the evolution of our response efforts and GOARN’s role,” said Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme and Deputy Director-General of WHO.  “When I returned to Uganda earlier this year for another Ebola response, I was immensely proud to see how strong the national capacities have become, led by the Ministry of Health with the support of WHO and GOARN partners. GOARN is an example of how multilateralism works to save lives. To this day, I wear the orange GOARN lanyard alongside my blue WHO one to show my respect for and pride in this network.”</p><p>GOARN leverages the expertise of its partner institutions to address global health challenges. Operating as a unified international community, the network has responded swiftly and effectively to public health threats by deploying technical experts to ensure the right expertise is in the right place at the right time. GOARN's goal is to strengthen countries' capacities and help build strong, resilient systems for response to emergencies.</p><p>GOARN ensures that the experts are well-trained and equipped with the right skills before they’re deployed where they are needed most, fostering seamless collaboration for swift, coordinated, and impactful responses.</p><p>GOARN has now grown into a network of over 310 institutions, including national public health agencies, nongovernmental organizations, UN agencies, academic, and other technical organizations. GOARN has responded to over 175 public health emergencies in 114 countries, deploying more than 3645 international responders who integrate within national responses, collaborating with thousands of national professionals to strengthen and enhance local efforts. The network has tackled major global public health events, including outbreaks of SARS, Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease, COVID-19, mpox, cholera, yellow fever, disasters such as floods and earthquakes, and war. GOARN has deployed expertise in epidemiology, disease surveillance, case management, clinical care, infection prevention and control, risk communication and community engagement, and others. These efforts have also delivered hands-on training to hundreds of national teams, bolstering their immediate response capacity and long-term resilience.</p><p>\"Looking back over the past 25 years, it’s remarkable to see how GOARN has evolved from a visionary concept to an indispensable network in the global health emergency landscape,” said Ray R. Arthur, PhD, Director, Global Disease Detection Operations Center, CDC (retired) and Former Chair of the GOARN Steering Committee. “As an early participant in establishing the network and as former chair of the Steering Committee, I witnessed firsthand the commitment and collaboration that drove the network’s success. GOARN has not only facilitated rapid response to public health emergencies but has also been instrumental in strengthening global health, ensuring that countries are better prepared for the challenges of tomorrow. It’s an honour to see the network continue to grow and play such a vital role in protecting public health worldwide.\"</p><p>Today, GOARN is a vital pillar in the <a href=\"/emergencies/partners/global-health-emergency-corps\">Global Health Emergency Corps</a> ensuring a well-coordinated health emergency workforce, centered in countries and connected regionally and globally. The 25-year milestone marks a significant evolution of GOARN’s role in preparedness and response. Rather than deploying large numbers of international professionals across every field, GOARN now brings in only the necessary expertise to address critical gaps on the ground. Paired with the focus on capacity strengthening and training initiates, GOARN has demonstrated the effectiveness of its mandate and efforts empowering countries to manage emergencies themselves.</p><p>GOARN calls on all Member States, partners and the global community to continue working together to build a global health emergency architecture that is resilient, equitable, and capable of addressing future health challenges.<br/> </p><h2>Voices from GOARN, past and present</h2><p><strong>Dr Mohannad Al-Nsour, Executive Director, Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET), current Chair of the GOARN Steering Committee:</strong><br/>“As the world faces the growing threats of epidemics, conflict, and humanitarian crises, GOARN’s role has never been more vital.

    "content_html": "<p>On World Malaria Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for revitalized efforts at all levels, from global policy to community action, to accelerate progress towards malaria elimination. </p><p>In the late 1990s, world leaders laid the foundation for remarkable progress in global malaria control, including preventing more than 2 billion cases of malaria and nearly 13 million deaths since 2000. </p><p>To date, <a href=\"/teams/global-malaria-programme/elimination/countries-and-territories-certified-malaria-free-by-who\">WHO has certified 45 countries</a> and 1 territory as malaria-free, and many countries with a low burden of malaria continue to move steadily towards the goal of elimination. Of the remaining 83 malaria-endemic countries, 25 reported fewer than 10 cases of the disease in 2023. </p><p>However, as history has shown, these gains are fragile.</p><p>“The history of malaria teaches us a harsh lesson: when we divert our attention, the disease resurges, taking its greatest toll on the most vulnerable,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “But the same history also shows us what’s possible: with strong political commitment, sustained investment, multisectoral action and community engagement, malaria can be defeated.”</p><h2>Investments in new interventions drive progress</h2><p>Years of investment in the development and deployment of new malaria vaccines and next-generation tools to prevent and control malaria are paying off. </p><p>On World Malaria Day, Mali will join 19 other African countries in introducing malaria vaccines—a vital step towards protecting young children from one of the continent’s most deadly diseases. The large-scale rollout of malaria vaccines in Africa is expected to save tens of thousands of young lives every year. </p><p>Meanwhile, the expanded use of a  <a href=\"/news-room/feature-stories/detail/expanded-use-of-new-dual-insecticide-nets-offers-hope-for-malaria-control-efforts-in-africa\">new generation of insecticide-treated nets</a> is poised to lower the disease burden. According to the latest <em>World malaria report</em>, these new nets—which have greater impact against malaria than the standard pyrethroid-only nets—accounted for nearly 80% of all nets delivered in sub-Saharan Africa in 2023, up from 59% the previous year.</p><h2><strong>Progress against malaria under threat</strong></h2><p>Despite significant gains, malaria remains a major public health challenge, with nearly 600 000 lives lost to the disease in 2023 alone. The African Region is hardest hit, shouldering an estimated 95% of the malaria burden each year.</p><p>In many areas, progress has been hampered by fragile health systems and rising threats such as drug and insecticide resistance. Many at-risk groups continue to miss out on the services they need to prevent, detect and treat malaria. Climate change, conflict, poverty and population displacement are compounding these challenges.</p><p>WHO <a href=\"/news/item/11-04-2025-malaria-progress-in-jeopardy-amid-foreign-aid-cuts\">recently warned</a> that the 2025 funding cuts could further derail progress in many endemic countries, putting millions of additional lives at risk. Of the 64 WHO Country Offices in malaria-endemic countries that took part in a recent  <a href=\"/publications/m/item/the-impact-of-suspensions-and-reductions-in-health-official-development-assistance-on-health-systems\">WHO stock take assessment</a>, more than half reported moderate or severe disruptions to malaria services.</p><h2><strong>Renewed call to protect hard-won gains</strong></h2><p>World Malaria Day 2025 - under the theme, “Malaria ends with us: reinvest, reimagine, reignite” - is calling for stepped up political and financial commitment to protect the hard-won gains against malaria.<strong></strong></p><p>To <strong>reinvest</strong>, WHO joins partners and civil society in calling on malaria-endemic countries to boost domestic spending, particularly in primary health care, so that all at-risk populations can access the services they need to prevent, detect and treat malaria. The successful replenishments of the Global Fund and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, are also critical to financing malaria programmes and interventions, and accelerating progress towards the targets set in the WHO<em> </em><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240031357\"><em></em></a><em><a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240031357\">Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030.</a></em></p><p>Addressing current challenges in global malaria control will also require a<strong> reimagined</strong> response through innovative tools, strategies and partnerships. New and more effective antimalarial drugs are needed, as all well as advancements in service delivery, diagnostics, insecticides, vaccines and vector control methods.</p><p>More countries are making malaria control and elimination a national priority, including through the <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/malaria/mpac-documentation/malaria-conference-declaration-final.pdf\"></a><a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/malaria/mpac-documentation/malaria-conference-declaration-final.pdf?sfvrsn=2a67eb91_9\">Yaoundé Declaration, </a>signed in March 2024 by African Ministers of Health from 11 high burden countries. </p><p>“Ministers committed to strengthening their health systems, stepping up domestic resources, enhancing multisectoral action and ensuring a robust accountability mechanism,” notes Dr Daniel Ngamije, Director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme. “This is the kind of leadership the world must rally behind.”</p><p><strong>Reigniting</strong> commitment at all levels – from communities and frontline health workers to governments, researchers, the private sector innovators and donors – will be critical to curbing and, ultimately, ending malaria. <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Notes to the editor:</strong></p><p>For more information on the WHO World Malaria Day campaign, visit:  <a href=\"/campaigns/world-malaria-day/2025\">https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-malaria-day/2025 </a> </p><p> </p>",

          "Despite significant gains, malaria remains a major public health challenge, with nearly 600 000 lives lost to the disease in 2023 alone. The African Region is hardest hit, shouldering an estimated 95% of the malaria burden each year.",
          "In many areas, progress has been hampered by fragile health systems and rising threats such as drug and insecticide resistance. Many at-risk groups continue to miss out on the services they need to prevent, detect and treat malaria. Climate change, conflict, poverty and population displacement are compounding these challenges.",
          "WHO recently warned that the 2025 funding cuts could further derail progress in many endemic countries, putting millions of additional lives at risk. Of the 64 WHO Country Offices in malaria-endemic countries that took part in a recent WHO stock take assessment , more than half reported moderate or severe disruptions to malaria services."

          "World Malaria Day 2025 - under the theme, “Malaria ends with us: reinvest, reimagine, reignite” - is calling for stepped up political and financial commitment to protect the hard-won gains against malaria.",
          "To reinvest , WHO joins partners and civil society in calling on malaria-endemic countries to boost domestic spending, particularly in primary health care, so that all at-risk populations can access the services they need to prevent, detect and treat malaria. The successful replenishments of the Global Fund and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, are also critical to financing malaria programmes and interventions, and accelerating progress towards the targets set in the WHO Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030.",
          "Addressing current challenges in global malaria control will also require a reimagined response through innovative tools, strategies and partnerships. New and more effective antimalarial drugs are needed, as all well as advancements in service delivery, diagnostics, insecticides, vaccines and vector control methods.",
          "More countries are making malaria control and elimination a national priority, including through the Yaoundé Declaration, signed in March 2024 by African Ministers of Health from 11 high burden countries.",
          "“Ministers committed to strengthening their health systems, stepping up domestic resources, enhancing multisectoral action and ensuring a robust accountability mechanism,” notes Dr Daniel Ngamije, Director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme. “This is the kind of leadership the world must rally behind.”",
          "Reigniting commitment at all levels – from communities and frontline health workers to governments, researchers, the private sector innovators and donors – will be critical to curbing and, ultimately, ending malaria.",

    "content_html": "<p>Immunization efforts are under growing threat as misinformation, population growth, humanitarian crises and funding cuts jeopardize progress and leave millions of children, adolescents and adults at risk, warn WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi during World Immunization Week, 24–30 April.</p><p>Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, meningitis and yellow fever are rising globally, and diseases like diphtheria, that have long been held at bay or virtually disappeared in many countries, are at risk of re-emerging. In response, the agencies are calling for urgent and sustained political attention and investment to strengthen immunization programmes and protect significant progress achieved in reducing child mortality over the past 50 years.</p><p>“Vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives over the past five decades,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Funding cuts to global health have put these hard-won gains in jeopardy. Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases are increasing around the world, putting lives at risk and exposing countries to increased costs in treating diseases and responding to outbreaks. Countries with limited resources must invest in the highest-impact interventions – and that includes vaccines.”</p><h2>Rising outbreaks and strained health systems</h2><p>Measles is making an especially dangerous comeback. The number of cases has been increasing year on year since 2021, tracking the reductions in immunization coverage that occurred during and since the COVID-19 pandemic in many communities. Measles cases reached an estimated 10.3 million in 2023, a 20% increase compared to 2022. </p><p>The agencies warn that this upward trend likely continued into 2024 and 2025, as outbreaks have intensified around the world. In the past 12 months, 138 countries have reported measles cases, with 61 experiencing large or disruptive outbreaks – the highest number observed in any 12-month period since 2019.</p><p>Meningitis cases in Africa also rose sharply in 2024, and the upward trend has continued into 2025. In the first three months of this year alone, more than 5500 suspected cases and nearly 300 deaths were reported in 22 countries. This follows approximately 26 000 cases and almost 1400 deaths across 24 countries last year. </p><p>Yellow fever cases in the African region are also climbing, with 124 confirmed cases reported in 12 countries in 2024. This comes after dramatic declines in the disease over the past decade, thanks to global vaccine stockpiles and use of yellow fever vaccine in routine immunization programmes. In the WHO Region of the Americas, yellow fever outbreaks have been confirmed since the beginning of this year, with a total of 131 cases in 4 countries. </p><p>These outbreaks come amidst global funding cuts. A recent <a href=\"/publications/m/item/the-impact-of-suspensions-and-reductions-in-health-official-development-assistance-on-health-systems\">WHO rapid stock take</a> with 108 country offices of WHO – mostly in low- and lower-middle-income countries – shows that nearly half of those countries are facing moderate to severe disruptions to vaccination campaigns, routine immunization and access to supplies due to reduced donor funding. Disease surveillance, including for vaccine-preventable diseases, is also impacted in more than half of the countries surveyed.</p><p>At the same time, the number of children missing routine vaccinations has been increasing in recent years, even as countries make efforts to catch up children missed during the pandemic. In 2023, an estimated 14.5 million children missed all of their routine vaccine doses – up from 13.9 million in 2022 and 12.9 million in 2019. Over half of these children live in countries facing conflict, fragility, or instability, where access to basic health services is often disrupted. </p><p>“The global funding crisis is severely limiting our ability to vaccinate over 15 million vulnerable children in fragile and conflict-affected countries against measles,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Immunization services, disease surveillance, and the outbreak response in nearly 50 countries are already being disrupted – with setbacks at a similar level to what we saw during COVID-19. We cannot afford to lose ground in the fight against preventable diseases.”</p><p>Continued investment in the ‘Big Catch-Up initiative’, launched in 2023 to reach children who missed vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, and other routine immunization programmes will be critical.</p><h2>How immunization addresses these challenges</h2><p>Joint efforts by WHO, UNICEF, Gavi and partners have helped countries expand access to vaccines and strengthen immunization systems through primary health care, even in the face of mounting challenges. Every year, vaccines save nearly 4.2 million lives against 14 diseases – with nearly half of these lives saved in the African Region.</p><p>Vaccination campaigns have led to the elimination of meningitis A in Africa’s meningitis belt, while a new vaccine that protects against five strains of meningitis holds promise for broader protection, with efforts underway to expand its use for outbreak response and prevention.</p><p>Progress has also been made in reducing yellow fever cases and deaths through increasing routine immunization coverage and emergency vaccine stockpiles, but recent outbreaks in Africa and in the Region of the Americas highlight the risks in areas with no reported cases in the past, low routine vaccination coverage and gaps in preventive campaigns. </p><p>In addition, the past two years have seen substantial progress in other areas of immunization. In the African Region, which has the highest cervical cancer burden in the world, HPV vaccine coverage nearly doubled between 2020 and 2023 from 21% to 40%, reflecting a concerted global effort towards <a href=\"/initiatives/cervical-cancer-elimination-initiative\">eliminating cervical cancer</a>. The progress in immunization also includes increases in global coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, particularly in the South-East Asia Region, alongside introductions in Chad and Somalia, countries with high disease burden. </p><p>Another milestone is the sub-national introduction of malaria vaccines in nearly 20 African countries, laying the foundation to save half a million additional lives by 2035 as more countries adopt the vaccines and scale-up accelerates as part of the tools to fight malaria.</p><h2>Call to action</h2><p>UNICEF, WHO, and Gavi urgently call for parents, the public, and politicians to strengthen support for immunization. The agencies emphasize the need for sustained investment in vaccines and immunization programmes and urge countries to honour their commitments to the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030).</p><p>As part of integrated primary health-care systems, vaccination can protect against diseases and connect families to other essential care, such as antenatal care, nutrition or malaria screening. Immunization is a ‘best buy’ in health with a return on investment of $54 for every dollar invested and provides a foundation for future prosperity and health security. </p><p>“Increasing outbreaks of highly infectious diseases are a concern for the whole world. The good news is we can fight back, and Gavi’s next strategic period has a clear plan to bolster our defences by expanding investments in global vaccine stockpiles and rolling out targeted preventive vaccination in countries most impacted by meningitis, yellow fever and measles,” said Dr Sania Nishtar, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “These vital activities, however, will be at risk if Gavi is not fully funded for the next five years and we call on our donors to support our mission in the interests of keeping everyone, everywhere, safer from preventable diseases.”</p><p>Gavi’s upcoming high-level pledging summit taking place on 25 June 2025 seeks to raise at least US$ 9 billion from our donors to fund our ambitious strategy to protect 500 million children, saving at least 8 million lives from 2026–2030.</p><p>#####</p><p> </p><p><strong>Notes to editor:</strong></p><p>Download multimedia content here: <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AM4086M4S1G\">https://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AM4086M4S1G</a> </p><p><strong>About WHO</strong><br/>Dedicated to the health and well-being of all people and guided by science, the World Health Organization leads and champions global efforts to give everyone, everywhere, an equal chance at a safe and healthy life.

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) issues warning on health service disruptions reported in 70% of its surveyed country offices as a result of sudden suspensions and reductions in official development assistance (ODA) for health. </p><p>The findings, based on rapid WHO assessment of the fast-evolving situation, raise concern for potentially deeper and prolonged effects on health systems and services across the world, especially in vulnerable and fragile settings. This requires urgent action and international response.</p><p>The new rapid stock take<strong> </strong>conducted in March–April 2025 with 108 WHO country offices, primarily in low- and lower-middle-income countries, shows that many countries are working to increase or reallocate funding from domestic and alternative external sources to address gaps. However, up to 24% of WHO Country Office responses suggest budget cuts are already translating into increased out-of-pocket payments. The poor and vulnerable likely risk bearing the additional brunt of these impacts. </p><p>“These results paint a worrying picture about the impact of the sudden and unplanned cuts to aid on the health of millions of people,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Although these cuts are a shock, they are also driving an accelerated transition away from aid dependency to a more sustainable self-reliance, based on domestic resources. Many countries are asking for WHO’s support, and WHO is working with them to identify and tailor the most effective measures.” </p><p>The stock take reports<strong> </strong>provide an early snapshot and insights from WHO country offices that work closely with ministries of health, providing regular support on health systems policies and planning. The stock take aimed at identifying the urgent support countries need to avoid catastrophic impacts on the health of the populations and to guide monitoring of the rapidly evolving situation.  </p><p>Key findings from the stock take show the following. </p><ul><li>The suspensions and reductions in ODA are disrupting all health system functions, with the most frequently reported impacts being on health emergency preparedness and response (70%), public health surveillance (66%), service provision (58%), humanitarian aid (56%), and the health and care workforce (54%).</li><li>Health services are being disrupted across the board in at least one third of the responding countries, with high levels of disruptions reported in outbreak detection and response, malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, family planning, and maternal and child health services.</li><li>The nature and scale of service disruptions are comparable to those observed during the peak periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in some settings.  </li><li>Critical shortages in the availability of medicines and health products are leaving one third of responding countries without commodities for major service areas.</li><li>The pause in ODA has led to job losses for health and care workers in over half of responding countries, and significant disruptions to trainings. </li></ul><ul><li>Information systems are particularly impacted as key health data collection is disrupted. Over 40% of countries experienced disruptions to key information systems, including collaborative surveillance and emergency systems, health management information systems, disease-specific reporting systems, lab information systems, and household/population surveys.</li><li>Eighty-one of the 108 WHO country offices have expressed the need for support across a broad range of health areas, including innovative funding and resource mobilization, targeted technical assistance and support. </li></ul><p>Given the rapidly evolving context, WHO will be monitoring the situation over time and will engage the global health community, including partners and donor agencies, to inform urgent response plans to mitigate deepening country impacts and enable greater sustainability.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>Note to editors:</strong></p><p>These findings represent a snapshot of the health systems and health services situation in the context of a rapidly evolving situation. Senior WHO country office staff were surveyed over the period of 7 March to 2 April 2025 to provide inputs and observations on the impact of ODA suspensions and reductions through a structured survey. WHO country offices in low- and lower-middle-income countries across all six WHO regions were included in this survey. They do not reflect the official views of the governments in the countries, territories and areas. WHO has a global presence in 150+ locations putting central focus on countries and populations, working to protect and improve the health of everyone, everywhere. <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/about/structure\"></a><a href=\"/about/structure\">More information</a>. </p><p> </p>",

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) issues warning on health service disruptions reported in 70% of its surveyed country offices as a result of sudden suspensions and reductions in official development assistance (ODA) for health.",
          "The findings, based on rapid WHO assessment of the fast-evolving situation, raise concern for potentially deeper and prolonged effects on health systems and services across the world, especially in vulnerable and fragile settings. This requires urgent action and international response.",
          "The new rapid stock take conducted in March–April 2025 with 108 WHO country offices, primarily in low- and lower-middle-income countries, shows that many countries are working to increase or reallocate funding from domestic and alternative external sources to address gaps. However, up to 24% of WHO Country Office responses suggest budget cuts are already translating into increased out-of-pocket payments. The poor and vulnerable likely risk bearing the additional brunt of these impacts.",
          "“These results paint a worrying picture about the impact of the sudden and unplanned cuts to aid on the health of millions of people,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Although these cuts are a shock, they are also driving an accelerated transition away from aid dependency to a more sustainable self-reliance, based on domestic resources. Many countries are asking for WHO’s support, and WHO is working with them to identify and tailor the most effective measures.”",
          "The stock take reports provide an early snapshot and insights from WHO country offices that work closely with ministries of health, providing regular support on health systems policies and planning. The stock take aimed at identifying the urgent support countries need to avoid catastrophic impacts on the health of the populations and to guide monitoring of the rapidly evolving situation.",
          "Key findings from the stock take show the following.",
          "The suspensions and reductions in ODA are disrupting all health system functions, with the most frequently reported impacts being on health emergency preparedness and response (70%), public health surveillance (66%), service provision (58%), humanitarian aid (56%), and the health and care workforce (54%).",
          "Health services are being disrupted across the board in at least one third of the responding countries, with high levels of disruptions reported in outbreak detection and response, malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, family planning, and maternal and child health services.",
          "The nature and scale of service disruptions are comparable to those observed during the peak periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in some settings.",
          "Critical shortages in the availability of medicines and health products are leaving one third of responding countries without commodities for major service areas.",
          "The pause in ODA has led to job losses for health and care workers in over half of responding countries, and significant disruptions to trainings.",
          "Information systems are particularly impacted as key health data collection is disrupted. Over 40% of countries experienced disruptions to key information systems, including collaborative surveillance and emergency systems, health management information systems, disease-specific reporting systems, lab information systems, and household/population surveys.",
          "Eighty-one of the 108 WHO country offices have expressed the need for support across a broad range of health areas, including innovative funding and resource mobilization, targeted technical assistance and support.",
          "Given the rapidly evolving context, WHO will be monitoring the situation over time and will engage the global health community, including partners and donor agencies, to inform urgent response plans to mitigate deepening country impacts and enable greater sustainability.",
          "Note to editors:",
          "These findings represent a snapshot of the health systems and health services situation in the context of a rapidly evolving situation. Senior WHO country office staff were surveyed over the period of 7 March to 2 April 2025 to provide inputs and observations on the impact of ODA suspensions and reductions through a structured survey. WHO country offices in low- and lower-middle-income countries across all six WHO regions were included in this survey. They do not reflect the official views of the governments in the countries, territories and areas. WHO has a global presence in 150+ locations putting central focus on countries and populations, working to protect and improve the health of everyone, everywhere. More information ."

    "content_html": "<p> </p><p>The 41<sup>st</sup> meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the<strong> </strong>international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO Director-General on 6 March 2025 with committee members and advisers meeting via video conference with affected countries, supported by the WHO Secretariat.  The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in the context of the global target of interruption and certification of WPV1 eradication by 2027 and interruption and certification of cVDPV2 elimination by 2029. Technical updates were received about the situation in the following countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), Djibouti, Ethiopia, Germany, Pakistan, Poland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. </p><h2><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Wild poliovirus</strong></h2><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Since the last Emergency Committee meeting, 36 new WPV1 cases were reported, three from Afghanistan and 33 from Pakistan bringing the total to 99 WPV1 cases in 2024 and three in 2025. This represents more than four-fold increase in Afghanistan and more than 12-fold increase in Pakistan in the number of WPV1 cases from 2023 to 2024.  A total of 741 WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported in 2024, 113 from Afghanistan and 628 from Pakistan. In 2025, 80 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported, 9 from Afghanistan and 71 from Pakistan.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The upward trend in WPV1 cases and environmental detections has persisted in both endemic countries throughout 2024. In Pakistan, this increase has been evident since mid-2023, initially in environmental samples and later in paralytic polio cases, primarily in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Sindh, and Balochistan. In Afghanistan, the rise in WPV1 detections, both in environmental samples and cases during 2024 has been predominantly in the South Region. The Committee noted the geographic spread of WPV1 to new provinces and districts in both endemic countries in 2024 and observed that WPV1 transmission has re-established in historical reservoirs, including Kandahar (Afghanistan), Peshawar, Karachi, and Quetta Block (Pakistan). Currently, the most intense WPV1 transmission is occurring in the southern cross-border epidemiological corridor, encompassing Quetta Block (Pakistan) and the South Region (Afghanistan). The Committee also noted the ongoing WPV1 transmission in the epidemiologically critical South KP and Central Pakistan blocks of Pakistan.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Review of the molecular epidemiology indicates that there has been progressive elimination of the genetic cluster ‘YB3C’ in 2022 and 2023, with its last detection in November 2023 in Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. However, there has been persistent transmission of YB3A genetic cluster since May 2022, resulting in its split into two: YB3A4A and YB3A4B. During the first half of 2024, the cluster YB3A4A was mainly circulating in the northern and southern cross-border corridors. During the second half of 2024 there was distinct expansion of both these genetic clusters seen in Pakistan, more pronounced for YB3A4A. In Afghanistan, the predominantly circulating genetic cluster in YB3A4A.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Both Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to implement an intensive and mostly synchronized campaign schedule focusing on improved vaccination coverage in the endemic zones and effective and timely response to WPV1 detections elsewhere in each country. Afghanistan implemented five sub-national vaccination rounds during the second half of 2024, targeting infected and high-risk provinces, while Pakistan implemented two nationwide and a large scale sub-national vaccination round from September through December 2024. After encouraging progress towards implementing house-to-house campaigns in all of Afghanistan during the first half of 2024, Afghanistan programme has not been able to implement house-to-house campaigns during most of the second half of 2024. All vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan since October 2024 have been implemented using alternate modalities (mostly site-to-site). The committee was concerned that site-to-site campaigns are usually not able to reach all the children, especially those of younger age and girls, which may lead to a further upsurge of WPV1 with geographical spread in Afghanistan and beyond. Afghanistan programme is taking measures to maximize the reach of site-to-site campaigns through adequate operational and social mobilization measures. The Committee noted overall high reported coverage of the vaccination campaigns in Pakistan; however, variations were observed about the quality at the sub-provincial and sub-district levels, relating to operational implementation challenges and increasing insecurity, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. Nearly 200 000 and 50 000 missed children were reported from the South KP and Quetta Block (Balochistan) in Pakistan at the end of October and December 2024 campaigns.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In addition to seasonal movement patterns within and between the two endemic countries, the continued return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan compounds the challenges faced. The scale of the displacement increases the risk of cross-border poliovirus spread as well as spread within both the countries.  This risk is being managed and mitigated in both countries through vaccination at border crossing points and the updating of micro-plans in the districts of origin and return. The programme continues to closely coordinate with IOM and UNHCR. The Committee noted ongoing coordination between the programmes of Afghanistan and Pakistan at the national and sub-national levels.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In summary, the available data indicate that globally transmission of WPV1 is geographically limited to the two WPV1 endemic countries; however, there has been geographical spread and intensifying transmission within the two endemic countries in 2024.</span></p><h2>Circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV)</h2><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In 2024, there have been 280 cVDPV cases, of which 265 are cVDPV2, 11 cVDPV1 and four are cVDPV3. Additionally, 257 environmental samples were positive for cVDPV, 254 positive cVDPV2 and three cVDPV3. Of the 265 cVDPV2 cases in 2024, 94 (36%) have occurred in Nigeria. Of the 11 cVDPV1 cases in 2024, 10 were reported from DR Congo and one from Mozambique. All the four cVDPV3 cases in 2024 were reported from Guinea.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> A total of 528 cases have been confirmed with cVDPV in all of 2023, of which 395 are cVDPV2 and 134 are cVDPV1 (one case co-infected with cVDPV1 and cVDPV2). Of the 528 cVDPV cases reported in 2023, 226 (43%) have occurred in the DR Congo.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Since the last meeting of the Emergency Committee, new cVDPV2 detections were reported from Finland, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and new cVDPV3 detections from Guinea.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In 2024, the total number of circulating cVDPV2 emergence groups detected to date is 26, compared to 27 in 2023, 22 in 2022, 29 in 2021, 36 in 2020, and 44 in 2019. Of the 26 emergence groups circulating in 2024, eleven are newly detected in 2024, 10 derived from the novel OPV2 vaccine. There have now been 25 nOPV2 derived cVDPV2 emergences since 2021. The committee noted that the nOPV2 vaccine continues to demonstrate significantly higher genetic stability and substantially lower likelihood of reversion to neurovirulence relative to Sabin OPV2.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">A total of 11 cVDPV1 cases have been reported in 2024, 10 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and one in Mozambique. This compares to 134 cVDPV1 cases in all of 2023 (106 in Democratic Republic of the Congo, 24 in Madagascar, four in Mozambique), representing a 92% reduction in the global cVDPV1 paralytic burden from 2023. However, one new emergence has been reported from the Tshopo province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC-TSH-3). This is the first cVDPV1 emergence reported since September 2022. The committed noted encouraging progress in Madagascar towards interrupting local cVDPV1 transmission, with no detections for more than 16 months.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In 2024, two countries reported cVDPV3 outbreaks: French Guiana (French territory in South America) and Guinea. Both cVDPV3 outbreaks in 2024 were due to new emergences, leading to three positive environmental samples in French Guiana (May to August 2024) and four cVDPV3 cases in Guinea (July to November 2024). The committee noted that these cVDPV3 outbreaks were reported after a significant interval, with the last cVDPV3 outbreak reported in March 2022.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In 2024, DR Congo and Mozambique reported co-circulation of cVDPV1 and cVDPV2, while Guinea detected co-circulation of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee noted that the risk of cVDPV outbreaks is largely driven by a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, high concentrations of zero-dose and under-immunized children, and ongoing population displacement.</span></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended extending the Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. In reaching this conclusion, the Committee considered the following factors:</span></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Ongoing risk of WPV1 international spread:</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">  </span></p><p>Based on the following factors, there remains the risk of international spread of WPV1:</p><ul><li>Intensifying WPV1 transmission with geographical spread into formerly endemic areas and core reservoirs of Afghanistan (South) and Pakistan (Karachi, Peshawar, Quetta Block) as well as other epidemiologically critical areas like Central Pakistan, and parts of Punjab province in Pakistan that were without any WPV1 detection for prolonged periods of time.</li><li>That WPV1 transmission has been re-established in the south region of Afghanistan and Karachi, and Quetta Block of Pakistan.</li><li>This intensifying WPV1 transmission in both endemic countries during the low transmission season indicates sizeable cohort of unimmunized and under-immunized children.</li><li>Lack of house-to-house vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan represents a major risk of further WPV1 spread and intensification of its transmission.</li><li>Certain geographies and population pockets in the epidemiologically critical areas of Pakistan continue to have inconsistent campaign quality and substantial number of unimmunized and under-immunized children due to insecurity, operational gaps, and vaccine hesitancy.</li><li>Ongoing population movement between the two endemic countries, including the returnees from Pakistan to Afghanistan, leading to cross-border WPV1 transmission.</li><li>Ongoing population movement from the two endemic countries to other countries, neighbouring and distant.</li></ul><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Ongoing risk of cVDPV international spread</span><strong>:</strong></p><p>Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of cVDPV appears to remain high:</p><ul><li>Ongoing cross border spread including into newly re-infected countries and territories.</li><li>Continued cVDPV2 transmission in the critical areas of Nigeria, with 36% of the global cVDPV2 cases in 2024 and its potential to amplify the transmission.</li><li>The cVDPV2 transmission in the Horn of Africa seems to be intensifying, particularly in Ethiopia. The Horn of Africa countries continue to face humanitarian and health emergencies making it challenging to implement high-quality vaccination campaigns in a timely manner.</li><li>There is a large pool of unimmunized susceptible children in the Northern Governorates of Yemen. There are challenges regarding timely shipping of AFP stool specimens from northern Yemen.</li><li>The widening gap in population intestinal mucosal immunity in young children since the withdrawal of OPV2 in 2016, as well as high concentration of zero dose children in certain areas.</li><li>Despite the decreasing number of cVDPV1 cases, a new emergence was detected in DR Congo in 2024, indicating a population immunity gap.</li><li>Resurgence of cVDPV3 after more than two years, infecting French Guiana and Guinea.<p>Contributing factors include:</p></li><li>Sub-optimal routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by humanitarian emergencies including conflict and protracted complex emergencies. This poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to polio outbreaks. </li><li>Ongoing insecurity and conflict in many areas that are the source of cVDPV transmission.</li><li>Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in northern Yemen and Somalia which have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for extended periods of more than a year.</li><li>The current resource-constrained environment further challenges the full and effective implementation of critical eradication activities.               </li></ul><p><strong>Risk categories</strong></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:</span></p><ol><li>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3.</li><li>States infected with cVDPV2, with or without evidence of local transmission.</li><li style=\"text-align:left;\">States previously infected by WPV1 or cVDPV within the last 24 months.</li></ol><p>Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:</p><ul><li>Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.</li><li>Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period.</li><li>These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps.</li></ul><p>Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will remain on a ‘watch list’ for a further 12 months for a period of heightened monitoring.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations. </p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">TEMPORARY RECOMMENDATIONS</span></strong></p><p><strong>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread </strong></p><p><em>(as of data available at WHO HQ on 20 February 2025)</em></p><p><strong>WPV1</strong>                                                                                                                                  <strong>        </strong></p><p>Afghanistan                            most recent detection 27 Jan 2025</p><p>Pakistan                                  most recent detection 30 Jan 2025</p><p><strong>cVDPV1</strong></p><p>Mozambique                           most recent detection 17 May 2024</p><p>DR Congo                               most recent detection 19 Sep 2024</p><p><strong>cVDPV3</strong></p><p>French Guiana (France)       most recent detection 06 Aug 2024</p><p>Guinea                                  most recent detection 21 Nov 2024</p><p>These countries should:</p><ul><li>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.</li><li>Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">&gt;</span> four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.</li><li>Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers.</li><li>Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.</li><li>Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (road, air and / or sea).</li><li>Further enhance cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional, and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.</li><li>Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication. Countries which have not yet introduced IPV2 into their schedules should urgently implement this. Once available, countries should also consider introducing the hexavalent vaccine, now approved by Gavi. </li><li>Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high-quality eradication activities in all infected and high-risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected.</li><li>Provide to the Director-General a regular report on the

style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Additional considerations</span></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"></span>The Committee noted that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative needs to reconsider its priorities and reprogram its operations in response to the current fiscal constraints. The current financial shortfall poses a significant risk to eradication efforts. The Committee acknowledges and appreciates the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s recent confirmation of its $500 million commitment to global polio eradication. The committee urged donor countries and organizations to enhance their financial support, emphasizing that failure is not an option. The Committee also called on national governments to prioritize polio eradication in their domestic funding allocations to ensure sustained progress toward eradication.</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee expressed deep concern over the escalating and expanding WPV1 transmission in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The persistence of WPV1 transmission despite ongoing vaccination campaigns highlights gaps in immunization quality. The Committee also noted that the current levels of WPV1 transmission during the low season could further intensify during the high transmission season if uniform, high-quality campaigns, particularly in core reservoir areas, are not ensured.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee remains concerned about the continued inability to conduct house-to-house vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan. This challenge places infants and young children, particularly girls, at a heightened risk of missing polio vaccination. The Committee appreciates the efforts to improve women’s participation in site-to-site polio vaccination as well as for border vaccination and encourages to expand these efforts to high-risk South Region of Afghanistan.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee acknowledged the strong political commitment to polio eradication in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Committee emphasized that this commitment must translate into concrete operational actions to strengthen community engagement and implement high-quality vaccination campaigns. These efforts are essential to interrupt the ongoing intense WPV1 transmission and mitigate the risk of national and international spread. In Afghanistan. The Committee specifically recommended the resumption of house-to-house vaccination campaigns and the recruitment of additional female vaccinators to enhance community acceptance and improve coverage.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee is encouraged by the improving cVDPV1</span><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> </strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">situation in the African Region, particularly in Madagascar, which has not reported any cases for over 16 months. The Committee emphasized the need to sustain high-quality vaccination efforts, particularly in the DR Congo and Mozambique, the only two countries that have reported cVDPV1 cases in 2024.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee noted the ongoing transmission of cVDPV2 in the African Region, particularly in northern Nigeria. While there has been an overall decline in cVDPV2 cases in 2024, the Committee expressed concern over the increase in cases reported by Angola, Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Yemen compared to 2023. The Committee also noted the concerning cVDPV2 epidemiological situation in Chad and Algeria and recommended the implementation of high-quality vaccination campaigns to boost population immunity. The Committee noted the challenges in implementing high-quality immunization responses in critical areas of the African Region and northern Yemen. Additionally, the Committee expressed concerns over surveillance gaps in northern Yemen, which may further hinder early detection and response efforts.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee noted the detection of cVDPV3 in Guinea and French Guiana in 2024, after more than two years with no reported detections globally and emphasized the need for a high-quality surveillance and immunization response to contain these outbreaks.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee noted that several cVDPV-affected countries continue to face conflict and insecurity, which disrupts both routine immunization and polio vaccination campaigns. The Committee also noted that ongoing health emergencies and disease outbreaks in several countries further complicate the timely and effective implementation of polio vaccination campaigns. Given the diverse challenges across countries and sub-national areas, the Committee emphasized the need for context-specific, tailored interventions to ensure high-quality campaigns and ultimately stop cVDPV outbreaks. The Committee also underscored the importance of synchronized sub-regional approaches and strong cross-border coordination to address challenges related to permeable borders and shared operational constraints across affected countries.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee noted some good practices in several countries, particularly in cross-border collaboration and surveillance. The Committee encourages countries to document and share these best practices and suggests that GPEI facilitates this process.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee noted the ongoing cross-border spread of cVDPV2 in the African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, as well as the recent detection of cVDPV2 in five countries of the European Region. This reinforces that polio remains a global risk until it is fully eradicated. The Committee acknowledged the ongoing response efforts of Finland, Germany, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in strengthening surveillance and addressing sub-national immunity gaps. The Committee also appreciated the inter-country coordination in the European Region, facilitated by the WHO European Regional Office, in response to the cVDPV2 detections in the region. The Committee recommended continued surveillance strengthening across the European Region, along with regular risk assessments to ensure timely identification and mitigation of emerging polio risks.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee highlighted the importance of maintaining sensitive surveillance in polio-infected and high-risk countries and recommended that GPEI provide all possible support under the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan. The Committee also underscored the importance of high-income countries maintaining high-quality surveillance for polioviruses, given the ongoing risk of importation, as recently demonstrated by cVDPV detections in the European Region. Robust surveillance remains essential for early detection and timely response to importations and newly emerging outbreaks.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee noted that novel OPV2 continues to demonstrate greater genetic stability compared to Sabin OPV2. However, the risk of new cVDPV2 emergences increases when the interval between outbreak response campaigns exceeds four weeks or when vaccination quality is suboptimal, underscoring the need for timely and high-quality immunization efforts.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee noted that the amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) through resolution WHA77.17 (2024), were notified to States Parties on 19 September 2024 and that they would come into effect on 19 September 2025 for 192 States Parties.  Regarding any potential effects of these amendments on the Committee, the Secretariat informed the Committee that it would be premature to assess any such effects at this time but would brief the Committee ahead of their entry into force in September 2025, should the Committee continue to be convened under the IHR at this time.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPVs, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment, and on 09 April 2025 determined that the poliovirus situation continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States previously infected by WPV1 or cVDPV within the last 24 months’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective, 9 April 2025.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

          "Since the last Emergency Committee meeting, 36 new WPV1 cases were reported, three from Afghanistan and 33 from Pakistan bringing the total to 99 WPV1 cases in 2024 and three in 2025. This represents more than four-fold increase in Afghanistan and more than 12-fold increase in Pakistan in the number of WPV1 cases from 2023 to 2024.  A total of 741 WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported in 2024, 113 from Afghanistan and 628 from Pakistan. In 2025, 80 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported, 9 from Afghanistan and 71 from Pakistan.",
          "The upward trend in WPV1 cases and environmental detections has persisted in both endemic countries throughout 2024. In Pakistan, this increase has been evident since mid-2023, initially in environmental samples and later in paralytic polio cases, primarily in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Sindh, and Balochistan. In Afghanistan, the rise in WPV1 detections, both in environmental samples and cases during 2024 has been predominantly in the South Region. The Committee noted the geographic spread of WPV1 to new provinces and districts in both endemic countries in 2024 and observed that WPV1 transmission has re-established in historical reservoirs, including Kandahar (Afghanistan), Peshawar, Karachi, and Quetta Block (Pakistan). Currently, the most intense WPV1 transmission is occurring in the southern cross-border epidemiological corridor, encompassing Quetta Block (Pakistan) and the South Region (Afghanistan). The Committee also noted the ongoing WPV1 transmission in the epidemiologically critical South KP and Central Pakistan blocks of Pakistan.",
          "Review of the molecular epidemiology indicates that there has been progressive elimination of the genetic cluster ‘YB3C’ in 2022 and 2023, with its last detection in November 2023 in Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. However, there has been persistent transmission of YB3A genetic cluster since May 2022, resulting in its split into two: YB3A4A and YB3A4B. During the first half of 2024, the cluster YB3A4A was mainly circulating in the northern and southern cross-border corridors. During the second half of 2024 there was distinct expansion of both these genetic clusters seen in Pakistan, more pronounced for YB3A4A. In Afghanistan, the predominantly circulating genetic cluster in YB3A4A.",
          "Both Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to implement an intensive and mostly synchronized campaign schedule focusing on improved vaccination coverage in the endemic zones and effective and timely response to WPV1 detections elsewhere in each country. Afghanistan implemented five sub-national vaccination rounds during the second half of 2024, targeting infected and high-risk provinces, while Pakistan implemented two nationwide and a large scale sub-national vaccination round from September through December 2024. After encouraging progress towards implementing house-to-house campaigns in all of Afghanistan during the first half of 2024, Afghanistan programme has not been able to implement house-to-house campaigns during most of the second half of 2024. All vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan since October 2024 have been implemented using alternate modalities (mostly site-to-site). The committee was concerned that site-to-site campaigns are usually not able to reach all the children, especially those of younger age and girls, which may lead to a further upsurge of WPV1 with geographical spread in Afghanistan and beyond. Afghanistan programme is taking measures to maximize the reach of site-to-site campaigns through adequate operational and social mobilization measures. The Committee noted overall high reported coverage of the vaccination campaigns in Pakistan; however, variations were observed about the quality at the sub-provincial and sub-district levels, relating to operational implementation challenges and increasing insecurity, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. Nearly 200 000 and 50 000 missed children were reported from the South KP and Quetta Block (Balochistan) in Pakistan at the end of October and December 2024 campaigns.",
          "In addition to seasonal movement patterns within and between the two endemic countries, the continued return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan compounds the challenges faced. The scale of the displacement increases the risk of cross-border poliovirus spread as well as spread within both the countries.  This risk is being managed and mitigated in both countries through vaccination at border crossing points and the updating of micro-plans in the districts of origin and return. The programme continues to closely coordinate with IOM and UNHCR. The Committee noted ongoing coordination between the programmes of Afghanistan and Pakistan at the national and sub-national levels.",
          "In summary, the available data indicate that globally transmission of WPV1 is geographically limited to the two WPV1 endemic countries; however, there has been geographical spread and intensifying transmission within the two endemic countries in 2024."

          "The Committee noted that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative needs to reconsider its priorities and reprogram its operations in response to the current fiscal constraints. The current financial shortfall poses a significant risk to eradication efforts. The Committee acknowledges and appreciates the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s recent confirmation of its $500 million commitment to global polio eradication. The committee urged donor countries and organizations to enhance their financial support, emphasizing that failure is not an option. The Committee also called on national governments to prioritize polio eradication in their domestic funding allocations to ensure sustained progress toward eradication.",
          "The Committee expressed deep concern over the escalating and expanding WPV1 transmission in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The persistence of WPV1 transmission despite ongoing vaccination campaigns highlights gaps in immunization quality. The Committee also noted that the current levels of WPV1 transmission during the low season could further intensify during the high transmission season if uniform, high-quality campaigns, particularly in core reservoir areas, are not ensured.",
          "The Committee remains concerned about the continued inability to conduct house-to-house vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan. This challenge places infants and young children, particularly girls, at a heightened risk of missing polio vaccination. The Committee appreciates the efforts to improve women’s participation in site-to-site polio vaccination as well as for border vaccination and encourages to expand these efforts to high-risk South Region of Afghanistan.",
          "The Committee acknowledged the strong political commitment to polio eradication in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Committee emphasized that this commitment must translate into concrete operational actions to strengthen community engagement and implement high-quality vaccination campaigns. These efforts are essential to interrupt the ongoing intense WPV1 transmission and mitigate the risk of national and international spread. In Afghanistan. The Committee specifically recommended the resumption of house-to-house vaccination campaigns and the recruitment of additional female vaccinators to enhance community acceptance and improve coverage.",
          "The Committee is encouraged by the improving cVDPV1 situation in the African Region, particularly in Madagascar, which has not reported any cases for over 16 months. The Committee emphasized the need to sustain high-quality vaccination efforts, particularly in the DR Congo and Mozambique, the only two countries that have reported cVDPV1 cases in 2024.",
          "The Committee noted the ongoing transmission of cVDPV2 in the African Region, particularly in northern Nigeria. While there has been an overall decline in cVDPV2 cases in 2024, the Committee expressed concern over the increase in cases reported by Angola, Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Yemen compared to 2023. The Committee also noted the concerning cVDPV2 epidemiological situation in Chad and Algeria and recommended the implementation of high-quality vaccination campaigns to boost population immunity. The Committee noted the challenges in implementing high-quality immunization responses in critical areas of the African Region and northern Yemen. Additionally, the Committee expressed concerns over surveillance gaps in northern Yemen, which may further hinder early detection and response efforts.",
          "The Committee noted the detection of cVDPV3 in Guinea and French Guiana in 2024, after more than two years with no reported detections globally and emphasized the need for a high-quality surveillance and immunization response to contain these outbreaks.",
          "The Committee noted that several cVDPV-affected countries continue to face conflict and insecurity, which disrupts both routine immunization and polio vaccination campaigns. The Committee also noted that ongoing health emergencies and disease outbreaks in several countries further complicate the timely and effective implementation of polio vaccination campaigns. Given the diverse challenges across countries and sub-national areas, the Committee emphasized the need for context-specific, tailored interventions to ensure high-quality campaigns and ultimately stop cVDPV outbreaks. The Committee also underscored the importance of synchronized sub-regional approaches and strong cross-border coordination to address challenges related to permeable borders and shared operational constraints across affected countries.",
          "The Committee noted some good practices in several countries, particularly in cross-border collaboration and surveillance. The Committee encourages countries to document and share these best practices and suggests that GPEI facilitates this process.",
          "The Committee noted the ongoing cross-border spread of cVDPV2 in the African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, as well as the recent detection of cVDPV2 in five countries of the European Region. This reinforces that polio remains a global risk until it is fully eradicated. The Committee acknowledged the ongoing response efforts of Finland, Germany, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in strengthening surveillance and addressing sub-national immunity gaps. The Committee also appreciated the inter-country coordination in the European Region, facilitated by the WHO European Regional Office, in response to the cVDPV2 detections in the region. The Committee recommended continued surveillance strengthening across the European Region, along with regular risk assessments to ensure timely identification and mitigation of emerging polio risks.",
          "The Committee highlighted the importance of maintaining sensitive surveillance in polio-infected and high-risk countries and recommended that GPEI provide all possible support under the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan. The Committee also underscored the importance of high-income countries maintaining high-quality surveillance for polioviruses, given the ongoing risk of importation, as recently demonstrated by cVDPV detections in the European Region. Robust surveillance remains essential for early detection and timely response to importations and newly emerging outbreaks.",
          "The Committee noted that novel OPV2 continues to demonstrate greater genetic stability compared to Sabin OPV2. However, the risk of new cVDPV2 emergences increases when the interval between outbreak response campaigns exceeds four weeks or when vaccination quality is suboptimal, underscoring the need for timely and high-quality immunization efforts.",
          "The Committee noted that the amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) through resolution WHA77.17 (2024), were notified to States Parties on 19 September 2024 and that they would come into effect on 19 September 2025 for 192 States Parties.  Regarding any potential effects of these amendments on the Committee, the Secretariat informed the Committee that it would be premature to assess any such effects at this time but would brief the Committee ahead of their entry into force in September 2025, should the Committee continue to be convened under the IHR at this time.",
          "Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPVs, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment, and on 09 April 2025 determined that the poliovirus situation continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States previously infected by WPV1 or cVDPV within the last 24 months’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective, 9 April 2025."

Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.",
      "Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication. Countries which have not yet introduced IPV2 into their schedules should urgently implement this. Once available, countries should also consider introducing the hexavalent vaccine, now approved by Gavi.",
      "Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high-quality eradication activities in all infected and high-risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected.",
      "Provide to the Director-General a regular report on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel.",
      "Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the prevention or interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency.",
      "Undertake urgent and intensive investigations and risk assessment to determine if there has been local transmission of the imported cVDPV2, requiring an immunization response.",
      "Noting the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections, Members States should request vaccines from the global novel OPV2 stockpile.",
      "Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication. Countries which have not yet introduced IPV2 into their schedules should urgently implement this. Once available, countries should also consider introducing the hexavalent vaccine, now approved by Gavi.",

      "Encourage residents and long­term visitors ( > four weeks) to receive a dose of IPV four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel.",
      "Ensure that travelers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status.",
      "Intensify regional cooperation and cross­border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus, and vaccinate refugees, travelers and cross­border populations.",
      "Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without the detection of circulation of VDPV2 in the country from any source, and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the criteria of a ‘state no longer infected’.",
      "At the end of 12 months without evidence of transmission, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.",
      "Urgently strengthen routine immunization to boost population immunity.",
      "Enhance surveillance quality, including considering introducing or expanding supplementary methods such as environmental surveillance, to reduce the risk of undetected WPV1 and cVDPV transmission, particularly among high-risk and vulnerable populations.",
      "Intensify efforts to ensure vaccination of mobile and cross­border populations, Internally Displaced Persons, refugees, and other vulnerable groups.",
      "Enhance regional cooperation and cross border coordination to ensure prompt detection of WPV1 and cVDPV, and vaccination of high-risk population groups.",

          "“Polaris demonstrated the critical importance of cultivating trust before a crisis occurs,” said Dr Soha Albayat from Qatar. “The foundation of our collaborative efforts is significantly stronger than in years past. We've moved beyond reactive measures, and are now proactively anticipating, aligning, and coordinating our cross-border emergency response plans.”",
          "“The Global Health Emergency Corps has evolved into a powerful platform, building on practice, trust and connection,” said Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme. “Exercise Polaris showed what is possible when countries operate with urgency and unity supported by well-connected partners. It is a strong signal that we are collectively more ready than we were.”",
          "At a time when multilateralism is under pressure and preparedness is often framed through a national lens, Exercise Polaris reaffirmed that health is a global issue."

Advancements in treatments mean that more people are likely to be living with immunocompromised conditions, which also could mean increases in cases of invasive fungal diseases.

These meetings are timed to balance the availability of the latest epidemiological, immunological, and virological data, with the kinetics of vaccine-induced protection and the lead time manufacturers need to update the antigen composition of authorized COVID-19 vaccines. </p><p>The purpose of this statement is to guide the scientific community and vaccine manufacturers as to which data should be generated ahead of the May 2025 TAG-CO-VAC deliberations. It is an update to the previous statement on the types of data requested in October 2024.<sup>1</sup> </p><p>To inform decisions on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition,<sup>2-6</sup> the TAG-CO-VAC reviews data (see Table) on the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the antigenic characteristics of previously and currently circulating variants. This includes the analysis of animal antisera following primary infection or vaccination in one-way and two-way neutralization tests, as well as immunogenicity data that assess the breadth and durability of immune responses, including neutralizing antibody responses, using sera from sequentially immunized or infected animals and pre-and post-vaccination human sera. The TAG-CO-VAC also considers vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates of currently approved COVID-19 vaccines, particularly those that control for time since vaccination and that provide variant-specific estimates across different vaccine platforms for protection against any infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease. Further examples of published data reviewed by TAG-CO-VAC and used to inform decisions on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition can be found in the annexes accompanying each of the previous statements.<sup>2-6</sup></p><p>In addition, the TAG-CO-VAC reviews available data from vaccine manufacturers, including animal and human studies demonstrating the breadth and durability of immune responses elicited by currently authorized vaccines, as well as any vaccine candidates in development. For vaccine candidates in development, the TAG-CO-VAC highlights the utility of clinical immunogenicity data for decision-making on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. The TAG-CO-VAC also notes that comparable immunogenicity data (i.e. to the same variants) from previous vaccine compositions are especially useful. Vaccine manufacturers are also asked to provide observational epidemiological data that demonstrate the efficacy or effectiveness of their authorized COVID-19 vaccines, as well as any vaccine candidates in development. </p><p>At this stage, the key antisera and antigens of interest for the May 2025 decision-making meeting for demonstrating breadth include antisera to: BA.2 <em>(other historical reference viruses – e.g., index virus, Alpha, BA.1 – are also useful for determining antigenic relationships),</em> XBB.1.5, JN.1, KP.2, XEC, LP.8.1, LF.7.2 and potentially emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Antisera of interest are animal sera after single or sequential exposure and human sera after a boost with monovalent JN.1, KP.2 or XBB.1.5 vaccines. Both pre- and post-vaccination sera should be included and, for all antisera, neutralizing antibody titers should be analyzed against at least one variant that emerged after the vaccine antigen, where feasible. Analysis of these antisera against the same panel of virus antigens as well as other new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants will provide insight into antigenic characteristics of previous and emerging variants.

          "The WHO Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) continues to closely monitor the genetic and antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination, and the performance of COVID-19 vaccines against circulating variants. Based on these evaluations, WHO advises vaccine manufacturers and regulatory authorities on the implications for future updates to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. The next decision-making meeting of the TAG-CO-VAC is scheduled for May 2025, after which a statement on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition and an accompanying data annex will be published on the WHO website. These meetings are timed to balance the availability of the latest epidemiological, immunological, and virological data, with the kinetics of vaccine-induced protection and the lead time manufacturers need to update the antigen composition of authorized COVID-19 vaccines.",
          "The purpose of this statement is to guide the scientific community and vaccine manufacturers as to which data should be generated ahead of the May 2025 TAG-CO-VAC deliberations. It is an update to the previous statement on the types of data requested in October 2024. 1",
          "To inform decisions on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition, 2-6 the TAG-CO-VAC reviews data (see Table) on the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the antigenic characteristics of previously and currently circulating variants. This includes the analysis of animal antisera following primary infection or vaccination in one-way and two-way neutralization tests, as well as immunogenicity data that assess the breadth and durability of immune responses, including neutralizing antibody responses, using sera from sequentially immunized or infected animals and pre-and post-vaccination human sera. The TAG-CO-VAC also considers vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates of currently approved COVID-19 vaccines, particularly those that control for time since vaccination and that provide variant-specific estimates across different vaccine platforms for protection against any infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease. Further examples of published data reviewed by TAG-CO-VAC and used to inform decisions on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition can be found in the annexes accompanying each of the previous statements. 2-6",
          "In addition, the TAG-CO-VAC reviews available data from vaccine manufacturers, including animal and human studies demonstrating the breadth and durability of immune responses elicited by currently authorized vaccines, as well as any vaccine candidates in development. For vaccine candidates in development, the TAG-CO-VAC highlights the utility of clinical immunogenicity data for decision-making on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. The TAG-CO-VAC also notes that comparable immunogenicity data (i.e. to the same variants) from previous vaccine compositions are especially useful. Vaccine manufacturers are also asked to provide observational epidemiological data that demonstrate the efficacy or effectiveness of their authorized COVID-19 vaccines, as well as any vaccine candidates in development.",
          "At this stage, the key antisera and antigens of interest for the May 2025 decision-making meeting for demonstrating breadth include antisera to: BA.2 (other historical reference viruses – e.g., index virus, Alpha, BA.1 – are also useful for determining antigenic relationships), XBB.1.5, JN.1, KP.2, XEC, LP.8.1, LF.7.2 and potentially emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Antisera of interest are animal sera after single or sequential exposure and human sera after a boost with monovalent JN.1, KP.2 or XBB.1.5 vaccines. Both pre- and post-vaccination sera should be included and, for all antisera, neutralizing antibody titers should be analyzed against at least one variant that emerged after the vaccine antigen, where feasible. Analysis of these antisera against the same panel of virus antigens as well as other new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants will provide insight into antigenic characteristics of previous and emerging variants. Emerging variants include the list of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest (VOI) and Variants Under Monitoring (VUM) maintained on the WHO website . Relative VE estimates should be calculated during periods of circulation of XBB, JN.1, KP.3.1.1, XEC or other emerging variant(s) in human populations across age groups, with separate VE estimates for each of the following vaccine antigen compositions: monovalent JN.1, monovalent KP.2 or monovalent XBB.1.5. Where available, the underlying rates of disease outcomes used to derive the relative VE estimates should also be provided.",

TB remains the world’s deadliest infectious disease, responsible for over 1 million deaths annually bringing devastating impacts on families and communities. </p><p>Global efforts to combat TB have saved an estimated 79 million lives since 2000. However, the drastic and abrupt cuts in global health funding happening now are threatening to reverse these gains. Rising drug resistance especially across Europe and the ongoing conflicts across the Middle-East, Africa and Eastern Europe, are further exacerbating the situation for the most vulnerable.</p><p> Under the theme Yes! We Can End TB: Commit, Invest, Deliver, <a href=\"/campaigns/world-tb-day/2025\">World Tuberculosis Day 2025</a> campaign highlights a rallying cry for urgency, and accountability and hope. “The huge gains the world has made against TB over the past 20 years are now at risk as cuts to funding start to disrupt access to services for prevention, screening, and treatment for people with TB,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “But we cannot give up on the concrete commitments that world leaders made at the UN General Assembly just 18 months ago to accelerate work to end TB. WHO is committed to working with all donors, partners and affected countries to mitigate the impact of funding cuts and find innovative solutions.”</p><h2>Funding: threat to global TB efforts</h2><p>Early reports to WHO reveal that severe disruptions in the TB response are seen across several of the highest-burden countries following the funding cuts. Countries in the WHO African Region are experiencing the greatest impact, followed by countries in the WHO South-East Asian and Western Pacific Regions. Twenty seven countries are facing crippling breakdowns in their TB response, with devastating consequences, such as:</p><li>Human resource shortages undermining service delivery;</li><li>Diagnostic services severely disrupted, delaying detection and treatment;</li><li>Data and surveillance systems collapsing, compromising disease tracking and management;</li><li>Community engagement efforts, including active case finding, screening, and contact tracing, deteriorating, leading to delayed diagnoses and increased transmission risks.</li><p>Nine countries report failing TB drug procurement and supply chains, jeopardizing treatment continuity and patient outcomes.</p><p>The 2025 funding cuts further exacerbate an already existing underfunding for global TB response. In 2023, only 26% of the US$ 22 billion annually needed for TB prevention and care was available, leaving a massive shortfall. TB research is in crisis, receiving just one-fifth of the US$ 5 billion annual target in 2022 – severely delaying advancements in diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines. WHO is leading efforts to accelerate TB vaccine development through the TB Vaccine Accelerator Council, but progress remains at risk without urgent financial commitments.</p><h2>Joint statement with civil society</h2><p>In response to the urgent challenges threatening TB services worldwide, WHO’s Director-General and Civil Society Task Force on Tuberculosis have issued a decisive statement. The <a href=\"/news/item/01-05-2023-who-director-general-and-civil-society-task-force-on-tb-release-joint-statement-on-key-priorities-in-the-lead-up-to-2nd-un-high-level-meeting-on-tb\"></a><a href=\"/news/item/18-03-2025-who-director-general-and-civil-society-task-force-on-tb-release-joint-statement-on-sustaining-the-momentum-to-end-tb\">joint statement </a>released this week, demands immediate, coordinated efforts from governments, global health leaders, donors, and policymakers to prevent further disruptions. The statement outlines five critical priorities:</p><li>Addressing TB service disruptions urgently, ensuring responses match the crisis's scale;</li><li>Securing sustainable domestic funding, guaranteeing uninterrupted and equitable access to TB prevention and care;</li><li>Safeguarding essential TB services, including access to life-saving drugs, diagnostics, treatment and social protections, alongside cross-sector collaboration;</li><li>Establishing or revitalizing national collaboration platforms, fostering alliances among civil society, NGOs, donors, and professional societies to tackle challenges;</li><li>Enhancing monitoring and early warning systems to assess real-time impact and detect disruptions early.</li><p>“This urgent call is timely and underscores the necessity of swift, decisive action to sustain global TB progress and prevent setbacks that could cost lives,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Global Programme on TB and Lung Health. “Investing in ending TB is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity – every dollar spent on prevention and treatment yields an estimated US$ 43 in economic returns.”</p><h2>New guidance on TB and lung health</h2><p>As one of the solutions to combating growing resource constraints, WHO is driving the integration of TB and lung health within primary healthcare as a sustainable solution. <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" data-sf-marked=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240107526/\">New technical guidance</a> released by WHO outlines critical actions across the care continuum, focusing on prevention, early detection of TB and comorbidities, optimized management at first contact and improved patient follow-up. The guidance also promotes better use of existing health systems, addressing shared risk factors such as overcrowding, tobacco, undernutrition and environmental pollutants. </p><p>By tackling TB determinants alongside communicable and non-communicable diseases, lung conditions, and disabilities through a unified strategy, WHO aims to reinforce the global response and drive lasting improvements in health outcomes.</p><p>On World TB Day, WHO calls on everyone: individuals, communities, societies, donors and governments, to do their part to end TB. Without concerted action from all stakeholders, the TB response will be decimated, reversing decades of progress, putting millions of lives at risk and threatening health security.</p><h2>Editor's note</h2><p>On 24 March 2025, a correction was made to the second sentence in the first paragraph of this news release as noted below.</p><p>The sentence in the original news release read:</p><p>TB remains the world’s deadliest infectious disease, responsible for over 1 million people annually bringing devastating impacts on families and communities.</p><p>This was changed to:</p><p>TB remains the world’s deadliest infectious disease, responsible for over 1 million deaths annually bringing devastating impacts on families and communities.</p><p> </p>",

Fourteen (14) of the 16 Committee Members, and one of the two Advisors to the Committee participated in the meeting.</p><p>On behalf of the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Deputy Director-General  welcomed Members of and Advisors to the Committee, as well as Government Officials designated to present their views to the Committee on behalf of the ten invited States Parties – Burundi, Canada, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nepal, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Uganda, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom).</p><p>In his opening remarks, the WHO Deputy Director-General recalled that, on 14 August 2024, the upsurge of mpox was determined to constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). He noted that, over the three years from 1 January 2022 through 31 January 2025, almost 130 000 confirmed cases of mpox, including over 280 deaths, were reported to WHO from 130 countries and territories in all six WHO Regions, including seven countries and territories that had reported their first mpox cases since the previous meeting of the Committee on 22 November 2024. The WHO African Region, where some States Parties are continuing to experience sustained community transmission, accounts for 61% of the cases and 72% of the deaths reported globally over the past 12 months.</p><p>The WHO Deputy Director-General highlighted that, since the last meeting of the Committee, the epidemiological situation continues to be volatile. Despite observed improvements pertaining to several aspects of the response – emergency coordination, surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, empowerment of communities, furthering equitable access to medical countermeasures and tools – several critical challenges had emerged, including: (a) rising geopolitical instability in the DRC due to escalating conflict affecting mpox response operations resulting in temporary pauses in operation, relocation of staff and restricted access to affected populations; (b) concurrent health emergencies  requiring States Parties and partners to respond (e.g. Sudan virus disease outbreak in Uganda); and (c) uncertainties related to the pause in financial support from the United States of America (United States) occurring in the broader landscape of declining foreign assistance. To date, globally, one-third of the funds supporting the response to mpox had been pledged by the United States. Without sufficient funds, the ability of States Parties, WHO and partners to maintain, sustain, and expand the response to mpox would be compromised.</p><p>The Representative of the Office of Legal Counsel then briefed the Members and Advisors on their roles and responsibilities and identified the mandate of the Committee under the relevant articles of the IHR. The Ethics Officer from the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics provided the Members and Advisors with an overview of the WHO Declaration of Interests process. The Members and Advisors were made aware of their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature that may give rise to a perceived or actual conflict of interest. They were additionally reminded of their duty to maintain the confidentiality of the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee. Each Member and Advisor was surveyed, with no conflicts of interest identified.</p><p>The meeting was handed over to the Chair who introduced the objectives of the meeting, which were to provide views to the WHO Director-General on whether the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, and if so, to provide views on the potential proposed temporary recommendations.</p><h2>Session open to representatives of States Parties invited to present their views</h2><p>The WHO Secretariat presented an overview of the global epidemiological situation of mpox, including all circulating clades of monkeypox virus (MPXV). Outside the WHO African Region, cases of mpox reported to WHO are associated with the spread of MPXV clade IIb, with a decline in the number of cases reported in recent months. In the WHO African Region, amid the circulation of multiple MPXV clades, the still growing number of cases reported monthly is driven by the spread of MPXV clade Ib. Since the Committee last met, on 22 November 2024, exported travel-related cases of confirmed MPXV clade Ib infection have been detected in eight additional countries outside the WHO African Region.</p><p>The WHO Secretariat then focused on the three countries reporting most cases of MPXV clade Ib since January 2024 – the DRC (over 15 000 cases, including cases in areas where MPXV clade Ia is circulating); Burundi (over 3000 cases, with a sustained decrease reported weekly and a geographic shift to the administrative capital Gitega since the Committee last met); and Uganda (nearly 3000 cases, with an exponential increase in and around the capital Kampala since the Committee last met). Notwithstanding changes in the case definition of mpox cases, uneven surveillance coverage (including due to the conflict in the eastern provinces of the country), and limited laboratory testing capacity in the DRC introducing some challenges in the interpretation of data , the number of mpox cases reported weekly is plateauing and the geographic distribution of cases, in all provinces in the country, remained very similar to the situation presented at the previous meeting of the Committee. Mathematical modelling work suggests that, since the PHEIC was determined in mid-August 2024 in the DRC, the transmission rate has decreased in certain health zones of the North Kivu and South Kivu Provinces, as well as in some health zones of the capital Kinshasa where vaccination efforts are underway.</p><p>The spread of MPXV clade Ia and Ib, in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Kinshasa Provinces of the DRC, as well as in Burundi and Uganda, appears to have started among adults, including through sexual networks involving commercial sex workers and their clients, disproportionately affecting the 20–39 years age group. Since then, in North Kivu and South Kivu Provinces of the DRC, more age group became affected reflecting community transmission through close contact, including household, whereas, in the capital Kinshasa, the spread has remained within the adult population. In Burundi and Uganda, the age distribution of mpox cases shows a bimodal pattern, with high incidence observed among young adults and younger children. This pattern reflects both ongoing sexual transmission and close contact transmission in household settings. The strikingly high proportion of cases among younger children (0-9 age group) observed in Burundi is possibly attributable to transmission occurring within health care facilities settings.</p><p>In addition to the three aforementioned countries, community transmission of MPXV clade Ib is also observed in Kenya, Rwanda, and Zambia, while travel-related imported cases have been reported both, by countries in the WHO African Region (Angola, Zimbabwe, with cases in Tanzania being under investigation), and by 14 countries in the five remaining WHO Regions. Most travel-related imported cases are male and, in instances where limited secondary transmission in the country of importation has occurred, a few children have been infected through household contact, including child-to-child transmission on one occasion. The five imported cases with sole travel history to the United Arab Emirates may signal wider mpox transmission in that country.</p><p>Mortality associated with the different MPXV clades in the WHO African Region, and notwithstanding the limitation of surveillance and laboratory diagnostics in the DRC, clade Ia accounts for the majority of fatal cases (1345), corresponding to an average case fatality rate (CFR%) of 2.5-3%, being highest in children under 1 year of age (4–5%). The CFR attributed with clade Ib infection remains very low at around 0.2%, and similar to the that attributed to clade IIb, with recorded deaths associated with specific risk factors such as uncontrolled HIV and other comorbidities.</p><p>The WHO Secretariat also noted an increase in mpox cases reported in West African countries since the PHEIC was determined in mid-August 2024, including the first cases of mpox, due to MPXV clade IIa, reported by Sierra Leone.</p><p>The WHO Secretariat presented the assessed risk by MPXV clades and further expressed in terms of overall public health risk where any given clade/s is/are circulating, as: Clade Ib – high public health risk in the DRC and neighbouring countries; Clade Ia – moderate public health risk in the DRC; Clade II – moderate public health risk in Nigeria and countries of West and Central Africa where mpox is endemic; and lade IIb – moderate public health risk globally.</p><p>The WHO Secretariat subsequently provided an update on response actions taken together with States Parties and partners since the Committee last met. In addition to the overview provided by the WHO Deputy Director-General, and in the epidemiological overview, the WHO Secretariat provided details on progress and challenges focusing on the aspects of the response outlined below.</p><p>The coordination of emergency operations by the WHO Secretariat was readjusted – including based on action reviews and leveraging the comparative advantages of WHO, State Parties, and partners –prioritizing a flexible, agile, and delivery-focused response. However, while decentralized field operations have intensified, such shifts take time, particularly in specific settings in the DRC and amid changes in geopolitical partnerships. The operational decentralization continues to emphasize increased laboratory diagnostic support, increased dissemination of standards and guidance to deliver safe clinical care, and empowering communities to enhance their efforts to protect themselves from risks associated with mpox.</p><p>Additionally, through the Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM), WHO and partners (Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)) are continuing coordinated and multifaceted efforts to prioritize access to and roll out mpox vaccines in an equitable manner.</p><p>With the <a href=\"/publications/m/item/mpox-global-strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan\">WHO Mpox global strategic preparedness and response plan, September 2024-February 2025</a> (SPRP) reaching the end of its initial timeframe, and considering the response strategy it outlines as still fit for purpose, the WHO Secretariat is planning to release an extension of the plan in the coming weeks.</p><p>In September 2024, the WHO Secretariat launched an appeal for US$ 87.4 million to support mpox response efforts <a href=\"/publications/m/item/who-appeal--mpox-public-health-emergency-2024\">WHO appeal: mpox public health emergency 2024</a> with US$ 65.5 million raised by the time of this meeting. The contribution from the United States had accounted for 33% of the funds raised, of which US$ 7.5 million is currently inaccessible due to the freeze of funds from the United States. As part of planning for the extension of the SPRP, the WHO Secretariat is conducting a review of available resources to address priority needs and mitigate potential future gaps in the delivery of the response. While the above-mentioned freeze is expected to primarily impact operations in Burundi, the Central African Republic, the DRC, the Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda, broader challenges are anticipated for the second and third quarters of 2025. Given the evolving epidemiological situation and challenges noted above, the reduction in predictable and flexible funding throughout 2025 will put at risk the progress of the mpox response to date.</p><p>Representatives of Burundi, the DRC, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda updated the Committee on the mpox epidemiological situation in their countries and their current control and response efforts, needs and challenges, including those related to the freeze of the funds from the United States. The use of mpox vaccine is contemplated in the response plans of the DRC, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda. In Burundi, following action review, community-based interventions that are being strengthened in areas experiencing high incident of mpox include risk communication and awareness raising.</p><p>Members of, and the Advisor to, the Committee then engaged in questions and answers, revolving around the issues and challenges enumerated below, with the presenters from States Parties and the WHO Secretariat, as well as with representatives of States Parties invited to submit a written statement to the Committee ahead of the meeting – Canada, China, Nepal, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Funding – The Committee reiterated the importance of efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources to support mpox response activities. Burundi and the DRC indicated the funds allocated to the response by their respective Governments, also providing details of specific activities supported. The DRC indicated that, at present, the freeze of the funds from the United States is impacting the transportation of clinical specimens and laboratory diagnostics, with a decline in the testing rate, and that the Government is exploring solutions with other partners. The WHO Secretariat added that alternative funding sources are being explored with non-traditional donors.</p><p>Age distribution of mpox cases – The WHO Secretariat indicated that (a) there are studies ongoing to determine the secondary attack rate by age group and type of exposure; (b) at least in Burundi, there is no evidence of large outbreaks in settings where children are congregating and, hence, supporting evidence of child-to-child transmission; and (c) in the South Kivu Proving of the DRC, it remains unknown the extent to which transmission to children is occurring beyond the household setting.</p><p>Impact of vaccination on transmission – The DRC indicated that, at present, there is no information about whether the use of the limited amount of mpox vaccine available is being effective in interrupting mpox transmission.</p><p>The DRC – The DRC indicated that, due to insecurity and to decrease in laboratory testing rate, any apparent decrease of the number of reported mpox cases may represent an artifact and should be interpreted with caution. The WHO Secretariat highlighted that, being mpox a relatively mild illness, the rate of underreporting is unknown and that the trends of mpox surveillance data are critical to monitor the evolution of the situation. With respect to detection of a new MPXV clade Ia lineage in Kinshasa, the WHO Secretariat indicated that the strain, similarly to clade Ib, has increased human-to-human transmission potential.</p><p>Uganda – Uganda elaborated on the shift of the dynamics of mpox transmission from lower to higher income groups. The initial spread of MPXV clade Ib initiated long-distance truck drivers, it continued in fishing communities, and then within commercial sex networks in the capital Kampala. The fact that more affluent individuals are now affected poses a public health risk both, nationally and internationally. Therefore, the use of mpox vaccine is focused among sex workers in Kampala. </p><p>Nigeria – Nigeria indicated that, in the context of the mpox response, the human health and animal health sectors are working very closely and that, despite the numerous research initiatives, to date, there is no evidence of animal involvement in sustaining the mpox outbreak in the human population. Nigeria, with a population of 200 million persons, indicated that 20 000 doses of mpox vaccine have been used in the country, targeting health care workers, female sex workers, and men who have sex with men.</p><p>The United Arab Emirates – Considering that, in five instances, travel-related imported cases of MPXV clade Ib infection had sole travel history to the United Arab Emirates, the representative of the country (a) indicated that the National IHR Focal Point reported to WHO the first case of MPXV clade Ib infection; (b) briefly described the surveillance, laboratory diagnostic, case management, and risk communication approaches in place; (c) indicated that mpox vaccine is available to health care workers and as a post-exposure measure; and (d) recalled that the country is bilaterally supporting the response efforts of some African countries.</p><p>The United Kingdom – The United Kingdom (a) described the detection, investigation, and clinical and public health management of the travel-related imported mpox cases; and (b) highlighted that the countries of origin of the imported cases are systematically informed about the occurrences.</p><h2>Deliberative session</h2><p>Following the session open to invited States Parties, the Committee reconvened in a closed session to examine the questions in relation to whether the event constitutes a PHEIC or not, and if so, to consider the temporary recommendations drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.</p><p>The Chair reminded the Committee Members of their mandate and recalled that a PHEIC is defined in the IHR as an “extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated international response”.</p><h3>The Committee was unanimous in expressing the views that the ongoing upsurge of mpox still meets the criteria of a PHEIC and that the Director-General be advised accordingly</h3><p>The overarching considerations underpinning the advice of the Committee are (a) the insecurity in the eastern provinces and in the capital of the DRC – the State Party epicenter of the MPXV clade Ib outbreak –, hampering mpox response field operations and with the potential to morph into a larger scale humanitarian response; (b) the freeze of funding by the United States both, of specific mpox response activities as well as of other, directly or indirectly related, aid interventions; and (c) the continuing detection of travel-related imported mpox cases in States Parties within and outside the WHO African Region.</p><p>On that basis, the Committee considered that:</p><p>The event is “extraordinary” because of (a) the persistent, if not increasing, challenges in gauging the actual magnitude and trend of the MPXV clade Ib outbreak, especially in the DRC. This is thwarting the ability to assess progress, if any, towards controlling the spread of mpox and to adjust response interventions. The Committee’s reading is that, overall, the epidemiological situation is worryingly similar to that observed in November 2024; (b) the unfolding dynamics of MPXV clade Ib transmission, resulting in the shift in age groups affected and, hence, posing challenges in timely targeting response interventions; (c) the co-circulation and the risk of mutations of MPXV clades in the context of sustained community transmission; and (d) the possibility of change in the severity of disease resulting from food insecurity and interruption in the delivery of HIV-related care due to the freeze of aid.</p><p>The event “constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” because of (a) the doubling of the number of States Parties having detected travel-related imported cases of MPXV clade Ib infection since the Committee last met, both in the WHO African Region and in all five other WHO Regions; (b) the possible influx of refugees from the eastern provinces of the DRC into neighbouring countries.</p><p>The event “requires a coordinated international response” because of the needs (a) to mobilize, and optimize the use, of financial and other resources to sustain response efforts, at the required level, in the medium term, following the freeze of funding by the United States; and (b) to continue facilitating and increasing equitable access to mpox vaccines and diagnostics.</p><h3>The Committee subsequently considered the draft of the temporary recommendations proposed by the WHO Secretariat</h3><p>Anticipating the possibility that the WHO Director-General may determine that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, the Committee had received a proposed set of revised temporary recommendations ahead of the meeting. This reflected the proposal to extend most of the temporary recommendations issued on 27 November 2024. The Committee indicated that it would be giving them further consideration with a view to share its advice in that regard with the WHO Director-General as soon as possible. In such a way, should the WHO Director-General determine that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, he could proceed, without delay, with issuing such communication together with a prospective revised set of temporary recommendations.</p><p>The Committee agreed to finalize the report of its third meeting during the week of 3 March 2025.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>The Committee reiterated its concern regarding the continuing spread of MPXV in and beyond Africa, considering global geopolitical developments, the humanitarian situation in the DRC, as well as the foreseeable options and opportunities to secure sustainable funding to support response efforts. The Committee considered that the determination by the WHO Director-General that the upsurge of mpox still constitutes a PHEIC would be warranted. However, the Committee cautioned about the possible unintended consequences of determining an event to constitute a PHEIC for extended periods of time, since this could undermine the global public health alert function intrinsic to such a determination and reduce the leverage of a PHEIC in boosting domestic and international response efforts for future events. To that effect, the Committee reiterated the need to elaborate on considerations, related to the three criteria defining a PHEIC, that would inform its future advice to the WHO Director-General as to the termination of this PHEIC.</p><p>The Incident Manager for mpox at WHO headquarters, on behalf of the WHO Deputy Director-General, expressed his gratitude to the Committee’s Officers, its Members and Advisor and closed the meeting.</p><h2>Editor's note</h2><p>On 24 March 2025, a correction was made to the fifth paragraph as noted below.</p><p>The original paragraph mistakenly listed Rwanda as an invited State Party. This was corrected and Rwanda is no longer mentioned.</p><p> </p>",

          "The WHO Secretariat then focused on the three countries reporting most cases of MPXV clade Ib since January 2024 – the DRC (over 15 000 cases, including cases in areas where MPXV clade Ia is circulating); Burundi (over 3000 cases, with a sustained decrease reported weekly and a geographic shift to the administrative capital Gitega since the Committee last met); and Uganda (nearly 3000 cases, with an exponential increase in and around the capital Kampala since the Committee last met). Notwithstanding changes in the case definition of mpox cases, uneven surveillance coverage (including due to the conflict in the eastern provinces of the country), and limited laboratory testing capacity in the DRC introducing some challenges in the interpretation of data , the number of mpox cases reported weekly is plateauing and the geographic distribution of cases, in all provinces in the country, remained very similar to the situation presented at the previous meeting of the Committee. Mathematical modelling work suggests that, since the PHEIC was determined in mid-August 2024 in the DRC, the transmission rate has decreased in certain health zones of the North Kivu and South Kivu Provinces, as well as in some health zones of the capital Kinshasa where vaccination efforts are underway.",
          "The spread of MPXV clade Ia and Ib, in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Kinshasa Provinces of the DRC, as well as in Burundi and Uganda, appears to have started among adults, including through sexual networks involving commercial sex workers and their clients, disproportionately affecting the 20–39 years age group. Since then, in North Kivu and South Kivu Provinces of the DRC, more age group became affected reflecting community transmission through close contact, including household, whereas, in the capital Kinshasa, the spread has remained within the adult population. In Burundi and Uganda, the age distribution of mpox cases shows a bimodal pattern, with high incidence observed among young adults and younger children. This pattern reflects both ongoing sexual transmission and close contact transmission in household settings. The strikingly high proportion of cases among younger children (0-9 age group) observed in Burundi is possibly attributable to transmission occurring within health care facilities settings.",
          "In addition to the three aforementioned countries, community transmission of MPXV clade Ib is also observed in Kenya, Rwanda, and Zambia, while travel-related imported cases have been reported both, by countries in the WHO African Region (Angola, Zimbabwe, with cases in Tanzania being under investigation), and by 14 countries in the five remaining WHO Regions. Most travel-related imported cases are male and, in instances where limited secondary transmission in the country of importation has occurred, a few children have been infected through household contact, including child-to-child transmission on one occasion. The five imported cases with sole travel history to the United Arab Emirates may signal wider mpox transmission in that country.",
          "Mortality associated with the different MPXV clades in the WHO African Region, and notwithstanding the limitation of surveillance and laboratory diagnostics in the DRC, clade Ia accounts for the majority of fatal cases (1345), corresponding to an average case fatality rate (CFR%) of 2.5-3%, being highest in children under 1 year of age (4–5%). The CFR attributed with clade Ib infection remains very low at around 0.2%, and similar to the that attributed to clade IIb, with recorded deaths associated with specific risk factors such as uncontrolled HIV and other comorbidities.",
          "The WHO Secretariat also noted an increase in mpox cases reported in West African countries since the PHEIC was determined in mid-August 2024, including the first cases of mpox, due to MPXV clade IIa, reported by Sierra Leone.",
          "The WHO Secretariat presented the assessed risk by MPXV clades and further expressed in terms of overall public health risk where any given clade/s is/are circulating, as: Clade Ib – high public health risk in the DRC and neighbouring countries; Clade Ia – moderate public health risk in the DRC; Clade II – moderate public health risk in Nigeria and countries of West and Central Africa where mpox is endemic; and lade IIb – moderate public health risk globally.",
          "The WHO Secretariat subsequently provided an update on response actions taken together with States Parties and partners since the Committee last met. In addition to the overview provided by the WHO Deputy Director-General, and in the epidemiological overview, the WHO Secretariat provided details on progress and challenges focusing on the aspects of the response outlined below.",
          "The coordination of emergency operations by the WHO Secretariat was readjusted – including based on action reviews and leveraging the comparative advantages of WHO, State Parties, and partners –prioritizing a flexible, agile, and delivery-focused response. However, while decentralized field operations have intensified, such shifts take time, particularly in specific settings in the DRC and amid changes in geopolitical partnerships. The operational decentralization continues to emphasize increased laboratory diagnostic support, increased dissemination of standards and guidance to deliver safe clinical care, and empowering communities to enhance their efforts to protect themselves from risks associated with mpox.",
          "Additionally, through the Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM), WHO and partners (Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)) are continuing coordinated and multifaceted efforts to prioritize access to and roll out mpox vaccines in an equitable manner.",
          "With the WHO Mpox global strategic preparedness and response plan, September 2024-February 2025 (SPRP) reaching the end of its initial timeframe, and considering the response strategy it outlines as still fit for purpose, the WHO Secretariat is planning to release an extension of the plan in the coming weeks.",
          "In September 2024, the WHO Secretariat launched an appeal for US$ 87.4 million to support mpox response efforts WHO appeal: mpox public health emergency 2024 with US$ 65.5 million raised by the time of this meeting. The contribution from the United States had accounted for 33% of the funds raised, of which US$ 7.5 million is currently inaccessible due to the freeze of funds from the United States. As part of planning for the extension of the SPRP, the WHO Secretariat is conducting a review of available resources to address priority needs and mitigate potential future gaps in the delivery of the response. While the above-mentioned freeze is expected to primarily impact operations in Burundi, the Central African Republic, the DRC, the Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda, broader challenges are anticipated for the second and third quarters of 2025. Given the evolving epidemiological situation and challenges noted above, the reduction in predictable and flexible funding throughout 2025 will put at risk the progress of the mpox response to date.",
          "Representatives of Burundi, the DRC, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda updated the Committee on the mpox epidemiological situation in their countries and their current control and response efforts, needs and challenges, including those related to the freeze of the funds from the United States. The use of mpox vaccine is contemplated in the response plans of the DRC, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda. In Burundi, following action review, community-based interventions that are being strengthened in areas experiencing high incident of mpox include risk communication and awareness raising.",
          "Members of, and the Advisor to, the Committee then engaged in questions and answers, revolving around the issues and challenges enumerated below, with the presenters from States Parties and the WHO Secretariat, as well as with representatives of States Parties invited to submit a written statement to the Committee ahead of the meeting – Canada, China, Nepal, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.",
          "Funding – The Committee reiterated the importance of efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources to support mpox response activities. Burundi and the DRC indicated the funds allocated to the response by their respective Governments, also providing details of specific activities supported. The DRC indicated that, at present, the freeze of the funds from the United States is impacting the transportation of clinical specimens and laboratory diagnostics, with a decline in the testing rate, and that the Government is exploring solutions with other partners. The WHO Secretariat added that alternative funding sources are being explored with non-traditional donors.",
          "Age distribution of mpox cases – The WHO Secretariat indicated that (a) there are studies ongoing to determine the secondary attack rate by age group and type of exposure; (b) at least in Burundi, there is no evidence of large outbreaks in settings where children are congregating and, hence, supporting evidence of child-to-child transmission; and (c) in the South Kivu Proving of the DRC, it remains unknown the extent to which transmission to children is occurring beyond the household setting.",
          "Impact of vaccination on transmission – The DRC indicated that, at present, there is no information about whether the use of the limited amount of mpox vaccine available is being effective in interrupting mpox transmission.",
          "The DRC – The DRC indicated that, due to insecurity and to decrease in laboratory testing rate, any apparent decrease of the number of reported mpox cases may represent an artifact and should be interpreted with caution. The WHO Secretariat highlighted that, being mpox a relatively mild illness, the rate of underreporting is unknown and that the trends of mpox surveillance data are critical to monitor the evolution of the situation. With respect to detection of a new MPXV clade Ia lineage in Kinshasa, the WHO Secretariat indicated that the strain, similarly to clade Ib, has increased human-to-human transmission potential.",
          "Uganda – Uganda elaborated on the shift of the dynamics of mpox transmission from lower to higher income groups. The initial spread of MPXV clade Ib initiated long-distance truck drivers, it continued in fishing communities, and then within commercial sex networks in the capital Kampala. The fact that more affluent individuals are now affected poses a public health risk both, nationally and internationally. Therefore, the use of mpox vaccine is focused among sex workers in Kampala.",
          "Nigeria – Nigeria indicated that, in the context of the mpox response, the human health and animal health sectors are working very closely and that, despite the numerous research initiatives, to date, there is no evidence of animal involvement in sustaining the mpox outbreak in the human population. Nigeria, with a population of 200 million persons, indicated that 20 000 doses of mpox vaccine have been used in the country, targeting health care workers, female sex workers, and men who have sex with men.",
          "The United Arab Emirates – Considering that, in five instances, travel-related imported cases of MPXV clade Ib infection had sole travel history to the United Arab Emirates, the representative of the country (a) indicated that the National IHR Focal Point reported to WHO the first case of MPXV clade Ib infection; (b) briefly described the surveillance, laboratory diagnostic, case management, and risk communication approaches in place; (c) indicated that mpox vaccine is available to health care workers and as a post-exposure measure; and (d) recalled that the country is bilaterally supporting the response efforts of some African countries.",
          "The United Kingdom – The United Kingdom (a) described the detection, investigation, and clinical and public health management of the travel-related imported mpox cases; and (b) highlighted that the countries of origin of the imported cases are systematically informed about the occurrences."

          "On that basis, the Committee considered that:",
          "The event is “extraordinary” because of (a) the persistent, if not increasing, challenges in gauging the actual magnitude and trend of the MPXV clade Ib outbreak, especially in the DRC. This is thwarting the ability to assess progress, if any, towards controlling the spread of mpox and to adjust response interventions. The Committee’s reading is that, overall, the epidemiological situation is worryingly similar to that observed in November 2024; (b) the unfolding dynamics of MPXV clade Ib transmission, resulting in the shift in age groups affected and, hence, posing challenges in timely targeting response interventions; (c) the co-circulation and the risk of mutations of MPXV clades in the context of sustained community transmission; and (d) the possibility of change in the severity of disease resulting from food insecurity and interruption in the delivery of HIV-related care due to the freeze of aid.",
          "The event “constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” because of (a) the doubling of the number of States Parties having detected travel-related imported cases of MPXV clade Ib infection since the Committee last met, both in the WHO African Region and in all five other WHO Regions; (b) the possible influx of refugees from the eastern provinces of the DRC into neighbouring countries.",
          "The event “requires a coordinated international response” because of the needs (a) to mobilize, and optimize the use, of financial and other resources to sustain response efforts, at the required level, in the medium term, following the freeze of funding by the United States; and (b) to continue facilitating and increasing equitable access to mpox vaccines and diagnostics."

The Committee considered that the determination by the WHO Director-General that the upsurge of mpox still constitutes a PHEIC would be warranted. However, the Committee cautioned about the possible unintended consequences of determining an event to constitute a PHEIC for extended periods of time, since this could undermine the global public health alert function intrinsic to such a determination and reduce the leverage of a PHEIC in boosting domestic and international response efforts for future events. To that effect, the Committee reiterated the need to elaborate on considerations, related to the three criteria defining a PHEIC, that would inform its future advice to the WHO Director-General as to the termination of this PHEIC.",

We hope countries and communities will increase vigilance and take necessary actions to protect vulnerable groups particularly youth from these substances.”</p><p>Four substances placed in Schedule I of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961), as amended by the 1972 Protocol are:</p><li><strong>N-Pyrrolidino protonitazene</strong>, also referred to as protonitazepyne, is a synthetic opioid.  It has been described as a beige powder or a white colourless or crystalline solid, and has been identified in falsified pharmaceutical opioid tablets. It is reported to be administered by various routes, including smoking, snorting and by injection. It can cause substantial harm, including death. It has no known therapeutic use. </li><li><strong>N-Pyrrolidino metonitazene</strong>, also referred to as metonitazepyne, is a synthetic opioid. It has been described as a beige powder and is reported to be administered by injection. There is evidence that its use causes substantial harm, including death. It has no known therapeutic use.</li><li><strong>Etonitazepipne</strong>, also referred to as N-piperidinyl etonitazene, is a synthetic opioid.  It has been described as a crystalline solid and a yellowish-white or yellow powder. There is evidence that use of this substance causes substantial harm, including death. It has no known therapeutic use. </li><li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"></span></strong><strong>N-Desethyl isotonitazene</strong>, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"></span>also referred to as norisotonitazene, is a synthetic opioid that has been described as a crystalline solid. It has been identified in falsified pharmaceuticals. Multiple deaths and hospital admissions have been reported in at least two regions. There is evidence that its use causes substantial harm, including death. It has no known therapeutic use. </li><p>Substance placed in Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971):</p><li><strong>Hexahydrocannabinol</strong>, also known as HHC, is a semi-synthetic cannabinoid described as a colourless viscous oil or resin. Products such as THC cannabis flowers and resins infused or sprayed with the substance, e-liquids and cartridges for electronic cigarettes, edible products such as gummies and marshmallows, tinctures resembling dietary supplements and distillate oils can include HHC. There is sufficient evidence that HHC is used in ways to constitute a public health and social problem, warranting placement under international control. </li><p>Substance placed in Schedule IV of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971):</p><li><strong>Carisoprodol </strong>is<strong> </strong>a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant sold as a single-ingredient preparation and in combination products. Carisoprodol is available as a pharmaceutical product in tablet form, has been detected in falsified pharmaceuticals and is also found as a white powder. There is increasing evidence that nonmedical use of carisoprodol in a number of countries constitutes a significant risk to public health. </li><p>WHO has been convening the ECDD as a scientific advisory body for over 70 years with the mission to protect populations from harmful substances and to ensure that psychoactive substances are available where needed for medical and scientific purposes. The ECDD conducts scientific reviews at the request of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs and is the only treaty-mandated body to provide health recommendations to the Commission to inform decisions in drug policy. </p><p>With the ongoing emergence of more harmful substances, including clandestinely manufactured synthetic opioids with no medical use such as fentanyl and nitazenes, Member States expressed interest in more scientific reviews of these substances by WHO in the coming period.

These conditions were responsible for around 80 000 and 50 000 fatalities respectively in 2020 – the last year for which  <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240068759\">published estimates</a> are available - highlighting that many women still lack access to lifesaving treatments and effective care during and after pregnancy and birth. </p><p>Published in the Lancet Global Health, the study is WHO’s first global update on the causes of maternal deaths since the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals were adopted in 2015. In addition to outlining the major direct obstetric causes, it shows that other health conditions, including both infectious and chronic diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, anaemias, and diabetes, underpin nearly a quarter (23%) of pregnancy and childbirth-related mortality. These conditions, which often go undetected or untreated until major complications occur, exacerbate risk and complicate pregnancies for millions of women around the world.</p><p>“Understanding why pregnant women and mothers are dying is critical for tackling the world’s lingering maternal mortality crisis and ensuring women have the best possible chances of surviving childbirth,” said Dr Pascale Allotey, Director of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research at WHO as well as the UN’s Special Programme on Human Reproduction (HRP). “This is also a massive equity issue globally - women everywhere need high quality, evidence-based health care before, during and after delivery, as well as efforts to prevent and treat other underlying conditions that jeopardize their health.”</p><p>In 2020, there were an estimated 287 000 maternal deaths in total – equivalent to one death every two minutes. This new WHO study reports that haemorrhage - mostly occurring during or following childbirth - is responsible for nearly a third (27%) of maternal mortality, with preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders contributing to an additional 16%. Preeclampsia is a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure that can lead to haemorrhage, strokes, organ failures and seizures if left untreated or treated too late. </p><p>Other direct causes include: sepsis and infections; pulmonary embolism; complications from spontaneous and induced abortions - including miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and issues relating to unsafe abortions – and, anesthetic complications and injuries that occur during childbirth. </p><p>The findings highlight the need to strengthen key aspects of maternity care, including antenatal services that detect risks early in pregnancy and prevent severe complications; lifesaving obstetrics that can manage critical birth-related emergencies like haemorrhage or embolism, and postnatal care. Most maternal deaths occur during or shortly after childbirth, making this a critical window to save lives. However, around a third of women – primarily in lower income countries - still do not receive essential postnatal checks in the first days after birth.  At a population level, broader preventive interventions could help reduce the prevalence of underlying health conditions - like noncommunicable diseases and malnutrition - that increase women’s risks.</p><p>“Often not just one but many interrelated factors contribute to a woman dying during or after pregnancy– preeclampsia for instance can significantly increase the likelihood of haemorrhage as well as other complications that may occur even long after childbirth,” said Dr Jenny Cresswell, Scientist at WHO and an author of the paper. “A more holistic approach to maternal health has been proven to give women the best chance of a healthy pregnancy and birth, and of enjoying lasting quality of life after delivery – health systems need to be able to support them across different life stages.”  </p><p>The study draws on national data that is reported to WHO, as well as peer-reviewed studies. For some causes, data remains limited. In particular, the authors call for more data on maternal suicide, which is currently available for only 12 countries. In addition, most countries do not report on late maternal deaths (those that occur in the year following childbirth), although several conditions can lead to risks lasting much beyond the birth itself. After childbirth, many women  <a href=\"/news/item/07-12-2023-more-than-a-third-of-women-experience-lasting-health-problems-after-childbirth\">struggle to access follow-up care</a>, including mental health support.</p><p>WHO works to strengthen access to high quality, respectful services across the continuum of <a href=\"/news/item/07-11-2016-new-guidelines-on-antenatal-care-for-a-positive-pregnancy-experience\">pregnancy</a>, <a href=\"/news/item/12-10-2023-improving-the-experience-of-pregnant-and-birthing-women\">childbirth</a> and <a href=\"/news/item/30-03-2022-who-urges-quality-care-for-women-and-newborns-in-critical-first-weeks-after-childbirth\">postnatal care</a>, through evidence-based research and guidelines.

To galvanize action, World Health Day 2025 – which marks five years from the Sustainable Development Goals deadline—will focus on maternal and newborn health. The campaign will call for a major intensification of efforts to ensure access to high quality, proven care for women and babies, especially in the poorest countries and crisis settings where the vast majority of deaths occur. Beyond survival, the campaign will also showcase the need for broader attention to women’s health, including postnatal care and support.</p><h2>About<strong></strong></h2><p>The study, Global and regional causes of maternal deaths 2009-2020: a WHO systematic analysis, updates a previous analysis conducted in 2014 which covered the period 2003-2009.

Currently, these medicines are being delivered to Mongolia and Uzbekistan, with next shipments planned for Ecuador, Jordan, Nepal and Zambia. The treatments are expected to reach approximately 5000 children with cancer across at least 30 hospitals in these countries within this year.</p><p>The Global Platform is a first initiative of its kind. Countries in the pilot phase will receive an uninterrupted supply of quality-assured childhood cancer medicines at no cost. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), childhood cancer survival rates are often below 30%, significantly lower than those in high-income countries. Six additional countries have been formally invited to join the platform.</p><p>The initiative is poised to become the largest, with the goal of reaching 50 nations in the next 5 to 7 years. It aims to eventually provide medicines for the treatment of approximately 120 000 children with cancer in LMICs, significantly reducing mortality rates. </p><p>“For too long, children with cancer have lacked access to life-saving medicines,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This unique partnership between WHO and St. Jude is working to provide quality-assured cancer medicines to paediatric hospitals in low-and middle-income countries. WHO is proud to be part of this joint initiative with St. Jude, bringing health and hope to children around the world.”</p><p>Every year, an estimated 400 000 children worldwide develop cancer. The majority of these children, living in resource-limited settings, are unable to consistently obtain or afford cancer medicines. It is estimated that 70% of the children from these settings die from cancer due to factors such as lack of appropriate treatment, treatment disruptions or low-quality medicines.</p><p>“A child’s chances of surviving cancer are largely determined by where they are born, making this one of the starkest disparities in global healthcare,” said James R. Downing, MD, president and CEO of St. Jude. “St. Jude was founded on Danny Thomas’ dream that no child should die in the dawn of life. By developing this platform, we believe this dream can someday be achieved for children stricken by cancer, irrespective of where they live.”</p><p>St. Jude and WHO announced the platform in 2021 to ensure children around the world have access to lifesaving treatments. The platform brings together governments, the pharmaceutical industry and non-governmental organizations in a unique collaborative model focused on creating solutions for children with cancer. The co-design approach addresses the broader needs of national stakeholders, with a focus on capacity building and long-term sustainability.</p><p>The platform provides comprehensive end-to-end support, from consolidating global demand to shaping the market, assisting countries with medicine selection and developing treatment standards. It represents a transformative model for the broader global health community working together to tackle health challenges, in particular for children and noncommunicable diseases. To accomplish this, St. Jude and WHO partner with UNICEF Supply Division, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Strategic Fund.<br/> </p><h3>Notes to editors:</h3><p><strong>World Health Organization</strong></p><p>Dedicated to the well-being of all people and guided by science, the World Health Organization (WHO) leads and champions global efforts to give everyone, everywhere an equal chance at a safe and healthy life.

WHO remains on the ground, and has continued to respond to the health needs by providing lifesaving medical supplies, supporting health workers, and coordinating the emergency response.</p><p>Hospitals and morgues are overwhelmed. Since 26 January, 3082 injured and 843 dead have been reported from 31 health facilities in and around Goma, North Kivu.</p><p>With the alarming expansion of violence further south, 65 injuries were reported from 3 hospitals in South Kivu.</p><p>These numbers are expected to rise further as more injured people are able to reach health facilities and more dead bodies are gathered off the streets. Wound infections are a risk for those who have not been able to reach health care facilities quickly, and as health facilities are running out of supplies they need to clean and disinfect.</p><p>The sight of bodies lying uncared for is distressing. Though the bodies of people who have died from injury do not generally carry or spread disease, it is the right of the dead to be identified and receive proper burial, and important for the living to know their loved ones have received this care.  </p><p>Over 70 (or 6%) of the health facilities in North Kivu have been affected, with some completely destroyed and others struggling to restart operations. Some ambulances have also been damaged. A WHO-supported health clinic in North Kivu was temporarily occupied by armed groups. Health workers have had to flee in places, while in others, they have been working round the clock for days, with limited resources and overwhelming demand, and sometimes at risk to their own lives.</p><p>Cancer, diabetes, hypertension, mental health and other routine services are also affected as medicines have run out and health workers are either absent or overburdened.</p><p>The risk of death during pregnancy and childbirth has increased from already high levels. Given the insecurity, pregnant women cannot reach health facilities for safe delivery. Experience with conflict in the region has shown the drastic effect it has, with the rate of births attended to by skilled health workers dropping to near zero during periods of intense violence.</p><p>The threat of infectious diseases has multiplied. Cholera, malaria, measles, meningitis, mpox and tuberculosis are among the infectious threats in the area. The water supply in Goma was disrupted and has only partially resumed, leading people to use water from the lake, and heightening the risk of cholera spread. Close to 600 suspected cases of cholera and 14 deaths were reported from North Kivu between 1 and 27 January.</p><p>Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially South Kivu province, is the epicentre of the mpox outbreak that prompted the WHO Director-General to declare a public health emergency of international concern last August. The mpox response is heavily impacted. Ninety percent of the mpox patients (128 of 143) in isolation units in Goma had fled for safety, making it nearly impossible to provide them with care, and increasing the risk of spread.</p><p>One in four people in the region was already facing emergency levels of hunger, with the recent violence expected to worsen the situation. Malnutrition and disease go hand-in-hand: malnourished people are less able to fight disease, while disease leads to further malnutrition. This vicious circle is especially concerning when it comes to children, and pregnant and breastfeeding women.</p><p>Goma was home to over 2 million people, including 700 000 people displaced by this crisis. These people have had to flee yet again, in search of safety. They are in temporary settlements, with their health and safety at risk.</p><p>A rapid assessment of 10 healthcare facilities in and around Goma showed a concerning rise in rape and other gender-based violence: there were 45 cases reported among the displaced, and 21 survivors of gang-rape admitted to two hospitals. These numbers are only the tip of the iceberg. These patients require medical care, psychological support, and support with maintaining their livelihood, especially when they are the sole providers for their families.</p><p>WHO has deployed emergency medical supplies, hygiene and water treatment supplies, and tents to increase hospital capacity by 1000 beds. Supplies are being depleted rapidly, and more resources are urgently needed.</p><p>WHO is preparing further deliveries as part a European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO)-led effort to fly in critical supplies. For this, the Goma airport, a critical lifeline, must be urgently reopened. WHO is also exploring options to deliver critical supplies through other routes.</p><p>WHO and partners were able to resume mpox vaccination in Goma on Wednesday, 5 February after a 10 day pause.</p><p>The United States’ recent decision to freeze foreign aid is significantly impacting relief efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year, the US contributed to as much as 70% of the country’s humanitarian response. Additionally, the US is a major funder of the mpox response, and has pledged a million vaccine doses of its own stock to global efforts. While WHO’s humanitarian response in the region relies on funding from other donors—including the European Union, United Kingdom and the WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies—reductions in overall aid will have repercussions on people’s health.</p><p>To meet immediate health needs in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, including for safe and dignified burials, WHO has spent US$ 600 000. The overall response requires US$ 50 million.</p><p>WHO calls for humanitarian access, the protection of health workers and facilities, and an end to attacks on health care. Health facilities, supplies, workers and patients should be protected. Ultimately, we call for peace, and an end to the unimaginable and long suffering of the people in this region.</p><p> </p>",

          "Over 70 (or 6%) of the health facilities in North Kivu have been affected, with some completely destroyed and others struggling to restart operations. Some ambulances have also been damaged. A WHO-supported health clinic in North Kivu was temporarily occupied by armed groups. Health workers have had to flee in places, while in others, they have been working round the clock for days, with limited resources and overwhelming demand, and sometimes at risk to their own lives.",
          "Cancer, diabetes, hypertension, mental health and other routine services are also affected as medicines have run out and health workers are either absent or overburdened.",
          "The risk of death during pregnancy and childbirth has increased from already high levels. Given the insecurity, pregnant women cannot reach health facilities for safe delivery. Experience with conflict in the region has shown the drastic effect it has, with the rate of births attended to by skilled health workers dropping to near zero during periods of intense violence.",
          "The threat of infectious diseases has multiplied. Cholera, malaria, measles, meningitis, mpox and tuberculosis are among the infectious threats in the area. The water supply in Goma was disrupted and has only partially resumed, leading people to use water from the lake, and heightening the risk of cholera spread. Close to 600 suspected cases of cholera and 14 deaths were reported from North Kivu between 1 and 27 January.",
          "Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially South Kivu province, is the epicentre of the mpox outbreak that prompted the WHO Director-General to declare a public health emergency of international concern last August. The mpox response is heavily impacted. Ninety percent of the mpox patients (128 of 143) in isolation units in Goma had fled for safety, making it nearly impossible to provide them with care, and increasing the risk of spread.",
          "One in four people in the region was already facing emergency levels of hunger, with the recent violence expected to worsen the situation. Malnutrition and disease go hand-in-hand: malnourished people are less able to fight disease, while disease leads to further malnutrition. This vicious circle is especially concerning when it comes to children, and pregnant and breastfeeding women.",
          "Goma was home to over 2 million people, including 700 000 people displaced by this crisis. These people have had to flee yet again, in search of safety. They are in temporary settlements, with their health and safety at risk.",
          "A rapid assessment of 10 healthcare facilities in and around Goma showed a concerning rise in rape and other gender-based violence: there were 45 cases reported among the displaced, and 21 survivors of gang-rape admitted to two hospitals. These numbers are only the tip of the iceberg. These patients require medical care, psychological support, and support with maintaining their livelihood, especially when they are the sole providers for their families.",
          "WHO has deployed emergency medical supplies, hygiene and water treatment supplies, and tents to increase hospital capacity by 1000 beds. Supplies are being depleted rapidly, and more resources are urgently needed.",
          "WHO is preparing further deliveries as part a European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO)-led effort to fly in critical supplies. For this, the Goma airport, a critical lifeline, must be urgently reopened. WHO is also exploring options to deliver critical supplies through other routes.",
          "WHO and partners were able to resume mpox vaccination in Goma on Wednesday, 5 February after a 10 day pause.",
          "The United States’ recent decision to freeze foreign aid is significantly impacting relief efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year, the US contributed to as much as 70% of the country’s humanitarian response. Additionally, the US is a major funder of the mpox response, and has pledged a million vaccine doses of its own stock to global efforts. While WHO’s humanitarian response in the region relies on funding from other donors—including the European Union, United Kingdom and the WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies—reductions in overall aid will have repercussions on people’s health.",
          "To meet immediate health needs in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, including for safe and dignified burials, WHO has spent US$ 600 000. The overall response requires US$ 50 million.",
          "WHO calls for humanitarian access, the protection of health workers and facilities, and an end to attacks on health care. Health facilities, supplies, workers and patients should be protected. Ultimately, we call for peace, and an end to the unimaginable and long suffering of the people in this region."

This success is yet another testament to the remarkable strides we have made against neglected tropical diseases and offers hope to other nations still battling onchocerciasis, demonstrating that elimination is possible.”</p><p>Onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness, is a parasitic disease and is the second leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide, after trachoma. It is transmitted to humans through the bites of infective black flies, primarily found in riverine areas. The disease primarily affects rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa and Yemen, with smaller endemic areas found in parts of Latin America.<br/></p><h2>Effective country-led efforts and partnerships</h2><p>Between 1976 and 1989, under the umbrella of the WHO Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP), Niger undertook vector control measures by spraying insecticides that significantly decreased levels of onchocerciasis transmission. Following the donation of ivermectin by Merck, Sharpe &amp; Dohme (MSD), areas still affected by lymphatic filariasis (LF) underwent mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin and albendazole from 2008 to 2019, followed by surveillance. Since ivermectin is effective against both diseases, and areas targeted for LF MDA were also endemic for onchocerciasis, this intervention also contributed to interrupting the transmission of the <em>Onchocerca volvulus</em> parasite. <br/></p><p>Niger started preliminary assessments on interruption of onchocerciasis transmission in 2014 after stopping LF MDA in most areas. This was followed by entomological and epidemiological surveys which revealed that the combination of medicine and vector control had successfully eliminated transmission of onchocerciasis, as evidenced by the reduction in prevalence from approximately 60% to 0.02%. </p><p>In addition to the vector control interventions and the medicines donated by MSD, a key factor contributing to Niger’s success is the partnership between the Nigerien government, WHO and nongovernmental organizations, which has helped mobilize resources and technical support.

It has also impeded the economic development of affected communities, driving people away from rivers, which are often lifelines for livelihoods,” says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Niger’s success ends this burden for its people.
