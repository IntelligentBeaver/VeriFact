    "content_html": "<p>An alarming lack of availability of essential medicines in the public sector drives patients to pay higher prices in the private sector or go without, according to a WHO study reported in today’s online edition of <em>The Lancet</em>. The results confirm that governments must do more to improve access to essential medicines as part of their efforts to make national health systems more efficient and equitable.</p><p>The study analysed data from surveys in 36 countries from all WHO geographical regions and World Bank income groups. Results show an average public-sector availability of only 38% across surveys. This forces patients to buy medicines from the private sector where treatments are more expensive and frequently unaffordable. In Africa, for example, the lowest-paid government worker needs to spend two days' salary each month to purchase diabetes treatment using the lowest-priced generic medicine. When the originator brand is used, costs escalate to over eight days' wages.</p><p>“You should not have to choose between buying medication for an ailing parent or buying food for your children,” said Carissa Etienne, WHO Assistant Director-General of Health Systems and Services. “It is not fair or necessary. That is why we are calling again for comprehensive primary health care, so that health systems in every country put the real health needs of people and communities first, and families are not impoverished or bankrupted because of health care payments.”</p><p>On the pricing side, the study revealed that “cuts” taken by wholesalers, distributors and retailers plus government taxes and duties are driving prices beyond affordability in many countries. In some countries, add-on costs can double the public-sector price of medicine, while in the private sector, wholesale mark-ups ranged from 2% to 380%, and retail mark-ups ranged from 10% to 552%.</p><p>“Essentially, multi-layered supply chain costs add up to one thing for patients, no access to essential medicines,” said Dr Richard Laing of the Essential Medicines and Pharmaceutical Policies department at WHO. “When you pull apart the layers of additional charges, the potential solutions for governments to make life-saving medicines more available and accessible are clear – improve financing and distribution efficiency, promote the use of generic products and control supply chain costs by limiting mark-ups and removing duties and taxes.”</p><p>The study further asserts that these actions should all be part of national medicine policies that are measured and evaluated against predetermined benchmarks at least every two years, with routine monitoring and reporting more frequently.</p><p>The results cover 15 medicines included in at least 80% of surveys, as well as four specific medicines used to treat asthma, diabetes, hypertension and acute infections. The figures are adjusted to account for differences in buying power of local currencies and then compared to international reference prices, allowing for cross-country comparison.</p><p>The work is part of an ongoing joint effort between WHO and Health Action International (HAI) to highlight and improve availability and affordability of essential medicines, especially in low- and middle-income countries.</p><p> </p>",

    "content_html": "<p>WHO and health partners have launched an intensive operation to prevent and control the increase in the number of cholera cases, which have tripled in some areas to 150 a week, amid the recent escalation of violence in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>\n<p>Insecurity, massive population displacement (at least 250 000 people since early August), weak health services and a lack of safe water and proper sanitation facilities have caused a marked increase in the number of people with cholera in North and South Kivu.</p>\n<p>As yet no data is available on the number of deaths linked to the current outbreak, but generally in complex emergencies the case fatality rate can surpass 30%. In 1994, some 50 000 people died from a combined epidemic of cholera and dysentery linked to the Rwandan exodus into Goma, the main town of North Kivu.</p>\n<p>There has been a tripling of cholera cases since the start of October to early November in the Goma health zone, which includes the area of Karisimbi. From July-August, there was a weekly incidence of less than 20 cases in Goma. But in the first week of October, there were 40 cholera cases, which increased to about 150 in early November.</p>\n<p>\"Such an increase of cases in a region that is already endemic for cholera is an early warning sign of a potentially larger epidemic, and all health providers are working together to ensure that we do not see a repeat of 1994,\" said Dr Eric Laroche, Assistant Director-General for WHO's Health Action in Crises.</p>\n<p>In all of North Kivu, there have been at least 997 cholera cases reported in that time, with most recorded in Rutshuru (466), Goma (263) and Karisimbi (145). In South Kivu during the same period, 855 cholera cases have been reported, with most in Minova (371).</p>\n<p>Cholera is a water-borne bacterial disease characterized by acute watery diarrhoea and vomiting and can rapidly lead to death if untreated. It is mainly transmitted through contaminated water and food and is closely linked to inadequate sanitation. It is endemic in the eastern part of the country and that has alerted the population and health providers of cholera's presence, risks and response.</p>\n<p>\"There is high awareness of the deadly impact that cholera, and many other communicable illnesses such as malaria and measles, have on populations in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\" Dr Laroche said. \"But this additional risk is unacceptable. Access to safe water, proper sanitation and health services is essential to prevent it from spreading to those displaced on roads, residing in temporary camps and living in established communities.\"</p>\n<h5>Health sector response to increasing needs</h5>\n<p>WHO is leading the coordinated health response to the emergency. All concerned health providers and agencies coordinate their efforts through a group known as the Health Cluster.</p>\n<p>WHO is buying and delivering large quantities of medical supplies, including materials to treat cholera and other water-borne diseases, in the affected areas of the country. Supplies are being provided to MSF Switzerland in the northern town of Dungu, where separate fighting has impacted the health of the community.</p>\n<p>Sixty tonnes of medicines have arrived by plane into Kampala, the capital of neighbouring Uganda, a large portion of which is due to leave by road on Saturday, 15 November for Goma. The consignment includes Oral Rehydration Salts that can treat successfully up to 80% of suspect cholera cases, as well as intravenous fluids and antibiotics for handling severe cases.</p>\n<p>WHO has more than a dozen staff in the area, including epidemiologists, who are working to strengthen the reporting system for cholera and other potentially life-threatening diseases, including measles and malaria. Malaria is a major killer in this part of the country, being responsible for 45% of infant mortality.</p>\n<h3>Related links</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/health-topics/cholera\" target=\"_blank\">More information on cholera</a></p>",

      "description": "WHO and health partners have launched an intensive operation to prevent and control the increase in the number of cholera cases, which have tripled in some areas to 150 a week, amid the recent escalation of violence in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Insecurity, massive population displacement (at least 250 000 people since early August), weak health services and a lack of safe water and proper sanitation facilities have caused a marked increase in the number of people with cholera in North and South Kivu.As yet no data is available on the number of deaths linked to the current outbreak, but generally in complex emergencies the case fatality rate can surpass 30%. In 1994, some 50 000 people died from a combined epidemic of cholera and dysentery linked to the Rwandan exodus into Goma, the main town of North Kivu.There has been a tripling of cholera cases since the start of October to early November in the Goma health zone, which includes the area of Karisimbi. From July-August, there was a weekly incidence of less than 20 cases in Goma. But in the first week of October, there were 40 cholera cases, which increased to about 150 in early November.\"Such an increase of cases in a region that is already endemic for cholera is an early warning sign of a potentially larger epidemic, and all health providers are working together to ensure that we do not see a repeat of 1994,\" said Dr Eric Laroche, Assistant Director-General for WHO's Health Action in Crises.In all of North Kivu, there have been at least 997 cholera cases reported in that time, with most recorded in Rutshuru (466), Goma (263) and Karisimbi (145). In South Kivu during the same period, 855 cholera cases have been reported, with most in Minova (371).Cholera is a water-borne bacterial disease characterized by acute watery diarrhoea and vomiting and can rapidly lead to death if untreated. It is mainly transmitted through contaminated water and food and is closely linked to inadequate sanitation. It is endemic in the eastern part of the country and that has alerted the population and health providers of cholera's presence, risks and response.\"There is high awareness of the deadly impact that cholera, and many other communicable illnesses such as malaria and measles, have on populations in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\" Dr Laroche said. \"But this additional risk is unacceptable. Access to safe water, proper sanitation and health services is essential to prevent it from spreading to those displaced on roads, residing in temporary camps and living in established communities.\"Health sector response to increasing needsWHO is leading the coordinated health response to the emergency. All concerned health providers and agencies coordinate their efforts through a group known as the Health Cluster.WHO is buying and delivering large quantities of medical supplies, including materials to treat cholera and other water-borne diseases, in the affected areas of the country. Supplies are being provided to MSF Switzerland in the northern town of Dungu, where separate fighting has impacted the health of the community.Sixty tonnes of medicines have arrived by plane into Kampala, the capital of neighbouring Uganda, a large portion of which is due to leave by road on Saturday, 15 November for Goma. The consignment includes Oral Rehydration Salts that can treat successfully up to 80% of suspect cholera cases, as well as intravenous fluids and antibiotics for handling severe cases.WHO has more than a dozen staff in the area, including epidemiologists, who are working to strengthen the reporting system for cholera and other potentially life-threatening diseases, including measles and malaria. Malaria is a major killer in this part of the country, being responsible for 45% of infant mortality.Related linksMore information on cholera",

Indeed, as far as WHO is aware, no rigorous, peer-reviewed studies have been conducted showing that the electronic cigarette is a safe and effective nicotine replacement therapy.WHO does not discount the possibility that the electronic cigarette could be useful as a smoking cessation aid. The only way to know is to test.\"If the marketers of the electronic cigarette want to help smokers quit, then they need to conduct clinical studies and toxicity analyses and operate within the proper regulatory framework,\" said Douglas Bettcher, Director a.i. of WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative. \"Until they do that, WHO cannot consider the electronic cigarette to be an appropriate nicotine replacement therapy, and it certainly cannot accept false suggestions that it has approved and endorsed the product. \"The WHO Study Group on Tobacco Product Regulation is scheduled to address the electronic cigarette, among other topics, 12-14 November 2008 in Durban, South Africa. Convened by WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan, its mandate is to advise her on scientifically sound and evidence-based recommendations to the Member States about tobacco product regulation.Related linksWHO's Tobacco Free InitiativeHealth topic: Tobacco",

    "content_html": "<p>Health ministers from countries of the African meningitis belt today committed themselves to introduce a highly promising candidate meningitis vaccine. The vaccine is designed to prevent periodic epidemics of the deadly disease in these countries.</p><p>Meeting at the 58th session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa, held in Yaoundé from 1 to 5 September, the ministers adopted the Yaoundé Declaration, committing themselves to several actions. They agreed to prepare comprehensive meningitis control plans, including the introduction of the new vaccine once available; to implement meningitis control strategies; to undertake joint action vis-à-vis the threat; to improve information exchange for epidemic response; and to contribute financially to epidemic control activities.</p><p>\"Several hundred million people are at risk of meningitis in 25 African countries. Many generations have suffered,\" said Professor Avocksouma Djona, Minister of Public Health, Chad. \"On behalf of all affected countries in Africa, today we are collectively committing ourselves to put an end to devastating outbreaks of this disease. We will ensure that this effective new vaccine is made available to populations throughout the Meningitis belt,\" he said.</p><h4>Affordable for Africa</h4><p>\"The new vaccine is the result of a deliberate effort to get ahead of these epidemics, at a price affordable in Africa. With this vaccine, countries can move away from a reactive response to emergencies towards elimination of the epidemic threat,\" said WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan. She added that WHO will provide technical support for introduction of the vaccine.</p><p>The candidate vaccine has several advantages. Priced at just US$ 0.40 per dose, the vaccine produces in both adults and toddlers a higher immune response than the currently available vaccines. In addition, the new vaccine confers long-term protection and induces immunity in certain non-vaccinated persons who live in proximity of those who are immunized, leading to broad community protection.</p><p>The meningitis prevention and control strategy that these countries will implement entails introducing the new meningococcal A conjugate vaccine to immunize - between 2009 and 2015 - a population of approximately 250 million people aged 1 to 29 years and 23 million infants living in 25 African countries. It also requires ensuring that adequate quantities of the currently available meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines are available for epidemic response. The latter initiative is important for two reasons: first, to ensure a smooth transition from current epidemic response strategies to a preventive approach and, second, to respond to the threat of non-group A meningococcus meningitis outbreaks (group C or W135).</p><p>The meningitis prevention and control strategy was reviewed and endorsed by WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization in April 2008 and by the GAVI Alliance Board in June 2008.</p><h4>'Money well spent'</h4><p>\"Vaccination with the new meningitis vaccine is money well spent. Our initial investment of US$ 55 million towards a meningitis stockpile will greatly help stave off additional outbreaks of this disease,\" said Dr Julian Lob-Leyvt, Executive Secretary of the GAVI Alliance. The GAVI Alliance is a public-private partnership of major stakeholders in immunization including WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank, developing country and donor governments, research and technical agencies in the vaccine industry, civil society and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p><p>The new product, conjugate meningococcal A vaccine (\"MenAfriVac\"), was developed through the Meningitis Vaccine Project, a product development partnership between WHO and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), a non-governmental organization. The project was set up in 2001 with core funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p><p>\"A single case of meningitis can drive a family into a spiral of poverty from which they may never recover. By committing to introducing MenAfriVac in meningitis belt countries, African governments will play a pivotal role in eliminating epidemics that have plagued the continent for more than a century, and they will help reduce poverty,\" said Dr F. Marc LaForce, Director of the Meningitis Vaccine Project.</p><h4>Children specially at risk</h4><p>\"Meningitis outbreaks have devastated communities in the poorest countries of Africa for many years. Children, in particular, are at risk. Now, with the new vaccine that is promising to be effective longer, there is a good chance that we can finally get a grip on the disease and protect all children and parents from this life-threatening disease,\" said Esther Guluma, Regional Director, UNICEF Regional Office for West and Central Africa.</p><p>\"This is a major development in the prevention and control of cerebro-spinal meningitis in the Sahel countries that will reduce the risk of epidemics currently killing thousands of people in the meningitis belt,\" said Dr Luis Gomes Sambo, Director of the WHO Regional Office for Africa.</p><p>The new vaccine is expected to be introduced starting 2009-10 in Burkina Faso and will be phased into an additional 24 countries between 2010 and 2015, with GAVI support. GAVI funding will also go towards ensuring sufficient stocks of the current vaccines are available for epidemic response during the introduction of MenAfriVac.</p><h4>Strain behind deadly outbreaks</h4><p>The candidate conjugate meningococcal A vaccine protects against infection by group A <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> (meningococcus), the strain mainly responsible for deadly outbreaks in 25 \"meningitis belt\" countries. Some 430 million people, living in the area stretching east to west across the continent from Senegal to Ethiopia are at risk of this bacterial disease. Even with antibiotic treatment, at least 10% of patients die and up to 20% have serious permanent health problems as a result of the disease.</p><p>A phase I clinical trial in adults aged 18 to 35 years was successfully completed in India. Phase II clinical trials of the candidate vaccine have been completed in The Gambia and Mali and showed almost 20 times higher antibody levels in one to two year olds, compared to the existing polysaccharide vaccine. (Follow-up of this trial is ongoing.) Phase II/III clinical trials have been successfully completed in two to 29 year olds in The Gambia, Mali and Senegal.</p><p>The vaccine is safe in testing and is manufactured by an Indian company.</p><h4>Next steps</h4><p>The vaccine is expected to be licensed in India in the course of early 2009, and to be submitted for WHO evaluation shortly thereafter. African countries may also register the vaccine during 2009 to allow early introduction.</p><p>An additional large phase III trial will be conducted in India and Mali in early 2009. A phase II study in infants began in Ghana in late August with results expected in 2010. The results of these trials may allow to extend indications for use to infants.</p><p></p>",

The vaccine is designed to prevent periodic epidemics of the deadly disease in these countries.Meeting at the 58th session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa, held in Yaoundé from 1 to 5 September, the ministers adopted the Yaoundé Declaration, committing themselves to several actions. They agreed to prepare comprehensive meningitis control plans, including the introduction of the new vaccine once available; to implement meningitis control strategies; to undertake joint action vis-à-vis the threat; to improve information exchange for epidemic response; and to contribute financially to epidemic control activities.\"Several hundred million people are at risk of meningitis in 25 African countries.

To date, only 22% of the health funding needs have been met.Endemic and epidemic communicable diseases are common in West Africa, with malaria being the main cause of illness and death in the region. Meningitis, cholera and yellow fever also claim scores of lives annually and cause great human suffering, which is only expected to be intensified due to the extra strains placed by the floods on the health sector. An estimated 5 million people also live with HIV/AIDS in the region, whose health care is further compromised by the flooding.The destruction of agricultural lands and loss of crops aggravates the food security crisis in the region. Several West African countries are among the 21 worldwide identified by WHO as being most at risk from the food crisis. Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger are above the global emergency threshold for malnutrition, with over 10% of children under five years of age suffering from acute malnutrition and over 40% with chronic malnutrition. Acute malnutrition develops quickly in vulnerable populations and involves a rapid loss of weight and the greater potential for death, compared with chronic malnutrition (stunting), which develops over a longer time and affects the height and learning abilities of sufferers.In Benin, the current flooding has displaced at least 150 000 people and raising fears of malaria, diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections, especially among children. WHO is helping supply clean water and provide appropriate sanitation, distribute bed nets and essential drugs, and undertake measles vaccinations for children. In Niger, 24 000 people have been displaced, while 12 000 have been displaced in Togo.",

    "lead": "Every day, over 2.5 billion people suffer from a lack of access to improved sanitation and nearly 1.2 billion practise open defecation, the riskiest sanitary practice of all, according to a report issued today by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation. The programme is the official UN mechanism tasked with monitoring progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) Target 7c on drinking water supply and sanitation.The report titled \"Progress on drinking water and sanitation - special focus on sanitation,\" comes halfway through the International Year of Sanitation. The report assesses -- for the first time -- global, regional and country progress using an innovative \"ladder\" concept. This shows sanitation practices in greater detail, enabling experts to highlight trends in using improved, shared and unimproved sanitation facilities and the trend in open defecation. \"Improved sanitation” refers to any facility that hygienically separates human waste from the environment.Similarly, the 'drinking water ladder' shows the percentage of the world population that uses water piped into a dwelling, plot or yard, and other improved water sources such as hand pumps, and unimproved sources.Worldwide, the number of people who lack access to an improved drinking water source (protected from faecal and chemical contamination) has fallen below one billion for the first time since data were first compiled in 1990. At present 87% of the world population has access to improved drinking water sources, with current trends suggesting that more than 90% will do so by 2015.The number of people practising open defecation dropped from 24% in 1990 to 18% in 2006. The report also highlights disparities within national borders, particularly between rural and urban dwellers. Worldwide, there are four times as many people in rural areas – approximately 746 million – without improved water sources, compared to some 137 million urban dwellers.Threats to children's survivalPoor sanitation threatens children's survival as a faecally-contaminated environment is directly linked to diarrhoeal disease, one of the biggest killers of infants under the age of five. A clean environment is very difficult to ensure if open defecation is practised even by a minority of the population.\"At current trends, the world will fall short of the Millennium sanitation target by more than 700 million people,\" said Ann M. Veneman, UNICEF Executive Director. \"Without dramatic improvements, much will be lost.\"However, more and more people are now using improved sanitation facilities, which ensure human excreta are disposed of in a way that prevents them from causing disease by contaminating food and water sources.Though the practice of open defecation is on the decline worldwide, 18% of the world's population, totalling 1.2 billion people, still practise it. In southern Asia, some 778 million people still rely on this risky sanitation practice.\"We have today a full menu of low-cost technical options for the provision of sanitation in most settings,\" said WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan. \"More and more governments are determined to improve health by bringing water and sanitation to their poorest populations.

    "content_html": "<p>People in low-resource countries who are ill with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) will get a faster diagnosis -- in two days, not the standard two to three months -- and appropriate treatment thanks to two new initiatives unveiled today by WHO, the Stop TB Partnership, UNITAID and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND).</p><p>MDR-TB is a form of TB that responds poorly to standard treatment because of resistance to the first-line drugs isoniazid and rifampicin. At present it is estimated that only 2% of MDR-TB cases worldwide are being diagnosed and treated appropriately, mainly because of inadequate laboratory services. The initiatives announced today should increase that proportion at least seven-fold over the next four years, to 15% or more.</p><p>\"I am delighted that this initiative will improve both the technology needed to diagnose TB quickly, and increase the availability of drugs to treat highly resistant TB,\" said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who helped launch the Stop TB Partnership's Global Plan to Stop TB in 2006 and whose government is a founding member of UNITAID. \"The UK is committed to stopping TB around the world, from our funding of TB prevention programmes in poor countries, to our support of cutting edge research to develop new drugs.\"</p><p>In developing countries most TB patients are tested for MDR-TB only after they fail to respond to standard treatments. Even then, it takes two months or more to confirm the diagnosis. Patients have to wait for the test results before they can receive life-saving second-line drugs. During this period, they can spread the multidrug-resistant disease to others. Often the patients die before results are known, especially if they are HIV-infected in addition to having MDR-TB.</p><p>The initiative comes just one week after WHO recommended \"line probe assays\" for rapid MDR-TB diagnosis worldwide. This policy change was driven by data from recent studies, including a large field trial -- conducted by FIND together with South Africa's Medical Research Council and National Health Laboratory Services -- which produced evidence for the reliability and feasibility of using line probe assays under routine conditions.</p><p>\"Five months ago, WHO renewed its call to make MDR-TB an urgent public health priority,\" said WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan, \"and today we have evidence to guide our response. Based on that evidence, we are launching these promising initiatives.\"</p><h4>Two projects</h4><p>The new initiative consists of two projects. The first, made possible through US$ 26.1 million in funding from UNITAID, will introduce a molecular method to diagnose MDR-TB that until now was used exclusively in research settings. These rapid, new molecular tests, known as line probe assays, produce an answer in less than two days.</p><p>Over the next four years -- as lab staff are trained, lab facilities enhanced and new equipment delivered -- 16 countries will begin using rapid methods to diagnose MDR-TB, including the molecular tests. The countries will receive the tests through the Stop TB Partnership's Global Drug Facility, which provides countries with both drugs and diagnostic supplies.</p><p>As part of the project, WHO's Global Laboratory Initiative and FIND will help countries prepare for installation and use of the new rapid diagnostic tests, ensuring necessary technical standards for biosafety and the capacity to accurately perform DNA-based tests. One country, Lesotho, is already equipped to start using these tests; Ethiopia is expected to be ready by the end of 2008. The tests will be phased in during 2009-2011 in the remaining 14 countries.</p><p>Under a second, complementary agreement with UNITAID for US$ 33.7 million, the Global Drug Facility will boost the supply of drugs needed to treat MDR-TB in 54 countries, including those receiving the new diagnostic tests. This project is also expected to achieve price reductions of up to 20% for second-line anti-TB drugs by 2010. All the countries receiving this assistance have met WHO's technical standards for managing MDR-TB and already have treatment programmes in place. Some will use grants from the Global Fund against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to purchase the drugs.</p><p>\"Through the US$ 60-million support provided by UNITAID, these projects are expected to produce significant results in diagnosing and treating patients as well as reducing drug prices and the costs of diagnosis.

      "description": "People in low-resource countries who are ill with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) will get a faster diagnosis -- in two days, not the standard two to three months -- and appropriate treatment thanks to two new initiatives unveiled today by WHO, the Stop TB Partnership, UNITAID and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND).MDR-TB is a form of TB that responds poorly to standard treatment because of resistance to the first-line drugs isoniazid and rifampicin. At present it is estimated that only 2% of MDR-TB cases worldwide are being diagnosed and treated appropriately, mainly because of inadequate laboratory services. The initiatives announced today should increase that proportion at least seven-fold over the next four years, to 15% or more.\"I am delighted that this initiative will improve both the technology needed to diagnose TB quickly, and increase the availability of drugs to treat highly resistant TB,\" said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who helped launch the Stop TB Partnership's Global Plan to Stop TB in 2006 and whose government is a founding member of UNITAID. \"The UK is committed to stopping TB around the world, from our funding of TB prevention programmes in poor countries, to our support of cutting edge research to develop new drugs.\"In developing countries most TB patients are tested for MDR-TB only after they fail to respond to standard treatments. Even then, it takes two months or more to confirm the diagnosis. Patients have to wait for the test results before they can receive life-saving second-line drugs. During this period, they can spread the multidrug-resistant disease to others. Often the patients die before results are known, especially if they are HIV-infected in addition to having MDR-TB.The initiative comes just one week after WHO recommended \"line probe assays\" for rapid MDR-TB diagnosis worldwide. This policy change was driven by data from recent studies, including a large field trial -- conducted by FIND together with South Africa's Medical Research Council and National Health Laboratory Services -- which produced evidence for the reliability and feasibility of using line probe assays under routine conditions.\"Five months ago, WHO renewed its call to make MDR-TB an urgent public health priority,\" said WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan, \"and today we have evidence to guide our response. Based on that evidence, we are launching these promising initiatives.\"Two projectsThe new initiative consists of two projects. The first, made possible through US$ 26.1 million in funding from UNITAID, will introduce a molecular method to diagnose MDR-TB that until now was used exclusively in research settings. These rapid, new molecular tests, known as line probe assays, produce an answer in less than two days.Over the next four years -- as lab staff are trained, lab facilities enhanced and new equipment delivered -- 16 countries will begin using rapid methods to diagnose MDR-TB, including the molecular tests. The countries will receive the tests through the Stop TB Partnership's Global Drug Facility, which provides countries with both drugs and diagnostic supplies.As part of the project, WHO's Global Laboratory Initiative and FIND will help countries prepare for installation and use of the new rapid diagnostic tests, ensuring necessary technical standards for biosafety and the capacity to accurately perform DNA-based tests. One country, Lesotho, is already equipped to start using these tests; Ethiopia is expected to be ready by the end of 2008. The tests will be phased in during 2009-2011 in the remaining 14 countries.Under a second, complementary agreement with UNITAID for US$ 33.7 million, the Global Drug Facility will boost the supply of drugs needed to treat MDR-TB in 54 countries, including those receiving the new diagnostic tests. This project is also expected to achieve price reductions of up to 20% for second-line anti-TB drugs by 2010. All the countries receiving this assistance have met WHO's technical standards for managing MDR-TB and already have treatment programmes in place. Some will use grants from the Global Fund against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to purchase the drugs.\"Through the US$ 60-million support provided by UNITAID, these projects are expected to produce significant results in diagnosing and treating patients as well as reducing drug prices and the costs of diagnosis. These efforts illustrate the way in which innovative financing can be deployed for health and development,\" said Philippe Douste-Blazy, Chairman of UNITAID's Executive Board.",

    "lead": "With major surgery now occurring at a rate of 234 million procedures per year - one for every 25 people - and studies indicating that a significant percentage result in preventable complications and deaths, WHO today launched a new safety checklist for surgical teams to use in operating theatres, as part of a major drive to make surgery safer around the world.\"Preventable surgical injuries and deaths are a growing concern,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO. \"Using the checklist is the best way to reduce surgical errors and improve patient safety.\"Several studies have shown that in industrial countries major complications occur in 3% to 16% of inpatient surgical procedures, and permanent disability or death rates are about 0.4% to 0.8%. In developing countries, studies suggest death rates of 5% to 10 % during major operations. Mortality from general anaesthesia alone is reported to be as high as one in 150 in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Infections and other postoperative complications are also a serious concern around the world. These studies suggest that about half of these complications may be preventable.\"Surgical care has been an essential component of health systems worldwide for more than a century,\" said Dr Atul Gawande, a surgeon and professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. \"Although there have been major improvements over the last few decades, the quality and safety of surgical care has been dismayingly variable in every part of the world. The Safe Surgery Saves Lives initiative aims to change this by raising the standards that patients anywhere can expect.\"The Safe Surgery Saves Lives initiative is a collaborative effort led by the Harvard School of Public Health. More than 200 national and international medical societies and ministries of health are working together to reduce avoidable deaths and complications in surgical care. The WHO surgical safety checklist, developed under the leadership of Dr Gawande, identifies a set of surgical safety standards that can be applied in all countries and health settings.Preliminary results from a thousand patients in eight pilot sites worldwide indicate that the checklist has nearly doubled the likelihood that patients will receive proven standards of surgical care. Use of the checklist in pilot sites has increased the rate of adherence to these standards from 36% to 68% and in some hospitals to almost 100%. This has resulted in substantial reductions in complications and deaths in the 1000 patients. Final results on the impact of the checklist are expected in the next few months.The checklist identifies three phases of an operation, each corresponding to a specific period in the normal flow of work: before the induction of anaesthesia (\"sign in\"), before the incision of the skin (\"time out\") and before the patient leaves the operating room (\"sign out\"). In each phase, a checklist coordinator must confirm that the surgery team has completed the listed tasks before it proceeds with the operation.For example, during the \"sign in\" phase, the coordinator should check whether the surgical site on the patient's body was properly marked and whether the patient's known allergies were checked. During the \"sign out\" phase, instruments, sponges and needles should be counted to check that none of these is accidentally left behind in the patient's body.The checklist released today will be finalized for dissemination by the end of 2008 once the evaluation of the eight pilot studies is complete.Related linksWorld Alliance for Patient Safety",

      "description": "WHO with other key UN agencies will tomorrow make the first high-level international visit to Abyei since last weekend's peace accord in the central west Sudanese town. The mission is to plan for the reconstruction of health facilities and other vital infrastructure in the town, as well as for the return of thousands of people displaced by more than five weeks of insecurity.Fighting commenced in early May and forced Abyei's population to flee to displacement camps and settlements in nearby areas, giving rise to numerous health risks. Most of Abyei's inhabitants remain in Agok, Abathok, Awal, Wun-Peth and Malual Aleu, increasing strains on resources in host communities.The main health risks facing the displaced are malnutrition and lack of access to safe drinking water. There is a high probability of communicable diseases breaking out due to various factors, including the low level of health coverage, overcrowding and poor sanitation in refugee settlements. The ongoing rainy season may cause a rise in acute watery diarrhoea, dysentery and malaria. Viral hemorrhagic fever is also a risk. Intensive primary health care efforts have kept these under control.Following the signing of the Abyei Road Map Agreement, the international community together with the authorities have begun plans to reconstruct the town. WHO is concerned with ensuring the restoration of health services that had been lost during the fighting. Abyei had seven health centres and one hospital.Tomorrow's visit by seniors official of key UN agencies in Sudan will focus on the voluntary return of displaced people to Abyei and reconstruction, including that of its health facilities.

Among its achievements, the Health Assembly produced a public health breakthrough by providing a platform for removing barriers and using innovative methods to encourage research, development and access to medicines for the common diseases of the developing world.</p><p>\"This is a major breakthrough for public health that will benefit many millions of people for many years to come,\" said WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan. \"This is a contribution to fairness in health and this is pro-active public health at its very best.\"</p><p>The <strong>public health, innovation and intellectual property</strong> strategy endorsed by the Health Assembly is designed to promote new approaches to pharmaceutical research and development (R&amp;D), and to enhance access to medicines. It is also designed to provide a medium-term framework for enhancing and making sustainable essential R&amp;D relevant to diseases impacting developing countries. The strategy proposes clear objectives and priorities, and estimates of funding needs in this area.</p><p>Delegates to the Health Assembly directly confronted major public health challenges which are now results of complex interactions of factors beyond health.</p><p>\"At this World Health Assembly, we witnessed the interplay between the political, trade and health interests,\" said the President of the Health Assembly, Dr Leslie Ramsammy who is the Minister of Health of Guyana. \"Child and maternal health, and the prevention and management of noncommunicable diseases rely on the supply chain and commodities. We are now much closer to having an increased flow of quality health commodities that will lead to better health.\"</p><p>The Health Assembly endorsed a six-year action plan to tackle what are now the leading threats to human health: <strong>noncommunicable diseases</strong>. These diseases - particularly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases - caused 60% of all deaths globally in 2005 (estimated at 35 million deaths). Low- and middle-income countries are the worst affected by these diseases which are largely preventable by modifying four common risk factors: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol.</p><p>Delegates also requested WHO - through a resolution - to intensify its work to curb <strong>harmful use of alcohol</strong>, which is the fifth leading risk factor for death and disability in the world. They called upon WHO to develop a global strategy for this purpose. The work on the strategy will start immediately and Member States will be consulted throughout the drafting process. The resolution also requests the Director- General to consult with intergovernmental organizations, health professionals, nongovernmental organizations and economic operators on ways they could contribute to reducing harmful use of alcohol.</p><p>Delegates to the Health Assembly also requested WHO and committed their own Ministries of Health to take action to protect health from <strong>climate change</strong>. They adopted a resolution that urges Member States to take decisive action to address health impacts from climate change, warning of its potential risks on human health. The resolution calls on the health sector</p><ul><li>to scale up adaptation projects that would limit the impacts of climate change on health;</li><li>to raise global awareness of the impacts of health from climate change at national and international levels; and</li><li>to boost political attention and action.</li></ul><p>Member States also called on WHO to develop and strengthen the evidence base on links between climate change and health, and to help developing countries address health impacts from climate change.</p><p>The Health Assembly's actions were not limited to new challenges.

      "description": "The global burden of disease is shifting from infectious diseases to noncommunicable diseases, with chronic conditions such as heart disease and stroke now being the chief causes of death globally, according to a new WHO report published today. The shifting health trends indicate that leading infectious diseases – diarrhoea, HIV, tuberculosis, neonatal infections and malaria – will become less important causes of death globally over the next 20 years.World health statistics 2008 is based on data collected from WHO's 193 Member States. This annual report is the most authoritative reference for a set of 73 health indicators in countries around the world. These are the best available data and they are essential for painting the global picture of health and how it is changing.“We are definitely seeing a trend towards fewer people dying of infectious diseases across the world,” said Dr Ties Boerma, Director of the WHO Department of Health Statistics and Informatics. “We tend to associate developing countries with infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. But in more and more countries the chief causes of death are noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease and stroke.”The statistical report documents in detail the levels of mortality in children and adults, patterns of morbidity and burden of disease, prevalence of risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, use of health care, availability of health care workers, and health care financing. It also draws attention to important issues in global health, including:Maternal mortality: in developed countries, nine mothers die for every 100 000 live births, while in developing countries the death rate is 450 and in sub-Saharan Africa it is 950.Life expectancy trends in Europe: life expectancy in eastern Europe increased from an average of 64.2 years in 1950 to 67.8 years in 2005, representing an increase of only about four years compared with 9 to 15 years for the rest of Europe.Health-care costs: 100 million people are impoverished every year by paying out of pocket for health care.Coverage of key maternal, neonatal and child health interventions: four out of 10 women and children do not receive basic preventive and curative interventions and at current rates of progress it will take several decades before this gap is closed.World health statistics 2008 is the official record of data produced by WHO’s technical programmes and regional offices in close consultation with countries and in collaboration with researchers and development agencies. In publishing these statistics, WHO underlines continuing health challenges and provides an evidence base for strategies to improve global public health.",

      "description": "Scientists tell us that the evidence the Earth is warming is \"unequivocal.\" Increases in global average air and sea temperature, ice melting and rising global sea levels all help us understand and prepare for the coming challenges. In addition to these observed changes, climate-sensitive impacts on human health are occurring today. They are attacking the pillars of public health. And they are providing a glimpse of the challenges public health will have to confront on a large scale, WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan warned today on the occasion of World Health Day.\"The core concern is succinctly stated: climate change endangers human health,\" said Dr Chan. \"The warming of the planet will be gradual, but the effects of extreme weather events -- more storms, floods, droughts and heat waves -- will be abrupt and acutely felt. Both trends can affect some of the most fundamental determinants of health: air, water, food, shelter and freedom from disease.\"Human beings are already exposed to the effects of climate-sensitive diseases and these diseases today kill millions. They include malnutrition, which causes over 3.5 million deaths per year, diarrhoeal diseases, which kill over 1.8 million, and malaria, which kills almost 1 million.Examples already provide us with images of the future:European heat wave, 2003: Estimates suggest that approximately 70 000 more people died in that summer than would have been expected.Rift Valley fever in Africa: Major outbreaks are usually associated with rains, which are expected to become more frequent as the climate changes.Hurricane Katrina, 2005: More than 1 800 people died and thousands more were displaced. Additionally, health facilities throughout the region were destroyed critically affecting health infrastructure.Malaria in the East African highlands: In the last 30 years, warmer temperatures have also created more favourable conditions for mosquito populations in the region and therefore for transmission of malaria.Epidemics of cholera in Bangladesh: They are closely linked to flooding and unsafe water.These trends and events cannot be attributed solely to climate change but they are the types of challenges we expect to become more frequent and intense with climate changes. They will further strain health resources that, in many regions, are already under severe stress.\"Although climate change is a global phenomenon, its consequences will not be evenly distributed,\" said Dr Chan. \"In short, climate change can affect problems that are already huge, largely concentrated in the developing world, and difficult to control.\"To address the health effects of climate change, WHO is coordinating and supporting research and assessment on the most effective measures to protect health from climate change, particularly for vulnerable populations such as women and children in developing countries, and is advising Member States on the necessary adaptive changes to their health systems to protect their populations.WHO and its partners -- including the UN Environment Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the UN World Meteorological Organization -- are devising a workplan and research agenda to get better estimates of the scale and nature of health vulnerability and to identify strategies and tools for health protection.

    "content_html": "<p> </p><p>The <em>Global tuberculosis control 2008</em>, released today by WHO, finds that the pace of the progress to control the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic slowed slightly in 2006, the most recent year for which data were available. The new information documents a slowdown in progress on diagnosing people with TB. Between 2001 to 2005, the average rate at which new TB cases were detected was increasing by 6% per year; but between 2005 and 2006 that rate of increase was cut in half, to 3%.</p><p>The reason for this slowing of progress is that some national programmes that were making rapid strides during the previous five years have been unable to continue at the same pace in 2006. Moreover, in most African countries there has been no increase in the detection of TB cases through national programmes. Other studies have also shown that many patients are treated by private care providers, and by non-governmental, faith-based and community organizations, thus escaping detection by the public programmes.</p><p>\"We've entered a new era,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \"To make progress, firstly public programmes must be further strengthened. Secondly, we need to fully tap the potential of other service providers. Enlisting these other providers, working in partnership with national programmes, will markedly increase diagnosis and treatment for people in need.\"</p><p>This is the 12th annual WHO report on global TB control, and is based on data given to WHO by 202 countries and territories. There were 9.2 million new cases of TB in 2006, including 700 000 cases among people living with HIV, and 500 000 cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). An estimated 1.5 million people died from TB in 2006. In addition, another 200 000 people with HIV died from HIV-associated TB.</p><h4>Two potential barriers to progress</h4><p>The report highlights two aspects of the epidemic that could further slow progress on TB. The first is multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), reported by WHO last month to have reached the highest levels ever recorded. To date, however, the response to this epidemic has been inadequate. Given limited laboratory and treatment capacity, countries project they will provide treatment only to an estimated 10% of people with MDR-TB worldwide in 2008.</p><p>The second threat to continued progress is the lethal combination of TB and HIV, which is fuelling the TB epidemic in many parts of the world, especially Africa. Although TB/HIV remains a massive challenge, some countries are making strides against the co-epidemic. Almost 700 000 TB patients were tested for HIV in 2006, up from 22 000 in 2002 - a sign of progress but still far from the 2006 target of 1.6 million set by the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015. The three African countries achieving the highest HIV testing rates in TB care settings in 2006 were Rwanda (76%), Malawi (64%) and Kenya (60%).</p><p>\"The report tells us that we are far from providing universal access to high-quality prevention, diagnostic, treatment and care services for HIV and TB,\" said Dr Peter Piot, Executive Director of UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. \"Clear progress has been made but we must all do more to make a joint approach to reducing TB deaths among people with HIV a reality.\"</p><p>The report also documents a shortage in funding. Despite an increase in resources, especially from the Global Fund and some middle-income countries, TB budgets are projected to remain flat in 2008 in almost all of the countries most heavily burdened by the disease. Ninety countries in which 91% of the world's TB cases occur provided complete financial data for the report. To meet the 2008 targets of the Global Plan to Stop TB, the funding shortfall for these 90 countries is about US$ 1 billion.</p><p>\"We look forward to working with all partners to further assist countries to achieve TB targets for 2015 and beyond,\" said Dr Michel Kazatchkine, Executive Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. \"Together we are bringing hope to the individuals and communities suffering from the enormous burden of TB.\" In recognition of World TB Day on 24 March, Dr Jorge Sampaio, former President of Portugal and the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy to Stop TB, called for enhanced leadership to address TB/HIV. \"TB is a leading cause of death among people living with HIV/AIDS,\" he said. \"Several countries have shown that targets relating to TB/HIV are achievable and have put in place measures that will have an impact on the lives of those at most risk.

The Forum, held in Kampala, Uganda, and organized by the Global Health Workforce Alliance (GHWA), mandated the Alliance to monitor progress made on the Agenda and report its findings in 2010. \"Health workers are the cornerstone of health systems and action is long overdue. This Forum and the Agenda bring much needed attention to the issue,\" said WHO Deputy Director-General Dr Anarfi Asamoa-Baah who spoke at the Forum.</p><p>The Agenda calls on all countries to give top priority to training and recruiting sufficient health personnel from within their own country and to provide adequate incentives and better working conditions to ensure the retention of health workers. It calls on international and regional financial institutions to relax constraints such as public health recruitment ceilings, and calls on WHO to accelerate negotiations for a code of practice on the international recruitment of health workers.</p><p>\"This is about much more than a health issue. It is about political choice. It is about quality of life and the dignity of individuals. Therefore, providing health workers for all is the responsibility of all societies and their governments,\" said Dr Francis Omaswa, Executive Director of GHWA, which is based at WHO.</p><p>WHO estimates that the world needs over 4 million additional health workers, and 57 countries are suffering from an acute shortage. Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly affected by this crisis, with one million health workers needed for this region alone.</p><div><h3>Related links</h3><p><a href=\"/teams/health-workforce/network\">Global Health Workforce Alliance</a></p></div><p> </p>",

      "description": "The first Global Forum on Human Resources for Health called for immediate and sustained action to resolve the critical shortage of health workers around the world, setting out the essential steps that need to be taken over the next decade to turn the crisis around.Nearly 1500 participants, including donors, experts and more than 30 ministers of health, education and finance, endorsed the Kampala Declaration and Agenda for Global Action. The Forum, held in Kampala, Uganda, and organized by the Global Health Workforce Alliance (GHWA), mandated the Alliance to monitor progress made on the Agenda and report its findings in 2010. \"Health workers are the cornerstone of health systems and action is long overdue. This Forum and the Agenda bring much needed attention to the issue,\" said WHO Deputy Director-General Dr Anarfi Asamoa-Baah who spoke at the Forum.The Agenda calls on all countries to give top priority to training and recruiting sufficient health personnel from within their own country and to provide adequate incentives and better working conditions to ensure the retention of health workers. It calls on international and regional financial institutions to relax constraints such as public health recruitment ceilings, and calls on WHO to accelerate negotiations for a code of practice on the international recruitment of health workers.\"This is about much more than a health issue. It is about political choice. It is about quality of life and the dignity of individuals. Therefore, providing health workers for all is the responsibility of all societies and their governments,\" said Dr Francis Omaswa, Executive Director of GHWA, which is based at WHO.WHO estimates that the world needs over 4 million additional health workers, and 57 countries are suffering from an acute shortage. Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly affected by this crisis, with one million health workers needed for this region alone.Related linksGlobal Health Workforce Alliance",

    "lead": "WHO today released new data showing that while progress has been made, not a single country fully implements all key tobacco control measures, and outlined an approach that governments can adopt to prevent tens of millions of premature deaths by the middle of this century.In a new report which presents the first comprehensive analysis of global tobacco use and control efforts, WHO finds that only 5% of the world’s population live in countries that fully protect their population with any one of the key measures that reduce smoking rates. The report also reveals that governments around the world collect 500 times more money in tobacco taxes each year than they spend on anti-tobacco efforts. It finds that tobacco taxes, the single most effective strategy, could be significantly increased in nearly all countries, providing a source of sustainable funding to implement and enforce the recommended approach, a package of six policies called MPOWER (see below).“While efforts to combat tobacco are gaining momentum, virtually every country needs to do more. These six strategies are within the reach of every country, rich or poor and, when combined as a package, they offer us the best chance of reversing this growing epidemic,” said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO. Dr Chan launched the WHO Report of the Global Tobacco Epidemic at a news conference with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg Philanthropies helped fund the report.“The report released today is revolutionary,” Mayor Bloomberg said. “For the first time, we have both a rigorous approach to stop the tobacco epidemic and solid data to hold us all accountable. No country fully implements all of the MPOWER policies and 80% of countries don’t fully implement even one policy. While tobacco control measures are sometimes controversial, they save lives and governments need to step up and do the right thing.”The six MPOWER strategies are:Monitor tobacco use and prevention policiesProtect people from tobacco smokeOffer help to quit tobacco useWarn about the dangers of tobaccoEnforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorshipRaise taxes on tobaccoThe report also documents the epidemic's shift to the developing world, where 80% of the more than eight million annual tobacco-related deaths projected by 2030 are expected to occur.This shift, the report says, results from a global tobacco industry strategy to target young people and adults in the developing world, ensuring that millions of people become fatally addicted every year. The targeting of young women in particular is highlighted as one of the “most ominous potential developments of the epidemic’s growth\".The global analysis, compiled by WHO with information provided by 179 Member States, gives governments and other groups a baseline from which to monitor efforts to stop the epidemic in the years ahead. The MPOWER package provides countries with a roadmap to help them meet their commitments to the widely embraced global tobacco treaty known as the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which came into force in 2005.WHO is also working with global partners to scale up the help that can be offered to countries to implement the strategies.Dr Douglas Bettcher, Director of WHO’s Tobacco Free Initiative, said the six MPOWER strategies would create a powerful response to the tobacco epidemic. “This package will create an enabling environment to help current tobacco users quit, protect people from second-hand smoke and prevent young people from taking up the habit,” he said.Other key findings in the report include:Only 5% of the global population is protected by comprehensive national smoke-free legislation and 40% of countries still allow smoking in hospitals and schools;Only 5% of the world’s population lives in countries with comprehensive national bans on tobacco advertising and promotion;Just 15 countries, representing 6% of the global population, mandate pictorial warnings on tobacco packaging;Services to treat tobacco dependence are fully available in only nine countries, covering 5% of the world’s people;Tobacco tax revenues are more than 4000 times greater than spending on tobacco control in middle-income countries and more than 9000 times greater in lower-income countries.

    "content_html": "<p>The Executive Board of the World Health Organization (WHO) began its twice-yearly session today on an optimistic note with a report highlighting progress in many areas of public health from the Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan.</p><p>Before describing progress however, Dr Chan drew attention to current threats to health arising from instability and civil unrest, which disrupt routine health services and compromise access to basic and emergency care. In reviewing the events of the last year, Dr Chan highlighted three trends that gave her personal encouragement.</p><p>First, she cited the increasing willingness of development partners, UN agencies, and funding facilities to invest in health systems, calling this a \"striking and welcome change from the past.\"</p><p>Secondly, she applauded the acceptance of climate change as a reality by world leaders. \"Up to now, the polar bear has been the poster child for climate change. We must use every scientifically sound and politically correct mechanism in the book to convince leaders that humanity really is the most important species endangered by climate change,\" Dr Chan told Board Members.</p><p>\"According to the latest projections, released in November, Africa will be severely affected by as early as 2020. This is just a dozen years away.

The study results could significantly change the way the illness is managed in developing countries, saving a significant number of lives every year and taking pressure off health systems.</p><p>The research, conducted in Pakistan by researchers from the Boston University School of Public Health and supported by WHO and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is published this week in <em>The Lancet</em> medical journal. It involved 2037 children with severe pneumonia who were randomly assigned to get either injectable antibiotics in a hospital or antibiotic pills at home. The trial was the first to compare the outcomes of hospital treatment of severe pneumonia with home-based treatment, and the results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of treating it with oral antibiotics outside of a hospital setting.</p><p>Pneumonia is the largest single killer of children under five around the world. Almost four children die from pneumonia every minute. About 60% of pneumonia cases in the developing world are caused by bacteria and can be treated with antibiotics, whereas most cases of pneumonia in developed countries are viral.</p><p>In the study, there were 87 (8.6%) treatment failures in the hospitalized group, and 77 (7.5%) in the group treated at home. Of the five children (0.2%) who died during the study, four were in the hospitalized group and one was at home.</p><p>This study confirmed the findings of three other trials in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America, which showed that oral antibiotics were just as effective as injectable antibiotics in treating hospitalized children with severe pneumonia.</p><h4>Far-reaching implications</h4><p>\"The potential impact of these results is enormous,\" said the article’s co-author Dr Shamim Qazi, Medical Officer with the WHO’s Department of Child and Adolescent Health and Development. \"Effective management of pneumonia is critical to improving child survival. Being able to treat children with severe pneumonia safely and effectively in their own homes would be of huge benefit to both families and health systems, by reducing the need for admission to hospital. We will be updating WHO guidelines in 2008 to reflect this new evidence.\"</p><p>“This confirmatory research in Pakistan, when implemented into programmes around the globe, will increase access to critical care in disadvantaged communities and support the potential to diagnose and treat severe pneumonia by community health workers,” said Dr Alfred Bartlett, Senior Advisor for Child Survival, USAID. “These findings promise to build upon an existing approach endorsed by WHO and UNICEF, for treatment of non-severe pneumonia, that is already contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.”</p><p>The current guidelines advise health workers to provide oral antibiotics for cases of non-severe pneumonia and to refer severe and very severe cases to hospitals for treatment with antibiotics by injection. However, many children with severe pneumonia who are currently referred for admission to a hospital either die before they reach there or are so sick by the time they arrive that nothing more can be done to save them.</p><p>A small number of cases of very severe pneumonia (around 2-3% of all pneumonia cases) will still require treatment with injectable antibiotics in a hospital.</p><p>Families in the poorest countries, where the majority of children are affected by pneumonia, may not have easy access to hospitals. In-patient treatment may not be an option for parents who cannot leave their homes to accompany the sick child. In addition, children with severe pneumonia are vulnerable to infections as a result of weak immunity and could be at increased risk in crowded hospital wards. A community-based approach would bring treatment to people's homes, so that children with pneumonia can be identified and begin treatment before the onset of life-threatening complications.</p><p></p>",

      "description": "Treating children with severe pneumonia at home is just as effective as treating them in hospitals, a new study has found. The study results could significantly change the way the illness is managed in developing countries, saving a significant number of lives every year and taking pressure off health systems.The research, conducted in Pakistan by researchers from the Boston University School of Public Health and supported by WHO and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is published this week in The Lancet medical journal. It involved 2037 children with severe pneumonia who were randomly assigned to get either injectable antibiotics in a hospital or antibiotic pills at home. The trial was the first to compare the outcomes of hospital treatment of severe pneumonia with home-based treatment, and the results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of treating it with oral antibiotics outside of a hospital setting.Pneumonia is the largest single killer of children under five around the world. Almost four children die from pneumonia every minute. About 60% of pneumonia cases in the developing world are caused by bacteria and can be treated with antibiotics, whereas most cases of pneumonia in developed countries are viral.In the study, there were 87 (8.6%) treatment failures in the hospitalized group, and 77 (7.5%) in the group treated at home. Of the five children (0.2%) who died during the study, four were in the hospitalized group and one was at home.This study confirmed the findings of three other trials in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America, which showed that oral antibiotics were just as effective as injectable antibiotics in treating hospitalized children with severe pneumonia.Far-reaching implications\"The potential impact of these results is enormous,\" said the article’s co-author Dr Shamim Qazi, Medical Officer with the WHO’s Department of Child and Adolescent Health and Development. \"Effective management of pneumonia is critical to improving child survival. Being able to treat children with severe pneumonia safely and effectively in their own homes would be of huge benefit to both families and health systems, by reducing the need for admission to hospital. We will be updating WHO guidelines in 2008 to reflect this new evidence.\"“This confirmatory research in Pakistan, when implemented into programmes around the globe, will increase access to critical care in disadvantaged communities and support the potential to diagnose and treat severe pneumonia by community health workers,” said Dr Alfred Bartlett, Senior Advisor for Child Survival, USAID. “These findings promise to build upon an existing approach endorsed by WHO and UNICEF, for treatment of non-severe pneumonia, that is already contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.”The current guidelines advise health workers to provide oral antibiotics for cases of non-severe pneumonia and to refer severe and very severe cases to hospitals for treatment with antibiotics by injection. However, many children with severe pneumonia who are currently referred for admission to a hospital either die before they reach there or are so sick by the time they arrive that nothing more can be done to save them.A small number of cases of very severe pneumonia (around 2-3% of all pneumonia cases) will still require treatment with injectable antibiotics in a hospital.Families in the poorest countries, where the majority of children are affected by pneumonia, may not have easy access to hospitals. In-patient treatment may not be an option for parents who cannot leave their homes to accompany the sick child. In addition, children with severe pneumonia are vulnerable to infections as a result of weak immunity and could be at increased risk in crowded hospital wards. A community-based approach would bring treatment to people's homes, so that children with pneumonia can be identified and begin treatment before the onset of life-threatening complications.",
