          "Today, WHO endorsed a new and novel rapid test for tuberculosis (TB), especially relevant in countries most affected by the disease. The test could revolutionize TB care and control by providing an accurate diagnosis for many patients in about 100 minutes, compared to current tests that can take up to three months to have results."

          "WHO's endorsement of the rapid test, which is a fully automated NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test) follows 18 months of rigorous assessment of its field effectiveness in the early diagnosis of TB, as well as multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and TB complicated by HIV infection, which are more difficult to diagnose."

          "Many countries still rely principally on sputum smear microscopy, a diagnostic method that was developed over a century ago. But this new 'while you wait' test incorporates modern DNA technology that can be used outside of conventional laboratories. It also benefits from being fully automated and therefore easy and safe to use.",
          "WHO is now calling for the fully automated NAAT to be rolled out under clearly defined conditions and as part of national plans for TB and MDR-TB care and control. Policy and operational guidance are also being issued based on findings from a series of expert reviews and a global consultation held last week in Geneva. The consultation was attended by more than a hundred representatives from national programmes, development aid agencies and international partners."

Co-developer FIND (the Foundation for Innovative and New Diagnostics) is announcing today it has negotiated with the manufacturer, Cepheid, a 75% reduction in the price for countries most affected by TB, compared to the current market price. Preferential pricing will be granted to 116 low- and middle- income countries where TB is endemic, with additional reduction in price once there is significant volume of demand.",
          "\"There has been a strong commitment to remove any obstacles, including financial barriers, that could prevent the successful roll-out of this new technology,\" said Dr Giorgio Roscigno, FIND's Chief Executive Officer. \"For the first time in TB control, we are enabling access to state-of-the-art technology simultaneously in low, middle and high income countries. The technology also allows testing of other diseases, which should further increase efficiency.\"",
          "WHO is also releasing recommendations and guidance for countries to incorporate this test in their programs. This includes testing protocols (or algorithms) to optimize the use and benefits of the new technology in those persons where it is needed most.",

Industry representatives affirmed their wish to cooperate in making supplies available to developing countries, and said they stood ready to produce the vaccine when requested.",

Influenza A(H1N1) has a very different clinical picture, which is so far mostly mild and self-limiting, unlike H5N1, which had a 50% to 60% mortality rate. She said that at the on-going World Health Assembly, Member States had asked that WHO reflect criteria other than geographical spread before moving to Phase 6.

But malaria drug resistance now emerging along the Thai-Cambodia border threatens these gains.",

          "Obstacles to malaria control include drug resistance in the parasite that causes the disease, as well as resistance of the vector mosquito to insecticides, environmental factors and counterfeit medicines. The likelihood of drug resistance is increased with the use of single-drug therapies for malaria, especially monotherapies of artemisinin and its derivatives. Monotherapy fosters resistance because it is easier for the parasite to adapt and eventually overcome the obstacles presented by a single drug than a combination of drugs delivered together. This makes it crucial for monotherapies to be removed from the market. WHO's treatment policy is to treat all cases of uncomplicated falciparum malaria with artemisinin combination therapy (ACTs).",

The Health Assembly also passed the Programme Budget for 2010 -2011.",
          "WHO Member States had earlier agreed to shorten the Health Assembly from nine to five days in order to allow senior officials to return to their home countries to help oversee preparedness for a possible influenza pandemic.",
          "The President of the 62nd World Health Assembly, Mr Nimal S. De Silva, Minister for Healthcare and Nutrition of Sri Lanka, noted that despite the fact that the session had been curtailed to five days, delegates could be proud of the fact that they had deliberated and agreed on pressing issues on the world health agenda. \"The cooperation and flexibility that the delegations had shown in agreeing on contentious issues is commendable,\" he said.",

Laboratory testing, contact tracing, and investigation of cases are disruptive and resource-intensive measures, raising questions about sustainability. Referring to a dilemma, she noted that such efforts have already yielded important clues at the scientific, clinical, and epidemiological levels, though much remains to be learned.",

They also agreed to strengthen measures to make access universal to M/XDR-TB diagnosis and quality treatment. Research for new TB diagnostics, medicines and vaccines is prioritized under the resolution through support for extra financing. At the same time, WHO will also work with Member States to develop national TB response plans that will prevent more people from getting drug-resistant tuberculosis, and diagnose and treat those that do.",

The plan of action aims, among other things, to foster innovation and improve access to medicines for diseases that disproportionately affect the poor.",

The plan contains actions for Member States, international partners and the WHO secretariat aimed at strengthening commitment at global and national levels to eliminate avoidable blindness. Actions are also aimed at strengthening national eye health policies and plans, increasing research to prevent blindness, improving coordination between partners and stakeholders to scale up efforts, and monitoring progress in elimination of avoidable blindness at national, regional and global levels.",

The study, which was supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and published in The Lancet medical journal, found that 2.6 million young people are dying each year, with 97% of these deaths taking place in low- and middle-income countries.",
          "There are more young people in the world today than ever before -- 1.8 billion, accounting for 30% of the world's population. Until now, there has been very little information available on the causes of death among young people globally and by region. This study is intended to inform the development of policies and programmes to ensure that they improve the lives, and prevent the deaths, of young people.",
          "Daisy Mafubelu, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Family and Community Health, said: \"Young people are transitioning from childhood to adulthood - at the threshold of becoming productive members of society - yet they often fall through the cracks. It is clear from these findings that considerable investment is needed - not only from the health sector, but also from sectors including education, welfare, transport, and justice - to improve access to information and services, and help young people avoid risky behaviours that can lead to death.\""

          "However, the 2009 global TB control report also reveals that one out of four TB deaths is HIV-related, twice as many as previously recognized. In 2007, there were an estimated 1.37 million new cases of tuberculosis among HIV-infected people and 456 000 deaths. This figure reflects an improvement in the quality of the country data, which are now more representative and available from more countries than in previous years.",
          "\"These findings point to an urgent need to find, prevent and treat tuberculosis in people living with HIV and to test for HIV in all patients with TB in order to provide prevention, treatment and care. Countries can only do that through stronger collaborative programmes and stronger health systems that address both diseases,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO."

          "Because of increased testing for HIV among TB patients, more people are getting appropriate treatment though the numbers still remain a small fraction of those in need. In 2007, 200 000 HIV-positive TB patients were enrolled on co-trimoxazole treatment to prevent opportunistic infections and 100 000 were on antiretroviral therapy.",

          "Given the current financial crisis, the report documents concerns over an increasing shortage in funding. Ninety-four countries in which 93% of the world's TB cases occur provided complete financial data for the report. To meet the 2009 milestones in the Stop TB Partnership's Global Plan to Stop TB, the funding shortfall for these 94 countries has risen to about US$ 1.5 billion. Full funding of the Global Plan will achieve its aim of halving TB prevalence and deaths compared with 1990 levels by 2015.",
          "\"We have made remarkable progress against both TB and HIV in the last few years. But, TB still kills more people with HIV than any other disease,\" said Dr Michel Kazatchkine, Executive Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. \"The financial crisis must not derail the implementation of the Global Plan to Stop TB. Now is the time to scale-up financing for effective interventions for the prevention, treatment and care of TB worldwide.\"",
          "The release of the report today coincides with World TB Day and a 1500-strong gathering at the 3rd Stop TB Partners’ Forum in Rio de Janeiro. Next week health leaders and ministers will gather in Beijing in a meeting organized by WHO, the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with the aim of securing commitments to actions and funding for drug-resistant TB."

We are extremely excited about the potential to offer African and Asian countries funding to introduce rotavirus vaccines.”",
          "Because oral vaccines can have variable efficacy in different populations, it was important to demonstrate vaccine performance in high-mortality settings. The studies in Africa were conducted among populations with high infant and child mortality, poor sanitary conditions, high diarrhoeal disease mortality and high maternal HIV prevalence.",
          "“The new evidence and the WHO recommendation are major breakthroughs for the health of our children,” said Dr Oyewale Tomori, Vice-Chancellor of Redeemer's University, Nigeria, who has served as Regional Laboratory Coordinator for WHO in the African Region. “Too many of our children are dying from rotavirus and other causes of diarrhoea. We urgently need these lifesaving vaccines against rotavirus.”"

While efficacy data from Asian countries are forthcoming, SAGE recommended rotavirus vaccines for all populations, including Asia, since available evidence indicates that efficacy data can be extrapolated to populations with similar mortality patterns regardless of geographic location.",

          "Approximately 400 000 infants acquire HIV infection each year as a result of mother-to-child transmission. To reduce this risk WHO recommends that all women with HIV should receive antiretroviral drugs to protect against HIV transmission during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding.",

          "“Virtual elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV by 2015 is possible,” said Dr Paul De Lay, UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director, Programmes. “Relatively small investments can go a long way in saving mothers and babies.”",
          "The recommendations on infants dovetail with WHO's new recommendations for women with HIV, which advise earlier treatment for all eligible women, including pregnant mothers.",

Now, WHO says mothers may safely breastfeed provided that they or their infants receive ARV drugs during the breastfeeding period. This has been shown to give infants the best chance to be protected from HIV transmission in settings where breastfeeding is the best option."

The release of the first-ever WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children identified medicines that should be available for use in children. The development of the WHO Model Formulary for Children builds on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children by providing prescribing guidance and is part of a series of activities WHO has undertaken as part of the \"Make medicines child size\" campaign and the Better Medicines for Children initiative.

          "These forms of TB do not respond to the standard six-month treatment with first-line anti-TB drugs and can take up to two years or more to treat with drugs that are less potent, more toxic and much more expensive, from 50 to 200 times higher. While a course of standard TB drugs cost approximately US$ 20, MDR-TB drugs can cost up to US$ 5 000, and XDR-TB treatment is far more expensive.",

No official estimates have been made on the number of XDR-TB cases, but there may be around 25 000 a year with most cases fatal. Since XDR-TB was first defined in 2006, a total of 58 countries have reported at least one case of XDR-TB.",

Planned budget for 2010 are far below these figures, amounting to less than US$ 0.5 billion for all 27 countries. Actual funding available for 2010 was US$ 280 million. Funding needed for MDR-TB control in 2015 will be 16 times higher than what is currently available in 2010.",

EXPAND TB is a five year project targeting 27 countries, launched in 2008 and implemented by WHO, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), the Stop TB Partnership's Global Drug Facility (GDF) and the Global Laboratory Initiative (GLI) with financial support from UNITAID. So far it has carried out a wide range of activities in 12 countries, including upgrading of infrastructure and training of staff. Technology transfer has started in countries, paving the way for more patients to be diagnosed accurately and rapidly enrolled on treatment. These upgrades should lead to eventual routine surveillance of drug resistance in affected countries.",

Bangladesh (one of the very few developing countries in which continuous surveillance among previously treated TB cases is being carried out in selected areas); China (first nationwide drug resistance survey conducted); Ethiopia (one of the first countries to introduce rapid molecular laboratory tests); Nepal and Romania (successful treatments of MDR-TB through Green Light Committee Initiative programmes); South Africa (policy changes for improving the management and care of M/XDR-TB).",
          "MDR-TB in Africa",
          "In Africa, there is a low percentage of MDR-TB reported among new TB cases compared with that in regions such as Eastern Europe and Central Asia, due in part to the limited laboratory capacity to conduct drug resistance surveys. Latest estimates of WHO put the number of MDR-TB cases emerging in 2008 in Africa at 69 000. Previous reports found high levels of mortality among people living with HIV and infected with MDR-TB and XDR-TB. In KwaZulu Natal in South Africa, an outbreak of XDR-TB killed 52 out of 53 people within three weeks, most of whom were HIV positive.",

Similar findings have been made in studies from Lithuania, Ukraine and Mozambique.",

          "This report presents drug resistance data from 114 countries and updated information from 35 of them. Despite the growing understanding of the magnitude and trends in drug-resistant TB, major gaps remain in geographical areas covered. Since 1994, only 59% of all countries globally have been able to collect high quality representative data on drug resistance. There is an urgent need to obtain information, particularly from Africa and those high MDR-TB burden countries where data have never been reported: Bangladesh, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Nigeria. Moreover, countries need to expand the scope of their surveys to cover entire populations, repeat surveys are needed to better understand trends in drug resistance and countries need to move towards adopting systematic continuous surveillance."

Merck & Co., the company that discovered and manufactures the drug, agreed in 1987 to donate the drug free of charge to countries where onchocerciasis is endemic. This has resulted in annual treatments to all eligible community members – over 60 million people were treated in 26 African countries in 2008. But although this large-scale treatment has enabled the control of onchocerciasis in Africa, it has not been clear whether it could also be used to eliminate infection and transmission to the extent that treatment with ivermectin could be safely stopped. Many scientists have doubted whether onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin is feasible in Africa, where more than 99% of cases are found.",
          "This new study in three areas in Mali and Senegal where onchocerciasis was endemic has now provided the first evidence of the feasibility of onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin in some endemic areas in Africa. Previously, it was thought that elimination of onchocerciasis was only possible in the limited, isolated areas in the Americas where the disease is endemic.",
          "However, the studies showed that after 15 to 17 years of six-monthly or annual treatments, only a few infections remained in the human population. Transmission levels were below predicted thresholds for elimination, so treatment was subsequently stopped in test areas and follow-up evaluations after 1.5 to 2 years showed that no further infections or transmission occurred."

          "Speaking at the United Nations Headquarters in New York today, Dr Chan said that it is time to build policies based on fairness – using differences in the health status of populations within and between countries – as the “key measure of how we, as a civilized society, are making progress.”",
          "“The world is in such a great big mess,” she said at the UN Secretary-General’s Forum on Advancing Global Health in the Face of Crisis on Monday. The meeting was attended by senior government officials and experts in health and international development.",
          "In the last year, this warming world has suffered a fuel crisis, a food crisis and a financial crisis. This list of challenges grew last week with the addition of pandemic influenza.",
          "The impact of these crises is not felt equally. Pandemic influenza, for example, will hit hardest in developing countries, which have large vulnerable populations. With their weak health systems, these struggling countries will take longer to recover. In many ways, developing countries facing the pandemic are virtually empty-handed, said Dr Chan.",
          "“Fairness, I believe, is at the heart of our ambitions for global health,” she told the world’s ambassadors. But fairness is in short supply. Differences in income, life expectancy, and opportunities are greater now than at any time in recent history. These extremes of privilege and misery, Dr Chan noted, are often “a precursor for social breakdown.”",
          "The soul-searching following the financial crisis has led to a questioning of “blind faith in economic growth.” From this self-examination, leaders are calling for a restoration of other values, especially fairness, to a central role in policy formation.",
          "“We hear clear calls, from leaders around the world, to give the international systems a moral dimension,” said Dr Chan, “to redesign them to respond to social values and concerns... A focus on health as a worthy pursuit for its own sake is the surest route to the moral dimension, the surest route to a value system that puts the welfare of humanity at its heart. Greater equity in the health status of populations, within and between countries, should be regarded as key measure of how we, as a civilized society, are making progress.”",
          "One method for achieving fairness, she suggested, would be for more countries to embrace primary health care. As she noted, a primary health care approach introduces greater fairness as well as efficiency, and allows health systems to reach their potential as cohesive, stabilizing social institutions."

Countries can use this to encourage more young people to become donors.\"",
          "Figures from the 2008 Blood Safety Survey 1 reveal that 14 countries collect more than half of their total donations from under 25s: Botswana, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Guinea, India, Jordan, Kiribati, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malawi, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Korea, Tuvalu, Viet Nam, and Zimbabwe .",
          "Standard age limits for blood donation are 18 to 65 years of age, but in some countries donations are accepted from people as young as 16 years, provided their parents consent. Voluntary unpaid donations are preferred over paid donations because supplies are generally safer, and there is less risk of donor exploitation. Evidence suggests that voluntary donations also promote other healthy lifestyle choices among young donors.",
          "\"Young people are the hope and future of a safe blood supply in the world,\" said Dr Neelam Dhingra, Coordinator of Blood Transfusion Safety at WHO. \"We are confident more countries can achieve 100 per cent voluntary unpaid blood donation if they focus efforts on engaging young people.\"",
          "Today, 62 countries obtain all, or nearly all (more than 99%), of their blood supplies from unpaid donors – up from 57 last year. Belarus, Islamic Republic of Iran, Kenya, Malaysia and Zambia are the latest to join this list.",
          "\"In 77 countries, however, donations are still well below the level required to meet patients' needs,\" Dr Dhingra added.",
          "WHO recommends that blood donation by at least 1% a country's population is generally sufficient to meet a country's basic requirements for safe blood. Requirements are higher in countries with more developed health systems. Among the greatest needs: to replace blood lost in childbirth (a major cause of maternal deaths worldwide), and to treat the anaemia that threatens the lives of thousands of children who have malaria or are undernourished.",
          "In May 2010, WHO Member States agreed on a resolution on the availability, safety and quality of blood products. The resolution paves the way to increase access to safe blood transfusions and to safe and affordable blood products in developing countries. It also echoes the Melbourne Declaration, released on World Blood Donor Day 2009 in Melbourne, Australia, which calls on countries to achieve 100% voluntary unpaid blood donation by 2020.",
          "Starting 14 June, a week-long programme of high-profile events celebrate voluntary blood donation. This year, international World Blood Donor Day events are taking place in Barcelona, Spain and at Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China. A number of communities, including Barcelona, will gather volunteers in a prominent public space to stand together all dressed in red in the form of a \"blood drop\" as part of their celebration."

The drug, moxidectin, is being investigated for its potential to kill or sterilize the adult worms of Onchocerca volvulus , which cause onchocerciasis.",

Currently, the disease is controlled by ivermectin, which has been donated for more than 20 years by the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. for use in onchocerciasis endemic countries. Treatment with ivermectin has enabled significant progress in the control of onchocerciasis, and currently reaches more than 60 million people in Africa annually. However, ivermectin kills the O. volvulus larvae but not the adult worms, so annual treatments for an extended period of time (at least 11-14 years) are required to ensure disease control.",

The report is based on 1100 studies conducted by national malaria control programs and research institutes over the ten-year period.",

          "\"A greater political commitment to support and sustain national monitoring of the efficacy of antimalarial medicines is critical to prevent a wider emergence of artemisinin resistance\", said Dr Pascal Ringwald of the Drug Resistance and Containment Unit, within WHO's Global Malaria Programme and one of the report authors."

Although patients infected were cured following treatment with an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), the recovery took more time. In artemisinin-resistant areas, the high cure rates observed depend heavily on the efficacy of the non-artemisinin component of the combination.",
          "Nonetheless, the report found that ACTs currently recommended by national malaria control programmes remain efficacious in treating malaria, with cure rates generally greater than 90%. In countries where the currently recommended ACT has a cure rate of less than 90%, policy change is ongoing to implement an efficacious replacement treatments for malaria.",
          "\"The emergence of artemisinin resistance on the Cambodia-Thailand border has been a wake-up call to the world to prevent its spread, increase monitoring, and preserve ACTs as the only effective treatment we have for falciparum malaria\", said Dr Robert Newman, Director of WHO's Global Malaria Programme. \"Prompt action will be critical to sustain progress in malaria control and achieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals.\""

However, there is some early evidence that resistance to artemisinins may also be emerging on the Myanmar-Thailand border. There is also concern that resistance could spread from the Cambodia-Thailand border to Africa, as it did with antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in the 1960s and 1970s.",
          "\"Antimalarial drug resistance is like a cancer, it must be fought at every level – affected countries need to be in the frontline in combating the emergence of drug resistance. WHO should be empowered and supported to take a strong lead. It is crucial to protect ACTs as they are the best treatments for millions of people against malaria,\" said Professor Nicholas J White, of the Mahidol-Oxford Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand.",
          "Since 1973, WHO has been providing support to national malaria control programmes to monitor drug resistance by regularly updating the standardized therapeutic efficacy study protocol, supporting and coordinating the collection, analysis and reporting of data, and promoting appropriate use of additional tests needed to confirm resistance."

          "Scientists continue to investigate how and why artemisinin resistance specifically emerges. Generally, antimalarial drug resistance first emerges through a rare spontaneous change in the malaria parasite. The subsequent ability of the drug resistant strain to survive and spread is influenced by many factors, including the use of substandard medicines and artemisinin-based monotherapies. However, it is clear that if the efficacy of artemisinin component continues to decline, there is an increased risk that resistance to non-artemisinin medicines used in the combination will emerge. Currently, research efforts are ongoing to discover and develop new medicines for the treatment of malaria.",
          "In response to the findings in this report, WHO is working with partners to develop a Global Plan for Artemisinin Resistance Containment, which will be released in January 2011. On World Health Day 2011, WHO will launch a public awareness campaign on antimicrobial resistance and its global spread, calling on governments and stakeholders to implement the policies and practices needed to safeguard medicines for future generations.",

          "\"This is the largest increase in people accessing treatment in a single year. It is an extremely encouraging development,\" says Dr Hiroki Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases.",
          "At the XVIII International AIDS Conference, WHO is calling for earlier treatment for people with HIV. The objective is to begin HIV treatment before they become ill because of weakened immunity.",
          "\"Starting treatment earlier gives us an opportunity to enable people living with HIV to stay healthier and live longer,” says Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, WHO Director of HIV/AIDS.",
          "Estimates developed through epidemiological modeling suggest that HIV-related mortality can be reduced by 20% between 2010 and 2015 if these guidelines for early treatment are broadly implemented.",
          "Earlier treatment can prevent opportunistic infections including tuberculosis (TB), the number one killer of people with HIV. Deaths from TB can be reduced by as much as 90%, if people with both HIV and TB start treatment earlier.",
          "The strength of a person's immune system is measured by CD4 cells. A healthy person has a CD4 count of 1000 - 1500 cells/mm3. WHO previously recommended starting HIV treatment when a person's CD4 count drops below 200 cells/mm3 but now advises starting HIV treatment at 350 cells/mm3 or below.",
          "\"In addition to saving lives, earlier treatment also has prevention benefits,” Dr Hirnschall says. “Because treatment reduces the level of virus in the body, it means HIV-positive people are less likely to pass the virus on to their partners.\"",
          "WHO's treatment guidelines expand the number of people recommended for HIV treatment from an estimated 10 million to an estimated 15 million. The cost needed for HIV treatment in 2010 will be about US$ 9 billion, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).",
          "\"The investments we make today can not only save millions of lives but millions of dollars tomorrow,” said Dr Bernhard Schwartlander, Director, Evidence, Strategy and Results, UNAIDS. \"People with weaker immune systems who come late for treatment require more complex and costly drugs and services than those who start treatment earlier and are healthier.\"",
          "Since 2003 - which marked the launch of the historic “3 by 5” initiative to provide access to HIV treatment to 3 million people living in low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2005 - the number of people receiving HIV treatment has increased 12-fold.",
          "At AIDS 2010, WHO is releasing the 2010 guidelines on Antiretroviral treatment of HIV infection in adults and adolescents – public health approach ."

Currently, many HIV-positive people are waiting too long to seek treatment, usually when their CD4 count falls below 200 cells/mm3. However, the benefits of earlier treatment may also encourage more people to undergo HIV testing and counselling and learn their HIV status.",

The global strategy proposes that WHO should play a strategic and central role in the relationship between public health and innovation and intellectual property within its mandate. The strategy was designed to promote new thinking in innovation and access to medicines, which would encourage needs-driven research rather than purely market-driven research.

          "According to new data in the 2009 AIDS epidemic update , new HIV infections have been reduced by 17% over the past eight years. Since 2001, when the United Nations Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS was signed, the number of new infections in sub-Saharan Africa is approximately 15% lower, which is about 400 000 fewer infections in 2008. In East Asia HIV incidence has declined by nearly 25% and in South and South East Asia by 10% in the same time period. In Eastern Europe, after a dramatic increase in new infections among injecting drug users, the epidemic has leveled off considerably. However, in some countries there are signs that HIV incidence is rising again.",
          "The report, released today by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO), highlights that beyond the peak and natural course of the epidemic - HIV prevention programmes are making a difference.",
          "\"The good news is that we have evidence that the declines we are seeing are due, at least in part, to HIV prevention,\" said Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of UNAIDS. \"However, the findings also show that prevention programming is often off the mark and that if we do a better job of getting resources and programmes to where they will make most impact, quicker progress can be made and more lives saved.\"",
          "In this first double issue, the UNAIDS Outlook report further explores how “modes of transmission” studies are changing the approach of HIV prevention efforts. The new magazine-style report looks at new ideas and ways to use the data collected in the companion epidemiological report."

However the number of AIDS-related deaths has declined by over 10% over the past five years as more people gained to access to the life saving treatment. UNAIDS and WHO estimate that since the availability of effective treatment in 1996, some 2.9 million lives have been saved.",
          "Dr Margaret Chan, Director- General of WHO said: \"International and national investment in HIV treatment scale-up has yielded concrete and measurable results. We cannot let this momentum wane. Now is the time to redouble our efforts, and save many more lives.\"",
          "Antiretroviral therapy has also made a significant impact in preventing new infections in children as more HIV-positive mothers gain access to treatment preventing them from transmitting the virus to their children. Around 200 000 new infections among children have been prevented since 2001.",
          "In Botswana, where treatment coverage is 80%, AIDS-related deaths have fallen by over 50% over the past five years and the number of children newly orphaned is also coming down as parents are living longer."

Early evidence shows that HIV may have a significant impact on maternal mortality. Research models using South African data estimate that about 50 000 maternal deaths were associated with HIV in 2008.",
          "\"AIDS isolation must end,\" said Mr Sidibé. \"Already research models are showing that HIV may have a significant impact on maternal mortality. Half of all maternal deaths in Botswana and South Africa are due to HIV. This tells us that we must work for a unified health approach bringing maternal and child health and HIV programmes as well as tuberculosis programmes together to work to achieve their common goal.\""

For example the epidemic in Eastern Europe and Central Asia once characterized by injecting drug use is now spreading to the sexual partners of people who inject drugs. Similarly in parts of Asia an epidemic once characterized by transmission through sex work and injecting drug use is now increasingly affecting heterosexual couples.",
          "Data show that few HIV prevention programmes exist for people over 25, married couples or people in stable relationships, widowers and divorcees. These are the same groups in which HIV prevalence has been found to be high in many sub-Saharan countries. For example in Swaziland people over the age of 25 accounted for more than two thirds of adult infections yet very few HIV prevention programmes are designed for older people.",
          "Funding for HIV prevention has become the smallest percentage of the HIV budgets of many countries. For example in Swaziland, just 17% of the country’s total budget for AIDS was spent on prevention despite a national HIV prevalence rate of 26%. In Ghana, the prevention budget was cut in 2007 by 43% from 2005 levels."

          "AIDSspace.org aims to expand informal and established networks to include more people interested in HIV to maximize resources for a stronger AIDS response. The premise behind AIDSspace is simple: if hundreds of millions of people can connect on some of the most popular social networking sites (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Twitter, YouTube) to connect, exchange ideas, post and share HIV-related content, they can do the same for HIV related content - including key policies, case studies, multimedia materials, conference posters, reports and other essential resources.

Therefore, better management of malaria has a positive impact on management of other childhood illness and overall child survival.",

In countries that depend heavily on people paying directly for services at the point of delivery, health bills push 100 million people into poverty each year.",

So far three countries (Liberia, Rwanda and the United Republic of Tanzania) have achieved this. If the governments of the world's 49 poorest countries each allocated 15% of state spending to health, they could raise an additional US$ 15 billion per year - almost doubling the funds available.",
          "They can also generate more money for health through more efficient tax collection, as Indonesia has done, raising revenue by 10% points. They can find new sources of tax revenue, such as sales taxes and currency transactions. Ghana, for example, has funded its national health insurance partly by increasing the value-added tax (VAT) by 2.5%. A review of 22 low-income countries shows that they could between them raise US$ 1.42 billion through a 50% increase in tobacco tax. India could generate US$ 370 million per year by implementing a levy of just 0.005% on foreign exchange transactions.",
          "The international community has a key role to play. An average of US$ 44 per capita is required to ensure access to even a small set of quality health services in low income countries. Many struggle to do this. Today, 31 countries spend less than US$ 35 per person on health. If all donors joined the Government of Norway and others that have kept their promise to allocate 0.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) to official development assistance, three million additional lives could be saved in lower income countries by 2015."

Countries like Japan that manage to ensure health services are available to the entire population have done so by reducing dependence on direct, out of pocket payments and increasing prepayment - generally through insurance or taxes or a mix of the two. The funds raised are then pooled, so that it is not just those who are unlucky enough to get sick that bear the financial burden. This is the model used in many European countries, with Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Rwanda, Thailand and Turkey all making significant progress in the last decade - along with Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan and the Republic of Moldova."

One of these is the purchasing of medicines. France has adopted a strategy of using generic drugs wherever possible - this saved the equivalent of almost US$ 2 billion in 2008. Hospitals are another. Hospital care often absorbs from half to two thirds of total government spending on health: almost US$300 billion is lost annually to hospital-related inefficiency. More efficient spending on hospitals could boost productivity by 15%.",
          "The international community has a key role to play in improving efficiency. Five years after the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which aimed to harmonize aid around country-led programmes, more than 140 global health initiatives run in parallel - imposing logistic and reporting burdens on recipient governments that stretch resources still further. The Government of Rwanda, for example, currently reports on more than 890 health indicators - a hugely time-consuming process."

          "The new vaccine has several advantages over vaccines currently used to combat meningitis epidemics in Africa: it protects children as young as one; and it is expected to both protect from the disease for significantly longer than the vaccine now used to combat epidemics, and to reduce infection and transmission. Reduced transmission in turn protects the larger community, including family members and others who have not been immunized.",
          "\"From day one, the development of this vaccine has been a collaboration between industry, institutions, and individuals driven by public health needs,” said Dr Marc LaForce, Director of the Meningitis Vaccine Project. \"The successful development of a vaccine in less than a decade is almost unheard of.\"",
          "The rapid development of the vaccine is in large part due to the commitment of the Serum Institute of India, Ltd., the vaccine manufacturer. Africans have in the past waited as long as 20 years for a vaccine to travel from the industrialized north to the nations of the south. In this case, MenAfriVac will be introduced in Africa before it is distributed anywhere else.",
          "The process of developing the new vaccine and planning for its introduction has also helped strengthen systems in Africa for disease surveillance, clinical development, pharmacovigilance and vaccine logistics. Clinical trials, carried out in the Gambia, Ghana, India, Mali, and Senegal, beginning in 2005, have shown the vaccine to be safe and highly effective. Indian regulatory authorities granted marketing authorization for export and use of MenAfriVac in December 2009. In June 2010, the vaccine was prequalified by WHO, which guarantees that the vaccine meets international standards of quality, safety, and efficacy."

          "\"In fewer than 10 years, we have overcome obstacles that have in the past seemed insurmountable,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \"With a one-time investment to vaccinate populations in all countries of the meningitis belt, nearly 150 000 young lives could be saved by 2015, and epidemic meningitis could become a thing of the past. This is within reach. We must not fail.”",
          "If MenAfriVac is introduced throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the resulting reduction in cases of meningitis is expected to free up more than US$ 120 million in the period up to 2015, money from national budgets which would otherwise be spent on medical costs for diagnosis and treatment. These funds can then be brought to bear on other problems of disease and poverty that weigh so heavily on the region.",
          "The GAVI Alliance has thus far contributed over US$ 85 million to the effort to eliminate meningococcal A meningitis in Africa. Yet, the full promise of the vaccine, to protect people throughout the African meningitis belt, can only be realized if an additional US$ 475 million is mobilized.",
          "\"GAVI is delighted to be contributing to funding the new vaccine’s introduction\" said Helen Evans, GAVI Alliance Interim CEO. \"We very much hope to be able to support the further rollout of MenAfriVac, so that by 2015 populations in all 25 countries of the meningitis belt will be vaccinated against meningitis A.\"",
          "The introduction of MenAfriVac in Burkina Faso will be closely followed by introduction in Mali and Niger, two other hyper-endemic countries in the meningitis belt. Vaccine introduction in these three countries has been made possible through the support of a number of funding and technical partners, including the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, Médecins sans Frontières, and UNICEF. \"Having procured the vaccine, UNICEF is working with the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso and local communities to ensure that this extraordinary campaign is a success,\" said Dr Gianfranco Rotigliano, Regional Director of the UNICEF Regional Office for West and Central Africa."

These risk charts are a major new tool for providing the best health care to all the world’s people\".",

          "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death globally, causing one third of all deaths. In 2005, 11.8 million people died of heart attacks and other heart diseases, and 5.7 million died of stroke. Around 80% of these deaths were in low- and middle-income countries. By 2015, an estimated 20 million people will die from CVD annually, mainly from heart attacks and strokes. Socioeconomic costs of premature deaths and disability, and escalating costs of medical care make it all the more urgent to take measures to prevent and control this burgeoning epidemic in low- and middle-income countries where health care resources are limited.",
          "Urbanization and globalization promote tobacco use, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. These risk factors result in increased risk of people developing heart attacks and strokes because the result is raised levels of blood pressure, blood glucose, blood cholesterol and body weight. These, in addition to increasing age, are major risk factors that determine an individual's chances of having a heart attack or stroke. This is known as the cardiovascular risk.",
          "Until now, individuals have often been assessed and treated based on a single cardiovascular risk factor such as high blood pressure, high blood lipids or diabetes. This approach can result in committing a patient who has only a small cardiovascular risk to many years of drug therapy or, conversely, neglecting to treat those with an overall higher cardiovascular risk. Most importantly, the single risk factor approach is not cost effective and is not affordable for many low-income and middle-income countries.",
          "For successful prevention and control of the CVD epidemic, the combination of population-based and individual-based strategies are needed to lower the cardiovascular risk of populations and individuals. Population-wide strategies such as tobacco control and promotion of a healthy diet and physical activity are very cost effective in all countries. Cost effective interventions are also available to treat those who have survived heart attacks and strokes. However, treating risk factors such as high blood pressure and blood lipids is cost effective for low-income and middle-income countries only if interventions are targeted at high risk individuals.",
          "In many low-income and middle-income countries, national and state health care budgets and per capita health expenditures are suboptimal. It is imperative, therefore, to use the limited resources that are available as effectively and efficiently as possible. This requires the prioritization of cost-effective approaches and the targeting of those patients who are most likely to benefit from interventions. In any population, those people who are most likely to benefit from cost-effective CVD interventions are the people with the highest cardiovascular risk.",
          "The World Health Organization, in collaboration with the International Society of Hypertension (ISH), has developed cardiovascular risk prediction charts that enable cardiovascular risk assessment and prediction in non-western populations.",
          "Many health care systems in low-income countries do not have the basic infrastructure facilities to support resource intensive risk prediction tools, particularly in primary health care. The WHO/ISH charts use easily measurable indicators of risk to quantify the 10-year risk of developing heart attacks and strokes. These indicators of risk include gender, age, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, diabetes and total blood cholesterol. For use in low-resource settings, where blood cholesterol measurement is not routinely available, alternative charts have been developed that predict risk without blood cholesterol. Also, in many low-resource settings, urine sugar levels may be used as a surrogate marker for diabetes.",
          "Although the risk-prediction charts and pocket guides are simple to use, short training sessions will be required to introduce the charts into regular health care practice. The charts are ready for use now, and will be updated over time. Like all risk-prediction tools, the accuracy of this tool for specific populations can be improved over the long term by making minor adaptations as data are collated for individual populations. Technical assistance will be provided, through the WHO-ISH collaboration, to compare this new tool with other risk prediction methods, to further improve accuracy, and to adapt the CVD risk-prediction charts to suit very specific country contexts."

          "The Committee based its assessment on the global situation, as well as reports from several countries that are now experiencing influenza. I fully agree with the Committee’s advice.",
          "As we enter the post-pandemic period, this does not mean that the H1N1 virus has gone away. Based on experience with past pandemics, we expect the H1N1 virus to take on the behaviour of a seasonal influenza virus and continue to circulate for some years to come.",
          "In the post-pandemic period, localized outbreaks of different magnitude may show significant levels of H1N1 transmission. This is the situation we are observing right now in New Zealand, and may see elsewhere.",
          "In fact, the actions of health authorities in New Zealand, and also in India, in terms of vigilance, quick detection and treatment, and recommended vaccination, provide a model of how other countries may need to respond in the immediate post-pandemic period.",
          "Globally, the levels and patterns of H1N1 transmission now being seen differ significantly from what was observed during the pandemic. Out-of-season outbreaks are no longer being reported in either the northern or southern hemisphere. Influenza outbreaks, including those primarily caused by the H1N1 virus, show an intensity similar to that seen during seasonal epidemics.",
          "During the pandemic, the H1N1 virus crowded out other influenza viruses to become the dominant virus. This is no longer the case. Many countries are reporting a mix of influenza viruses, again as is typically seen during seasonal epidemics.",
          "Recently published studies indicate that 20–40% of populations in some areas have been infected by the H1N1 virus and thus have some level of protective immunity. Many countries report good vaccination coverage, especially in high-risk groups, and this coverage further increases community-wide immunity.",
          "Pandemics, like the viruses that cause them, are unpredictable. So is the immediate post-pandemic period. There will be many questions, and we will have clear answers for only some. Continued vigilance is extremely important, and WHO has issued advice on recommended surveillance, vaccination, and clinical management during the post-pandemic period.",
          "Based on available evidence and experience from past pandemics, it is likely that the virus will continue to cause serious disease in younger age groups, at least in the immediate post-pandemic period. Groups identified during the pandemic as at higher risk of severe or fatal illness will probably remain at heightened risk, though hopefully the number of such cases will diminish.",
          "In addition, a small proportion of people infected during the pandemic, including young and healthy people, developed a severe form of primary viral pneumonia that is not typically seen during seasonal epidemics and is especially difficult and demanding to treat. It is not known whether this pattern will change during the post-pandemic period, further emphasizing the need for vigilance.",
          "As I said, pandemics are unpredictable and prone to deliver surprises. No two pandemics are ever alike. This pandemic has turned out to be much more fortunate than what we feared a little over a year ago.",
          "This time around, we have been aided by pure good luck. The virus did not mutate during the pandemic to a more lethal form. Widespread resistance to oseltamivir did not develop. The vaccine proved to be a good match with circulating viruses and showed an excellent safety profile.",
          "Thanks to extensive preparedness and support from the international community, even countries with very weak health systems were able to detect cases and report them promptly.",
          "Had things gone wrong in any of these areas, we would be in a very different situation today.",

Particular emphasis was placed on the epidemiological situation in the southern hemisphere, where many countries are experiencing their winter influenza season. The update also covered certain countries reporting active pandemic influenza virus transmission. Representatives of the governments of Argentina, Australia, India, New Zealand and South Africa described the most recent developments in their countries. Particular attention was given to the situation in some countries which are currently experiencing intense influenza epidemics largely caused by the H1N1 (2009) virus.",
          "While noting such epidemics with concern, the Committee based its assessment on the global situation. Members noted clear indications that influenza, worldwide, is transitioning towards seasonal patterns of transmission. In the majority of countries, out-of-season outbreaks are no longer being observed, and the intensity of H1N1 (2009) transmission is lower than that reported during 2009 and early 2010. Members further noted that the H1N1 (2009) virus will likely continue to circulate for some years to come, taking on the behaviour of a seasonal influenza virus.",
          "The Committee agreed that the global influenza situation no longer represented an extraordinary event requiring immediate emergency actions on an international scale. In their view, the public health emergency of international concern, recommended following the emergence of the H1N1 (2009) virus, should be considered over. The Committee further noted that the temporary recommendations adopted in response to the public health emergency of international concern were terminated.",
          "After extensive discussions, the Committee unanimously advised the Director-General that the world was no longer experiencing an influenza pandemic, but that some countries continue to experience significant H1N1 (2009) epidemics. Members agreed that waiting for winter data from the southern hemisphere had been necessary in order to make such a global assessment with reasonable confidence.",
          "The Committee noted that the information from India, New Zealand and the Pacific Island countries was consistent with the expectation that individual countries might experience significant levels of influenza associated with the H1N1 (2009) virus in the future, and expressed the need for national authorities to continue to implement outbreak response measures in those countries when such events occur. The Committee strongly emphasized the need for States to maintain vigilant disease surveillance and monitoring for influenza outbreaks and influenza-like illness as well as ensuring the availability of necessary public health measures for preventing and controlling influenza. Such measures include the continued use of H1N1 (2009) pandemic or seasonal influenza vaccines where appropriate and available. The Committee noted that the uptake of pandemic vaccine in some Pacific Island countries appeared sufficiently high to reduce the risk of outbreaks in these countries.",
          "Based on the advice of the Emergency Committee, and her own assessment of the situation, the Director-General determined that the world was no longer in an influenza pandemic and therefore terminated the public health emergency of international concern in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005).",
          "In light of these determinations, the Director-General thanked the members and the advisor of the Emergency Committee for their diligent service and expert advice, which were of great importance to international public health.",
          "The work of the Emergency Committee now being ended, the names, affiliations and declared interests of the Committee members and advisor will be published on the WHO website as soon as possible."

The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission are currently in tropical areas, primarily in parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. These areas are now experiencing a relatively low level of resurgence of cases after experiencing more intense activity during July 2009. In temperate zones of the Southern Hemisphere, countries are not reporting increases in influenza activity above epidemic thresholds, or unusually early influenza activity. Pandemic influenza activity across the African continent is low or sporadic; data from West Africa indicates that the active transmission of pandemic influenza virus has largely subsided after peaking during February and March 2010.",
          "After extensive discussions and questions, the Committee expressed the unanimous view that from a global perspective while pandemic activity is continuing, the period of most intense pandemic activity appears likely to have passed for many parts of the world. Committee members stressed that it remains critical for countries to continue to maintain vigilance concerning the pandemic, including all necessary public health measures for disease control as well as influenza virus and disease surveillance.",
          "Following the advice of the Emergency Committee, the Director-General determined that while the period of most intense pandemic activity has passed, pandemic disease is expected to continue to occur and that a further meeting of the Emergency Committee to reassess the epidemiological situation would be convened by mid July 2010, when information from the winter influenza season in the Southern Hemisphere will be available.",
          "On a separate issue, the Director-General noted that the secretariat is following the practice of the Organization for public disclosure of the names of the Emergency Committee members to take place once the work of the Committee had been completed. The purpose of this practice is to protect the integrity and independence of the Members while doing this critical work - but also to ensure transparency by publicly providing the names of the members as well as information about any interest declared by them at the appropriate time.

          "Over the centuries, smallpox has been one of mankind’s most feared and deadly diseases with a history dating back at least 3500 years. Historically, it spread across the world, killing kings and peasants alike. People in many countries worshiped special deities intended to protect them from smallpox. One third or more of infected people died, as little could be done for them."

        "content": [
          "Hope for protection against the disease emerged in 1796. An English physician, Edward Jenner, discovered that by inoculating a person with pustules from the pox infection of a cow, smallpox could be prevented. The vaccinated person developed antibodies which protected both against the cowpox infection and against the closely related virus that caused smallpox. It was the world’s first vaccine.",
          "For nearly a century, the vaccine virus (called vaccinia), was transferred from one person to the next – from arm to arm. The problem was to discover how to provide large amounts of vaccine. This was eventually solved by growing the vaccine virus on the flank of cows.",
          "The practice of vaccination spread but it was much less effective in the tropical countries because the vaccine rapidly deteriorated in the heat. Finally, in the 1950s, an English scientist, Leslie Collier, discovered a method to produce a potent, heat-stable vaccine that could be used throughout the world. This was a pivotal development in the successful effort to eradicate the disease because it eliminated the cumbersome logistics required to maintain the cold chain for previously used liquid smallpox vaccines. Health care workers could carry the freeze-dried vaccine for 30 days in their bags and the vaccine would still be potent.",
          "The bifurcated (two-pronged) needle, invented by a scientist at Wyeth Laboratory, permitted the development of a new vaccination technique called the \"multiple puncture\" method. It was easy to perform and required only one fourth as much vaccine as other methods in use. It soon replaced all other techniques for vaccination."

          "Since its founding, the World Health Assembly has been concerned about smallpox control. In 1948, at its first meeting, it was decided to form a joint study group on smallpox. During the next years, it supported research to compare the effects of different strains of smallpox vaccines and fostered efforts to improve vaccine production methods. In 1955, the 7th World Health Assembly decided to provide budgetary assistance to some governments and solicited donations of vaccine. Between 1959 and 1966, many countries provided supplies of vaccine, the USSR (Former Soviet Union) alone donated more than 400 million doses. However, progress was slow and vaccine shortages regularly occurred.",
          "In 1966, the 19th World Health Assembly took the momentous decision to undertake a global programme of smallpox eradication, first initiated by the same body in 1959. In the Director-General’s Report to the 19th World Health Assembly, a new strategy was proposed and accepted with special funds authorized. An intensified effort to eradicate the disease began in January 1967. That year, there were more than 10 million cases and 2 million deaths in 43 countries.",
          "The basic strategy consisted of two components: carefully monitored mass vaccination programmes to reach 80% of the population and a new approach to disease prevention — surveillance and containment. This required weekly reports of smallpox cases from all health units with special teams to quickly investigate cases and outbreaks.",
          "As the programme progressed, smallpox was eliminated first in South America, West and Central Africa, then in Asia and finally in East Africa. Global smallpox eradication was finally achieved with the world’s last naturally-occurring case in Somalia on 26 October 1977. Special search programmes continued throughout the world for another two years to be certain that transmission had stopped. The World Health Assembly resolution (WHA33.3), adopted on 8 May 1980, declared that the global goal of smallpox eradication had been achieved."

          "Continuing research, technical innovation, and adaptation of the programme strategy to local circumstances were critical factors in the success of the eradication effort. Innovations by programme staff that affected global programme policy included progressive innovations in the surveillance and containment strategy, the use of smallpox identification cards in markets and special house-to-house searches, and techniques for isolating patients in their homes, villages or in special compounds.",
          "Epidemiological studies by field staff demonstrated that smallpox did not spread so rapidly as textbooks suggested. Thus, surveillance and containment worked more effectively than had been hoped. Vaccine immunity proved to be sufficiently long-lasting that repeat vaccinations were not necessary during the course of the programme.",

          "The Emergency Committee held its seventh meeting by teleconference on 23 February 2010. The Director-General sought the Committee's views on the determination of the pandemic status.",
          "A detailed update was provided to the Committee on the global pandemic situation. After asking additional questions and reviewing the evidence and holding extensive discussion, the Committee was of the view that there was mixed evidence showing declining or low pandemic activity in many countries, but new community level transmission activity in West Africa. Moreover, they expressed concern that the winter months of the Southern Hemisphere had not yet started and there was uncertainty whether additional generalized waves of activity might occur and the need to not undermine preparations. The Committee advised that it was premature to conclude that all parts of the world have experienced peak transmission of the H1N1 pandemic influenza and that additional time and information was needed to provide expert advice on the status of the pandemic. The Committee accordingly suggested that the Committee be re-convened in a few weeks to review intervening developments and related epidemiological information.",
          "Having considered these views, the current epidemiological evidence and other relevant information, the Director-General determined that there had been no change in the pandemic phase, and decided to continue to monitor the situation and developments closely and to convene the Committee again within the next several weeks.",
