    "content_html": "<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">An experimental Ebola vaccine was highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to results published today in <em>The Lancet</em>. The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year.</span></p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<span>The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11 841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The trial was led by WHO, together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,\" said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study’s lead author. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe &amp; Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013–2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11 300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called “ring vaccination” approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain “contacts of contacts”. A total of 117 clusters (or \"rings\") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine’s efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so called \"herd immunity\"). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured,\" said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>It was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement,\" said Dr John-Arne Røttingen, specialist director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300 000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO’s Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Additional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called “compassionate use” that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO’s partners are working to compile data to support license applications.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO’s R&amp;D Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Notes to editors</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The rVSV-ZEBOV trial is funded by WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust; the UK Government through the Department for International Development; the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Norwegian Institute of Public Health through the Research Council of Norway,; the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the International Development Research Centre, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development; and Médecins Sans Frontières. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The trial team includes experts from The University of Bern, the University of Florida, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England, the European Mobile Laboratories among others.

    "lead": "But in many countries in the region, substantial gaps in programme coverage remain. Funding shortfalls and fragile health systems are undermining overall progress, jeopardizing the attainment of global targets.",
    "content_html": "<div><span>WHO’s World <em>Malaria Report 2016</em> reveals that children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa have greater access to effective malaria control. Across the region, a steep increase in diagnostic testing for children and preventive treatment for pregnant women has been reported over the last 5 years. Among all populations at risk of malaria, the use of insecticide-treated nets has expanded rapidly.</span></div><p><span>But in many countries in the region, substantial gaps in programme coverage remain. Funding shortfalls and fragile health systems are undermining overall progress, jeopardizing the attainment of global targets.</span></p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Scale-up in malaria control</h2><p><span>Sub-Saharan Africa carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2015, the region was home to 90% of malaria cases and 92% of malaria deaths. Children under five years of age are particularly vulnerable, accounting for an estimated 70% of all malaria deaths.</span></p><p><span>Diagnostic testing enables health providers to rapidly detect malaria and prescribe life-saving treatment. New findings presented in the report show that, in 2015, approximately half (51%) of children with a fever seeking care at a public health facility in 22 African countries received a diagnostic test for malaria, compared to 29% in 2010.</span></p><p><span>To protect women in areas of moderate and high malaria transmission in Africa, WHO recommends \"intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy\" (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. The treatment, administered at each scheduled antenatal care visit after the first trimester, can prevent maternal and infant mortality, anaemia, and the other adverse effects of malaria in pregnancy.</span></p><p><span>According to available data, there was a five-fold increase in the percentage of women receiving the recommended 3 or more doses of this preventive treatment in 20 African countries. Coverage reached 31% in 2015, up from 6% in 2010.</span></p><p><span>Insecticide-treated nets are the cornerstone of malaria prevention efforts in Africa. The report found that more than half (53%) of the population at risk in sub-Saharan Africa slept under a treated net in 2015, compared to 30% in 2010.</span></p><p><span>Last month, WHO released the findings of a major 5-year evaluation in 5 countries. The study showed that people who slept under long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) had significantly lower rates of malaria infection than those who did not use a net, even though mosquitoes showed resistance to pyrethroids (the only insecticide class used in LLINs) in all of these areas.</span></p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">An unfinished agenda</h2><p><span>Malaria remains an acute public health problem, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the report, there were 212 million new cases of malaria and 429 000 deaths worldwide in 2015.</span></p><p><span>There are still substantial gaps in the coverage of core malaria control tools. In 2015, an estimated 43% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa was not protected by treated nets or indoor spraying with insecticides, the primary methods of malaria vector control.</span></p><p><span>In many countries, health systems are under-resourced and poorly accessible to those most at risk of malaria. In 2015, a large proportion (36%) of children with a fever were not taken to a health facility for care in 23 African countries.</span></p><p><span>\"We are definitely seeing progress,\" notes Dr Pedro Alonso, Director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme. \"But the world is still struggling to achieve the high levels of programme coverage that are needed to beat this disease.\"</span></p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Global targets</h2><p><span>At the 2015 World Health Assembly, Member States adopted the <em>Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030</em>. The Strategy set ambitious targets for 2030 with milestones every 5 years to track progress.</span></p><p><span>Eliminating malaria in at least 10 countries is a milestone for 2020. The report shows that prospects for reaching this target are bright: In 2015, 10 countries and territories reported fewer than 150 indigenous cases of malaria, and a further 9 countries reported between 150 and 1000 cases.</span></p><p><span>Countries that have achieved at least 3 consecutive years of zero indigenous cases of malaria are eligible to apply for the WHO certification of malaria elimination. In recent months, the WHO Director-General certified that Kyrgyzstan and Sri Lanka had eliminated malaria.</span></p><p><span>But progress towards other key targets must be accelerated. The Strategy calls for a 40% reduction in malaria case incidence by the year 2020, compared to a 2015 baseline. According to the report, less than half (40) of the 91 countries and territories with malaria are on track to achieve this milestone. Progress has been particularly slow in countries with a high malaria burden.</span></p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">An urgent need for more funding</h2><p><span>Sustained and sufficient funding for malaria control is a serious challenge. Despite a steep increase in global investment for malaria between 2000 and 2010, funding has since flat-lined. In 2015, malaria funding totalled US$ 2.9 billion, representing only 45% of the funding milestone for 2020 (US$ 6.4 billion).</span></p><p><span>Governments of malaria-endemic countries provided about 31% of total malaria funding in 2015. The United States of America is the largest international malaria funder, accounting for about 35% of total funding in 2015, followed by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (16%).</span></p><p><span>If global targets are to be met, funding from both domestic and international sources must increase substantially.</span></p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Note to editors</h2><p class=\"section_head2\"><strong>RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine</strong></p><p><span>Last month, WHO announced that the world’s first malaria vaccine would be rolled out through pilot projects in 3 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

          "Diagnostic testing enables health providers to rapidly detect malaria and prescribe life-saving treatment. New findings presented in the report show that, in 2015, approximately half (51%) of children with a fever seeking care at a public health facility in 22 African countries received a diagnostic test for malaria, compared to 29% in 2010.",
          "To protect women in areas of moderate and high malaria transmission in Africa, WHO recommends \"intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy\" (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. The treatment, administered at each scheduled antenatal care visit after the first trimester, can prevent maternal and infant mortality, anaemia, and the other adverse effects of malaria in pregnancy.",
          "According to available data, there was a five-fold increase in the percentage of women receiving the recommended 3 or more doses of this preventive treatment in 20 African countries. Coverage reached 31% in 2015, up from 6% in 2010.",
          "Insecticide-treated nets are the cornerstone of malaria prevention efforts in Africa. The report found that more than half (53%) of the population at risk in sub-Saharan Africa slept under a treated net in 2015, compared to 30% in 2010.",
          "Last month, WHO released the findings of a major 5-year evaluation in 5 countries. The study showed that people who slept under long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) had significantly lower rates of malaria infection than those who did not use a net, even though mosquitoes showed resistance to pyrethroids (the only insecticide class used in LLINs) in all of these areas."

          "In many countries, health systems are under-resourced and poorly accessible to those most at risk of malaria. In 2015, a large proportion (36%) of children with a fever were not taken to a health facility for care in 23 African countries.",

The report shows that prospects for reaching this target are bright: In 2015, 10 countries and territories reported fewer than 150 indigenous cases of malaria, and a further 9 countries reported between 150 and 1000 cases.",

For example, global coverage rates for all HIV testing, prevention, and treatment are lower among men than women.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Men account for only 30% of people who have tested for HIV.

These recommendations followed a July 2015 announcement that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had issued a positive scientific opinion of the RTS,S vaccine. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO officially adopted the SAGE-MPAC recommendations in January 2016 and has since worked to mobilize financial support for the pilots and to finalize the programme design. The pilot programme will evaluate the feasibility of delivering the required 4 doses of RTS,S; the impact of RTS,S on lives saved; and the safety of the vaccine in the context of routine use.* It will also assess the extent to which the vaccine’s protective effect demonstrated in children aged 5–17 months old in the Phase 3 trial can be replicated in real-life settings. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Country selection </h2>\n<p>\n<span>RTS,S is the first malaria vaccine to successfully complete pivotal Phase 3 testing.

Consultations are ongoing and the names of the 3 selected countries will be announced in the coming weeks. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">A complementary control tool</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The RTS,S vaccine is proposed as a tool to complement the existing package of WHO-recommended malaria preventive, diagnostic and treatment measures and will be used in combination with the current interventions. Other tools include: long-lasting insecticidal bed-nets, spraying inside walls of dwellings with insecticides, preventive treatment for infants and during pregnancy, prompt diagnostic testing, and treatment of confirmed cases with effective anti-malarial medicines. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Deployment of these tools has already dramatically lowered malaria disease burden in many African settings. Between 2000 and 2015, the rate of new malaria cases in sub-Saharan Africa fell by 42% and malaria mortality rates fell by 66%. However, this region continues to account for approximately 90% of global malaria cases and deaths.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>As RTS,S is only partially effective, it will be essential that any vaccinated patients with a fever be tested for malaria, and that all those with a confirmed malaria diagnosis are treated with high quality, effective anti-malarial medicines. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Partner quotes:</h2>\n<h2 class=\"section_head2\">Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance: </h2>\n<p>\n<span>“These pilots are critical to determine whether this vaccine can be rolled out more broadly, adding an important new tool to the proven interventions we already have in the fight against malaria.

    "content_html": "<div>\n<p>The eleventh meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened via teleconference by the Director General on 11 November 2016.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<span>The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine­derived polioviruses (cVDPV). The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations. The following IHR States Parties presented an update on the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 11 August 2016: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Wild polio</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Overall the Committee was encouraged by steady progress in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but noted that the detection of four cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Nigeria was a setback to polio eradication. The committee was reassured and impressed by the rapid response of the polio eradication programme in Nigeria. The committee conceded that such setbacks can be anticipated as eradication gets closer, but also recognised that these are a threat to achieving the global polio endgame.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee welcomed the progress being made in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the renewed emphasis on cooperation along the long international border between the two countries noting that this sub region constitutes an epidemiological block.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In Pakistan, the Committee recognized the large decrease in inaccessible children in 2016 was a significant achievement. However, the recent exportation of WPV1 from Pakistan into Paktika province of Afghanistan illustrated the difficulty of halting international spread between these two countries. Furthermore, the proportion of environmental samples testing positive for WPV1 in Pakistan has remained around 10% throughout 2016, with positive samples being detected across a wide geographic area. In most cases, environmental samples have tested positive in areas where no wild polio cases have been detected suggesting high population immunity but also raising the possibility of missed cases.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee was concerned by the deteriorating security in parts of Afghanistan leading to more children becoming inaccessible, heightening anxiety about completion of eradication. The recent outbreak in Bermel district in Paktika province illustrates the vulnerability of Afghanistan in terms of pockets of high risk populations, with low population immunity and high degree of mobility, including refugees, returnees, IDP’s and nomadic groups. The committee noted that the last exportation from Afghanistan (to Pakistan, 14 Sept 2015) was more than 13 months ago.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee commended Nigeria for its rapid response to the new WPV1 cases, including release of emergency funding, and also for the transparency of its communication. However, there remain substantial populations in Northern Nigeria that are totally or partially inaccessible, and where there are significant security risks that may pose danger to polio eradication workers and volunteers. Noting that the four recently isolated polioviruses had been circulating for three to four years, the committee concluded that it is highly likely that polioviruses are circulating in these areas so that reaching these populations is critically important for the polio eradication effort. The risk of international spread to Lake Chad basin countries or further afield in sub-Saharan Africa is considered very high. The committee was encouraged that the Lake Chad basin countries including Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and the Central African Republic, had established a Task Force for sub-regional coordination. This opens up opportunities to access inaccessible areas e.g. Nigerian islands in Lake Chad, inaccessible from Nigeria, could possibly be accessed from Chad.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee received final reports from Somalia, Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, as these three countries had been on the list of members vulnerable to importation of poliovirus, a risk category defined by the IHR Polio Emergency Committee. After 12 months on this list, countries are asked to provide a report to the committee outlining the activities they have undertaken to reduce vulnerability to poliovirus outbreaks. Based on these reports, the Committee advises on whether or not countries should stay on the vulnerable list. After reviewing reports from these countries the Committee made the following recommendations: Based on its geographical proximity to the WPV1 outbreak and the likelihood of circulating poliovirus in the Lake Chad region, Cameroon is still considered vulnerable. Equatorial Guinea also remains vulnerable, based on very sub-optimal polio eradication activities including poor surveillance, low routine immunisation coverage, and waning national efforts to address this vulnerability. In contrast, although Somalia has a large population that is inaccessible and not vaccinated, the surveillance in this region is sufficient to rule out transmission and in other areas of the country the national programme remains strong.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Vaccine derived poliovirus</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee noted that there have been no new cases of cVDPV since the previous meetings in May and August 2016 respectively. However, a healthy child contact of a WPV1 case from Borno, Nigeria tested positive in August 2016 for the same strain of cVDPV2 as found in the positive environmental sample in March 2016, indicating ongoing circulation in Borno state. It was concluded that cVDPV2 was likely present but undetected in the same inaccessible populations as WPV1, with ongoing risk of international spread to neighboring countries.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In Guinea, the most recent case of cVDPV had onset in December 2015. The Committee, however, felt there is a continued risk of spread to neighbouring areas both within Guinea and to the neighbouring post-Ebola affected countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone, as active surveillance has only recently started and the likelihood of missing transmission cannot be ruled out. Addressing surveillance gaps in Liberia and Sierra Leone still requires more efforts.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee received ‘12 month reports’ from Myanmar and Madagascar, and noted that it is now more than 13 months since cases of cVDPV were detected in these countries. Although some gaps in surveillance remain, circulation appears to have ceased.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee unanimously agreed that the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of the Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The new outbreak of WPV1 in Nigeria highlighting that there are high-risk areas where surveillance is compromised by inaccessibility, resulting in ongoing circulation of WPV for several years without detection. The risk of transmission in the Lake Chad sub-region appears very high.</li>\n<li>The continued international spread of wild poliovirus during 2016 from Pakistan to Afghanistan, resulting in intense transmission in vulnerable populations.</li>\n<li>The persistent, wide geographical distribution of positive WPV1 in environmental samples in Pakistan.</li>\n<li>The current special and extraordinary context of being closer to polio eradication than ever before in history.</li>\n<li>The risk and consequent costs of failure to eradicate globally one of the world’s most serious vaccine preventable diseases. Even though global transmission has fallen dramatically and with it the likelihood of international spread, the consequences and impact of international spread should it occur would be grave.</li>\n<li>The possibility of global complacency developing as the numbers of polio cases continues to fall and eradication becomes a possibility.</li>\n<li>The serious consequences of further international spread for the increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.

The Director General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries falling into the definition of ‘States currently exporting wild polioviruses or cVDPV’, for ‘States infected with wild poliovirus or cVDPV but not currently exporting’ and for ‘States no longer infected by wild poliovirus, but which remain vulnerable to international spread, and states that are vulnerable to the emergence and circulation of VDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations as revised by the Committee under the IHR to reduce the international spread of poliovirus, effective 18 November 2016.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Director General thanked the Committee Members and Advisors for their advice and requested their reassessment of this situation within the next three months.</span></p>",

          "Overall the Committee was encouraged by steady progress in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but noted that the detection of four cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Nigeria was a setback to polio eradication. The committee was reassured and impressed by the rapid response of the polio eradication programme in Nigeria. The committee conceded that such setbacks can be anticipated as eradication gets closer, but also recognised that these are a threat to achieving the global polio endgame.",
          "The Committee welcomed the progress being made in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the renewed emphasis on cooperation along the long international border between the two countries noting that this sub region constitutes an epidemiological block.",
          "In Pakistan, the Committee recognized the large decrease in inaccessible children in 2016 was a significant achievement. However, the recent exportation of WPV1 from Pakistan into Paktika province of Afghanistan illustrated the difficulty of halting international spread between these two countries. Furthermore, the proportion of environmental samples testing positive for WPV1 in Pakistan has remained around 10% throughout 2016, with positive samples being detected across a wide geographic area. In most cases, environmental samples have tested positive in areas where no wild polio cases have been detected suggesting high population immunity but also raising the possibility of missed cases.",
          "The Committee was concerned by the deteriorating security in parts of Afghanistan leading to more children becoming inaccessible, heightening anxiety about completion of eradication. The recent outbreak in Bermel district in Paktika province illustrates the vulnerability of Afghanistan in terms of pockets of high risk populations, with low population immunity and high degree of mobility, including refugees, returnees, IDP’s and nomadic groups. The committee noted that the last exportation from Afghanistan (to Pakistan, 14 Sept 2015) was more than 13 months ago.",
          "The Committee commended Nigeria for its rapid response to the new WPV1 cases, including release of emergency funding, and also for the transparency of its communication. However, there remain substantial populations in Northern Nigeria that are totally or partially inaccessible, and where there are significant security risks that may pose danger to polio eradication workers and volunteers. Noting that the four recently isolated polioviruses had been circulating for three to four years, the committee concluded that it is highly likely that polioviruses are circulating in these areas so that reaching these populations is critically important for the polio eradication effort. The risk of international spread to Lake Chad basin countries or further afield in sub-Saharan Africa is considered very high. The committee was encouraged that the Lake Chad basin countries including Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and the Central African Republic, had established a Task Force for sub-regional coordination. This opens up opportunities to access inaccessible areas e.g. Nigerian islands in Lake Chad, inaccessible from Nigeria, could possibly be accessed from Chad.",
          "The Committee received final reports from Somalia, Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, as these three countries had been on the list of members vulnerable to importation of poliovirus, a risk category defined by the IHR Polio Emergency Committee. After 12 months on this list, countries are asked to provide a report to the committee outlining the activities they have undertaken to reduce vulnerability to poliovirus outbreaks. Based on these reports, the Committee advises on whether or not countries should stay on the vulnerable list. After reviewing reports from these countries the Committee made the following recommendations: Based on its geographical proximity to the WPV1 outbreak and the likelihood of circulating poliovirus in the Lake Chad region, Cameroon is still considered vulnerable. Equatorial Guinea also remains vulnerable, based on very sub-optimal polio eradication activities including poor surveillance, low routine immunisation coverage, and waning national efforts to address this vulnerability. In contrast, although Somalia has a large population that is inaccessible and not vaccinated, the surveillance in this region is sufficient to rule out transmission and in other areas of the country the national programme remains strong."

          "The Committee noted that there have been no new cases of cVDPV since the previous meetings in May and August 2016 respectively. However, a healthy child contact of a WPV1 case from Borno, Nigeria tested positive in August 2016 for the same strain of cVDPV2 as found in the positive environmental sample in March 2016, indicating ongoing circulation in Borno state. It was concluded that cVDPV2 was likely present but undetected in the same inaccessible populations as WPV1, with ongoing risk of international spread to neighboring countries.",
          "In Guinea, the most recent case of cVDPV had onset in December 2015. The Committee, however, felt there is a continued risk of spread to neighbouring areas both within Guinea and to the neighbouring post-Ebola affected countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone, as active surveillance has only recently started and the likelihood of missing transmission cannot be ruled out. Addressing surveillance gaps in Liberia and Sierra Leone still requires more efforts.",
          "The Committee received ‘12 month reports’ from Myanmar and Madagascar, and noted that it is now more than 13 months since cases of cVDPV were detected in these countries. Although some gaps in surveillance remain, circulation appears to have ceased."

Without this commitment, children will continue to die from a disease that is easy and cheap to prevent.\"</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Mass measles vaccination campaigns and a global increase in routine measles vaccination coverage saved an estimated 20.3 million young lives between 2000 and 2015, according to UNICEF; WHO; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>But progress has been uneven. In 2015, about 20 million infants missed their measles shots and an estimated 134 000 children died from the disease. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan account for half of the unvaccinated infants and 75% of the measles deaths.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"It is not acceptable that millions of children miss their vaccines every year. We have a safe and highly effective vaccine to stop the spread of measles and save lives,\" said Dr. Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, Director of WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. \"This year, the Region of the Americas was declared free of measles – proof that elimination is possible. Now, we must stop measles in the rest of the world. It starts with vaccination.\"</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Measles is a key indicator of the strength of a country’s immunization systems and, all too often, it ends up being the canary in the coalmine with outbreaks acting as the first warning of deeper problems,\" said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. \"To address one of the world’s most deadly vaccine-preventable childhood killers we need strong commitments from countries and partners to boost routine immunization coverage and to strengthen surveillance systems.\"</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Measles, a highly contagious viral disease that spreads through direct contact and through the air, is one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. It can be prevented with 2 doses of a safe and effective vaccine.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Measles outbreaks in numerous countries – caused by gaps in routine immunization and in mass vaccination campaigns – continue to be a serious challenge. In 2015, large outbreaks were reported in Egypt, Ethiopia, Germany, Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia. The outbreaks in Germany and Mongolia affected older persons, highlighting the need to vaccinate adolescents and young adults who have no protection against measles.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Measles also tends to flare up in countries in conflict or humanitarian emergencies due to the challenges of vaccinating every child. Last year, outbreaks were reported in Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Measles elimination in 4 of 6 WHO regions is the global target at the midpoint of the <em>Global Vaccine Action Plan</em> implementation. \"The world has missed this target, but we can achieve measles elimination as we have seen in the Region of the Americas,\" said Dr. Rebecca Martin, director of CDC’s Center for Global Health. \"As the African adage goes, ‘it takes a village to raise a child’ and it takes the same local and global villages to protect children against measles. We can eliminate measles from countries and everyone needs to play a role. This year’s report shows that the 2015 WHO regional measles elimination goals were not met because not every child has been reached – gaps exist. We need to close these gaps, ensure that commitments for adequate human and financial resources are kept and used well to reach every child, detect and respond to every case of measles, and prevent further spread. These efforts will protect all children so that they can become the next generation of leaders. This will also ensure that every country has a strong safety net to stop disease threats where they occur and protect the world from global health threats.\"</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Note to editors</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The <em>Global Vaccine Action Plan</em> adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2012 set a goal of eliminating measles in 4 regions by 2015.

These guidelines are an invaluable tool for protecting patients.\"</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Surgical site infections are caused by bacteria that get in through incisions made during surgery. They threaten the lives of millions of patients each year and contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance. In low- and middle-income countries, 11% of patients who undergo surgery are infected in the process. In Africa, up to 20% of women who have a caesarean section contract a wound infection, compromising their own health and their ability to care for their babies.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>But surgical site infections are not just a problem for poor countries. In the United States, they contribute to patients spending more than 400 000 extra days in hospital at a cost of an additional US$ 900 million per year.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Preventing infections before, during and after surgery</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The guidelines include 13 recommendations for the period before surgery, and 16 for preventing infections during and after surgery. They range from simple precautions such as ensuring that patients bathe or shower before surgery and the best way for surgical teams to clean their hands, to guidance on when to use antibiotics to prevent infections, what disinfectants to use before incision, and which sutures to use.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Sooner or later many of us will need surgery, but none of us wants to pick up an infection on the operating table,\" said Dr Ed Kelley, Director of WHO’s Department of Service Delivery and Safety. \"By applying these new guidelines surgical teams can reduce harm, improve quality of life, and do their bit to stop the spread of antibiotic resistance. We also recommend that patients preparing for surgery ask their surgeon whether they are following WHO’s advice.\"</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>No international evidence-based guidelines had previously been available and there are inconsistencies in the interpretation of evidence and recommendations in existing national guidelines. The new WHO guidelines are valid for any country and suitable to local adaptations, and take account of the strength of available scientific evidence, the cost and resource implications, and patient values and preferences. They complement WHO’s popular <em>\"Surgical Safety Checklist\"</em>, which gives a broad range of safety measures, by giving more detailed recommendations on preventing infections.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Halting the spread of antibiotic resistance</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Importantly, the guidelines recommend that antibiotics be used to prevent infections before and during surgery only, a crucial measure in stopping the spread of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics should not be used after surgery, as is often done.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Antibiotics are medicines used to prevent and treat bacterial infections. Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change in response to the use of these medicines. Resistance develops naturally over time, but misuse of antibiotics in humans and animals is rapidly accelerating the process.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Antibiotic resistance is putting the achievements of modern medicine at risk. Without effective antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of infections, organ transplants, cancer chemotherapy and surgeries such as caesarean sections and hip replacements become much more dangerous. This leads to longer hospital stays, higher medical costs, and increased mortality.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Many studies show that implementing a range of preventive measures significantly reduces harm from surgical site infections. A pilot study in 4 African countries showed that implementing a selection of the new recommendations could result in a 39% reduction in surgical site infections. Building upon these successful examples, WHO is developing a guide and toolkit that will help national and local authorities to put the recommendations into action.</span> </p>\n<div> </div>",

          "Antibiotics are medicines used to prevent and treat bacterial infections. Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change in response to the use of these medicines. Resistance develops naturally over time, but misuse of antibiotics in humans and animals is rapidly accelerating the process.",
          "Antibiotic resistance is putting the achievements of modern medicine at risk. Without effective antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of infections, organ transplants, cancer chemotherapy and surgeries such as caesarean sections and hip replacements become much more dangerous. This leads to longer hospital stays, higher medical costs, and increased mortality.",
          "Many studies show that implementing a range of preventive measures significantly reduces harm from surgical site infections. A pilot study in 4 African countries showed that implementing a selection of the new recommendations could result in a 39% reduction in surgical site infections. Building upon these successful examples, WHO is developing a guide and toolkit that will help national and local authorities to put the recommendations into action."

Many midwives also face cultural isolation, unsafe accommodation and low salaries.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The organizations highlight the need to provide midwives with professional support (including better working conditions); stronger education and regulatory environments; and stronger advocacy around midwifery.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Every year, more than 300 000 women die while giving birth and 2.7 million newborns die during the first 28 days of life, many from preventable causes. Midwifery – the skilled, knowledgeable and compassionate care provided throughout pregnancy and childbirth – plays a vital role in preventing these deaths, but only when it is of quality and provided by midwives educated and regulated to international standards.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">The challenges midwives face</h2>\n<p>\n<span>\"Just as we are all committed to the highest quality care for all women, newborns, and their families, so must we be united in our fervour to ensure that the midwifery workforce is supported by quality education, regulation, and safe working conditions,\" says Frances Ganges, ICM Chief Executive. \"Midwives must be respected, compensated and valued as equally as other professionals.\"\r\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>One-fifth of midwives who answered the online survey depend on another source of income to survive, which adds to the pressure and exhaustion that they experience. Many combine the roles of work, motherhood and caring for others in their communities. The midwives reported that long and stressful hours badly affected their families, with over one-third stating they had no choice but to leave children under 14 years alone while they work.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Though most feel they are treated with respect, many midwives reported harassment at work, a lack of security and fear of violence. Disrespect in the workplace negatively affects midwives’ self-esteem and their ability to provide quality care to mothers and babies worldwide.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Professionally, many midwives are neither provided with adequate education, nor regulatory and legal support. Few national midwifery associations get the support they need to develop leadership skills. This lack of investment reinforces gender inequality and unequal power relations within the health system.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">What needs to change</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The partners responsible for the survey are highlighting the urgent need to address the challenges so many midwives face. Key steps include:</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>1. Provision of <strong>professional support</strong>. To improve working conditions for midwives and quality of care for women and newborns, midwifery professionals need salaries that adequately reflect the level of their skills and responsibilities, health insurance and social security systems, professional support networks, good living environments, and counselling services.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>2. Better <strong>education and regulation</strong>. The report includes recommendations to strengthen education and regulatory environments around midwifery. Nine out of ten respondents think that recognition of midwives by the health service is important for changes to take place.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>3. <strong>Advocacy for midwifery</strong>. Based on the findings of the survey, WHO, ICM, WRA, USAID, UNFPA and other partners are developing a \"Global Midwifery Advocacy Strategy\" aimed at addressing the barriers midwifery personnel face in order to improve quality of care. The strategy will urge global decision makers to value the evidence on the positive impact of quality midwifery care. It will encourage policy makers to draw on the expertise of midwives when making policy and strategy decisions that affect maternal and newborn care.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Midwives are essential to providing quality, respectful maternal and newborn care. They are able to prevent and manage many complications of pregnancy and birth and play a crucial role in ending preventable child and maternal deaths,\" says Dr Ariel Pablos-Méndez, Assistant Administrator for Global Health and Child and Maternal Survival Coordinator, USAID. \"USAID is committed to supporting and empowering their important role on the frontlines of health systems.\"</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"If we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we must value and support midwives,\" says Betsy McCallon, CEO, White Ribbon Alliance. \"Midwives are directly responsible for providing reproductive, maternal and newborn health services, yet they are largely absent or ignored from designing policies and programs at all levels. Today, we stand with midwives to call for investment in and respect for midwives and midwifery so that all women receive the quality and dignified care they deserve.\"</span></p>",

    "content_html": "<p><strong>Investing in health employment is key in attaining Sustainable Development Goals</strong></p><div><span>The Presidents of France and South Africa today called for urgent investments globally to create new jobs in the health sector in order to prevent a projected shortfall of 18 million health workers primarily in low- and lower-middle-income countries, and help countries to maximize the social and economic benefits of increased health employment.</span></div><p><span>The High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth, chaired by H.E. François Hollande and H.E. Jacob Zuma, today delivered its final report and recommendations to United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.</span></p><p><span>The Commission concluded that investing in the health workforce is needed to make progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, including gains in health, global security and inclusive economic growth. The commission made 10 recommendations for realising those gains, through appropriate investments in health employment that can power economies, move countries closer to universal health coverage and act as a bulwark against outbreaks such as Ebola.</span></p><p><span>Ageing populations and increasing rates of non-communicable diseases are projected to generate demand for 40 million new health workers worldwide by 2030, which would represent a doubling of the current global health workforce. But most of those jobs will be created in the wealthiest countries. Without action there will be a shortfall, primarily in low- and lower-middle-income countries, of 18 million health workers needed to achieve and sustain universal health coverage.</span></p><p><span>Mounting evidence shows that investments in the health sector pay handsome dividends. The returns on investment in health are estimated to be 9 to 1, and around one quarter of growth between 2000 and 2011 in low-income and middle-income countries is estimated to have resulted from improvements to health. Investing in skills and expanding health employment will also contribute to the economic empowerment of women and youth.</span></p><p><span>\"For too long countries have seen health workers as just another cost to be managed, instead of an investment with a triple return for health, economic growth and global health security,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization.</span></p><p><span>The need for action is urgent. The Commission calls for immediate actions by March 2018 to secure commitments and accountability for accelerated health workforce investments. In response to the Commission’s request, the Vice-Chairs of the Commission from WHO, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the Organizations for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will convene all relevant stakeholders by the end of 2016 to develop a 5-year implementation plan for the 10 recommendations.</span></p><p><span>\"The report provides solid evidence that investing in the health economy and progressing towards universal health coverage can strengthen economic growth and make it more inclusive by generating decent jobs in a wide range of occupations,\" said Mr Guy Ryder, Director-General of the International Labour Organization. \"It offers practical proposals for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, particularly Sustainable Development Goal 3 on healthy lives and well-being for all at all ages, and Goal 8 on inclusive growth and decent work.\"</span></p><p><span>Health is a major and growing source of jobs. Across the OECD, employment in health and social work grew by 48% between 2000 and 2014, while jobs in industry and agriculture declined.</span></p><p><span>\"These recommendations will chart the course to achieve greater and more effective investment in the health workforce. This will be a critical element to promote better lives and help our economies flourish and achieve their full potential,\" said Mr Angel Gurría, Secretary-General of the OECD.</span></p><p><span>The Commission’s vision is for an expanded, transformed and sustainable health workforce to promote health, prevent disease, meet the needs of populations, and drive inclusive economic growth.</span></p><p><span>The commission’s 10 recommendations are:</span></p><ul><li>Stimulate investments in creating decent health sector jobs, particularly for women and youth, with the right skills, in the right numbers and in the right places.</li><li>Maximize women’s economic participation and foster their empowerment through institutionalizing their leadership, addressing gender biases and inequities in education and the health labour market, and tackling gender concerns in health reform processes.</li><li>Scale up transformative, high-quality education and lifelong learning so that all health workers have skills that match the health needs of populations and can work to their full potential.</li><li>Reform service models concentrated on hospital care and focus instead on prevention and on the efficient provision of high-quality, affordable, integrated, community-based, people-centred primary and ambulatory care, paying special attention to underserved areas.</li><li>Harness the power of cost-effective information and communication technologies to enhance health education, people-centred health services and health information systems.</li><li>Ensure investment in the International Health Regulations core capacities, including skills development of national and international health workers in humanitarian settings and public health emergencies, both acute and protracted. Ensure the protection and security of all health workers and health facilities in all settings.</li><li>Raise adequate funding from domestic and international sources, public and private where appropriate, and consider broad-based health financing reform where needed, to invest in the right skills, decent working conditions and an appropriate number of health workers.</li><li>Promote intersectoral collaboration at national, regional and international levels; engage civil society, unions and other health workers' organizations and the private sector; and align international cooperation to support investments in the health workforce, as part of national health and education strategies and plans.</li><li>Advance international recognition of health workers' qualifications to optimize skills use, increase the benefits from and reduce the negative effects of health worker migration, and safeguard migrants' rights.</li><li>Undertake robust research and analysis of health labour markets, using harmonized metrics and methodologies, to strengthen evidence, accountability and action.</li></ul><hr/><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Note for editors:</h2><p><span>The High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth was established by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in March 2016.

CDC is also working with the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in DRC to support the dose sparing approach used in the Kinshasa campaign, including facilitating an evaluation of the immune response it provides.

From the first day and throughout the campaign, thousands of people have been turning up to get vaccinated at posts across the huge city. By 28 August, the Government reported that 7.7 million people had been vaccinated in the capital city, and a further 1.5 million people in DRC's border regions with Angola. Of the 7.7 million people vaccinated in Kinshasa, around 400 000 pregnant women and babies received the full dose under SAGE recommendations.</span></p><p><span>Over the next few weeks, vaccination teams will focus on completing the campaign in remote border regions and reaching people at risk who may have missed out on vaccination the first time around. In Angola, vaccination campaigns are ongoing, with an estimated 3 million people vaccinated since mid-August.</span></p><p><span>This latest campaign that aims at prevention builds on previous emergency yellow fever reactive vaccination campaigns led by national governments that have already reached more than 13 million people in Angola and more than 3 million in DRC since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2015.</span></p><p><span>Since the beginning of this year, almost 1000 people in both countries have had confirmed yellow fever, with many more suspected cases and more than 400 deaths reported.</span></p><p><span>The yellow fever outbreak in both countries appears to be declining – no new cases have been confirmed in either country for over a month – However, given that there may still be viral circulation in the mosquito vector, and in other animal reservoirs, and in anticipation of the upcoming rainy season that will result in increased risk of transmission, it is critical to continue to provide support to ensure the countries have the capacity to detect and respond to any further cases of yellow fever.</span> <span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#333333;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> </span></p>",

          "Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) mobilized 200 staff from 20 countries to manage the vaccination of over 710 000 people in three health zones in Kinshasa in collaboration with Ministry of Health staff, including training of the vaccination teams, supervision, logistic support, waste and cold chain management.",
          "The Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo, supported by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, mobilized thousands of volunteers across affected areas to promote and support the campaign and share yellow fever prevention and protection information.",
          "Save the Children deployed a team of specialists from their Emergency Health Unit to provide technical and operational support to the Ministry of Public Health in Binza Ozone health zone. The team, with help from national staff, assisted the Ministry to vaccinate more than 360 000 people, more than half of them children.",
          "The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has supported the international response and vaccination campaigns, deploying more than 45 experts to support these efforts since February 2016, in roles including: Incident Manager in Angola, Response Team Leads, Emergency Management Specialist, Laboratory experts, Public Health Advisors, Vaccine Specialists, Communications Specialists and Epidemiologists. CDC is also working with the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in DRC to support the dose sparing approach used in the Kinshasa campaign, including facilitating an evaluation of the immune response it provides. This study, funded by USAID, will help provide more information and inform decisions on future use of this method for yellow fever vaccination.",
          "Through its US$ 20.3 million contribution to the global yellow fever vaccine stockpile, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has supported the majority of vaccine doses used in DRC and Angola outbreak response. Overall Gavi has contributed 16.5 million vaccine doses to the stockpile this year. Additionally, the Vaccine Alliance is providing US$ 8.7 million to support the operational costs of the campaign in DRC.",
          "The World Bank provided US$ 3 million to co-finance the yellow fever vaccines as well as other services needed as part of the overall plan prepared by the Government. The World Bank also has contributed US $5 million to the Government of Angola to finance the yellow fever vaccination programme in the country."

          "On 16 August, the Government of DRC launched the vaccination campaign in Kinshasa with the goal to vaccinate 7.5 million people within 2 weeks in order to interrupt viral circulation and prevent the outbreak from escalating.. From the first day and throughout the campaign, thousands of people have been turning up to get vaccinated at posts across the huge city. By 28 August, the Government reported that 7.7 million people had been vaccinated in the capital city, and a further 1.5 million people in DRC's border regions with Angola. Of the 7.7 million people vaccinated in Kinshasa, around 400 000 pregnant women and babies received the full dose under SAGE recommendations.",
          "Over the next few weeks, vaccination teams will focus on completing the campaign in remote border regions and reaching people at risk who may have missed out on vaccination the first time around. In Angola, vaccination campaigns are ongoing, with an estimated 3 million people vaccinated since mid-August.",
          "This latest campaign that aims at prevention builds on previous emergency yellow fever reactive vaccination campaigns led by national governments that have already reached more than 13 million people in Angola and more than 3 million in DRC since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2015.",
          "Since the beginning of this year, almost 1000 people in both countries have had confirmed yellow fever, with many more suspected cases and more than 400 deaths reported.",
          "The yellow fever outbreak in both countries appears to be declining – no new cases have been confirmed in either country for over a month – However, given that there may still be viral circulation in the mosquito vector, and in other animal reservoirs, and in anticipation of the upcoming rainy season that will result in increased risk of transmission, it is critical to continue to provide support to ensure the countries have the capacity to detect and respond to any further cases of yellow fever."

However, these STIs often go undiagnosed and are becoming more difficult to treat, with some antibiotics now failing as a result of misuse and overuse. It is estimated that, each year, 131 million people are infected with chlamydia, 78 million with gonorrhoea, and 5.6 million with syphilis.</span></p><p><span>Resistance of these STIs to the effect of antibiotics has increased rapidly in recent years and has reduced treatment options. Of the 3 STIs, gonorrhoea has developed the strongest resistance to antibiotics. Strains of multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea that do not respond to any available antibiotics have already been detected. Antibiotic resistance in chlamydia and syphilis, though less common, also exists, making prevention and prompt treatment critical.</span></p><p><span>When left undiagnosed and untreated, these STIs can result in serious complications and long-term health problems for women, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and miscarriage, and untreated gonorrhoea and chlamydia can cause infertility in both men and women. Infection with chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis can also increase a person’s risk of being infected with HIV two- to three-fold. An untreated STI in a pregnant woman increases the chances of stillbirth and newborn death.</span></p><p><span>\"Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis are major public health problems worldwide, affecting millions of peoples' quality of life, causing serious illness and sometimes death. The new WHO guidelines reinforce the need to treat these STIs with the right antibiotic, at the right dose, and the right time to reduce their spread and improve sexual and reproductive health. To do that, national health services need to monitor the patterns of antibiotic resistance in these infections within their countries,\" says Ian Askew, Director of Reproductive Health and Research, WHO.</span></p><p><span>The new recommendations are based on the latest available evidence on the most effective treatments for these 3 sexually transmitted infections.</span></p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Gonorrhoea</h2><p><span>Gonorrhoea is a common STI that can cause infection in the genitals, rectum, and throat. Antimicrobial resistance has appeared and expanded with every release of new classes of antibiotics for the treatment of gonorrhoea. Because of widespread resistance, older and cheaper antibiotics have lost their effectiveness in treatment of the infection.</span></p><ul><li><a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789241549691\">WHO guidelines for the treatment of <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em></a>\n</li></ul><p><span>WHO urges countries to update their national gonorrhoea treatment guidelines in response to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. National health authorities should track the prevalence of resistance to different antibiotics in the strains of gonorrhoea circulating among their population. The new guideline calls on health authorities to advise doctors to prescribe whichever antibiotic would be most effective, based on local resistance patterns. The new WHO guidelines do not recommend quinolones (a class of antibiotic) for the treatment of gonorrhoea due to widespread high levels of resistance.</span></p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Syphilis</h2><p><span>Syphilis is spread by contact with a sore on the genitals, anus, rectum, lips or mouth, or from mother to child during pregnancy. If a pregnant woman has untreated syphilis and the infection is transmitted to the fetus, this often causes it to die. In 2012, mother-to-child transmission of syphilis resulted in an estimated 143 000 early fetal deaths or stillbirths, 62 000 neonatal deaths, and 44 000 babies being born preterm or with low-birth-weight.</span></p><ul><li><a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789241549714\">WHO guidelines for the treatment of <em>Treponema pallidum</em> (syphilis)</a>\n</li></ul><p><span>To cure syphilis, the new WHO guidelines strongly recommend a single dose of benzathine penicillin – a form of the antibiotic that is injected by a doctor or nurse into the infected patient’s buttock or thigh muscle. This is the most effective treatment for syphilis, as it is more effective and cheaper than oral antibiotics.</span></p><p><span>Benzathine penicillin was recognized by the Sixty-ninth World Health Assembly in May 2016 as an essential medicine which has been in short supply for several years. Reports of stock outs have been received by WHO from antenatal care representatives and providers in countries with high burdens of syphilis from 3 WHO Regions. WHO is working with partners to identify countries with shortages and help monitor global availability of benzathine penicillin to close the gap between national needs and supply of the antibiotic.</span></p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Chlamydia</h2><p><span>Chlamydia is the most common bacterial STI and people with this infection are frequently co-infected with gonorrhoea. Symptoms of chlamydia include discharge and a burning feeling when urinating, but most people who are infected have no symptoms. Even when chlamydia is asymptomatic, it can damage the reproductive system.</span></p><ul><li><a href=\"/publications/i/item/978-92-4-154971-4\">WHO guidelines for the treatment of <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em></a>\n</li></ul><p><span>WHO is calling on countries to start using the updated guidelines immediately, as recommended in the <em>\"Global Health Sector Strategy for Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016-2021)\"</em> endorsed by governments at the World Health Assembly in May 2016.

    "content_html": "<div>\n<p>The tenth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened via teleconference by the WHO Director-General on 11 August 2016.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<span>The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine­derived polioviruses (cVDPV).</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Secretariat presented a full report of progress for all affected IHR States Parties previously considered by the Emergency Committee. The following IHR States Parties presented an update on the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 12 May 2016: Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Wild polio</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee was gravely concerned by the report from Nigeria of two new cases in July of acute flaccid paralysis in children due to WPV1 from Borno State from two different local government areas (LGA): Gwoza and Jere. The Committee noted that genetic analysis indicated that the two viruses detected had circulated undetected for several years. These cases, together with the cVDPV2 reported in May 2016 also from Borno, indicate polioviruses have been circulating undetected in the area for several years and that significant gaps in surveillance remain. Such gaps are compounded by a recent increase in the area of inaccessibility in the state. The Committee was also concerned that Gwoza district has a long border with the Extreme North province of Cameroon and is considered inaccessible. Noting the history of poliovirus transmission in the Lake Chad area, and the international borders around Borno with Cameroon, Chad and Niger, the Committee concluded that the risk of international spread between these four countries was extremely high and may already be happening. Further international spread would significantly delay progress towards global eradication. The Emergency Committee was concerned that the Nigerian Polio Presidential Committee has not met in 2016, and that there have been delays in government funds being released for the polio response.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee applauded the progress being made in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the renewed emphasis on cooperation along the long international border between the two countries noting that this constitutes an epidemiological block between the two countries. The Committee applauded the strong progress being made in Pakistan, with consistent evidence of reduced transmission in 2016, and welcomed Pakistan’s determination to complete eradication this year. The Committee was pleased that as a result of these efforts, there has been no international spread of wild poliovirus between Pakistan and Afghanistan since the previous meeting.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Whilst border vaccination between these two countries is limited to children under ten years of age, efforts are being made to vaccinate departing travellers of all age groups from airports. The committee was pleased that progress had been made in Afghanistan where some foreign embassies now facilitate implementation of Temporary Recommendations through adopting procedures that include proof of polio vaccination as part of visa application processes for travellers departing from Afghanistan.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee, however, was concerned by the deteriorating security in parts of Afghanistan leading to more children becoming inaccessible, heightening anxiety about completion of eradication in 2016, thereby delaying the global polio endgame. The Committee also noted that globally there are still significant vulnerable areas and populations that are inadequately immunized due to conflict, insecurity and poor coverage associated with weak immunization programmes. Such vulnerable areas include countries in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, and Central Africa.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee noted that in Equatorial Guinea (last case 3 May 2014) and Cameroon (last case 9 July 2014), although more than 24 months have passed without new infection by poliovirus, neither country had yet provided a final report as requested. Furthermore, Equatorial Guinea had weak surveillance indicators, and there were concerns about routine immunisation and Cameroon is now vulnerable to importation of WPV from Nigeria.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Vaccine derived poliovirus</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee noted that there have been no new cases of cVDPV since the previous meeting in May 2016.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In Guinea, the outbreak appears to be confined to one region, Kankan, where the most recent case had onset in December 2015. The Committee, however, felt there appears to be a medium to high risk of spread to neighbouring areas, as active surveillance has only recently started and the likelihood of missing transmission cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, surveillance indicators in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone are below required standards and more efforts are needed to enhance surveillance in all these countries.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee remains very concerned that in Nigeria a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been detected in an environmental sample in March 2016 in Maiduguri, Borno State, north-east Nigeria. The Committee noted that a very robust outbreak response is under way by the Government of Nigeria, but the new incidence of WPV1 now complicates that response.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In Myanmar, Laos and Madagascar, where the most recent cases had onset of paralysis on : 5 October 2015 from Rakhine province, 11 January 2016 from Vientiane province, and 22 August 2015 from Sud-Ouest province, respectively, recent outbreak assessments showed much progress, but uncertainty about ongoing transmission remains due to gaps in surveillance. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In the Ukraine, where two cases of cVDPV1 occurred in 2015, the outbreak assessment recently concluded that poliovirus transmission had ceased, and as it is now 13 months since onset of the last case (7 July 2015) the outbreak is considered closed.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee unanimously agreed that the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of the Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The new outbreak of WPV1 in Nigeria highlighting that there are high-risk areas where surveillance is compromised by inaccessibility, resulting in ongoing circulation of WPV for several years without detection. The risk of transmission in the Lake Chad sub-region appears extremely high.</li>\n<li>The continued international spread of wild poliovirus during 2015 and 2016 involving Pakistan and Afghanistan.</li>\n<li>The current special and extraordinary context of being closer to polio eradication than ever before in history.</li>\n<li>The risk and consequent costs of failure to eradicate globally one of the world’s most serious vaccine preventable diseases. Even though global transmission has fallen dramatically and with it the likelihood of international spread, the consequences and impact of international spread should it occur would be grave.</li>\n<li>The possibility of global complacency developing as the numbers of polio cases continues to fall and eradication becomes a possibility.</li>\n<li>The continued necessity of a coordinated international response to improve immunization and surveillance for wild poliovirus, to stop international spread and reduce the risk of new spread.</li>\n<li>The serious consequences of further international spread for the increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. Outbreaks in fragile states are exceedingly difficult to control and threaten the completion of global polio eradication during its end stage.</li>\n<li>The importance of a regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders, while recognizing that the risk of distant international spread remains from zones with active poliovirus transmission.</li>\n<li>Additionally with respect to cVDPV:</li>\n<ul class=\"disc\">\n<li>cVDPVs also pose a risk for international spread, which without an urgent response with appropriate measures threatens vulnerable populations as noted above;</li>\n<li>The emergence and circulation of VDPVs in four WHO regions demonstrates significant gaps in population immunity at a critical time in the polio endgame;</li>\n<li>There is a particular urgency of preventing type 2 cVDPVs following the globally synchronized withdrawal of type 2 component of the oral poliovirus vaccine in April 2016;</li>\n<li>The ongoing challenges of improving routine immunization in areas affected by insecurity and other emergencies, including Ebola;</li>\n<li>The global shortage of IPV poses fresh challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"section_head2\">Risk categories</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee provided the WHO Director­General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of wild poliovirus and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head2\">Wild poliovirus</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>States currently exporting wild poliovirus;</li>\n<li>States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting;</li>\n<li>States no longer infected by wild poliovirus, but which remain vulnerable to international spread.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"section_head2\">Circulating vaccine derived poliovirus</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>States currently exporting cVDPV;</li>\n<li>States infected with cVDPV but not currently exporting;</li>\n<li>States no longer infected by cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to the emergence and circulation of VDPV.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee applied the following criteria to assess the period for detection of no new exportations and the period for detection of no new cases or environmental isolates of wild poliovirus or cVDPV:</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head3\">Criteria to assess States no longer exporting (detection of no new wild poliovirus or cVDPV exportation)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the first case caused by the most recent exportation PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period, OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of the first case caused by the most recent importation have been tested for polio and excluded for newly imported WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental samples collected within 12 months of the first case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.</li>\n<li>Environmental isolation of exported poliovirus: 12 months after collection of the first positive environmental sample in the country that received the new exportation PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"section_head3\">Criteria to assess States no longer infected (detection of no new wild poliovirus or cVDPV)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.</li>\n<li>Environmental isolation of wild poliovirus or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental sample PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"section_head2\">Temporary recommendations</h2>\n<h2 class=\"section_head3\">States currently exporting wild poliovirus or cVDPV</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Currently Pakistan (last wild poliovirus exportation: 1 February 2016) and Afghanistan (last wild poliovirus exportation: 6 June 2015).</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Exporting countries should:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained.</li>\n<li>Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. &gt; four weeks) of all ages receive a dose of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.</li>\n<li>Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of OPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers.</li>\n<li>Ensure that such travellers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.</li>\n<li>Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travellers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea).</li>\n<li>Recognising that the movement of people across the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan continues to facilitate exportation of wild poliovirus, both countries should further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travellers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Both countries have maintained permanent vaccination teams at the main border crossings for many years. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travellers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.</li>\n<li>Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new exportations and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above criteria of a 'state no longer exporting'.</li>\n<li>Provide to the WHO Director­General a monthly report on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel, including the number of residents whose travel was restricted and the number of travellers who were vaccinated and provided appropriate documentation at the point of departure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"section_head3\">States infected with wild poliovirus or cVDPVs but not currently exporting</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Infected countries (WPV1)</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nigeria (last case 13 July 2016)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>Infected countries (cVDPV)</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nigeria (last env isolate 23 March 2016)</li>\n<li>Guinea (last case 14 December 2015)</li>\n<li>Madagascar (last case 22 August 2015)</li>\n<li>Lao People’s Democratic Republic (last case 11 January 2016)\r\n    </li>\n<li>Myanmar (last case 5 October 2015)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>These countries should:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained.</li>\n<li>Encourage residents and long­term visitors to receive a dose of OPV or IPV four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel; those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure.</li>\n<li>Ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status.

          "The Committee was gravely concerned by the report from Nigeria of two new cases in July of acute flaccid paralysis in children due to WPV1 from Borno State from two different local government areas (LGA): Gwoza and Jere. The Committee noted that genetic analysis indicated that the two viruses detected had circulated undetected for several years. These cases, together with the cVDPV2 reported in May 2016 also from Borno, indicate polioviruses have been circulating undetected in the area for several years and that significant gaps in surveillance remain. Such gaps are compounded by a recent increase in the area of inaccessibility in the state. The Committee was also concerned that Gwoza district has a long border with the Extreme North province of Cameroon and is considered inaccessible. Noting the history of poliovirus transmission in the Lake Chad area, and the international borders around Borno with Cameroon, Chad and Niger, the Committee concluded that the risk of international spread between these four countries was extremely high and may already be happening. Further international spread would significantly delay progress towards global eradication. The Emergency Committee was concerned that the Nigerian Polio Presidential Committee has not met in 2016, and that there have been delays in government funds being released for the polio response.",
          "The Committee applauded the progress being made in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the renewed emphasis on cooperation along the long international border between the two countries noting that this constitutes an epidemiological block between the two countries. The Committee applauded the strong progress being made in Pakistan, with consistent evidence of reduced transmission in 2016, and welcomed Pakistan’s determination to complete eradication this year. The Committee was pleased that as a result of these efforts, there has been no international spread of wild poliovirus between Pakistan and Afghanistan since the previous meeting.",
          "Whilst border vaccination between these two countries is limited to children under ten years of age, efforts are being made to vaccinate departing travellers of all age groups from airports. The committee was pleased that progress had been made in Afghanistan where some foreign embassies now facilitate implementation of Temporary Recommendations through adopting procedures that include proof of polio vaccination as part of visa application processes for travellers departing from Afghanistan.",
          "The Committee, however, was concerned by the deteriorating security in parts of Afghanistan leading to more children becoming inaccessible, heightening anxiety about completion of eradication in 2016, thereby delaying the global polio endgame. The Committee also noted that globally there are still significant vulnerable areas and populations that are inadequately immunized due to conflict, insecurity and poor coverage associated with weak immunization programmes. Such vulnerable areas include countries in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, and Central Africa.",
          "The Committee noted that in Equatorial Guinea (last case 3 May 2014) and Cameroon (last case 9 July 2014), although more than 24 months have passed without new infection by poliovirus, neither country had yet provided a final report as requested. Furthermore, Equatorial Guinea had weak surveillance indicators, and there were concerns about routine immunisation and Cameroon is now vulnerable to importation of WPV from Nigeria."

          "In Guinea, the outbreak appears to be confined to one region, Kankan, where the most recent case had onset in December 2015. The Committee, however, felt there appears to be a medium to high risk of spread to neighbouring areas, as active surveillance has only recently started and the likelihood of missing transmission cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, surveillance indicators in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone are below required standards and more efforts are needed to enhance surveillance in all these countries.",
          "The Committee remains very concerned that in Nigeria a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been detected in an environmental sample in March 2016 in Maiduguri, Borno State, north-east Nigeria. The Committee noted that a very robust outbreak response is under way by the Government of Nigeria, but the new incidence of WPV1 now complicates that response.",
          "In Myanmar, Laos and Madagascar, where the most recent cases had onset of paralysis on : 5 October 2015 from Rakhine province, 11 January 2016 from Vientiane province, and 22 August 2015 from Sud-Ouest province, respectively, recent outbreak assessments showed much progress, but uncertainty about ongoing transmission remains due to gaps in surveillance.",
          "In the Ukraine, where two cases of cVDPV1 occurred in 2015, the outbreak assessment recently concluded that poliovirus transmission had ceased, and as it is now 13 months since onset of the last case (7 July 2015) the outbreak is considered closed."

          "The serious consequences of further international spread for the increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. Outbreaks in fragile states are exceedingly difficult to control and threaten the completion of global polio eradication during its end stage.",

    "content_html": "<div> <span>WHO has today named Mr Michael R. Bloomberg, philanthropist and former three-term Mayor of the City of New York, as Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs).</span></div>\n<p>\n<span>NCDs (including heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases) and injuries are responsible for 43 million deaths each year - almost 80% of all deaths worldwide. Each year, 16 million people die from NCDs before the age of 70. Road traffic crashes account for a further 1.25 million deaths each year and are the leading cause of death among young people, aged 15–29 years. The premature death and disability from NCDs and injury can largely be prevented, through implementing proven, cost effective measures. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>For the past decade, Bloomberg has been working with WHO on tobacco control and injury prevention. “Michael Bloomberg is a valued partner and has a long track record of supporting WHO in the areas of tobacco control, improving data for health, road safety and drowning prevention,” said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. “I am therefore absolutely delighted to be able to appoint him as Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases. This will enable us to strengthen our response together to the major public health challenges of NCDs and injuries.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In his new role, Mr Bloomberg will work with national and local political leaders around the globe to highlight the burden of NCDs and injuries. His track record on public health achievements as mayor will enable him to motivate cities to take on the global agenda for NCD and injury prevention. He will help mobilize national and city level political leaders, donors and the private sector to prevent and treat the NCD epidemic and combat injuries.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Through this work, Mr Bloomberg and WHO will be supporting the attainment of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). World leaders have recognized NCDs and injuries as urgent priorities for action in the SDGs. The SDGs contain a number of specific targets for NCDs and injuries, including halving the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020, reducing by one-third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases by 2030, and strengthening implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“I am honored to become WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and excited about the possibilities that are within our reach. Cities and countries around the world are making great progress reducing preventable, premature deaths, and by replicating the most effective measures on a global scale, we can save many millions of lives,” said Michael Bloomberg. “Together with WHO, we’ll support low- and middle-income countries as they work to achieve their policy goals and direct resources in ways that will best improve public health. We’ll also work to raise awareness among leaders and policy makers at the local level about the real gains that can be achieved when effective programs are in place.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Mr. Bloomberg’s role and activities will extend the reach of WHO’s work to reduce exposure to the main NCD risk factors: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and the harmful use of alcohol, as well as to promote proven measures to reduce injuries from road traffic crashes, burns, falls and drowning. This includes efforts to strengthen health systems’ response to manage NCDs and injuries, and to improve availability of health data to inform policy and programmes. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Effective strategies to prevent NCDs include increasing the tax and price of tobacco and alcohol, enforcing smoke-free environments, implementing large graphic tobacco health warnings, enforcing bans in tobacco advertisement, promotion and sponsorships, promoting the availability of healthy, affordable diets, and discouraging the consumption of foods and beverages high in sugars, salt and fat. Proven actions to prevent the most common forms of injuries include enforcing speed limits, drink-driving legislation and the wearing of seat-belts and helmets, enforcing laws on smoke alarms and hot water tap temperatures, removing or covering water hazards and fencing pools to prevent drowning, eliminating fall hazards and improving balance among the elderly. These are all strategies where both national and local government officials can play a role.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Note for editors</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The position of WHO Global Ambassador is for an initial period of two years and is on a purely honorary basis.

Bloomberg has given more than $4.3 billion in support of education, the environment, government innovation, the arts, and public health.

The strategy includes a target to treat 8 million people for hepatitis B or C by 2020. The longer term aim is to reduce new viral hepatitis infections by 90% and to reduce the number of deaths due to viral hepatitis by 65% by 2030 from 2016 figures.</span></p><p><span>The strategy is ambitious, but the tools to achieve the targets are already in hand. An effective vaccine and treatment for hepatitis B exists. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C but there has been dramatic progress on treatment for the disease in the past few years. The introduction of oral medicines, called direct-acting antivirals, has made it possible to potentially cure more than 90% of patients within 2–3 months. But in many countries, current policies, regulations and medicine prices put the cure out of most people’s reach. </span></p><p><span>“We need to act now to stop people from dying needlessly from hepatitis,” said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, WHO's Director of the HIV/AIDS Department and Global Hepatitis Programme. “This requires a rapid acceleration of access to services and medicines for all people in need.” </span></p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Improving treatment</h2><p><span>Some countries, however, are finding ways to get services to the people who need them.

The Organization is highlighting the need to renew attention to HIV prevention, whilst maintaining momentum on scaling up access to HIV treatment. It is also signalling the growing emergence of antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance and the need for sustainable financing of the global response.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<span>“The enormous progress on HIV, particularly on treatment, is one of the big public health success stories of the century,” says Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General, WHO. “But this is no time for complacency. If the world is to achieve its goal of ending AIDS by 2030, it must rapidly expand and intensify its efforts.” </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Prevention</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Globally, progress on HIV prevention has stalled. In 2015 there were 2.1 million new HIV infections – marginally fewer than the 2.2 million in 2010. In some regions, and among some groups, infections are rising. In some places where the epidemic had been under control, for example in some urban populations of men who have sex with men, it is re-emerging.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In 2014, 35% of new HIV infections worldwide occurred among men who have sex with men; sex workers and their clients; transgender people; people who inject drugs and people in prisons. In eastern and southern Africa, girls aged between 10–19 years remain particularly vulnerable and affected.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Reducing new HIV infections means addressing the social and legal barriers that impede many people from accessing HIV services. It means tailoring prevention programmes so the right services reach the groups that are most vulnerable and affected, ensuring that individuals have easy access to approaches that work, and work for them. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO notes that better prevention will happen if countries invest strategically in approaches with the greatest impact, for example by exploiting new interventions, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) – where antiretroviral drugs are used to protect people at high risk of becoming infected with HIV. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO also highlights the importance of revitalizing long-established and proven approaches, such as the promotion of condoms, and to maintain momentum on voluntary medical male circumcision in the 14 most-affected countries of eastern and southern African countries, where 11.7 million voluntary medical male circumcisions were performed by the end of 2015. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>At the same time, countries need to deliver these services more efficiently to reach more people at lower cost, including through the integration of HIV prevention into sexual and reproductive health services.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Treatment</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Since 2015, WHO has recommended that all people diagnosed with HIV start antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible to prevent illness and death. The uptake of WHO’s Treat All policy has been rapid. Implementation has been facilitated by recent dramatic improvements in ART being used – with 1 tablet a day which is safe and well tolerated.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Treatment saves lives: AIDS-related deaths have fallen 45% since their peak in 2005 and 26% since 2010. Expanding HIV treatment also helps reduce transmission: as the level of the virus drops in a person, so does the risk of transmission. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>But many challenges remain. More than 40% of people living with HIV still do not know they are infected, highlighting the need for ready access to simple and affordable testing services. Self-testing provides an opportunity for more people to be tested, particularly those who are reluctant to use health services. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>There is also a need to tailor treatment programmes to reach people who may be reluctant to come forward, and to ensure that these people are supported by a full range of community services, as well as strengthening health systems more generally so people can receive the full range of health services they need, beyond HIV.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Drug resistance</h2>\n<p>\n<span>WHO’s last report on HIV-related drug resistance (2004-2008) showed that 5% of people on ART were resistant to at least 1 antiretroviral drug. The Organization is monitoring the trends and notes worrisome indications that drug resistance is emerging as a more significant threat in some countries and populations. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO is therefore launching a report on “Early Warning Indicators of HIV drug resistance” in Durban this week to help countries monitor factors that may contribute to the problem. These programme factors include adherence to treatment and retention in the services, interruptions in the supply of antiretroviral drugs through stock-outs, and poor quality of treatment services. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The report outlines actions countries need to take in order to identify problems early and to act quickly to avert drug resistance. As treatment continues to expand, countries will need to be vigilant to ensure that the quality of treatment services is assured to minimize the emergence of drug resistance. To address this threat, WHO is developing a Global Action Plan on HIV drug resistance – calling on countries to continue surveillance to ensure rapid action.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Financing for a sustainable response</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The ever-expanding development agenda, changing donor priorities and continuing threats to the global economy all pose challenges to financing efforts to end AIDS. It will be important to ensure full replenishment of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria in September.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Middle-income countries will face particular challenges as they transition from external to predominantly domestic funding of their HIV and broader health services. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>At the same time, countries will need to align HIV responses with broader efforts towards universal health coverage and access to social protection. This will require them to generate more funds for health in general, for example through general taxation, and to establish robust financing mechanisms that enable individuals to receive the services they need without suffering financial hardship. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>It will also be key to improve cost-effectiveness and increase efficiencies. Working to bring down the cost of medicines and other commodities is one way to do this. Another is closer integration of HIV services with the wider health system, and making the most of common health system platforms, such as strategic information, human resources, and procurement and supply management.<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"> </span><br/>\n</span></p>",

This will require them to generate more funds for health in general, for example through general taxation, and to establish robust financing mechanisms that enable individuals to receive the services they need without suffering financial hardship.",
          "It will also be key to improve cost-effectiveness and increase efficiencies. Working to bring down the cost of medicines and other commodities is one way to do this. Another is closer integration of HIV services with the wider health system, and making the most of common health system platforms, such as strategic information, human resources, and procurement and supply management."

The IHR were amended in 2014 to indicate that a single dose of the vaccine is sufficient for life-long immunity and therefore extends the validity of vaccination certificates to the life of the person vaccinated. All countries must abide by this new amendment when it enters into force on 11 July 2016. </span></p><p><span>A yellow fever vaccine given at a fractional dose would not qualify for a yellow fever certificate under the IHR requirements.

          "Eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis is key to the global effort to combat sexually transmitted infections and to end AIDS by the year 2030.",
          "In 2014, WHO and partners developed global criteria to validate the elimination of transmission of both infections through a rigorous review of country progress. Last year, Cuba became the first country to be validated for having successfully eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis.",
          "Today, WHO recognizes Thailand, Armenia, Belarus, and the Republic of Moldova for their remarkable accomplishments. These countries have worked hard to ensure early access to prenatal care, HIV and syphilis testing for pregnant women and their partners, and treatment for women who test positive, as well as their babies. The provision of reproductive health information, the engagement of communities and outreach to marginalized populations, in a manner consistent with basic human rights and gender equality, has helped to facilitate such access.",
          "The achievements are testament to a key factor – the integration of maternal and child health with sexual, reproductive health and HIV services. Integration underpins WHO’s new health sector strategies on HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and viral hepatitis, and is fundamental to the attainment of universal health coverage and the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals."

It provides the Organization with comprehensive policies and procedures on engaging with nongovernmental organizations, private sector entities, philanthropic foundations and academic institutions. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Framework aims to strengthen WHO engagement with all stakeholders while protecting its work from conflicts of interest and undue influence from external actors, and is based on a standardized process of due diligence and risk assessment. FENSA also facilitates an enhanced level of transparency and accountability in WHO’s engagement with non-State actors, with information on these engagements publicly available online in the WHO Register of non-State actors.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Sustainable Development Goals</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates agreed a comprehensive set of steps that lay the groundwork for pursuing the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>They agreed to prioritize universal health coverage, and to work with actors outside the health sector to address the social, economic and environmental causes of health problems, including antimicrobial resistance. They agreed to continue and expand efforts to address poor maternal and child health and infectious diseases in developing countries, and to put a greater focus on equity within and between countries, leaving no-one behind. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates also asked WHO to take steps to ensure that the organization has the resources it needs at all levels to achieve the SDGs, to work with countries to strengthen their ability to monitor progress towards the goals, and to take the SDGs into consideration in developing the Organization's budget and programme of work.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">International Health Regulations</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The Health Assembly considered the report of the Review Committee on the Role of the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) in the Ebola Outbreak and Response. Delegates commended the Committee for its work. They called on WHO to develop a global implementation plan for the recommendations of the Committee, taking forward immediately those recommendations that are consistent with existing IHR (2005) practice and allowing for further discussion and consideration of the new approaches that are proposed. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Review concluded that the escalation of the Ebola outbreak was not the fault of the IHR themselves. Instead, it identified a lack of implementation of the Regulations as contributing to the escalation. It also characterized the IHR as an invaluable international legal framework that provides the backbone for public health response. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Approaches proposed in the Committee’s report to strengthen implementation of the Regulations include the introduction of a new, intermediate level of public health alert and recognition of external assessment of country core capacities as a best practice.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Tobacco control</h2>\n<p>\n<span>In a move to further strengthen global tobacco control efforts, delegates decided to invite the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control’s (WHO FCTC) Conference of the Parties (COP) to provide information on outcomes of this biennial event to future World Health Assembly meetings. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>They also invited the COP to consider requesting the Assembly to provide a report for information on relevant tobacco-related activities to future meetings of the COP. The seventh session of the COP is being held on 7-12 November 2016, in New Delhi, India.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The WHO FCTC is the first treaty negotiated under WHO’s auspices. To date, it comprises 180 Parties and is one of the most rapidly and widely embraced treaties in UN history. It was developed in response to the globalization of the tobacco epidemic and is an evidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates also decided to include a follow-up item on this issue at the Seventieth World Health Assembly.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Road traffic deaths and injuries </h2>\n<p>\n<span>To support countries’ efforts to reach the SDG target of reducing road traffic deaths and injuries by 50% by 2020, World Health Assembly delegates today adopted a resolution requesting Member States to accelerate implementation of the outcome document of the Second Global High-Level Conference on Road Safety 2011-2020 held in November 2015, (the Brasilia Declaration on Road Safety).</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Road traffic crashes kill more than 1.2 million people annually and injure up to 50 million.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The resolution calls for national strategies and plans to address the needs of the most vulnerable people on the roads, including children, youth, older people and people with disabilities. It urges countries to rethink transport policies and to adopt more sustainable modes of transport, like walking, cycling and public transport.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>It requests the WHO secretariat to continue facilitating development of voluntary global performance targets on risk factors and service delivery mechanisms. It also asks WHO to help countries implement policies and practices, including on trauma care and rehabilitation; and facilitate preparations for the Fourth United Nations Global Road Safety Week in May 2017.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Nutrition </h2>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates adopted 2 resolutions on nutrition. The first, drawn up in response to the recently launched UN Decade of Action on Nutrition from 2016 to 2025, urges countries to make concrete policy and financial commitments to improve people’s diets, and report back regularly on those policies and investments. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>It calls on UN bodies to guide and implement national nutrition programmes and support monitoring and reporting mechanisms. It specifically requests that WHO and FAO work together to help countries develop, strengthen and implement their plans and maintain an open access database of commitments for public accountability.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The second welcomed WHO guidance on ending the inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children. The guidance clarifies that, in order to protect, promote and support breastfeeding, the marketing of “follow-up formula” and “growing-up milks”—targeted for consumption by babies aged 6 months to 3 years—should be regulated in just the same manner as infant formula for 0 to 6-month-olds is. This recommendation is in line with the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1981. Milk that is marketed as a general family food is not covered by the guidance, since it is not marketed specifically for feeding of infants and young children.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In light of the poor nutritional quality of some food and beverages marketed to infants and young children, the WHO guidance also indicates that foods for infants and young children should be promoted only if they meet standards for composition, safety, quality and nutrient levels and are in-line with national dietary guidelines.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The guidance also lays out key principles of how health professionals should interact with companies that market complementary foods. It recommends that health professionals do not accept gifts or free samples from these companies. They should not distribute samples, coupons, or products to families nor allow the companies to provide education or market foods through their health facilities. The guidance also recommends that companies do not sponsor meetings of health professionals.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The resolution urges countries, health professionals, the food industry, and the media to implement the guidance. In the resolution, countries also requested support from WHO to implement the guidance and monitor and evaluate its impact on infant and young child nutrition. They asked WHO to work with other international organizations on promoting national implementation of the guidance, and to report back to the Assembly in 2018 and 2020.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The World Health Assembly has adopted 3 global health sector strategies on: HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for the period 2016-2021. The integrated strategies highlight the critical role of Universal Health Coverage. Their targets are aligned with those laid out in the Sustainable Development Goals. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The strategies outline actions to be taken by countries and by the WHO secretariat. Each aims to accelerate and intensify the health sector response to further progress towards ending all 3 epidemics.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The HIV strategy aims to further accelerate the expansion of access to antiretroviral therapy to all people living with HIV as well as the further scale-up of prevention and testing to reach interim targets: since 2000, it has been estimated that as many as 7.8 million HIV-related deaths and 30 million new HIV infections have been averted. By 2020 the strategy aims to reduce global HIV-related deaths to below 500 000, to reduce new HIV infections to below 500 000 and to ensure zero new infections among infants. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The hepatitis strategy – the first of its kind - introduces the first-ever global targets for viral hepatitis. These include a 30% reduction in new cases of hepatitis B and C by 2020 and a 10% reduction in mortality. Key approaches will be to expand vaccination programmes for hepatitis A,B, and E; focus on preventing mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B; improve injection, blood and surgical safety; “harm reduction” for people who inject drugs; and increase access to treatment for hepatitis B and C. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The STI strategy specifically emphasizes the need to scale up prevention, screening and surveillance, in particular for adolescents and other at-risk populations, as well as the need to control the spread and impact of drug resistance. Although diagnostic tests for STIs are widely used in high-income countries, in low- and middle-income countries, diagnostic tests are largely unavailable. Resistance of STIs – in particular gonorrhoea – to antibiotics has increased rapidly in recent years and has reduced treatment options. More than 1 million sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are acquired every day worldwide. Each year, there are an estimated 357 million new infections with 1 of 4 STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Mycetoma</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The Health Assembly adopted a resolution on mycetoma. Mycetoma is a chronic, progressively destructive inflammatory disease of the skin, subcutaneous and connective tissue, muscle and bone. It usually affects the foot but also can also affect other parts of the body.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Mycetoma appears to mainly affect poor agricultural labourers and herdsmen. Due to its slow progression and painless nature, many patients come forward for treatment at an advanced stage of the disease when amputation is the only available treatment.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The global burden of mycetoma cannot be determined accurately due to lack of data. However, a 2013 systematic review of available data reported almost 9000 cases in 50 countries around the world. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The new resolution will help raise awareness of the disease. A wider recognition of the burden of mycetoma is expected to boost the development of control strategies and tools suitable for implementation in poor and remote areas where many of the cases occur.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Access to medicines and vaccines</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates agreed a range of measures aimed at addressing the global shortage of medicines and vaccines, especially for children.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates agreed to develop ways to forecast, avert and reduce shortages. These include notification systems, better ways of monitoring supply and demand, improving financial management of procurement systems to prevent funding shortfalls, and improving affordability through price negotiations and voluntary or compulsory licensing of high-priced medicines.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Access to medicines and vaccines is one of the cornerstones of universal health coverage, and is critical to the achievement of the health-related SDGs. Stock-outs and shortages have been increasing in severity in recent years in most parts of the world, including of antibiotics, anaesthetics, chemotherapy drugs and other essential medicines. Benzathine penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat congenital syphilis and rheumatic heart disease, has been in chronic short supply for several years.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The products most susceptible to shortages are those that are off-patent, difficult to formulate, have a short shelf-life, or are made by a small number of manufacturers. Low-volume markets, poor visibility of demand, and overly aggressive price reduction in procurement also contribute to shortages.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Research and development</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates at the World Health Assembly agreed today to accelerate the development of the WHO Global Observatory on Health Research and Development in order to identify gaps in R&amp;D, especially for diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries and attract little investment.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The observatory is a database of research and development projects. It is a key feature of WHO’s strategic R&amp;D workplan, endorsed by the Assembly in 2013, to help achieve the development and delivery of health products for which market mechanisms fail to provide incentives. A demonstration version of the observatory was made available at the beginning of 2016, integrating available information on funding for health R&amp;D, health products in the pipeline, clinical trials and research publications. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The workplan also includes 6 demonstration projects aimed at developing products. These include an initiative on R&amp;D for visceral leishmaniasis; development of a vaccine against schistosomiasis; a single-dose cure for malaria; development of affordable biomarkers as diagnostics; open-source drug development for diseases of poverty and a multiplexed point-of-care test for acute febrile illness. Funding is urgently needed to develop both the observatory and the demonstration projects. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The delegates urged WHO's Member States to increase funding for the observatory, and to strengthen their own national R&amp;D observatories. They also requested WHO to expedite the development of the observatory, promote and advocate for sustainable financing for it, and to establish an expert advisory committee to identify R&amp;D priorities based on analysis provided by the observatory and other sources.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Integrated health services</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The Health Assembly today adopted the WHO Framework on Integrated, People-Centred Health Services, which calls for a fundamental shift in the way health services are funded, managed and delivered.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Longer lifespans and the growing burden of long-term chronic conditions requiring complex interventions over many years are putting increasing pressure on health systems globally. Unless they are transformed, health systems will become increasingly fragmented, inefficient and unsustainable.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Integrated people-centred care means putting people and communities, not diseases, at the centre of health systems, and empowering people to take charge of their own health rather than being passive recipients of services. Evidence shows that health systems oriented around the needs of people and communities become more effective, cost less, improve health literacy and patient engagement, and are better prepared to respond to health crises.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates requested WHO to develop indicators to track progress toward integrated people-centred health services.</span></p>",

These include an initiative on R&D for visceral leishmaniasis; development of a vaccine against schistosomiasis; a single-dose cure for malaria; development of affordable biomarkers as diagnostics; open-source drug development for diseases of poverty and a multiplexed point-of-care test for acute febrile illness. Funding is urgently needed to develop both the observatory and the demonstration projects.",
          "The delegates urged WHO's Member States to increase funding for the observatory, and to strengthen their own national R&D observatories. They also requested WHO to expedite the development of the observatory, promote and advocate for sustainable financing for it, and to establish an expert advisory committee to identify R&D priorities based on analysis provided by the observatory and other sources."

Every year, 4.3 million deaths occur from exposure to indoor air pollution and 3.7 million deaths are attributable to outdoor air pollution. The road map outlines actions to be taken between 2016 and 2019, and is organized into 4 categories.",
    "content_html": "<div> <span>Delegates at the World Health Assembly have agreed resolutions and decisions on air pollution, chemicals, the health workforce, childhood obesity, violence, noncommunicable diseases, and the election of the next Director-General. </span></div>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Air pollution</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates welcomed a new road map for responding to the adverse health effects of air pollution. Every year, 4.3 million deaths occur from exposure to indoor air pollution and 3.7 million deaths are attributable to outdoor air pollution. The road map outlines actions to be taken between 2016 and 2019, and is organized into 4 categories. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>It sets out to expand the knowledge base, by building and disseminating global evidence and knowledge of the impacts of air pollution on health and the effectiveness of interventions and policies to address it. The road map also aims to enhance systems to monitor and report on health trends and progress towards the air pollution-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. It focuses on leveraging health sector leadership and coordinated action at all levels – local, national, regional and global – to raise awareness of air pollution. Lastly, the road map will enhance the health sector’s capacity to address the adverse health effects from air pollution through training, guidelines and national action plans.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Chemicals</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The Health Assembly also approved a resolution on the health sector’s role in the sound management of chemicals. Chemicals contribute significantly to the global economy, living standards and health, but poor management also contributes significantly to the global burden of disease and death, particularly in developing countries. Worldwide, 1.3 million lives are lost every year due to exposures to selected chemicals, such as lead and pesticides. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates reconfirmed their commitment to ensuring chemicals are used and produced in ways that minimize significant adverse effects on human health and the environment by 2020. The resolution urges Member States to strengthen international cooperation, through transferring expertise, technologies and scientific data, as well as exchanging good practices to manage chemicals and waste.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The resolution asks the WHO Secretariat to develop and present to the Seventieth World Health Assembly a road map outlining concrete actions to enhance the health sector engagement towards meeting the 2020 goal and associated targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It also requests the Secretariat to develop a report on the impacts of waste on health and actions the health sector could take to protect it. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Health workforce</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates agreed today to adopt the \"<em>Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030</em>\", which aims to accelerate progress towards universal health coverage and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by ensuring equitable access to health workers in every country. Today’s resolution calls on countries to take steps to strengthen their health workforces, including actively forecasting gaps between need for and supply of health workers, collecting and reporting better data, and ensuring adequate funding for the health workforce.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Population growth, ageing societies, and changing disease patterns are expected to drive greater demand for well-trained health workers in the next 15 years. The global economy is projected to create around 40 million new health sector jobs by 2030, mostly in middle- and high-income countries. But despite that anticipated growth, there will be a projected shortage of 18 million health workers needed to achieve the SDGs in low- and lower-middle-income countries, fuelled in part by labour mobility, both within and between nations. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Ending Childhood Obesity</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates considered the report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity which sets out the approaches and combinations of interventions that are likely to be most effective in tackling childhood and adolescent obesity in different contexts around the world. In 2014, an estimated 41 million children under 5 years of age were affected by overweight or obesity, 48% of which lived in Asia and 25% in Africa. Undernutrition in early childhood places children at an especially high risk of developing obesity later in life when food and physical activity patterns change.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Member States welcomed the 6 recommendations detailed in the Commission’s report. These include strategies to tackle environmental norms that foster obesity, reduce the risk of obesity through the life-course and treat children who are already obese to improve their current and future health. The Health Assembly calls on the WHO Secretariat to develop an implementation plan to guide further action, in consultation with Member States, and invited stakeholders to work towards implementation of the actions. The Assembly also recommended Member States develop national responses to end childhood and adolescent obesity, in-line with the report’s recommendations.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Global plan of action on violence</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates agreed a resolution on the WHO global plan of action on violence. Non-fatal acts of violence take a particular toll on women and children. 1-in-4 children has been physically abused; 1-in-5 girls has been sexually abused; and 1-in-3 women has experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence at some point in her lifetime. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The plan is designed to help countries strengthen action to address interpersonal violence, in particular violence against women and girls, and children. The resolution encourages countries to strengthen the role of the health system in responding to violence. It invites partners to take steps to accomplish the plan's 4 strategic directions: strengthen health system leadership and governance; enhance health service delivery and the capacity of health workers and providers to respond to the needs of people who have experienced violence; boost programming to prevent interpersonal violence; and improve information and evidence.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases </h2>\n<p>\n<span>Member States reviewed the progress made by countries in addressing noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including heart and lung diseases, cancers, and diabetes, since the first UN High-level Meeting on NCDs in 2011. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>There has been a significant increase in the number of countries with a national multisectoral NCD action plan (from 18% of countries in 2010 to 37% in 2015) and a NCD department within national ministries of health (from 53% to 66% in the same timeframe). Globally, the probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 from a major NCD has dropped slightly, as well as alcohol per capita consumption, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure. However, significant global increases are witnessed in the prevalence of obesity and overweight. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In preparation for the third UN High-level Meeting on NCDs in 2018, Member States requested WHO update a set of very cost-effective and affordable NCD interventions that can be implemented by all Member States, as well as to develop an approach to register and publish contributions of the private sector to achieving global NCD targets.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Director-General election </h2>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates have agreed 3 proposals from the Director-General to increase transparency around the upcoming election of her successor.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>They approved the Director-General’s proposal to acknowledge the nomination of prospective candidates provided the nominating country agrees. The deadline for submissions is 22 September 2016 and nominations are not formally opened until the following day. However, the DG can now publicly acknowledge the names of prospective candidates submitted before then, provided the nominating country is in agreement.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>They agreed to webcast the Candidates’ Forum expected to be held in November 2016. The Forum is an interactive dialogue where each candidate gives a 30-minute presentation of their vision and plans for WHO, followed by a questions and answer session with Member State representatives. Participation in the live event is limited to Member States, but the event will now be webcast live on the WHO website in all official languages. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Assembly also decided that candidates nominated by the Executive Board to the World Health Assembly will have the opportunity to address the Health Assembly before voting takes place. Delegates further decided that these addresses be webcast on the WHO website in all official WHO languages.</span></p>",

Her address was followed by a technical briefing that underscored the need for multisectoral action in order to achieve the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and agreement on a new resolution on meeting those goals.</p><h3>Climate change and health<br/></h3></div><p>Ms Figueres thanked Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General, for first insisting on the need to reach an agreement on climate change because of its effects on health.</p><p>Congratulating the world’s heads of states for reaching last year’s Paris Agreement on climate change, she called on governments to act on the agreement. She encouraged health ministers to take the lead, noting that one of the most urgent aspects of climate change is its impact on health. Nevertheless, only 15% of the countries that have drawn up plans for climate change refer to health in those plans.</p><p>Ms Figueres also stressed the importance of taking action to prevent health problems, noting that the great majority of health interventions currently focus on treatment. </p><p>She ended with a warning that if the world does not fundamentally change its approach to energy within the next 5 years, there is a risk that damage to the atmosphere will be irrevocable and continue to impact health for decades. </p><h3>Sustainable Development Goals</h3><p>Delegates agreed to strengthen national health systems to progress towards universal health coverage, as a key way of achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals. </p><p>The resolution highlights the need to strengthen a range of essential public health functions. This will involve investing adequate, sustainable resources in health-system strengthening; enhancing the education, recruitment and retention of health workers; tackling social, environmental and economic determinants of health; and improving the monitoring and analysis of health outcomes. </p><p>In September last year the United Nations General Assembly adopted the SDGs, an ambitious set of 17 goals with 169 targets for achieving a fairer, safer and healthier world by 2030. </p><p>The health-related targets are concentrated in, but not limited to, Goal 3: “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.” They include a target of achieving universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. </p><p>Universal health coverage (UHC), supported by resilient national health systems based on strong primary care, is widely regarded as the best defence countries can have against outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Ebola and Zika, as well the burgeoning burden and costs of noncommunicable diseases such as cancer and diabetes. With its focus on equity, it represents an essential strategy towards the fulfilment of one of the core principles of the SDGs: leaving no one behind. </p> ",

In addition, any further spread of type 2 cVDPVs is a public health emergency following the globally synchronized withdrawal of type 2 OPV completed 1st May 2016.</p></div><p><span>The following IHR States Parties submitted an update on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 12th February 2016: Afghanistan, Guinea, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Nigeria and Pakistan.</span>\n</p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Wild polio</h2><p><span>The Committee noted that since the declaration that the international spread of polio constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in May 2014, strong progress has been made by countries toward interruption of wild poliovirus transmission and implementation of Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director­ General. There has been a decline in the occurrence of international spread of wild poliovirus, with no international spread in 2015 or thus far in 2016 except between Afghanistan and Pakistan.<br/><br/>The Committee was encouraged by the intensified efforts and progress toward interruption of poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan despite challenging circumstances, and the renewed emphasis on cooperation along the long international border between the two countries. The committee particularly applauded the strong progress being made in Pakistan, with consistent evidence of reduced transmission in 2016, and welcomed Pakistan’s determination to complete eradication this year.</span>\n</p><p><span>The Committee noted however that the international spread of wild poliovirus has continued, with two new reports of exportations from Pakistan into Afghanistan, one of which had occurred in October 2015 but only recognized recently following a new analysis of genetic data, and the second more recently in February 2016. These cases occurred in Nangarhar and Kunar Provinces, in the eastern region, adjoining the Pakistan border. While there has been no new exportation from Afghanistan to Pakistan, ongoing transmission particularly in inaccessible parts of the Eastern Region of Afghanistan close to the international border presents an ongoing risk. The new virus in Kunar was closely related to Pakistan viruses circulating at least since June 2014 in the Khyber-Peshawar block. The new Afghan virus in Nangarhar was closely related to Pakistan viruses also circulating during 2015 in the Khyber-Peshawar block.<br/><br/>The committee expressed its appreciation of the ongoing scientific cooperation between the Polio Regional Reference Laboratory in Islamabad and the Global Polio Specialized Laboratory in Atlanta to monitor the genetic characteristics and poliovirus sub-types in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and noted that the powerful tools employed to do this would be of great benefit in the polio endgame. This closer tracking of WPV1 means that chains of transmission across the border are more likely to be detected than in the past.</span>\n</p><p><span>The committee reaffirmed that under the IHR, spread of poliovirus between two Member States constitutes international spread. The Committee acknowledged that cross border collaboration efforts have continued to be strengthened. Whilst border vaccination between these two countries is limited to children under ten years of age, efforts are being made to vaccinate departing travellers of all age groups from airports when leaving this epidemiological block formed by the 2 countries. The committee noted that all countries, and particularly those with embassies in Afghanistan and Pakistan, should facilitate implementation of Temporary Recommendations through adopting procedures that include proof of polio vaccination as part of visa application processes for travellers departing from Afghanistan or Pakistan, and urged the WHO secretariat to further assist in developing this process.</span>\n</p><p><span>The committee was particularly concerned by the deteriorating security in parts of Afghanistan leading to more children becoming inaccessible, heightening anxiety about completion of eradication in 2016, thereby delaying the global polio endgame. The committee also noted that globally there are still significant vulnerable areas and populations that are inadequately immunized due to conflict, insecurity and poor coverage associated with weak immunization programmes. Such vulnerable areas include countries in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, central Africa and parts of Europe. <br/><br/>The hard­ earned gains of the GPEI can be quickly lost if there is re­introduction of poliovirus in settings of disrupted health systems and complex humanitarian emergencies. The large population movements across the Middle East and from Afghanistan and Pakistan create a heightened risk of international spread of polio. There is a risk of missing polio vaccination among refugee and mobile populations, adding to missed and under vaccinated populations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. An estimated 3 to 4 million people have been displaced to Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey and are at the centre of a mass migration across Europe.</span>\n</p><p><span>The committee acknowledged receipt of final reports as requested from Israel, South Sudan and Iraq, and agreed that these three countries are no longer subject to the Temporary Recommendations. However, noting some gaps in surveillance in South Sudan and Iraq, the committee urged the GPEI and partner organizations to continue to provide support to these countries, in addition to Ethiopia and Syria which sent their final reports in February. </span>\n</p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Vaccine derived poliovirus</h2><p><span>The current circulating vaccine­derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks across four WHO regions illustrate serious gaps in routine immunization programs, leading to significant pockets of vulnerability to polio outbreaks. In 2015, six outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus occurred – three cVDPV type 1 outbreaks (Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar and Ukraine) and three cVDPV type 2 outbreaks (Guinea, Myanmar and Nigeria). In 2016, transmission is continuing in Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Nigeria and possibly Guinea.</span>\n</p><p><span>In Guinea, the outbreak appears to be confined to one region, Kankan, but there appears to be a medium to high risk of continuation beyond OPV2 withdrawal. The possibility of missing transmission cannot be ruled out due to gaps in surveillance that were identified during the outbreak response assessment. Furthermore, surveillance indicators in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone are below required standards and urgent efforts are needed to enhance surveillance in these countries. </span>\n</p><p><span>The committee noted that in Lao People’s Democratic Republic there was ongoing circulation of vaccine derived polioviruses, particularly in hard to reach populations, underlining the importance of communication to counteract vaccine hesitancy. The lessons learnt from the ongoing efforts in the cVDPV outbreak should be used to revise the existing communication and social mobilization plan for routine immunization so as to address the vaccine hesitancy in these communities, including the use of local vernacular mobilization materials, intensified routine immunization campaigns in all identified high-risk and hard-to-reach areas to improve the vaccination coverage, revision of microplanning for routine vaccination to identify the high risk communities in every catchment area, and assessing the vaccination coverage in these communities during periodic coverage surveys. </span>\n</p><p><span>The committee was very concerned that in Nigeria, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been detected in an environmental sample in March 2016 in Maiduguri, Borno State, north-east Nigeria. Genetic sequencing of the isolated strain indicates it is most closely linked genetically to a cVDPV2 strain from Borno in November 2013 and last detected in May 2014, indicating the strain has been circulating without detection for almost two years, but different to the strain identified in 2015 in the Federal Capital Territory and Kaduna. The committee noted that a very robust outbreak response is under way by the Government of Nigeria, but was concerned that the risk of international spread of this strain of cVDPV2 from Nigeria was high. Surveillance and immunization activities need to be strengthened in neighbouring countries in the Lake Chad region. </span>\n</p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Conclusion</h2><p><span>The Committee unanimously agreed that the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of the Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</span>\n</p><ul><li>The continued international spread of wild poliovirus during 2015 and 2016 involving Pakistan and Afghanistan.</li><li>The current special and extraordinary context of being closer to polio eradication than ever before in history.</li><li>The risk and consequent costs of failure to eradicate globally one of the world’s most serious vaccine preventable diseases. Even though globally transmission has fallen and therefore the likelihood of international spread has also fallen, the consequences and impact of international spread should it occur become more serious, and this possibility is greater if global complacency sets in.</li><li>The continued necessity of a coordinated international response to improve immunization and surveillance for wild poliovirus, stop its international spread and reduce the risk of new spread.</li><li>The serious consequences of further international spread for the increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.

          "The Committee noted that since the declaration that the international spread of polio constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in May 2014, strong progress has been made by countries toward interruption of wild poliovirus transmission and implementation of Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director­ General. There has been a decline in the occurrence of international spread of wild poliovirus, with no international spread in 2015 or thus far in 2016 except between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Committee was encouraged by the intensified efforts and progress toward interruption of poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan despite challenging circumstances, and the renewed emphasis on cooperation along the long international border between the two countries. The committee particularly applauded the strong progress being made in Pakistan, with consistent evidence of reduced transmission in 2016, and welcomed Pakistan’s determination to complete eradication this year.",
          "The Committee noted however that the international spread of wild poliovirus has continued, with two new reports of exportations from Pakistan into Afghanistan, one of which had occurred in October 2015 but only recognized recently following a new analysis of genetic data, and the second more recently in February 2016. These cases occurred in Nangarhar and Kunar Provinces, in the eastern region, adjoining the Pakistan border. While there has been no new exportation from Afghanistan to Pakistan, ongoing transmission particularly in inaccessible parts of the Eastern Region of Afghanistan close to the international border presents an ongoing risk. The new virus in Kunar was closely related to Pakistan viruses circulating at least since June 2014 in the Khyber-Peshawar block. The new Afghan virus in Nangarhar was closely related to Pakistan viruses also circulating during 2015 in the Khyber-Peshawar block. The committee expressed its appreciation of the ongoing scientific cooperation between the Polio Regional Reference Laboratory in Islamabad and the Global Polio Specialized Laboratory in Atlanta to monitor the genetic characteristics and poliovirus sub-types in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and noted that the powerful tools employed to do this would be of great benefit in the polio endgame. This closer tracking of WPV1 means that chains of transmission across the border are more likely to be detected than in the past.",
          "The committee reaffirmed that under the IHR, spread of poliovirus between two Member States constitutes international spread. The Committee acknowledged that cross border collaboration efforts have continued to be strengthened. Whilst border vaccination between these two countries is limited to children under ten years of age, efforts are being made to vaccinate departing travellers of all age groups from airports when leaving this epidemiological block formed by the 2 countries. The committee noted that all countries, and particularly those with embassies in Afghanistan and Pakistan, should facilitate implementation of Temporary Recommendations through adopting procedures that include proof of polio vaccination as part of visa application processes for travellers departing from Afghanistan or Pakistan, and urged the WHO secretariat to further assist in developing this process.",
          "The committee was particularly concerned by the deteriorating security in parts of Afghanistan leading to more children becoming inaccessible, heightening anxiety about completion of eradication in 2016, thereby delaying the global polio endgame. The committee also noted that globally there are still significant vulnerable areas and populations that are inadequately immunized due to conflict, insecurity and poor coverage associated with weak immunization programmes. Such vulnerable areas include countries in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, central Africa and parts of Europe. The hard­ earned gains of the GPEI can be quickly lost if there is re­introduction of poliovirus in settings of disrupted health systems and complex humanitarian emergencies. The large population movements across the Middle East and from Afghanistan and Pakistan create a heightened risk of international spread of polio. There is a risk of missing polio vaccination among refugee and mobile populations, adding to missed and under vaccinated populations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. An estimated 3 to 4 million people have been displaced to Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey and are at the centre of a mass migration across Europe.",
          "The committee acknowledged receipt of final reports as requested from Israel, South Sudan and Iraq, and agreed that these three countries are no longer subject to the Temporary Recommendations. However, noting some gaps in surveillance in South Sudan and Iraq, the committee urged the GPEI and partner organizations to continue to provide support to these countries, in addition to Ethiopia and Syria which sent their final reports in February."

          "The current circulating vaccine­derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks across four WHO regions illustrate serious gaps in routine immunization programs, leading to significant pockets of vulnerability to polio outbreaks. In 2015, six outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus occurred – three cVDPV type 1 outbreaks (Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar and Ukraine) and three cVDPV type 2 outbreaks (Guinea, Myanmar and Nigeria). In 2016, transmission is continuing in Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Nigeria and possibly Guinea.",
          "In Guinea, the outbreak appears to be confined to one region, Kankan, but there appears to be a medium to high risk of continuation beyond OPV2 withdrawal. The possibility of missing transmission cannot be ruled out due to gaps in surveillance that were identified during the outbreak response assessment. Furthermore, surveillance indicators in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone are below required standards and urgent efforts are needed to enhance surveillance in these countries.",
          "The committee noted that in Lao People’s Democratic Republic there was ongoing circulation of vaccine derived polioviruses, particularly in hard to reach populations, underlining the importance of communication to counteract vaccine hesitancy. The lessons learnt from the ongoing efforts in the cVDPV outbreak should be used to revise the existing communication and social mobilization plan for routine immunization so as to address the vaccine hesitancy in these communities, including the use of local vernacular mobilization materials, intensified routine immunization campaigns in all identified high-risk and hard-to-reach areas to improve the vaccination coverage, revision of microplanning for routine vaccination to identify the high risk communities in every catchment area, and assessing the vaccination coverage in these communities during periodic coverage surveys.",
          "The committee was very concerned that in Nigeria, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been detected in an environmental sample in March 2016 in Maiduguri, Borno State, north-east Nigeria. Genetic sequencing of the isolated strain indicates it is most closely linked genetically to a cVDPV2 strain from Borno in November 2013 and last detected in May 2014, indicating the strain has been circulating without detection for almost two years, but different to the strain identified in 2015 in the Federal Capital Territory and Kaduna. The committee noted that a very robust outbreak response is under way by the Government of Nigeria, but was concerned that the risk of international spread of this strain of cVDPV2 from Nigeria was high. Surveillance and immunization activities need to be strengthened in neighbouring countries in the Lake Chad region."

Recognizing that cVDPV illustrates serious gaps in routine immunization programs in otherwise polio free countries, the Committee recommended that the international partners in routine immunization, for example Gavi, should urgently assist affected countries to improve the national immunization program.",

          "The Committee recognised that the communication message explaining why a PHEIC is being maintained should be carefully prepared. On the one hand the world is applauding the successful switch from tOPV to bOPV and the reduction of new cases of wild poliovirus, while on the other hand a PHEIC is being maintained to ensure that all possible measures are brought to bear to support these final phases of polio eradication. This apparent paradox needs careful explanation.",
          "Based on the advice concerning wild poliovirus and cVDPV, and the reports made by Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Guinea, the Director­ General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 20 May 2016 determined that the events relating to poliovirus continue to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to wild poliovirus and cVDPV. The Director­General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for ‘States currently exporting wild polioviruses or cVDPV’, for ‘States infected with wild poliovirus or cVDPV but not currently exporting’ and for ‘States no longer infected by wild poliovirus, but which remain vulnerable to international spread, and states that are vulnerable to the emergence and circulation of VDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations as revised by the Committee under the IHR to reduce the international spread of poliovirus, effective 20 May 2016.",

Both countries have maintained permanent vaccination teams at the main border crossings for many years. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travellers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.",

Not only is it less expensive than current regimens, but it is also expected to improve outcomes and potentially decrease deaths due to better adherence to treatment and reduced loss to follow-up.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The conventional treatment regimens, which take 18–24 months to complete, yield low cure rates: just 50% on average globally. This is largely because patients find it very hard to keep taking second-line drugs, which can be quite toxic, for prolonged periods of time. They therefore often interrupt treatment or are lost to follow-up in health services. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The shorter regimen is recommended for patients diagnosed with uncomplicated MDR-TB, for example those individuals whose MDR-TB is not resistant to the most important drugs used to treat MDR-TB (fluoroquinolones and injectables), known as “second-line drugs”. It is also recommended for individuals who have not yet been treated with second line drugs. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO’s recommendations on the shorter regimens are based on initial programmatic studies involving 1200 patients with uncomplicated MDR-TB in 10 countries .

The novel diagnostic test – called MTBDRsl – is a DNA-based test that identifies genetic mutations in MDR-TB strains, making them resistant to fluoroquinolones and injectable second-line TB drugs. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>This test yields results in just 24-48 hours, down from the 3 months or longer currently required. The much faster turnaround time means that MDR-TB patients with additional resistance are not only diagnosed more quickly, but can quickly be placed on appropriate second-line regimens. WHO reports that fewer than 20% of the estimated 480 000 MDR-TB patients globally are currently being properly treated. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The MTBDRsl test is also a critical prerequisite for identifying MDR-TB patients who are eligible for the newly recommended shorter regimen, while avoiding placing patients who have resistance to second-line drugs on this regimen (which could fuel the development of extensively drug-resistant TB or XDR-TB). </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“We hope that the faster diagnosis and shorter treatment will accelerate the much-needed global MDR-TB response,” said Dr Karin Weyer, Coordinator of Laboratories, Diagnostics and Drug Resistance, WHO Global TB Programme. “Anticipated cost-savings from the roll out of this regimen could be re-invested in MDR-TB services to enable more patients to be tested and retained on treatment.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO is working closely with technical and funding partners to ensure adequate resources and support for the uptake of the rapid test and shorter, cheaper regimen in countries.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Quick facts </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resistance to standard TB drugs exists in most countries worldwide.

This is up from 103 countries in 2011, when the last WHO analysis was done. Only 39 countries have laws that enact all provisions of the Code, however, a slight increase from 37 in 2011.</span>\n</p><p><span>WHO and UNICEF recommend that babies are fed nothing but breast milk for their first 6 months, after which they should continue breastfeeding – as well as eating other safe and nutritionally adequate foods – until 2 years of age or beyond. In that context, WHO Member States have committed to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life to at least 50% by 2025 as one of a set of global nutrition targets</span>\n</p><p><span>The Code calls on countries to protect breastfeeding by stopping the inappropriate marketing of breast-milk substitutes (including infant formula), feeding bottles and teats. It also aims to and ensure breast-milk substitutes are used safely when they are necessary. It bans all forms of promotion of substitutes, including advertising, gifts to health workers and distribution of free samples. In addition, labels cannot make nutritional and health claims or include images that idealize infant formula. They must include clear instructions on how to use the product and carry messages about the superiority of breastfeeding over formula and the risks of not breastfeeding.</span>\n</p><p><span>“It is encouraging to see more countries pass laws to protect and promote breastfeeding, but there are still far too many places where mothers are inundated with incorrect and biased information through advertising and unsubstantiated health claims. This can distort parents’ perceptions and undermine their confidence in breastfeeding, with the result that far too many children miss out on its many benefits,” says Dr Francesco Branca, Director of WHO’s Department of Nutrition for Health and Development.</span>\n</p><div><img alt=\"Breastfeeding after UNICEF measles vaccination, Kot Danda, Nepal.\" src=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/imported/breastfeeding-2106-630x420-jpg.jpg?sfvrsn=ee1d7eaf_4\" width=\"630\"/><div class=\"image_credit\" style=\"width:630px;\">UNICEF/Page</div></div><p><span>The breast-milk substitute business is a big one, with annual sales amounting to almost US$ 45 billion worldwide. This is projected to rise by over 55% to US$ 70 billion by 2019.</span>\n</p><p><span>“The breast-milk substitutes industry is strong and growing, and so the battle to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding around the world is an uphill one – but it is one that is worth the effort,” says UNICEF Chief of Nutrition Werner Schultink. “Mothers deserve a chance to get the correct information: that they have readily available the means to protect the health and well-being of their children. Clever marketing should not be allowed to fudge the truth that there is no equal substitute for a mother’s own milk.”</span>\n</p><p><span>Overall, richer countries lag behind poorer ones. The proportion of countries with comprehensive legislation in line with the Code is highest in the WHO South-East Asia Region (36%, or 4 out of 11 countries), followed by the WHO African Region (30%, or 14 out of 47 countries) and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (29%, or 6 out of 21 countries). The WHO Region of the Americas (23%, or 8 out of 35 countries); Western Pacific Region (15%, or 4 out of 27 countries); and European Region (6%, or 3 out of 53 countries) have lower proportions of countries with comprehensive legislation.</span>\n</p><p><span>Among the countries that have any laws on marketing of breast-milk substitutes, globally:</span>\n</p><ul><li>Just over half sufficiently prohibit advertising and promotion.</li><li>Fewer than half prohibit the provision to health facilities of free or low-cost supplies of breast-milk substitutes.</li><li>Just over half prohibit gifts to health workers or members of their families.</li><li>The scope of products to which legislation applies remains limited. Many countries’ laws cover infant formula and ‘follow-up formula’, but only one third explicitly cover products intended for children aged 1 year and up.</li><li>Fewer than half of countries ban nutrition and health claims on designated products.</li></ul><p><span>IBFAN, with its International Code Documentation Centre (ICDC) taking the lead, has closely cooperated with WHO and UNICEF to prepare this report. The results are in line with the findings reported in ICDC’s own <em>\"State of the Code 2016\"</em>.</span>\n</p><p><span>“IBFAN hopes that the report will lead more countries to improve and enforce existing legislation so that breastfeeding will have a better chance and save more lives,” says Annelies Allain, Director of IBFAN’s ICDC. “Legislation needs to keep pace with new marketing strategies and this report will help policy makers to do so.”</span>\n</p><p><span>The report, <em>\"Marketing of breast-milk substitutes: National implementation of the International Code – Status report 2016\"</em>, includes tables showing, country by country, which Code measures have and have not been enacted into law. It also includes case studies on countries that have strengthened their laws or monitoring systems for the Code in recent years.

Polio was eliminated in 1 country, tetanus in 3, and rubella in 1 geographical region. The challenge now is to make gains like this the norm.” </span></p><p><span>Immunization averts 2 to 3 million deaths annually; however, an additional 1.5 million deaths could be avoided if global vaccination coverage improves. Today, an estimated 18.7 million infants – nearly 1 in 5 children – worldwide are still missing routine immunizations for preventable diseases, such as diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus. </span></p><p><span>In 2012, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), a commitment to ensure that no one misses out on vital immunizations. Despite gains in vaccination coverage in some regions and countries the past year, global vaccination targets remain off track. </span></p><p><a href=\"/publications/i/item/global-vaccine-action-plan-2011-2020\">Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011 - 2020</a>\n</p><p><span>Only 1 out of 6 targets is on track — the introduction of new or underutilized vaccines in low- and middle-income countries. During the past 5 years, 86 low- and middle-income countries have made 128 introductions of the following vaccines: Hib-containing vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), rotavirus vaccine, human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), rubella and inactivated polio vaccine. The target is to introduce 1 or more new or underutilized vaccines in at least 90 low- and middle-income countries by 2015.</span></p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Game-changers in immunization</h2><p><span>Last year saw some major breakthroughs. </span></p><p><span>India joined Cambodia, Madagascar and Mauritania in eliminating maternal and neonatal tetanus.

Now, only two countries – Afghanistan and Pakistan – remain polio endemic. </span></p><p><span>The Region of the Americas became the first to eliminate rubella, a contagious viral disease that can cause multiple birth defects as well as fetal death when contracted by women during pregnancy.

    "content_html": "<p><strong>Depression and anxiety disorders cost the global economy US$1 trillion each year; countries and development partners to discuss way forward during World Bank-WHO events</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Every US$ 1 invested in scaling up treatment for depression and anxiety leads to a return of US$ 4 in better health and ability to work, according to a new WHO-led study which estimates, for the first time, both the health and economic benefits of investing in treatment of the most common forms of mental illness globally. The study, published today in “<strong>The Lancet Psychiatry</strong>”, provides a strong argument for greater investment in mental health services in countries of all income levels.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<span>“We know that treatment of depression and anxiety makes good sense for health and wellbeing; this new study confirms that it makes sound economic sense too,” said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO. “We must now find ways to make sure that access to mental health services becomes a reality for all men, women and children, wherever they live.”</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Depression and anxiety are increasing</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Common mental disorders are increasing worldwide. Between 1990 and 2013, the number of people suffering from depression and/or anxiety increased by nearly 50%, from 416 million to 615 million. Close to 10% of the world’s population is affected, and mental disorders account for 30% of the global non-fatal disease burden. Humanitarian emergencies and ongoing conflict add further to the need for scale-up of treatment options. WHO estimates that, during emergencies, as many as 1 in 5 people are affected by depression and anxiety. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Returns on investment in treatment far outweigh the costs </h2>\n<p>\n<span>The new study calculated treatment costs and health outcomes in 36 low-, middle- and high-income countries for the 15 years from 2016-2030. The estimated costs of scaling up treatment, primarily psychosocial counselling and antidepressant medication, amounted to US$ 147 billion. Yet the returns far outweigh the costs. A 5% improvement in labour force participation and productivity is valued at US$ 399 billion, and improved health adds another US$ 310 billion in returns. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>However, current investment in mental health services is far lower than what is needed. According to WHO’s “<em>Mental Health Atlas 2014</em>” survey, governments spend on average 3% of their health budgets on mental health, ranging from less than 1% in low-income countries to 5% in high-income countries. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Despite hundreds of millions of people around the world living with mental disorders, mental health has remained in the shadows,” said Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank Group. “This is not just a public health issue — it’s a development issue. We need to act now because the lost productivity is something the global economy simply cannot afford.”</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Finance and development actors meet to consider scale-up</h2>\n<p>\n<span>A series of events, being co-hosted by the World Bank and WHO on 13-14 April, as part of the World Bank Group-International Monetary Fund Spring Meetings in Washington DC, is bringing ministers of finance, development agencies, academic experts and practitioners together to discuss how to put mental health at the centre of the health and development agenda globally and in countries. The event aims to kick-start an increase in investments in mental health: investments by governments, development agencies and civil society. It also includes an Innovations Fair showcasing feasible, affordable and cost-effective ways to improve mental health care around the world. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>During the events, countries which have been successful in scaling up mental health care will present the challenges they faced and how they were overcome. Examples include: Brazil, which has developed a psychosocial care network; Ethiopia, which is rapidly scaling-up training and provision of mental health care across the country; and South Africa, where mental health care and treatment form an integral component of the country’s re-engineered primary health care system. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Mental health needs to be a global humanitarian and development priority — and a priority in every country,” said Arthur Kleinman, Professor of Medical Anthropology and Psychiatry at Harvard University and an expert on global mental health. “We need to provide treatment, now, to those who need it most, and in the communities where they live. Until we do, mental illness will continue to eclipse the potential of people and economies.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Scaling up mental health services will contribute to achievement of 1 of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals, endorsed at the United Nations General Assembly in 2015: by 2030, to reduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Event hashtag: #mentalhealthnow</span></p>\n<div> </div>",

According to WHO’s “ Mental Health Atlas 2014 ” survey, governments spend on average 3% of their health budgets on mental health, ranging from less than 1% in low-income countries to 5% in high-income countries.",
          "“Despite hundreds of millions of people around the world living with mental disorders, mental health has remained in the shadows,” said Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank Group. “This is not just a public health issue — it’s a development issue. We need to act now because the lost productivity is something the global economy simply cannot afford.”"

The event aims to kick-start an increase in investments in mental health: investments by governments, development agencies and civil society. It also includes an Innovations Fair showcasing feasible, affordable and cost-effective ways to improve mental health care around the world.",
          "During the events, countries which have been successful in scaling up mental health care will present the challenges they faced and how they were overcome. Examples include: Brazil, which has developed a psychosocial care network; Ethiopia, which is rapidly scaling-up training and provision of mental health care across the country; and South Africa, where mental health care and treatment form an integral component of the country’s re-engineered primary health care system.",
          "“Mental health needs to be a global humanitarian and development priority — and a priority in every country,” said Arthur Kleinman, Professor of Medical Anthropology and Psychiatry at Harvard University and an expert on global mental health. “We need to provide treatment, now, to those who need it most, and in the communities where they live. Until we do, mental illness will continue to eclipse the potential of people and economies.”",
          "Scaling up mental health services will contribute to achievement of 1 of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals, endorsed at the United Nations General Assembly in 2015: by 2030, to reduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.",

Factors driving this dramatic rise include overweight and obesity, WHO announced ahead of World Health Day.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<span>WHO is marking its annual World Health Day (7 April), which celebrates the Organization’s founding in 1948, by issuing a call for action on diabetes. In its first “Global report on diabetes”, WHO highlights the need to step up prevention and treatment of the disease. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Health-promoting environments reduce risk factors</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Measures needed include expanding health-promoting environments to reduce diabetes risk factors, like physical inactivity and unhealthy diets, and strengthening national capacities to help people with diabetes receive the treatment and care they need to manage their conditions.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“If we are to make any headway in halting the rise in diabetes, we need to rethink our daily lives: to eat healthily, be physically active, and avoid excessive weight gain,” says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. “Even in the poorest settings, governments must ensure that people are able to make these healthy choices and that health systems are able to diagnose and treat people with diabetes.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Diabetes is a chronic, progressive noncommunicable disease (NCD) characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (blood sugar). It occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough of the insulin hormone, which regulates blood sugar, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Key findings from WHO’s “Global report on diabetes”</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Among the key findings from the “Global report on diabetes” are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The number of people living with diabetes and its prevalence are growing in all regions of the world. In 2014, 422 million adults (or 8.5% of the population) had diabetes, compared with 108 million (4.7%) in 1980. </li>\n<li>The epidemic of diabetes has major health and socioeconomic impacts, especially in developing countries.</li>\n<li>In 2014, more than 1 in 3 adults aged over 18 years were overweight and more than one in 10 were obese.</li>\n<li>The complications of diabetes can lead to heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and lower limb amputation. For example, rates of lower limb amputation are 10 to 20 times higher for people with diabetes. </li>\n<li>Diabetes caused 1.5 million deaths in 2012. Higher-than-optimal blood glucose caused an additional 2.2 million deaths by increasing the risks of cardiovascular and other diseases.</li>\n<li>Many of these deaths (43%) occur prematurely, before the age of 70 years, and are largely preventable through adoption of policies to create supportive environments for healthy lifestyles and better detection and treatment of the disease. </li>\n<li>Good management includes use of a small set of generic medicines; interventions to promote healthy lifestyles; patient education to facilitate self-care; and regular screening for early detection and treatment of complications. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Global commitments to reduce diabetes</h2>\n<p>\n<span>“Many cases of diabetes can be prevented, and measures exist to detect and manage the condition, improving the odds that people with diabetes live long and healthy lives,” says Dr Oleg Chestnov, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for NCDs and Mental Health. “But change greatly depends on governments doing more, including by implementing global commitments to address diabetes and other NCDs.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>These include meeting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.4, which calls for reducing premature death from NCDs, including diabetes, by 30% by 2030. Governments have also committed to achieving 4 time-bound national commitments set out in the 2014 UN General Assembly “Outcome Document on Noncommunicable Diseases”, and attaining the 9 global targets laid out in the WHO “Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs”, which include halting the rise in diabetes and obesity. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Around 100 years after the insulin hormone was discovered, the “Global report on diabetes” shows that essential diabetes medicines and technologies, including insulin, needed for treatment are generally available in only 1 in 3 of the world’s poorest countries,” says Dr Etienne Krug, Director of WHO’s Department for the Management of NCDs, Disability, Violence and Injury Prevention. “Access to insulin is a matter of life or death for many people with diabetes. Improving access to insulin and NCD medicines in general should be a priority.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Global efforts are underway to make medicines, including for NCDs, more available and affordable. Commitments from world leaders, including the SDGs, the 2011 “UN Political Declaration on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases”, the 2014 UN General Assembly “Outcome Document on Noncommunicable Diseases”, and the work of the UN Secretary-General’s high-level panel on access to essential medicines are aimed at improving affordability and availability of essential drugs for people living with diabetes. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Note to editors</h2>\n<p>\n<span>There are three main forms of diabetes: type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes. The cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown and people living with it require daily insulin administration for survival. Type 2 accounts for the vast majority of people living with diabetes globally, and is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity. Once seen only in adults, type 2 diabetes is now increasingly occurring in children and young people. Gestational diabetes is a temporary condition that occurs in pregnancy and carries long-term risk of type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes is present when blood glucose values are above normal but still below those diagnostic of diabetes.</span></p>\n<div> </div>",

A further 1 billion people will be added by 2030, with 90% of the growth being in low- and middle-income countries.

    "content_html": "<div>\n<p>In advance of World TB Day, to be observed on 24 March, WHO is calling on countries and partners to \"Unite to End Tuberculosis\".</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<span>The call comes as we enter the era of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ending tuberculosis (TB) by 2030 is a target of the SDGs and the goal of the WHO End TB Strategy.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>That is an ambitious aim. While there has been significant progress in the fight against TB, with 43 million lives saved since 2000, the battle is only half-won: over 4 000 people lose their lives each day to this leading infectious disease. Many of the communities that are most burdened by tuberculosis are those that are poor, vulnerable and marginalized.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Greater collaboration needed</strong></h2>\n<p>\n<span>Ending TB will only be achieved with greater collaboration within and across governments, and with partners from civil society, communities, researchers, the private sector and development agencies. This means taking a whole-of-society and multidisciplinary approach, in the context of universal health coverage.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Momentum is growing at country and community levels – including in the 30 countries with the highest TB burden (over 85% of the global burden). A number of countries are strengthening the strategic agendas of their TB programmes, by adopting newer tools, extending access to care and linking with other parts of government to reduce the financial costs borne by patients. Other countries are partnering with researchers to speed development of diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines, and to improve delivery.</span></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h2><span><strong>Country progress on TB</strong></span></h2>\n<p>\n<span>For example, India which is home to more people ill with TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) than any other country, has committed to achieving universal access to TB care with its campaign for a TB-Free India<strong>. </strong>The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is expanding its capacity to test patients rapidly for drug-resistant TB and is initiating use of bedaquiline, a new, WHO-recommended drug in MDR-TB treatment. In addition, by making TB case notification mandatory in 2012 and by intensifying efforts to engage the private sector, case notifications rose 29% in 2014 alone.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In working towards universal health coverage, South Africa has greatly expanded access to Xpert MTB/RIF, a WHO-recommended rapid molecular test for TB and drug-resistant TB. South Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV who are receiving TB preventive treatment in the world.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span> In Thailand, where a large percentage of the population has access to health services at modest cost, efforts are focusing on ensuring that all residents – including migrants – have access to TB treatment.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In the Russian Federation, a high-level working group across government institutions has strengthened TB policies over the last 15 years. Since 2005, Russia reports that TB mortality rate has dropped more than 50%, and TB notifications have dropped 20%. WHO will work with the Ministry of Health in 2016 to assess these data and help assess the factors leading to such a decline.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Brazil and Viet Nam, both with effective basic TB services, are investing in research efforts to drive down the TB burden. Brazil has formed a national network of TB researchers, REDE-TB, which is working on basic science, clinical trials, and operational research priorities. Viet Nam has formed VICTORY (“Viet Nam Integrated Centre for Tuberculosis and Respirology Research”), a research partnership that is initiating a TB prevalence survey and developing tools to prioritize interventions for MDR-TB.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Challenges remain</strong> </h2>\n<p>\n<span>Despite these advances, formidable challenges remain including fragile health systems, human resource and financial constraints, and the serious co-epidemics with HIV, diabetes, and tobacco use.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>MDR-TB is another critical challenge. Urgent and effective action to address antimicrobial resistance is key to ending TB by 2030. So are increased investments, as the global tuberculosis response remains underfunded for both implementation and research.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO is committed to continuing its work with countries and partners around the world to address these challenges and to accelerate collective action to end the TB epidemic altogether.</span></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h2><span><strong>Key TB Facts</strong></span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>TB ranks alongside HIV/AIDS the world’s top infectious disease killer.</li>\n<li>In 2014, 9.6 million people fell ill with TB and 1.5 million died from the disease, including 380 000 among people living with HIV.</li>\n<li>More than 95% of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, and TB is among the top 5 causes of death for women aged 15 to 44.</li>\n<li>In 2014, an estimated 1 million children became ill with TB and 140 000 children died.</li>\n<li>TB is a leading killer of HIV-positive people: in 2014, 1 in 3 HIV deaths was due to TB.</li>\n<li>Globally, in 2014, an estimated 480 000 people developed MDR-TB.</li>\n<li>The TB death rate dropped by 47% between 1990 and 2015.</li>\n<li>An estimated 43 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2014.</li>\n<li>The WHO End TB Strategy aims to reduce TB deaths by 90% and to cut new cases by 80% between 2015 and 2030, and to ensure that no TB-affected family faces catastrophic costs due to TB.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h2><span> <strong>Note to editors: </strong></span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>WHO defines the 30 highest TB burden countries as:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span> The 20 countries with the highest absolute burden of disease (estimated number of new TB cases per year): Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Russian Federation, South Africa, Thailand, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Viet Nam.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The 10 countries with the highest incidence rates (estimated number of new TB cases /100 000), and at least 10 000 estimated new TB cases per year: Angola, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Congo, Lesotho, Liberia, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>WHO has produced a brochure for World TB Day 2016 on actions being taken in these highest-burden countries.</li>\n</ul>",

NCDs, such as stroke, heart disease, cancers and chronic respiratory disease, now amount to nearly two-thirds of the total deaths caused by unhealthy environments. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>At the same time, deaths from infectious diseases, such as diarrhoea and malaria, often related to poor water, sanitation and waste management, have declined. Increases in access to safe water and sanitation have been key contributors to this decline, alongside better access to immunization, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and essential medicines. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Healthier environment: healthier people </h2>\n<p>\n<span>“A healthy environment underpins a healthy population,” says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. “If countries do not take actions to make environments where people live and work healthy, millions will continue to become ill and die too young.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The report emphasizes cost-effective measures that countries can take to reverse the upward trend of environment-related disease and deaths. These include reducing the use of solid fuels for cooking and increasing access to low-carbon energy technologies. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“There’s an urgent need for investment in strategies to reduce environmental risks in our cities, homes and workplaces”, said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. “Such investments can significantly reduce the rising worldwide burden of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, injuries, and cancers, and lead to immediate savings in healthcare costs.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Environmental risks take their greatest toll on young children and older people, the report finds, with children under 5 and adults aged 50 to 75 years most impacted. Yearly, the deaths of 1.7 million children under 5 and 4.9 million adults aged 50 to 75 could be prevented through better environmental management. Lower respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases mostly impact children under 5, while older people are most impacted by NCDs. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Burden of disease in WHO Regions</h2>\n<p>\n<span>Regionally, the report finds, low- and middle-income countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions had the largest environment-related disease burden in 2012, with a total of 7.3 million deaths, most attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution.

Syria today is a very different place – almost unrecognizable in parts – that will take generations to rebuild.</span></div>\n<p>\n<span>In the past few weeks however, we are seeing signs of momentum, fragile glimmers of hope. Fewer bombs are falling; humanitarian access has opened up in some places; negotiators from all sides are preparing to come together and talk. As humanitarians we welcome progress where it means real change.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The United Nations, NGOs and partners have seized new opportunities to reach people who have had nothing for a very long time. Despite danger and uncertainty we are trying new delivery methods, constantly trying to negotiate ways to reach people. Through regular aid and the recent deliveries to besieged towns we have managed to reach over six million people since the beginning of 2016.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>However, until all parties to this conflict stop attacking civilians, schools, markets and hospitals, we will continue to press them on their obligations and hold them to account. Medical supplies and equipment are still being removed at checkpoints: this is unacceptable.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Until parties to the conflict fully open up safe, unimpeded access to everyone we will keep trying to reach civilians by all and any means possible, however challenging. We are able to reach more people now in besieged areas: but we are yet to reach one in every five besieged Syrians who urgently need help and protection.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>While we are starting to get basic supplies to communities who have been cut off for months or more, it is just not enough. For example, we are extremely concerned about the situation in northern rural Homs and in Aleppo, where around 500,000 people are caught behind active frontlines. Two million people are in areas controlled by ISIL.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>We and our partners remain ready to deliver assistance.

No vaccine or therapeutic has yet been tested on humans. </span></p><h2 class=\"section_head1\">Vaccines</h2><p><span>Experts agreed that the development of a vaccine is a major priority to respond to epidemics in the future.

There has been an overall decline in the occurrence of international spread of wild poliovirus. The Committee was particularly encouraged by the intensified efforts and progress toward interruption of poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan despite challenging circumstances, and the renewed emphasis on cooperation along the long international border between the two countries.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee noted however that the international spread of wild poliovirus has continued, with two new recent reports of exportations from Pakistan into Afghanistan which occurred in October and November 2015. These cases occurred in Nangarhar and Kunar Provinces, in the eastern region, adjoining the Pakistan border. While there has been no new exportation from Afghanistan to Pakistan, ongoing transmission particularly in inaccessible parts of the Eastern Region of Afghanistan close to the international border presents an ongoing risk. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee noted that while Pakistan and Afghanistan have historically shared a vast common zone of poliovirus transmission, the ongoing spread between the two countries is occurring from discrete zones of persistent transmission in each country. Strong programmatic action in these zones should interrupt such cross-border transmission, as illustrated by the experience in regions that were previously polio-endemic. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The committee re-emphasized that under the IHR, spread of poliovirus between two Member States can constitute international spread. The Committee acknowledged that cross border collaboration efforts have continued to be strengthened. Whilst border vaccination between these two countries is limited to children under ten years of age, efforts are being made to vaccinate departing travellers of all age groups from airports when leaving this epidemiological block formed by the two countries. The committee was particularly pleased that the Temporary Recommendations for international travellers of all ages are now being implemented in Afghanistan at the international airport in Kabul. In this respect, it noted that all countries, and particularly those with embassies in Afghanistan and Pakistan, should facilitate implementation of Temporary Recommendations through adopting procedures that include proof of polio vaccination as part of visa application processes for travellers departing from Afghanistan or Pakistan.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The committee noted that globally there are still significant vulnerable areas and populations that are inadequately immunized due to conflict, insecurity and poor coverage associated with weak immunization programmes. Such vulnerable areas include countries in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, central Africa and parts of Europe. The hard-earned gains of the GPEI can be quickly lost if there is re-introduction of poliovirus in settings of disrupted health systems and complex humanitarian emergencies. The large population movements across the Middle East and from Afghanistan and Pakistan create a heightened risk of international spread of polio. There is a risk of missing polio vaccination among refugee and mobile populations, adding to missed and under vaccinated populations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. An estimated three to four million people have been displaced to Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan and are at the centre of a mass migration across Europe. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The committee was very concerned by the weakening of AFP surveillance in Equatorial Guinea, and urged renewed efforts to strengthen surveillance and routine immunization there. Insecurity in Africa, notably in parts of Cameroon and Somalia, continues to pose a threat to polio eradication in that continent.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Vaccine derived poliovirus</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The current circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks across four WHO regions illustrate serious gaps in routine immunization programs, leading to significant pockets of vulnerability to polio outbreaks. In 2015, six outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus have occurred – three cVDPV type 1 outbreaks (Ukraine, Madagascar and Lao People’s Democratic Republic) and three cVDPV type 2 outbreaks (Myanmar, Nigeria and Guinea). </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Six additional cases of cVDPV type 2 have been reported in Guinea since the last meeting. This increases the threat of international spread, particularly to neighbouring countries, where the Ebola epidemic has weakened health systems including routine immunization. This is of particular concern given the imminent global withdrawal of type 2 oral polio vaccine (OPV2) in April 2016. The committee noted with concern that AFP surveillance does not meet international standards in parts of Guinea, heightening concern about whether circulation could be missed. Post-Ebola there was a new community reluctance to accept vaccination, and this needs to be urgently addressed. The committee acknowledged the efforts to improve the quality of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), and urged that this continue.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The committee noted that in Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Myanmar there was ongoing circulation of vaccine derived polioviruses, particularly in hard to reach populations in both countries, underlining the importance of communication to counteract vaccine hesitancy.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>While there have been no new cases of cVDPV in Ukraine, Madagascar, South Sudan or Nigeria since the last committee meeting, threats remain. More needs to be done in each of these countries to improve routine coverage and AFP surveillance. In Ukraine, the committee was concerned by the restricted availability of polio vaccines (including non-availability to persons &gt;10 years of age) and suboptimal routine immunization, and reports of lack of community acceptance of polio vaccines. This reluctance to be vaccinated needs to be addressed through well-crafted communications. In South Sudan and Nigeria, there was heightened risk of further circulation in areas affected by conflict and insecurity. Complacency is another risk in Nigeria, and as the number of SIAs decreases, the strengthening of routine immunization needs to be a high priority. </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"section_head1\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee unanimously agreed that the international spread of polio remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of the Temporary Recommendations for a further three months.

There has been an overall decline in the occurrence of international spread of wild poliovirus. The Committee was particularly encouraged by the intensified efforts and progress toward interruption of poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan despite challenging circumstances, and the renewed emphasis on cooperation along the long international border between the two countries.",
          "The Committee noted however that the international spread of wild poliovirus has continued, with two new recent reports of exportations from Pakistan into Afghanistan which occurred in October and November 2015.

Recognizing that cVDPV illustrates serious gaps in routine immunization programs in otherwise polio free countries, the Committee recommended that the international partners in routine immunization, for example Gavi, should urgently assist affected countries to improve the national immunization program.",
