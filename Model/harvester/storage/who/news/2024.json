The systematic dismantling of the health system and a siege for over 80 days on North Gaza puts the lives of the 75,000 Palestinians remaining in the area at risk.Initial reports indicate that some areas of the hospital were burnt and severely damaged during the raid, including the laboratory, surgical unit, engineering and maintenance department, operations theatre, and the medical store. Earlier in the day, twelve patients and a female health staff were reportedly forced to evacuate to destroyed and non-functional Indonesian Hospital where it is not possible to provide any care, while the majority of the staff, stable patients and companions were moved to a nearby location. Additionally, some people were reportedly stripped and forced to walk toward southern Gaza. Over the last two months, the area around the hospital has remained highly volatile and attacks on the hospitals and on health workers have occurred almost daily. This week, bombardments in its vicinity reportedly killed 50 people, including five health workers from Kamal Adwan Hospital.Kamal Adwan is now empty. Yesterday evening, the remaining 15 critical patients, 50 caregivers and 20 health workers were transferred to Indonesian Hospital, which lacks the necessary equipment and supplies to provide adequate care. The movement and treatment of these critical patients under such conditions pose grave risks to their survival. WHO is deeply concerned for their wellbeing, as well as for the Kamal Adwan Hospital director who has been reportedly detained during the raid. WHO lost contact with him since the raid began.An urgent WHO mission to Indonesian Hospital is being planned for tomorrow to assess the situation at the facility, provide basic medical supplies, food and water, and safely move critical patients to Gaza City for continued care.The raid on the Kamal Adwan hospital follows escalating restrictions on access and repeated attacks. Since early October 2024, WHO has verified at least 50 attacks on health on or near the hospital. Despite the increasingly dire needs for emergency and trauma services and supplies, only 10 out of 21 WHO missions to Kamal Adwan have been partially facilitated between early October and December. During these missions, 45 000 liters of fuel, medical supplies, blood, and food were delivered, and 114 patients along with 123 companions were transferred to Al-Shifa Hospital. But the deployment of international emergency medical teams has been repeatedly denied.WHO and partners' efforts to sustain the hospitals’ operations have been undone. With Kamal Adwan and Indonesian hospitals entirely out of service, and Al-Awda Hospital barely able to function, and severely damaged due to recent airstrikes, the healthcare lifeline for those in North Gaza is reaching a breaking point.WHO calls for urgently ensuring that hospitals in North Gaza can be supported to become functional again.Hospitals have once again become battlegrounds, reminiscent of the destruction of the health system in Gaza City earlier this year.Since October 2023, WHO has repeatedly issued urgent calls to protect health workers and hospitals as per international humanitarian law —yet these calls remain unheard.

Previous statements from the TAG-CO-VAC can be found on the  <a href=\"/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-covid-19-vaccine-composition-(tag-co-vac)/about\">WHO website</a>.</p><p>The TAG-CO-VAC reconvened on 10-12 December 2024 to review the genetic and antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2; immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination; the performance of currently approved vaccines against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants; and the implications for COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition.</p><h3>Evidence reviewed </h3><h3></h3><p>The published and unpublished evidence reviewed by the TAG-CO-VAC included: (1) SARS-CoV-2 genetic evolution with additional support from the WHO  <a href=\"/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-virus-evolution\">Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution</a> (TAG-VE); (2) Antigenic characterization of previous and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants using virus neutralization tests with animal antisera and further analysis of antigenic relationships using antigenic cartography; (3) Immunogenicity data on the breadth of neutralizing antibody responses elicited by currently approved vaccine antigens against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants using animal and human sera; (4) Preliminary immunogenicity data on immune responses following infection with circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants; (5) Available vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates of currently approved vaccines during periods of circulation of XBB.1 and JN.1 lineages; and (6) Preliminary preclinical and clinical immunogenicity data on the performance of candidate vaccines with updated antigens shared confidentially by vaccine manufacturers with TAG-CO-VAC.

The majority of COVID-19 deaths continue to occur in individuals aged 65 years and older and those with coexisting conditions. There are persistent and increasing gaps in the reporting of cases, hospitalizations and deaths, from WHO Member States, making epidemiological trends difficult to infer. </li><li>Currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants are all derived from JN.1. The weekly proportion of XEC sequences among all SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted to GISAID continues to increase, while the weekly proportions of all other Variants of Interest (JN.1) or Variants Under Monitoring (KP.2, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, JN.1.18 and LB.1) are now declining. There are other JN.1-derived variants that are currently in low proportions, but which have mutations that may give them an advantage over XEC: currently LP.8.1, NP.1, LF.7.2 are variants being monitored and/or characterized.</li><li>In published and unpublished data using antisera from naïve animal models, circulating JN.1-derived variants (JN.1, JN.1.16.1, KP.2, KP.2.3, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, LB.1 and XEC) are antigenically closely related.<ul><li>Analysis of naïve mice immunized with mRNA vaccine antigens (KP.3, KP.3.1.1, XEC) showed that JN.1, KP.3.1.1, XEC are antigenically closely related to each other (approximately 1 antigenic unit in cartographic analysis, which corresponds to a two-fold-reduction in neutralization). Antisera to KP.3.1.1 and XEC generate cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers to each other and to other emerging variants. </li><li>Antisera from naïve hamsters infected with JN.1 descendent lineages showed that circulating JN.1-derived variants such as KP.3.1.1 are antigenically closely related to JN.1 and to each other (approximately 1 antigenic unit in cartographic analysis). JN.1 antisera showed greater cross-reactivity to KP.2 and KP.3.1.1, as compared to KP.2 antisera.</li></ul></li><li>In published and unpublished data from humans, vaccination with monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 antigens significantly increased neutralizing antibody titers that cross-reacted with all JN.1 descendent lineages tested. <ul><li>Analysis of pre- and post-vaccination sera from JN.1 or KP.2 immunized individuals demonstrated that vaccination results in strong rises in neutralizing antibody titers against JN.1 and descendent variants, including KP.2, KP.2.3, KP.3, KP.3.1.1 and XEC. </li><li>Post-monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 vaccination neutralizing antibody titers against KP.3.1.1 and XEC were modestly lower (consistent 2-fold reductions in titers) than those against the homologous JN.1 or KP.2 antigens. </li><li>There were greater reductions in cross-neutralization of emerging JN.1 lineage variants using post-monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination sera, as compared to post-monovalent JN.1 or post-monovalent KP.2 vaccination sera.</li></ul></li><li>In a context of infection- and vaccine-derived immunity in the majority of the population, contemporary vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates are relative (rVE) rather than absolute (comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals). rVE, sometimes referred to as “up-to-date VE”, demonstrates the added protection of most recent vaccination over and above pre-existing immunity derived from previous infections and/or vaccinations. There are currently studies reporting VE or rVE estimates using monovalent JN.1 lineage (JN.1 or KP.2) vaccines.  </li><li>Approved monovalent XBB.1.5 mRNA COVID-19 vaccines continued to provide additional protection against severe disease and death during periods of XBB descendent lineage circulation in the first three months after vaccination; rVE point estimates against symptomatic disease were typically lower. During periods of JN.1 descendent lineage circulation, monovalent XBB.1.5 mRNA vaccines continued to show additional protection in the first three months after vaccination, however, available evidence points towards a reduction in rVE estimates against JN.1-derived variants, as compared to XBB.1 lineage variants, for protection against death, severe disease, symptomatic disease and infection.</li><li>The VE estimates for monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccines against JN.1-derived variants are consistent with reductions in neutralizing antibody titers observed in preclinical and clinical immunogenicity studies of post-monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination sera against JN.1 descendent variants, as compared to XBB.1 lineage variants.</li><li>Preclinical data shared confidentially with the TAG-CO-VAC by vaccine manufacturers show that immunization of naïve mice, as well as of mice previously immunized with SARS-CoV-2 variants with monovalent JN.1-containing or monovalent KP.2-containing vaccine candidates resulted in good neutralization of JN.1 and descendent variants, including KP.3.1.1, XEC and MC.1. However, neutralizing antibody titers against KP.3.1.1, XEC and MC.1 were approximately 2-fold lower than those against the homologous immunizing antigen. A single preclinical immunogenicity study in mice using an XEC vaccine candidate showed comparable neutralizing antibody titers against JN.1, KP.3.1.1 and XEC as compared to a JN.1 vaccine candidate. </li><li>Clinical data shared confidentially with the TAG-CO-VAC by vaccine manufacturers show that post-monovalent JN.1 sera neutralized JN.1 and its derivatives including KP.3.1.1 and XEC well. </li></ul><p>The TAG-CO-VAC acknowledges several limitations of the available data: </p><ul type=\"disc\"><li data-level=\"1\" data-list=\"3\">There are      persistent and increasing gaps in the reporting of cases, hospitalizations      and deaths, from WHO Member States, as well as in genetic/genomic      surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 globally, including low numbers of samples      sequenced and limited geographic diversity.

Post-monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 vaccination neutralizing antibody titers against KP.3.1.1 and XEC were modestly lower (consistent 2-fold reductions in titers) than those against the homologous JN.1 or KP.2 antigens.

There are currently studies reporting VE or rVE estimates using monovalent JN.1 lineage (JN.1 or KP.2) vaccines.",

During periods of JN.1 descendent lineage circulation, monovalent XBB.1.5 mRNA vaccines continued to show additional protection in the first three months after vaccination, however, available evidence points towards a reduction in rVE estimates against JN.1-derived variants, as compared to XBB.1 lineage variants, for protection against death, severe disease, symptomatic disease and infection.",

The TAG-CO-VAC strongly      supports the ongoing work of the WHO Coronavirus Network (CoViNet) to address this information gap.",

      "Although neutralizing antibody titers have been shown to be important correlates of      protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and of estimates of vaccine      effectiveness, there are multiple components of immune protection elicited      by infection and/or vaccination. Data on the immune responses following      JN.1 descendent lineage infection or monovalent JN.1, KP.2 or XBB.1.5      vaccination are largely restricted to neutralizing antibodies. Data and      interpretation of other aspects of the immune response, including cellular      immunity, are limited.",
      "Immunogenicity data against currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants are not available      for all COVID-19 vaccines. Further, there are very limited data on      immune responses following infection in humans with recent SARS-CoV-2      variants (e.g., KP.3.1.1, XEC).",
      "Estimates of VE      against recently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including XBB or JN.1      descendent lineages, are limited in terms of the number and geographic      diversity of studies, vaccine platforms evaluated, populations assessed, and      duration of follow-up. Furthermore, the referent population for VE      estimates varies substantially with respect to prior history of      vaccination. There are currently no direct comparative estimates for      monovalent JN.1, KP.2 or XBB.1.5 vaccines versus other antigen      composition(s) delivered during the same time period.

          "The road ahead for Lebanon‘s health system is rocky and the future uncertain.",
          "Lebanon’s cumulative real GDP has shrunk by 38% since 2019, according to the World Bank, with the war being the latest of many blows. As of today, more than 1 million people displaced by hostilities have returned to southern Lebanon where the physical and health infrastructure is in tatters. Several health facilities remain closed and most hospitals are running below capacity due to financial restraints and shortages of staff, long-standing challenges in Lebanon.",
          "More than 530 health workers and patients have been killed or injured in attacks on health care and thousands of health workers have been displaced or have emigrated leaving the hospitals and the health centres grappling to meet the health needs of the populations. In order to keep hospitals running, the need for health workers is dire.",
          "Water and sanitation systems have been severely disrupted, compounding the risk of disease outbreaks. With nearly 7% of buildings in ruins in the two southern governorates that were hardest hit, thousands remain on the move and won’t be able to return home anytime soon. Those who have returned face the risks posed by explosive remnants of war, as well as greater overall health risks."

          "Since 8 October 2023, more than 4000 people were killed and 17 000 injured in Lebanon alone. Since the ceasefire took hold and conflict-impacted areas have become more accessible, the death toll continued climbing as more bodies are found in the 16 000 buildings that have been partially or completely destroyed , leaving an estimated 8 million tonnes of debris.",
          "\"The physical destruction is similar to what you see after an earthquake – and that has resulted in complex injuries, open wounds and fractures. And since the treatment provided during the war was often not optimal, the injured end up needing multiple surgeries to prevent complications and disabilities,  \" said Dr Ahmad Alchaikh Hassan, WHO Trauma Technical Officer.",
          "One in 4 people with life-changing injuries will need long-term rehabilitation and, in some cases, assistive technologies and prosthetics. Specialized support will be required as the technical capacities in Lebanon cannot cope with the increasing numbers of people in need for these services and commodities.",
          "\"This need for specialized health care will persist for months and years to come. Lebanon needs reconstructive surgeons to treat the severely injured, eye doctors to treat the thousands of people injured in the pager attack, physiotherapists to start rehabilitating amputees and prosthetists to assist users of assistive devices,\" said WHO Representative Dr Abubakar."

          "Three weeks into an 8-week ceasefire, WHO and the Ministry of Public Health are working on replenishing medical supplies and restoring health services country-wide.",
          "\"WHO and national health authorities have carried out several mass casualty management trainings across Lebanon – resulting in stronger, more life-saving assertive responses.  Without these timely interventions, the outcomes would be unconscionable, \" said Dr Hassan, WHO's Trauma Technical Officer.",
          "The ongoing WHO operations include scaling up trauma care capacity, training surgeons on specialized trauma care in conflict areas, providing mental health trainings to health workers, capacity building for rehabilitation in post-conflict settings, replacing damaged equipment, identifying gaps in health coverage, and preparing for future scenarios and the subsequent health impact.",
          "WHO also provided 5000 contingency blood bags and reagents to blood banks and developed awareness material on unexploded ordinances and other health risks for first responders and civilians. WHO and the Ministry of Public Health run strong country-wide surveillance for disease outbreaks which pose a heightened risk in post-conflict settings.",
          "\"The road to recovery will be long and windy. Our aim is to assist the health system to bounce back, and be resilient and prepared. We are grateful to our many partners who have supported this response but this is not the end of it. This is the start and the need for technical and financial support has never been greater,\" concluded WHO Representative Dr Abubakar."

    "content_html": "<p>Around 846 million people aged between 15 and 49 are living with genital herpes infections – more than 1 in 5 of this age-group globally – according to <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://sti.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/sextrans-2024-056307\" target=\"_blank\">new estimates</a> released today. At least 1 person each second – 42 million people annually – is estimated to acquire a new genital herpes infection.</p><p>Most of the time, these infections cause no or few symptoms. However, for some people they lead to painful genital sores and blisters that can recur throughout life, causing significant discomfort and often requiring multiple healthcare visits. According to the estimates, more than 200 million people aged 15 to 49 suffered at least one such symptomatic episode in 2020. </p><p>The authors of the study, published in the journal <em>Sexually Transmitted Infections</em>, say that new treatments and vaccines are needed to reduce adverse health effects of the herpes virus and control its spread.</p><p>“While most people with a genital herpes infection experience few symptoms, with so many infections genital herpes still causes pain and distress for millions globally and strains already overburdened health systems,” said Dr Meg Doherty, Director of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes at WHO. “Better prevention and treatment options are urgently needed to reduce herpes transmission and will also contribute to reducing the transmission of HIV.”</p><p>Currently, there is no cure for herpes, although treatments can relieve symptoms. In addition to sores, genital herpes can also on occasion lead to serious complications, including neonatal herpes – a rare condition most likely to occur when a mother acquires the infection for the first time in late pregnancy and then transmits the virus to her baby during childbirth. </p><p>There are two types of the herpes simplex virus (HSV), known as HSV-1 and HSV-2, both of which can lead to genital herpes. According to the estimates, 520 million people in 2020 had genital HSV-2, which is transmitted during sexual activity. From a public health perspective, genital HSV-2 is more serious since it is substantially more likely to cause recurrent outbreaks, accounts for around 90% of symptomatic episodes, and is linked to a three-fold increased risk of getting HIV.</p><p>Unlike HSV-2, HSV-1 primarily spreads during childhood through saliva or skin to skin contact around the mouth to cause oral herpes, with cold sores or mouth ulcers the most common symptoms. In those without previous infection, however, HSV-1 can be acquired through sexual contact to cause genital infection in adolescence or adulthood. Some 376 million people are estimated to have had genital HSV-1 infections in 2020. Of these, 50 million are estimated also to have HSV-2 as it is possible to have both types at the same time.</p><p>While the 2020 estimates show virtually no difference in the prevalence of genital HSV-2 compared to 2016, estimated genital HSV-1 infections are higher. Over recent years, several countries have observed changing patterns of transmission in HSV-1, with adult genital infections increasing as childhood oral infections decline. Reduced oral spread during childhood may be linked to factors like less crowded living conditions and improved hygiene, which then increases susceptibility to the virus at older ages. The authors note that these increases may also partially reflect changes in methods and additional data sources. </p><p>“Stigma around genital herpes means it has been discussed too little, despite affecting millions of people globally. Not enough has been done to address this common infection,” said Dr Sami Gottlieb, an author of the report and Medical Officer within WHO’s Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research including the UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP). “Expanded research and investment in developing new herpes vaccines and therapies, and their equitable use, could play a critical role in improving quality of life for people around the world.”</p><p>While they are not fully effective at stopping its spread, correct and consistent use of condoms reduces risks of herpes transmission. People with active symptoms should avoid sexual contact with other people, since herpes is most contagious when sores are present. WHO recommends that people with symptoms of genital herpes should be offered HIV testing and if needed, pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention. </p><p>In line with its <a href=\"/teams/global-hiv-hepatitis-and-stis-programmes/strategies/global-health-sector-strategies\">Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections for 2022-2030</a>, WHO works to increase awareness about genital herpes infections and related symptoms, improve access to antiviral medications, and promote related HIV prevention efforts.

    "content_html": "<p> </p><p>The fortieth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the<strong> </strong>international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO Director-General on 6 November 2024 with Committee members and advisers meeting via video conference with affected countries, supported by the WHO Secretariat. The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in the context of the global target of interruption and certification of WPV1 eradication by 2027 and interruption and certification of cVDPV2 elimination by 2029. Technical updates were received about the situation in Afghanistan, Cameroon, France, Ghana, Indonesia, Nigeria, occupied Palestinian territory (oPt), Pakistan, Spain and Zimbabwe.</p><h2>Wild poliovirus<strong></strong></h2><p>Since the last Emergency Committee meeting, 51 new WPV1 cases were reported – 17 from Afghanistan and 34 from Pakistan – bringing the total to 62 in 2024. This represents a 283% increase in paralytic cases in Afghanistan and a 550% increase in Pakistan compared to all of 2023. The number of WPV1 positive environmental samples in Pakistan in 2024 is 402 compared to 126 during all of 2023. The number of WPV1 positive environmental samples in Afghanistan in 2024 is 84 compared to 62 in all of 2023.<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span></p><p>There has been an upward trend of WPV1 detection in Pakistan since mid-2023, initially in the environmental samples and later also in paralytic polio cases, mostly from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Sindh and Balochistan provinces. In Afghanistan, there is increased WPV1 detection in the environmental samples and paralytic cases, mainly in the South Region since late 2023. The Committee noted the WPV1 geographic spread in both the endemic countries and that most of the newly infected provinces in 2024 had not reported WPV1 cases in recent years (before 2024). The Committee, however, noted that the most intense WPV1 transmission is in the southern cross border epidemiological corridor comprising of Quetta Block of Pakistan and South Region of Afghanistan. Moreover, WPV1 transmission is seemingly re-establishing in historical core reservoirs of Karachi and Peshawar of Pakistan. Review of the molecular epidemiology indicates that there has been progressive elimination of the genetic cluster ‘YB3C’ in 2022 and 2023, with its last detection in November 2023 in Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. However, there has been persistent transmission of YB3A genetic cluster since May 2022, resulting in its split into two: YB3A4A and YB3A4B. The YB3A4A is a shared cluster in the northern and southern cross-border corridors across Afghanistan and Pakistan, while the YB3A4B is mainly active in Pakistan.</p><p>Both Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to implement an intensive and synchronized campaign schedule focusing on improved vaccination coverage in the endemic zones and effective and timely response to WPV1 detections elsewhere in each country. Both countries implemented two nationwide rounds each in 2024 so far; Afghanistan implemented an additional four and Pakistan an additional six sub-national vaccination rounds. After very encouraging progress towards implementing house-to-house campaigns in all of Afghanistan during the first half of 2024, Afghanistan programme has recently gone back to implementing site-to-site modality campaigns. The Committee was concerned about this recent development, since site-to-site campaigns are not able to reach all the children in Afghanistan especially those of younger age and girls, which may lead to a further upsurge of WPV1 with geographical spread in Afghanistan and beyond. In Pakistan, the campaign quality in the endemic zone of South KP and historic WPV1 reservoirs continues to face challenges relating to operational implementation and increasing insecurity (including attacks on health works) particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. Despite some recent progress in the endemic South KP in Pakistan, there are concerning numbers of missed children during the recent campaigns (ranging from 5000 to 700 000) due to insecurity, boycotts, and programme quality issues. Key AFP surveillance performance indicators are not meeting the targets in some of the districts of South KP of Pakistan. In addition to seasonal movement patterns within and between the two endemic countries, the continued return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan compounds the challenges faced. The scale of the displacement increases the risk of cross-border poliovirus spread as well as spread within both the countries. This risk is being managed and mitigated in both countries through vaccination at border crossing points and the updating of micro-plans in the districts of origin and return. The programme continues to closely coordinate with IOM and UNHCR.</p><p>In summary, the available data indicate that globally transmission of WPV1 is geographically limited to the two WPV1 endemic countries; however, there has been geographical spread and intensifying transmission within the two endemic countries in 2024.<strong style=\"background-color:initial;color:#333333;font-size:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></strong></p><h2>Wild poliovirus type-3 accidental exposure in France</h2><p>The Committee noted the recent incident of an accidental WPV3 exposure in a manufacturing plant in France and appreciated the immediate and effective response measures taken by the French authorities to prevent any spread. The Committee reinforced the importance of ensuring poliovirus containment measures as per the WHO Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment and recommendations of the Global Certification Commission on Poliomyelitis Eradication.</p><h2>Circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV)</h2><p>In 2024, there have been 190 cVDPV cases, of which 182 are cVDPV2 and eight are cVDPV1. Additionally, 177 environmental samples were positive for cVDPV, all type 2. Of the 182 cVDPV2 cases in 2024, 85 (46%) have occurred in Nigeria. Of the eight cVDPV1 cases in 2024, seven were reported from DR Congo and one from Mozambique.</p><p>A total of 529 cases have been confirmed with cVDPV in all of 2023, of which 395 are cVDPV2 and 134 are cVDPV1. Of the 529 cVDPV cases reported in 2023, 226 (43%) have occurred in the DR Congo.</p><p>Since the last meeting of the Emergency Committee, Cameroon, Djibouti, French Guiana (France), Ghana, oPt, Spain, and Zimbabwe reported new cVDPV2 detections. Amidst the ongoing insecurity and humanitarian challenges, the oPt (Gaza) reported 11 cVDPV2 positive environmental samples and one paralytic case between June and October 2024. The Committee appreciated the ongoing outbreak response implementation in Gaza reaching nearly 600 000 children during the first campaign, despite the very challenging situation.</p><p>In 2024, the total number of circulating cVDPV2 emergence groups detected to date is 24, compared to 27 in 2023, 22 in 2022, 29 in 2021, 36 in 2020, and 44 in 2019. Of the 24 emergence groups circulating in 2024, eight are newly detected this year, all derived from the novel OPV2 vaccine. There have now been 23 nOPV2 derived cVDPV2 emergences since 2021. The Committee noted that the nOPV2 vaccine continues to demonstrate significantly higher genetic stability and substantially lower likelihood of reversion to neurovirulence relative to Sabin OPV2.</p><p>A total of eight cVDPV1 cases have been reported in 2024, seven in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and one in Mozambique. This compares to 134 cVDPV1 cases in all of 2023 (106 in Democratic Republic of the Congo, 24 in Madagascar, four in Mozambique), representing a 94% reduction in the global cVDPV1 paralytic burden from 2023. However, one new emergence has been reported from the Tshopo province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC-TSH-3). This is the first cVDPV1 emergence reported since September 2022. The committed noted encouraging progress in Madagascar towards interrupting local cVDPV1 transmission, with no detections for more than 12 months.</p><p>The Committee noted that two cVDPV3 outbreaks have recently been reported for the first time since March 2022; in French Guiana (a French territory located in the South America) and Guinea in the African Region. French Guiana reported three cVDPV3 positive environmental samples while Guinea reported three paralytic cases.</p><p>The Committee noted that much of the risk for cVDPV outbreaks can be linked to a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, a high concentration of zero dose and under-immunized children along with continued population displacement. These factors are currently most evident in northern Yemen where response immunization has not yet happened due to insecurity and conflict as well as northern Nigeria, south-central Somalia, eastern DR Congo and oPt.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Ongoing risk of WPV1 international spread:</span>  </p><p>Based on the following factors, there remains the risk of international spread of WPV1:</p><ul><li>Spread of WPV1 transmission back into formerly endemic areas and core reservoirs of Afghanistan (South) and Pakistan (Karachi, Peshawar, Quetta Block) as well as other areas in the two countries that were without any WPV1 detection for prolong periods of time; representing a significant risk to the gains made during the last two years.</li><li>That WPV1 transmission has been re-established in the south region of Afghanistan and the Peshawar, Karachi, and Quetta Blocks in Pakistan.</li><li>This intensifying WPV1 transmission in both endemic countries during the early low transmission season indicates sizeable cohort of unimmunized and under-immunized children.</li><li>Lack of house-to-house vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan represents a major risk of further WPV1 spread and intensification of its transmission.</li><li>Certain geographies and population pockets in the epidemiologically critical areas of Pakistan continue to have inconsistent campaign quality and substantial number of unimmunized and under-immunized children due to insecurity (including attacks on health workers) and operational gaps.</li><li>High-risk mobile populations in Pakistan represent a specific risk of international spread to Afghanistan in particular, compounded by ongoing significant movement of returnees from Pakistan into several provinces of Afghanistan.</li></ul><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Ongoing risk of cVDPV international spread</span><strong>:</strong></p><p>Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of cVDPV appears to remain high:</p><ul><li>Ongoing cross border spread including into newly re-infected countries and territories.</li><li>Continued cVDPV2 transmission in the critical areas of Nigeria, with 46% of the global cVDPV2 cases in 2024 and its potential to amplify the transmission.</li><li>The cVDPV2 transmission in the Horn of Africa seems to be intensifying. The Horn of Africa countries continue to face humanitarian and health emergencies making it challenging to implement high-quality vaccination campaigns in a timely manner.</li><li>There is a large pool of unimmunized susceptible children in the Northern Governorates of Yemen.</li><li>The ever-widening gap in population intestinal mucosal immunity in young children since the withdrawal of OPV2 in 2016, as well as high concentration of zero dose children in certain areas.</li><li>Despite the decreasing number of cVDPV1 cases, a new emergence was detected in DR Congo, indicating a population immunity gap.</li><li>Recent resurgence of cVDPV3 after more than two years, infecting French Guiana and Guinea.</li><li>Ongoing insecurity and conflict in many areas that are the source of cVDPV transmission.</li></ul><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Contributing factors include:</span></p><ul><li>Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by humanitarian emergencies including conflict and protracted complex emergencies.

The strategy under the revised timeline, aims to stopping WPV1 transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan by end-2025 and certification of WPV1 eradication by end-2027; and stopping cVDPV2 outbreaks globally by end-2026 and certification cVDPV2 elimination by 2029. The bOPV Cessation will be considered after certification of eradication of WPV1 and certification of elimination of cVDPV2 by the Global Certification Commission on Poliomyelitis Eradication. </p><p>The Committee expressed concern about the intensifying WPV1 transmission in Afghanistan and Pakistan with significant increase in the number of paralytic cases and geographic spread in 2024. Consequent to persistent WPV1 transmission, the YB3A genetic cluster of WPV1 has split into two, indicating significant number of under-immunized children in both the remaining endemic countries. Continuing WPV1 transmission despite the ongoing campaigns implementation indicates the need for an in-depth programme review and adjustment in current programme strategies. The review should inform the programme planning and implementation in the crucial upcoming low transmission season from December 2024 through May 2025.<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> </span></p><p>The Committee is concerned about the inability to implement house-to-house campaigns and very low engagement of women health workers in Afghanistan, putting infants and young children especially the girls, at high risk of missing polio vaccination. This situation may jeopardize all the gains made in Afghanistan over the last two years, including in the East Region where polio epidemiology has been seemingly improving during the last few months. </p><p>The Committee noted the high-level political commitment for polio eradication in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Committee urged that the political commitment must translate into meaningful steps at the operational level to enhance community engagement and implement high-quality vaccination campaigns to stop the current intense WPV1 transmission and avert the risk of national and international spread. Specifically in Afghanistan the Committee recommended resumption of house-to-house campaigns and employment of more female vaccinators to enhance community acceptability. </p><p>The Committee noted the ongoing transmission of cVDPV in the African Region; particularly in northern Nigeria, where the transmission has lately intensified. The reports about continued sub-optimal quality vaccination campaigns and lack of community engagement are concerning for the Committee. The Committee noted the recent review and planning exercise of the Nigeria polio programme and urged to immediately put in place the plans to address the challenges in northern Nigeria. Though, the number of cVDPV cases have declined in DR Congo in 2024, the Committee considers that the country is still at high-risk of continuing outbreaks and needs to further boost population immunity through high-quality vaccination efforts. The Committee is encouraged by the improving cVDPV1 situation in the African Region; however, expressed concern about the recent detection of a new cVDPV1 emergence in DR Congo, indicating some population pockets with low immunity. </p><p>The Committee expressed concern about the inability to implement immunization response in the northern Yemen, with continued reporting of cases. The Committee is also concerned about the surveillance related challenges in northern Yemen. The committee is encouraged by the coordinated immunization response in Gaza and appreciated the efforts of all stakeholders towards implementing the response. </p><p>The committee noted the detection of cVDPV3 in Guinea and French Guiana after more than two years and urged timely and high-quality surveillance and immunization response to stop these outbreaks.<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> </span></p><p>The committee noted that many of the cVDPV infected countries remain conflict affected, disrupting routine immunization as well as polio vaccination campaigns. The committee also noted that other health emergencies and disease outbreaks (cholera, measles, dengue, malaria, etc.) in several countries are making it very challenging to implement timely and high-quality polio vaccination campaigns. The committee noted that context-specific tailored interventions will be critical to implement high-quality campaigns and ultimately stop the cVDPV outbreaks in the current complex scenario, with varying challenges in different countries and sub-national geographies. Synchronized sub-regional approaches and strong cross-border coordination will also be critical to jointly address the challenges relating to permeable borders and common operational challenges across countries. </p><p>The committee noted some good practices in several countries, particularly on cross-border collaboration and surveillance, and on community and professional engagement. The committee encourages the countries to document and share the best practices and suggests that GPEI facilitates that. </p><p>The Committee noted the importance of maintaining sensitive surveillance in the polio infected and high-risk countries and that the GPEI should provide all possible support in this regard under the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan. The developed countries should also maintain quality surveillance for polioviruses, considering the ongoing importation risk recently highlighted by cVDPV detection in Spain and French Guiana. High-quality surveillance is fundamental to ensure early detection and timely response to importations and newly emerged outbreaks.<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> </span></p><p>The committee noted that novel OPV2 continues to demonstrate high genetic stability compared to Sabin OPV2. However, the risk of new cVDPV2 emergences will remain in the event of long intervals (&gt; 4 weeks) between outbreak response campaigns and low vaccination quality. </p><p>The Committee noted that the amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) through resolution WHA77.17 (2024), were notified to States Parties on 19 September 2024 and that they would come into effect on 19 September 2025 for 192 States Parties.  Regarding any potential effects of these amendments on the Committee, the Secretariat informed that it would be premature to assess any such effects at this time but would brief the Committee ahead of their entry into force in September 2025. </p><p>Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPVs, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment, and on 3 December 2024 determined that the poliovirus situation continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective, 3 December 2024.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",

          "Since the last Emergency Committee meeting, 51 new WPV1 cases were reported – 17 from Afghanistan and 34 from Pakistan – bringing the total to 62 in 2024. This represents a 283% increase in paralytic cases in Afghanistan and a 550% increase in Pakistan compared to all of 2023. The number of WPV1 positive environmental samples in Pakistan in 2024 is 402 compared to 126 during all of 2023. The number of WPV1 positive environmental samples in Afghanistan in 2024 is 84 compared to 62 in all of 2023.",
          "There has been an upward trend of WPV1 detection in Pakistan since mid-2023, initially in the environmental samples and later also in paralytic polio cases, mostly from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Sindh and Balochistan provinces. In Afghanistan, there is increased WPV1 detection in the environmental samples and paralytic cases, mainly in the South Region since late 2023. The Committee noted the WPV1 geographic spread in both the endemic countries and that most of the newly infected provinces in 2024 had not reported WPV1 cases in recent years (before 2024). The Committee, however, noted that the most intense WPV1 transmission is in the southern cross border epidemiological corridor comprising of Quetta Block of Pakistan and South Region of Afghanistan. Moreover, WPV1 transmission is seemingly re-establishing in historical core reservoirs of Karachi and Peshawar of Pakistan. Review of the molecular epidemiology indicates that there has been progressive elimination of the genetic cluster ‘YB3C’ in 2022 and 2023, with its last detection in November 2023 in Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. However, there has been persistent transmission of YB3A genetic cluster since May 2022, resulting in its split into two: YB3A4A and YB3A4B. The YB3A4A is a shared cluster in the northern and southern cross-border corridors across Afghanistan and Pakistan, while the YB3A4B is mainly active in Pakistan.",
          "Both Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to implement an intensive and synchronized campaign schedule focusing on improved vaccination coverage in the endemic zones and effective and timely response to WPV1 detections elsewhere in each country. Both countries implemented two nationwide rounds each in 2024 so far; Afghanistan implemented an additional four and Pakistan an additional six sub-national vaccination rounds. After very encouraging progress towards implementing house-to-house campaigns in all of Afghanistan during the first half of 2024, Afghanistan programme has recently gone back to implementing site-to-site modality campaigns. The Committee was concerned about this recent development, since site-to-site campaigns are not able to reach all the children in Afghanistan especially those of younger age and girls, which may lead to a further upsurge of WPV1 with geographical spread in Afghanistan and beyond. In Pakistan, the campaign quality in the endemic zone of South KP and historic WPV1 reservoirs continues to face challenges relating to operational implementation and increasing insecurity (including attacks on health works) particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. Despite some recent progress in the endemic South KP in Pakistan, there are concerning numbers of missed children during the recent campaigns (ranging from 5000 to 700 000) due to insecurity, boycotts, and programme quality issues. Key AFP surveillance performance indicators are not meeting the targets in some of the districts of South KP of Pakistan. In addition to seasonal movement patterns within and between the two endemic countries, the continued return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan compounds the challenges faced. The scale of the displacement increases the risk of cross-border poliovirus spread as well as spread within both the countries. This risk is being managed and mitigated in both countries through vaccination at border crossing points and the updating of micro-plans in the districts of origin and return. The programme continues to closely coordinate with IOM and UNHCR.",
          "In summary, the available data indicate that globally transmission of WPV1 is geographically limited to the two WPV1 endemic countries; however, there has been geographical spread and intensifying transmission within the two endemic countries in 2024."

          "In 2024, the total number of circulating cVDPV2 emergence groups detected to date is 24, compared to 27 in 2023, 22 in 2022, 29 in 2021, 36 in 2020, and 44 in 2019. Of the 24 emergence groups circulating in 2024, eight are newly detected this year, all derived from the novel OPV2 vaccine. There have now been 23 nOPV2 derived cVDPV2 emergences since 2021. The Committee noted that the nOPV2 vaccine continues to demonstrate significantly higher genetic stability and substantially lower likelihood of reversion to neurovirulence relative to Sabin OPV2.",
          "A total of eight cVDPV1 cases have been reported in 2024, seven in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and one in Mozambique. This compares to 134 cVDPV1 cases in all of 2023 (106 in Democratic Republic of the Congo, 24 in Madagascar, four in Mozambique), representing a 94% reduction in the global cVDPV1 paralytic burden from 2023. However, one new emergence has been reported from the Tshopo province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC-TSH-3). This is the first cVDPV1 emergence reported since September 2022. The committed noted encouraging progress in Madagascar towards interrupting local cVDPV1 transmission, with no detections for more than 12 months.",
          "The Committee noted that two cVDPV3 outbreaks have recently been reported for the first time since March 2022; in French Guiana (a French territory located in the South America) and Guinea in the African Region. French Guiana reported three cVDPV3 positive environmental samples while Guinea reported three paralytic cases.",
          "The Committee noted that much of the risk for cVDPV outbreaks can be linked to a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, a high concentration of zero dose and under-immunized children along with continued population displacement. These factors are currently most evident in northern Yemen where response immunization has not yet happened due to insecurity and conflict as well as northern Nigeria, south-central Somalia, eastern DR Congo and oPt."

          "The Committee noted that GPEI Polio Oversight Board (POB) in its recent meeting in mid-October 2024, revised the timeline for the GPEI Strategy 2022 – 2026, up to 2029. The strategy under the revised timeline, aims to stopping WPV1 transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan by end-2025 and certification of WPV1 eradication by end-2027; and stopping cVDPV2 outbreaks globally by end-2026 and certification cVDPV2 elimination by 2029. The bOPV Cessation will be considered after certification of eradication of WPV1 and certification of elimination of cVDPV2 by the Global Certification Commission on Poliomyelitis Eradication.",
          "The Committee expressed concern about the intensifying WPV1 transmission in Afghanistan and Pakistan with significant increase in the number of paralytic cases and geographic spread in 2024. Consequent to persistent WPV1 transmission, the YB3A genetic cluster of WPV1 has split into two, indicating significant number of under-immunized children in both the remaining endemic countries. Continuing WPV1 transmission despite the ongoing campaigns implementation indicates the need for an in-depth programme review and adjustment in current programme strategies. The review should inform the programme planning and implementation in the crucial upcoming low transmission season from December 2024 through May 2025.",
          "The Committee is concerned about the inability to implement house-to-house campaigns and very low engagement of women health workers in Afghanistan, putting infants and young children especially the girls, at high risk of missing polio vaccination. This situation may jeopardize all the gains made in Afghanistan over the last two years, including in the East Region where polio epidemiology has been seemingly improving during the last few months.",
          "The Committee noted the high-level political commitment for polio eradication in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Committee urged that the political commitment must translate into meaningful steps at the operational level to enhance community engagement and implement high-quality vaccination campaigns to stop the current intense WPV1 transmission and avert the risk of national and international spread. Specifically in Afghanistan the Committee recommended resumption of house-to-house campaigns and employment of more female vaccinators to enhance community acceptability.",
          "The Committee noted the ongoing transmission of cVDPV in the African Region; particularly in northern Nigeria, where the transmission has lately intensified. The reports about continued sub-optimal quality vaccination campaigns and lack of community engagement are concerning for the Committee. The Committee noted the recent review and planning exercise of the Nigeria polio programme and urged to immediately put in place the plans to address the challenges in northern Nigeria. Though, the number of cVDPV cases have declined in DR Congo in 2024, the Committee considers that the country is still at high-risk of continuing outbreaks and needs to further boost population immunity through high-quality vaccination efforts. The Committee is encouraged by the improving cVDPV1 situation in the African Region; however, expressed concern about the recent detection of a new cVDPV1 emergence in DR Congo, indicating some population pockets with low immunity.",
          "The Committee expressed concern about the inability to implement immunization response in the northern Yemen, with continued reporting of cases. The Committee is also concerned about the surveillance related challenges in northern Yemen. The committee is encouraged by the coordinated immunization response in Gaza and appreciated the efforts of all stakeholders towards implementing the response.",
          "The committee noted the detection of cVDPV3 in Guinea and French Guiana after more than two years and urged timely and high-quality surveillance and immunization response to stop these outbreaks.",
          "The committee noted that many of the cVDPV infected countries remain conflict affected, disrupting routine immunization as well as polio vaccination campaigns. The committee also noted that other health emergencies and disease outbreaks (cholera, measles, dengue, malaria, etc.) in several countries are making it very challenging to implement timely and high-quality polio vaccination campaigns. The committee noted that context-specific tailored interventions will be critical to implement high-quality campaigns and ultimately stop the cVDPV outbreaks in the current complex scenario, with varying challenges in different countries and sub-national geographies. Synchronized sub-regional approaches and strong cross-border coordination will also be critical to jointly address the challenges relating to permeable borders and common operational challenges across countries.",
          "The committee noted some good practices in several countries, particularly on cross-border collaboration and surveillance, and on community and professional engagement. The committee encourages the countries to document and share the best practices and suggests that GPEI facilitates that.",
          "The Committee noted the importance of maintaining sensitive surveillance in the polio infected and high-risk countries and that the GPEI should provide all possible support in this regard under the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan. The developed countries should also maintain quality surveillance for polioviruses, considering the ongoing importation risk recently highlighted by cVDPV detection in Spain and French Guiana. High-quality surveillance is fundamental to ensure early detection and timely response to importations and newly emerged outbreaks.",
          "The committee noted that novel OPV2 continues to demonstrate high genetic stability compared to Sabin OPV2. However, the risk of new cVDPV2 emergences will remain in the event of long intervals (> 4 weeks) between outbreak response campaigns and low vaccination quality.",
          "The Committee noted that the amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) through resolution WHA77.17 (2024), were notified to States Parties on 19 September 2024 and that they would come into effect on 19 September 2025 for 192 States Parties.  Regarding any potential effects of these amendments on the Committee, the Secretariat informed that it would be premature to assess any such effects at this time but would brief the Committee ahead of their entry into force in September 2025.",
          "Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPVs, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment, and on 3 December 2024 determined that the poliovirus situation continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective, 3 December 2024."

Thirteen (13) of the 16 Committee Members, and one of the two Advisors to the Committee participated in the meeting. </p><p>The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) delegated the WHO Deputy Director-General to welcome the Committee Members and Advisors, and invited Government Officials designated to present to the Committee on behalf of the five invited States Parties – Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.</p><p>The WHO Deputy Director-General recalled that the determination of the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), on 14 August 2024, was a call for national authorities to invest energetically to prevent and control the transmission of monkeypox virus (MPXV) with particular focus on clade Ib, to reduce the risk of international spread of mpox, and for the international community to act cohesively and intensely with all the tools and resources available for the prevention and control of mpox. </p><p>Highlighting the evolution of mpox globally (see details under the heading “Session open to representatives of States Parties invited to present their views), the WHO Deputy Director-General stressed that, since the Committee last met in August 2024, the situation has become more complex and continues to require a coordinated international response, including in all countries and especially in those with limited number of mpox cases before wider spread of disease may occur. He outlined the constructive collaborations and efforts of WHO and numerous partners, including the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), to scale up the response at regional, national and sub-national levels; and the establishment, by WHO and partners, of the Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM) as part of the interim Medical Countermeasures Network endorsed by WHO Member States, to support the equitable allocation and distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. The WHO Deputy Director-General outlined a number of challenges States Parties are facing to interrupt the transmission of mpox, including a number of concurrent health emergencies and competing health priorities, hence requiring political commitment and resources to further scale up targeted and integrated interventions at local levels. </p><p>The Representative of the Office of Legal Counsel briefed the Members and Advisors on their roles and responsibilities and identified the mandate of the Committee under the relevant articles of the IHR. The Ethics Officer from the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics provided the Members and Advisors with an overview of the WHO Declaration of Interests process. The Members and Advisors were made aware of their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature that may give rise to a perceived or actual conflict of interest. They were additionally reminded of their duty to maintain the confidentiality of the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee. Each Member and Advisor was surveyed, with no conflicts of interest identified.</p><p>The meeting was handed over to the Chair who introduced the objectives of the meeting, which were to provide views to the WHO Director-General on whether the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, and if so, to provide views on the potential proposed temporary recommendations.  </p><p><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:25px;text-align:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Session open to representatives of States Parties invited to present their views</strong></p><p>The WHO Secretariat presented an overview of the global epidemiological situation of mpox, all MPXV clades included, highlighting that, since the Committee last met in August 2024, MPXV transmission has been reported in all six WHO Regions. While the WHO African Region represents the largest contributor to the global increase of mpox cases due to clades Ia, Ib and IIa, mpox in the WHO Western Pacific Region has been increasing due to an MPXV clade IIb outbreak among men who have sex with men reported from Australia.</p><p>With regards to the spread of MPXV clade Ib in the WHO African Region, since the Committee last met, the WHO Secretariat presented that the foci of transmission are in the DRC, with clade Ib now detected in six provinces, including in the urban area of the capital Kinshasa. MPXV clade Ib has also spread in neighbouring countries, including in Burundi (2,083 mpox cases, growing in the urban areas of Bujumbura and Gitega) and Uganda (582 mpox cases, growing in the capital Kampala) with established sustained community transmission; and Kenya (17 mpox cases) and Rwanda (37 mpox cases) with clusters of mpox cases (data reported as of 19 November 2024).  </p><p>Additionally, travel-related cases of MPXV clade Ib infection, mostly epidemiologically linked to the above-mentioned countries, have been detected in eight countries in the following WHO Regions – African Region (Zambia and Zimbabwe); Americas Region (United States of America); European Region (Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, transmission within the household of the case occurred); and South-East Asian Region (India and Thailand).  </p><p>Available data from the sub-national level in the DRC shows that the observed dynamics of transmission of MPXV clade Ib are changing over time and are diverse across affected health zones. Since MPXV clade Ib was first detected in September 2023 in South Kivu province in the health zone of Kamituga, the most affected age group has shifted from adults, where transmission was first observed and appears to have been sustained by contact within commercial sexual networks, to younger age groups, including children, and sustained by household and likely broader community transmission through close physical contact. </p><p>The same epidemiological characteristics are being observed in the capital Kinshasa, where the outbreak is largely driven by transmission between adults, but where steadily more children are being reported as a result of close physical contact within households and/or the community. It is worth noting that, regardless of the circulating MPXV clades, adults of 50 years of age or older are less affected, likely due to the immunity conferred by prior vaccination against smallpox.</p><p>The WHO Secretariat indicated that information about mortality in confirmed cases of mpox, regardless of the MPXV clade, is limited. In the DRC, based on routine syndromic surveillance data, deaths attributed to mpox are predominant in rural areas known to be endemic for MPXV clade Ia – with variable case fatality rates observed across those areas, but being consistently higher in children under 5 years of age. </p><p>Outside the DRC, deaths associated with MPXV clade Ib infection have been reported in Burundi (1), Uganda (2) and Kenya (1).</p><p>The WHO Secretariat presented the assessed risk by MPXV clades and further expressed in terms of overall public health risk where any given clade/s is/are circulating, and risk of national and international spread, as: Clade Ib – high public health risk and high risk of national/international spread; Clade Ia – high public health risk and moderate risk of national/international spread; Clade II – moderate public health risk and moderate risk of national/international spread.</p><p><span style=\"background-color:initial;color:#333333;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span>The WHO Secretariat subsequently provided an update on actions WHO has taken, with States Parties and partners, following the issuance of the temporary recommendations on 19 August 2024, the extension of the <a href=\"/publications/m/item/extension-of-the-standing-recommendations-for-mpox-issued-by-the-DG-of-the-WHO-in-accordance-with-the-IHR-2005-21082024\">standing recommendations for mpox</a>, and the <a href=\"/publications/m/item/who-appeal--mpox-public-health-emergency-2024\">WHO appeal: mpox public health emergency 2024</a>, and based on the  <a href=\"/publications/m/item/mpox-global-strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan\">WHO Mpox global strategic preparedness and response plan, September 2024-February 2025</a>; the  <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" data-sf-marked=\"\" href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/publications/mpox-continental-preparedness-and-response-plan-africa\">Africa CDC-WHO Mpox Continental Preparedness and Response Plan for Africa, September 2024-February 2025</a>; <a href=\"/publications/m/item/a-coordinated-research-roadmap-on-monkeypox-virus--immediate-research-next-steps-to-contribute-to-control-the-outbreak\">A coordinated research roadmap – Mpox virus - Immediate research next steps to contribute to control the outbreak (2024)</a>.  </p><p>In addition to the overview provided by the WHO Deputy Director-General, the WHO Secretariat provided detailed updates on progress and challenges related to the following areas of the response, including: collaborative surveillance, safe and scalable clinical care, community protection, access to countermeasures, including diagnostics and vaccines (over 1.1 million doses of MVA-BN vaccine allocated to date), operations (deployment of human resources, dispatch of personal protective equipment, diagnostic tests, etc. to the field), funding (of the 87.4 million USD needed as per WHO appeal, 40.6 million USD were received or pledged; 3.5 million USD were released from the WHO's Contingency Funds for Emergencies), and coordination with partners. </p><p>Representatives of Burundi, the DRC, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda updated the Committee on the mpox epidemiological situation in their countries and their current response efforts, needs and challenges. Mpox vaccine is currently being used in the DRC and Rwanda, and there are plans to use it in Kenya and Uganda, whereas vaccination against mpox is currently not encompassed by the response strategy of Burundi.</p><p>Members of, and the Advisor to, the Committee then engaged in questions and answers with the WHO Secretariat and invited Government Officials, on the issues and challenges presented.</p><p>The determination that the upsurge of mpox constitutes a PHEIC in August 2024 was regarded by States Parties attending the meeting as having boosted domestic response efforts and the mobilization of international resource to support those efforts. </p><p>However, the lack of information at national and local levels, including the suboptimal implementation of response interventions, was regarded as an obstacle to progress in controlling and interrupting MPXV transmission. Examples to that effect related to the proportion of suspected mpox cases tested; the time from diagnosis to subsequent isolation of mpox cases; the trend of mpox test positivity rate; the proportion of contacts that have completed the follow-up period; the proportion of mpox cases with an unknown epidemiological link, and trend thereof; and challenges with mpox vaccination implementation. Challenges with vaccination implementation include: the current vaccination coverage in countries with mpox vaccines, including in targeted at risk groups; the proportion of contacts that have received mpox vaccine; the time elapsed between the last exposure of an unvaccinated contact; and the administration of mpox vaccine.</p><p>The observed multifaceted dynamics of the spread of MPXV was discussed at length in terms of (a) the expansion of transmission from within known commercial sexual networks, and subsequently within households, and to the wider community with sustained transmission; (b) opportunities to refine the risk assessment approach, considering lower geographical levels and vulnerable subsets of population; and (c) the potential for predictive mathematical modeling approaches to anticipate MPXV spread both within countries and internationally.</p><p>Aspects related to the use of mpox vaccines as part of the response were discussed, including, but not limited to, (a) progress with global and domestic regulatory issues; (b) challenges for use of mpox vaccines in infants, children, adolescents, and immunocompromised persons (as per <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/378522/WER9934-eng-fre.pdf?sequence=1\">WHO vaccine position paper</a>, August 2024); (c) need to implement vaccination as part of an integrated targeted response to interrupt MPXV transmission in hotspots at the local level, as opposed to a broader geographical use of the vaccine; (d) uncertainties related to the effectiveness of post-exposure use of the vaccine; (e) possible inclusion of studies to assess vaccine effectiveness in vaccine deployment plans; and (f) approaches to overcome vaccine hesitancy. </p><p>The coordination between Africa CDC and WHO in supporting States Parties’ response efforts in implementing the Africa CDC-WHO Mpox Continental Preparedness and Response Plan for Africa, September 2024-February 2025 was reported as collaborative, constructive and progressive. WHO and Africa CDC have a joint continental incident management team based in Kinshasa, DRC. A significant achievement of this coordination is the alignment of the vaccine allocation process and the AAM with the Technical Review Committee and the vaccination group within the Continental IMST. </p><p><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:25px;text-align:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Deliberative session</strong></p><p>Following the session open to invited States Parties, the Committee reconvened in a closed session to examine the questions in relation to whether the event constitutes a PHEIC or not, and if so, to consider the temporary recommendations drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.</p><p>The Chair reminded the Committee Members of their mandate and recalled that a PHEIC is defined in the IHR as an <em>“extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated international response”</em>.</p><p><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The Committee was unanimous in expressing the views that the ongoing upsurge of mpox still meets the criteria of a PHEIC and that the Director-General be advised accordingly.</strong></p><p>The overarching consideration underpinning the advice of the Committee is the limited effectiveness and efficiency of the response implemented at local level, particularly in Burundi and the DRC, to interrupt MPXV transmission – specifically in terms of surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, contact tracing, and community education and engagement. If duly and systematically implemented early on, such interventions could substantially contribute to the interruption of transmission both locally and globally, especially considering that access to mpox vaccine is often challenging, and the strategic use of vaccine has yet to be fully implemented. </p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">On that basis, and further elaborating upon issues addressed during the question and answers session, the Committee considered that:</span></p><p>The event is “<strong>extraordinary</strong>” because of (a) the increased number of mpox cases and geographical expansion of foci of MPXV clade Ib transmission within States Parties; (b) the evolving dynamics of MPXV clade Ib transmission – from within known commercial sexual networks, to within households, to the wider community – resulting in the infection of broader age-groups, and/or vulnerable population groups, and/or co-infection and co-circulation with other MPXV clades and/or pathogens, and, hence, generating uncertainties and unknowns in terms of morbidity and mortality, and, consequently, leading to new response challenges, including regarding clinical care; (c) the risk of MPVX clade Ib mutations in the context of sustained community transmission, resulting in new dynamics of transmission and/or associated with new morbidity and mortality patterns (e.g. changes of transmissibility and/or virulence); (d) the ongoing prevalence of MPXV clade Ia infections in DRC with new foci of sexual network disease transmission in the capital Kinshasa.</p><p>The event “<strong>constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease</strong>” because of (a) the documented recent exportation of MPVX clade Ib cases from States Parties where that clade is circulating to others within the WHO African Region and at least three additional WHO Regions; (b) the epidemiological link of exported MPVX clade Ib cases in the areas where exposure occurred is not known; (c) the risk that MPXV, and clade Ib in particular, is introduced in States Parties that may not comply with reporting requirement to WHO under IHR provisions, and/or may not have the capacities to implement response interventions.</p><p>The event <strong>“requires a coordinated international response”</strong> through (a) intensified engagement of international partners with national authorities to (i) raise the profile of mpox as public health priority, and (ii) strengthen prevention and response operations at the local level through the deployment of dedicated human resources and supplies; (b) mobilization of financial resources and their effective and efficient use; (c) the facilitation of equitable access to mpox including vaccines and diagnostics, including with the view to build capacity for the local and/or regional production of vaccine in the mid- to longer term.  </p><p>The Committee indicated the need to start elaborating on the considerations that would inform their future advice to terminate the PHEIC while assessing the three criteria defining a PHEIC. </p><p><strong>The Committee subsequently considered the draft of the temporary recommendations proposed by</strong> <strong>the WHO Secretariat</strong>. </p><p>Notwithstanding that temporary recommendations constitute non-binding advice to States Parties, and noting that it was the first time that a set of temporary recommendations included one related to reporting on the implementation thereof, the WHO Secretariat presented the structure and outcome of the survey to that effect administered to, and completed online by the five States Parties to which the temporary recommendations issued on 19 August 2024 were directed to (Burundi, the DRC, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda). Provided that the Director-General would determine that the event still constitutes a PHEIC, and issue temporary recommendations accordingly, the Committee formulated suggestions to the WHO Secretariat to improve the survey by encompassing the local dimension of the response, and to use the outcome of the survey for shaping the proposed temporary recommendations. </p><p>The Committee then considered the revised set of temporary recommendations proposed by the WHO Secretariat, should the Director-Generals determine that the event still constitutes a PHEIC. The Committee had received the proposed set ahead of the meeting and, noting the proposal to extend most of the temporary recommendations issued on 19 August 2024, the Committee formulated suggestions regarding the definition of “hotspot”, referred to in some of the recommendations. </p><p>The Committee indicated that it would be giving further consideration to the proposed temporary recommendations while finalizing the report of the meeting.</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:25px;font-weight:700;text-align:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Conclusion</span></p><p>The Committee reiterated its concern regarding the continuing spread of MPXV and uncertainties ensuing, and the effectiveness and efficiency of the response at the local level. The Committee underscored the need for the sustained commitment by national authorities in focusing efforts and resources at the local level to interrupt MPXV transmission, as well as the role of coordinated international cooperation in supporting and complementing such efforts in a synergistic manner. Therefore, the Committee considers that the determination by the WHO Director-General that the upsurge of mpox still constitutes a PHEIC would be warranted.<strong> </strong></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The WHO Deputy Director-General expressed his gratitude to the Committee’s Officers, its Members and Advisor and closed the meeting.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> </span></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">---------</p><h2 align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Temporary recommendations</strong></h2><p><strong>These temporary recommendations</strong> are issued to <strong>States Parties</strong> experiencing the transmission of monkeypox virus (MPXV), <strong>including</strong>, but not limited to, those where there is <strong>sustained community transmission, and where there are clusters of cases or sporadic travel-related cases of MPXV clade Ib</strong><sup>.</sup><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://worldhealthorg-my.sharepoint.com/personal/serraor_who_int/Documents/ALL%20SITES%20MIGRATION%20SITEFINITY/Web%20box/28%20November%202024/Changes%20with%20respect%20to%20Michel%20version.docx#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p><div><div id=\"ftn1\"><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">They are intended to be implemented by those States Parties in addition to the current </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> </span><a href=\"/publications/m/item/extension-of-the-standing-recommendations-for-mpox-issued-by-the-DG-of-the-WHO-in-accordance-with-the-IHR-2005-21082024\" style=\"text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;white-space:inherit;\">standing recommendations for mpox</a><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">, which will be extended until 20 August 2025. </span></p></div></div><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In the context of the global efforts to prevent and control the spread of mpox disease outlined in the </span> <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240092907\" style=\"text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;white-space:inherit;\">WHO Strategic framework for enhancing prevention and control of mpox- 2024-2027</a><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">, the aforementioned </span> <a href=\"/publications/m/item/extension-of-the-standing-recommendations-for-mpox-issued-by-the-DG-of-the-WHO-in-accordance-with-the-IHR-2005-21082024\" style=\"text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;white-space:inherit;\">standing recommendations</a><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> apply to </span><strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">all States Parties</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">. </span><br/></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> </span>All current WHO interim technical guidance can be accessed on <a href=\"/emergencies/outbreak-toolkit/disease-outbreak-toolboxes/mpox-outbreak-toolbox\" style=\"text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;white-space:inherit;\">this page</a><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> </span>of the WHO website.

The analysis, conducted by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), highlights the scale of the diabetes epidemic and an urgent need for stronger global action to address both rising disease rates and widening treatment gaps, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p><p>“We have seen an alarming rise in diabetes over the past three decades, which reflects the increase in obesity, compounded by the impacts of the marketing of unhealthy food, a lack of physical activity and economic hardship,\" said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “To bring the global diabetes epidemic under control, countries must urgently take action. This starts with enacting policies that support healthy diets and physical activity, and, most importantly, health systems that provide prevention, early detection and treatment.”</p><p>The study reports that global diabetes prevalence in adults rose from 7% to 14% between 1990 and 2022. LMICs experienced the largest increases, where diabetes rates have soared while treatment access remains persistently low. This trend has led to stark global inequalities: in 2022, almost 450 million adults aged 30 and older – about 59% of all adults with diabetes – remained untreated, marking a 3.5-fold increase in untreated people since 1990. Ninety per cent of these untreated adults are living in LMICs.</p><p>The study further reveals substantial global differences in diabetes rates, with the prevalence of diabetes among adults aged 18 and older around 20% in the WHO South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean Regions. These two regions, together with the African Region, have the lowest rates of diabetes treatment coverage, with fewer than 4 in 10 adults with diabetes taking glucose-lowering medication for their diabetes.</p><h3>WHO’s commitment to global diabetes response</h3><p>Addressing the soaring diabetes burden, WHO is also launching a new<a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240102248\"> </a><a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240102248\">global monitoring framework on diabetes</a> today.  This product represents a crucial step in the global response, providing comprehensive guidance to countries in measuring and evaluating diabetes prevention, care, outcomes and impacts. By tracking key indicators such as glycaemic control, hypertension and access to essential medicines, countries can improve targeted interventions and policy initiatives. This standardized approach empowers countries to prioritize resources effectively, driving significant improvements in diabetes prevention and care.</p><p>WHO’s <a href=\"/initiatives/the-who-global-diabetes-compact\">Global Diabetes Compact</a>, launched in 2021, includes the vision of reducing the risk of diabetes, and ensuring that all people who are diagnosed with diabetes have access to equitable, comprehensive, affordable and quality treatment and care. The work undertaken as part of the Compact will also support the prevention of type 2 diabetes from obesity, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. In addition, the same year, a diabetes resolution was endorsed at the World Health Assembly urging Member States to raise the priority given to the prevention, diagnosis and control of diabetes as well as prevention and management of risk factors such as obesity.</p><p>In 2022, WHO established five global diabetes coverage targets to be achieved by 2030.

          "Addressing the soaring diabetes burden, WHO is also launching a new global monitoring framework on diabetes today.  This product represents a crucial step in the global response, providing comprehensive guidance to countries in measuring and evaluating diabetes prevention, care, outcomes and impacts. By tracking key indicators such as glycaemic control, hypertension and access to essential medicines, countries can improve targeted interventions and policy initiatives. This standardized approach empowers countries to prioritize resources effectively, driving significant improvements in diabetes prevention and care.",
          "WHO’s Global Diabetes Compact , launched in 2021, includes the vision of reducing the risk of diabetes, and ensuring that all people who are diagnosed with diabetes have access to equitable, comprehensive, affordable and quality treatment and care. The work undertaken as part of the Compact will also support the prevention of type 2 diabetes from obesity, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. In addition, the same year, a diabetes resolution was endorsed at the World Health Assembly urging Member States to raise the priority given to the prevention, diagnosis and control of diabetes as well as prevention and management of risk factors such as obesity.",

    "content_html": "<p>Ahead of the 2024 UN Climate Change Conference in Baku (COP29), the World Health Organization (WHO) calls for an end to reliance on fossil fuels and advocates for people-centred adaptation and resilience.</p><p>Launching the <em><a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/environment-climate-change-and-health/58595-who-cop29-special-report_layout_9web.pdf?sfvrsn=dd2b816_8\">COP29 special report on climate and health</a></em> and a technical guidance on <em><a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/environment-climate-change-and-health/quality-critieria-for-integrating-health-in-ndcs_web.pdf?sfvrsn=ccd3e050_7\">Healthy Nationally Determined Contributions</a></em>, WHO urges world leaders at COP29 to abandon the siloed approach to addressing climate change and health. It stresses the importance of positioning health at the core of all climate negotiations, strategies, policies and action plans, to save lives and secure healthier futures for present and future generations.</p><p>“The climate crisis is a health crisis, which makes prioritizing health and well-being in climate action not only a moral and legal imperative, but a strategic opportunity to unlock transformative health benefits for a more just and equitable future,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “COP29 is a crucial opportunity for global leaders to integrate health considerations into strategies for adapting to and mitigating climate change. WHO is supporting this work with practical guidelines and support for countries.”</p><h2>Bold health argument for climate action</h2><p>Developed by WHO in collaboration with over 100 organizations and 300 experts, the <em>COP29 special report on climate change and health</em> identifies critical policies across three integrated dimensions – people, place and planet. The report outlines key actions aiming to protect all people, particularly the estimated 3.6 billion people who live in areas which are most susceptible to climate change.</p><p>The report underlines the importance of the governance that integrates health in climate policy-making – and climate in health policy-making – being essential for progress. The report’s top recommendations include:</p><li>make human health and well-being the top measure of climate success to catalyse progress and ensure people-centred adaptation and resilience; </li><ul><li>end fossil fuel subsidies and reliance by realigning economic and financial systems to protect both people's health and the environment, through investment in clean, sustainable alternatives that reduce pollution-related diseases and cut carbon emissions;</li></ul><ul><li>mobilize financing for climate-health initiatives, particularly to strengthen responsive health systems and support the health workforce, creating resilient, climate-proof health systems to protect health and save lives;</li></ul><ul><li>invest in proven solutions; just 5 interventions – from heat-health warning systems, to clean household energy, to efficient pricing of fossil fuels – would save almost 2 million lives a year, and bring US$ 4 in benefits for each dollar invested;</li></ul><ul><li>build greater focus on the role of cities in health outcomes, through more sustainable urban design, clean energy, resilient housing, and improved sanitation; and</li></ul><ul><li>increase protections for and restoration of nature and biodiversity, recognizing the synergistic health benefits of clean air, water and food security.</li></ul><p>“Health is the lived experience of climate change,” said Dr Maria Neira, Director, Environment, Climate Change and Health, WHO. “By prioritizing health in every aspect of climate action, we can unlock significant benefits for public health, climate resilience, security, and economic stability. Health is the argument we need to catalyze urgent and large-scale action in this critical moment.”</p><h2>Enhanced WHO action on health and climate</h2><p>Climate NDCs or Nationally Determined Contributions are national plans and commitments made by countries under the Paris Agreement. While health is identified as a priority in 91% of the NDCs, few outline specific actions to leverage the health benefits of climate mitigation and adaptation or to protect health from climate-related risks.</p><p>To support countries to better integrate health into their climate policies, WHO has released today <em>WHO quality criteria for integrating health into Nationally Determined Contributions: Healthy NDCs.</em> The guidance outlines practical actions for ministries of health, ministries of environment, and other health-determining sectors (e.g. transport, energy, urban planning, water and sanitation) to incorporate health considerations within their adaptation and mitigation policies and actions.</p><p>This technical guidance serves as a concrete framework to implement the recommendations included in the WHO’s <em>COP29 special report</em>, addressing key areas such as leadership and enabling environment; national circumstances and policy priorities; mitigation; adaptation; loss and damage; finance; and implementation. Integrating health within climate plans will support:</p><ul><li><strong>addressing health impacts:</strong> tackling the diverse health effects of climate change;</li><li><strong>strengthening health systems: </strong>enhancing climate resilience and decarbonization in health systems; and</li><li><strong>promoting co-benefits:</strong> focusing on key sectors that have a strong influence both on health and climate change mitigation and adaptation, such as transportation and energy.</li></ul><p>In addition to its own initiatives, WHO convenes 90 countries and 75 partners through the <a href=\"/initiatives/alliance-for-transformative-action-on-climate-and-health\">Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH)</a>. This platform was established to advance the commitments made at COP26 for building climate-resilient and sustainable health systems. ATACH promotes the integration of climate change and health nexus into respective national, regional, and global plans using the collective power of WHO Member States and other stakeholders to drive this agenda forward with urgency and scale.</p><h3>Quotes of support</h3><p><strong>António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations:</strong></p><p>“The climate crisis is also a health crisis. Human health and planetary health are intertwined. Countries must take meaningful action to protect their people, boost resources, cut emissions, phase out fossil fuels, and make peace with nature. COP29 must drive progress towards those vital goals for the planet’s health and for people’s health.”</p><p><strong>Dr Rajiv J. Shah, President of The Rockefeller Foundation:</strong></p><p>“The impact of climate change has to be measured in more than degrees: we have to account for lives saved, lost, and improved. The Rockefeller Foundation is working closely with the World Health Organization and many other partners to center health considerations in all climate action, including efforts to enable just energy transitions and to increase economic opportunities for people living in frontline communities.”</p><p><strong>Dr Vanessa Kerry, WHO Director-General Special Envoy for Climate Change Health:</strong></p><p>\"This report exposes how the accelerating climate and health crisis impacts more than just our health – it undermines economies, deepens inequities, and fuels political instability. As leaders gather for COP29, we urge them to fast-track a just transition and increase funding for health systems and frontline health workers to protect the most vulnerable. Health must be central in climate discussions, metrics, and Nationally Determined Contributions. To safeguard people, economies, and global security, health must be at the heart of climate action. We can’t afford to wait.\"</p><p><strong>Dr Alan Dangour, Director of Climate &amp; Health at Wellcome:</strong></p><p>“In every single country, climate change is costing lives, causing pain and suffering. It is a common crisis that must unite us to act, and act quickly. At COP29, countries must grasp the opportunity to commit to ambitious cross-government climate actions that both protect the planet and improves health for all. By working together, we can still change our current course and save lives.” </p><p><strong>Dr Micaela Serafini, President, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Switzerland:</strong></p><p>“Today, we are in an unacceptable situation where the world’s most vulnerable people are paying the highest price for a problem they did not cause. Solutions to safeguard their health must be prioritized, with the well-being of people placed at the heart of climate action. Failing to do so will take a toll on the very vitals of humanity.”</p><p><strong>Jagan Chapagain, Secretary General, The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC):</strong></p><p>“From the impacts of extreme heat to the spread of illnesses through floodwaters, from malnutrition as crops fail to mosquito-borne diseases where they haven’t been seen before, the climate crisis is the ultimate health crisis. This report is vital – highlighting how climate change makes us sick and what we need to do about it.”</p><p><strong>Jeni Miller, PhD, Executive Director, Global Climate and Health Alliance</strong></p><p>“Health workers are seeing the impacts of climate change firsthand, in the suffering of patients and communities they serve. During COP29, it is time for all governments to demonstrate readiness to protect people’s lives by getting serious about bold climate action. Wealthy governments must deliver the funding needed to help the most impacted countries to build their resilience and response to climate shocks. And together, governments must spell out how and when they will achieve the fossil fuel phase out promised at COP28, to deliver a full, healthy, and just clean energy transition.”</p><p><strong>Jaber Oufkir, Liaison Officer for Public Health Issues, The International Federation of Medical Students’ Association (IFMSA):</strong></p><p>The IFMSA envisions a world where climate change is fundamentally recognized as a health-care emergency. We foresee a future where the health sector leads the charge toward a net-zero economy, prioritizing sustainable practices and advocating for systemic changes. The climate crisis is not just an environmental issue; it’s a health crisis that impacts young people profoundly. Yet, youth voices are often absent from the conversations that could make a real difference. We strongly believe that young perspectives must be front and centre in the fight against climate change and highlight the importance of transparent intergenerational collaboration, creating a space where climate, health, and youth empowerment intersect for change. Our vision calls for actionable commitments from decision-makers to integrate health into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), prioritize health equity, and integrate climate adaptation strategies into public health frameworks. We ultimately envision diligent efforts towards phasing out fossil fuels and taking necessary steps to ensure a sustainable future for all.</p><p> </p>",

    "content_html": "<p>More than 100 governments today made historic commitments to end childhood violence, including nine pledging to ban corporal punishment – an issue that affects 3 out of every 5 children regularly in their homes. These commitments were made at <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://endviolenceagainstchildrenconference.org/\">a landmark event</a> in Bogotá, Colombia, where government delegations are set to agree on a new global declaration aimed at protecting children from all kinds of violence, exploitation and abuse.</p><p>Also at the event, which is hosted by the Governments of Colombia and Sweden together with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, several countries committed to improve services for childhood violence survivors or tackle bullying, while others said they would invest in critical parenting support – one of the most effective interventions for reducing violence risks in the home.</p><p>“Despite being highly preventable, violence remains a horrific day to day reality for millions of children around the world – leaving scars that span generations,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.  “Today countries made critical pledges that, once enacted, could finally turn the tide on childhood violence. From establishing lifechanging support for families to making schools safer places or tackling online abuse, these actions will be fundamental to protecting children from lasting harm and ill health.”</p><p>Over half of all children globally – some 1 billion – are estimated to suffer some form of violence, such as child maltreatment (including corporal punishment, the most prevalent form of childhood violence), bullying, physical or emotional abuse, as well as sexual violence.  Violence against children is often hidden, mostly occurs behind closed doors, and is vastly underreported. WHO estimates that fewer than half of affected children tell anyone they experienced violence and under 10% receive any help.</p><p>Such violence not only constitutes a grave violation of children’s rights but also increases the risk of immediate and long-term health issues. For some children, violence results in death or serious injury. Every 13 minutes, a child or adolescent dies as a result of homicide – equating to around 40 000 preventable deaths each year. For others, experiencing violence has devastating and life-long consequences. These include anxiety and depression, risky behaviours like unsafe sex, smoking and substance abuse, and reduced academic achievement.</p><p>Evidence shows that violence against children is preventable, with the health sector having a critical role to play. Proven solutions include parenting support to help caregivers avoid violent discipline and build positive relationships with their children; school-based interventions to strengthen life and social skills for children and adolescents, and prevent bullying; child-friendly social and health services for children that experience violence; laws that prohibit violence against children and reduce underlying risk factors such as access to alcohol and guns, and efforts to ensure safer internet use for children. Research has shown that when countries effectively implement such strategies, they can reduce violence against children by as much as 20-50%.</p><p>In line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the first global targets for ending violence against children were established in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Progress in reducing overall prevalence of childhood violence has however been slow, despite gains in some individual countries. Around 9 in 10 children still live in countries where prevalent forms of childhood violence such as corporal punishment, or even sexual abuse and exploitation, are not yet prohibited by law.</p><p>Over 1000 people are attending this first-ever Ministerial Conference on Violence against Children, including high-level government delegations, children, young people, survivor and civil society allies.<br/></p><p>Specific pledges at the event include among others, commitments to end physical punishment, to introduce new digital safety initiatives, increase the legally permitted age of marriage and to invest in parenting education and child protection. WHO provides significant support for efforts to end childhood violence, through technical guidance, guiding effective strategies for prevention and response, and conducting new research and data, including its global status reports.<strong> </strong></p><h3>Key statistics</h3><ul><li>Over half of all children aged 2-17 – more than 1 billion – experience some form of violence each year.</li><li>Around 3 in 5 children are regularly punished by physical means in their homes.</li><li>1 in 5 girls and 1 in 7 boys experience sexual violence.</li><li>Between 25% and 50% children are estimated to have experienced bullying.</li><li>For adolescent males, violence – often involving firearms or other weapons - is now the leading cause of death. <br/></li></ul><h3>Notable pledges<br/></h3><ul><li>Eight countries pledged to pursue legislation against corporal punishment in all settings  – Burundi, Czechia, Gambia, Kyrgyzstan, Panama, Sri Lanka, Uganda and Tajikistan – and Nigeria in schools.</li><li>Dozens of countries committed to invest in parenting support.</li><li>The Government of the United Kingdom along with other partners committed to launch a Global Taskforce on ending violence in and through schools.</li><li>Tanzania committed to introduce Child Protection Desks in all 25 000 schools.</li><li>Spain committed to pursue a new digital law to promote digital safety.</li><li>Solomon Islands pledged to raise the age of marriage from 15 to 18 – noting that early marriage is a significant risk factor for violence against adolescent girls.</li><li>Many countries made commitments to strengthen national policies and/or develop specific plans to tackle violence against children.<br/></li></ul><p><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://endviolenceagainstchildrenconference.org/pledges/\">All pledges</a> </p><p> </p>",

The WHO study is the first global effort to systematically prioritize endemic pathogens based on criteria that included regional disease burden, antimicrobial resistance risk and socioeconomic impact. </p><p>The study reconfirms longstanding priorities for vaccine research and development (R&amp;D), including for HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis – three diseases that collectively take nearly 2.5 million lives each year. </p><p>The study also identifies pathogens such as Group A streptococcus and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> as top disease control priorities in all regions, highlighting the urgency to develop new vaccines for pathogens increasingly resistant to antimicrobials.</p><p>“Too often global decisions on new vaccines have been solely driven by return on investment, rather than by the number of lives that could be saved in the most vulnerable communities,” said Dr Kate O’Brien, Director of the Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals Department at WHO. “This study uses broad regional expertise and data to assess vaccines that would not only significantly reduce diseases that greatly impact communities today but also reduce the medical costs that families and health systems face.” </p><p>WHO asked international and regional experts to identify factors that are most important to them when deciding which vaccines to introduce and use. The analysis of those preferences, combined with regional data for each pathogen, resulted in top 10 priority pathogens for each WHO region. The regional lists where then consolidated to form the global list, resulting in 17 priority endemic pathogens for which new vaccines need to be researched, developed and used.</p><p>This new WHO global priority list of endemic pathogens for vaccine R&amp;D supports the Immunization Agenda 2030’s goal of ensuring that everyone, in all regions, can benefit from vaccines that protect them from serious diseases. The list provides an equitable and transparent evidence base to set regional and global agendas for new vaccine R&amp;D and manufacturing, and is intended to give academics, funders, manufacturers and countries a clear direction for where vaccine R&amp;D could have the most impact. </p><p>This global prioritization exercise for endemic pathogens, complements the <a href=\"/teams/blueprint/who-r-and-d-blueprint-for-epidemics\"></a><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/blueprint/who-r-and-d-blueprint-for-epidemics\">WHO R&amp;D blueprint for epidemics</a>, which identified priority pathogens that could cause future epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). </p><p>The findings of this new report on endemic pathogens are part of WHO’s work to identify and support the research priorities and needs of immunization programmes in low- and middle-income countries, to inform the global vaccine R&amp;D agenda, and to strategically advance development and uptake of priority vaccines, particularly against pathogens that cause the largest public health burden and greatest socioeconomic impact.  </p><h2>WHO Priority endemic pathogens list</h2><p>Vaccines for these pathogens are at different stages of development.</p><p><strong>Pathogens where vaccine research is needed</strong></p><ul><li>Group A streptococcus</li><li>Hepatitis C virus</li><li>HIV-1</li><li><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em></li></ul><p><strong> Pathogens where vaccines need to be further developed</strong></p><ul><li>Cytomegalovirus</li><li>Influenza virus (broadly protective vaccine)</li><li><em>Leishmania</em> species</li><li>Non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella</em></li><li><em>Norovirus</em></li><li><em>Plasmodium falciparum </em>(malaria)<em></em></li><li><em>Shigella </em>species<em></em></li><li><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></li></ul><p><strong>Pathogens where vaccines are approaching regulatory approval, policy recommendation or introduction</strong></p><ul><li>Dengue virus</li><li>Group B streptococcus</li><li>Extra-intestinal pathogenic <em>E. coli</em></li><li><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em></li><li>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</li></ul>",

          "Humanitarian relief must be facilitated, and we urge all parties to provide unimpeded access to affected people. Additionally, commercial goods must be allowed to enter Gaza.",

WHO’s EUL is based on the review of quality, safety and performance data in compliance with international standards while addressing the specific needs of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p><p>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing, which detects viral DNA, is considered the gold standard for diagnosing mpox infection.</p><p>WHO listed the Xpert Mpox, a real-time PCR test manufactured by Cepheid under its EUL procedure, on 25 October. This test is designed for use on compatible GeneXpert systems. The Xpert Mpox test is easy to operate and delivers results in under 40 minutes. Once the cartridge is placed in the system, the process is fully automated, with real-time PCR detecting viral DNA of monkeypox virus clade II. The GeneXpert system is a near-point-of-care testing option, which can support decentralized testing.</p><p>Another PCR-based option, <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://extranet.who.int/prequal/news/second-mpox-ivd-listed-under-who-emergency-use-listing-procedure\">the cobas MPXV assay, developed by Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., was listed on 14 October 2024</a>. It is intended for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems. This tool is a real-time PCR test capable of detecting both mpox clades and delivering results in under 2 hours. It can process multiple samples simultaneously and is suitable for clinical laboratories that handle large volumes of tests.</p><p>“Ensuring global access to mpox diagnostic tests that meet WHO standards for quality, safety and performance is essential for efficient and effective testing in settings affected by mpox outbreaks,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, WHO Director for Regulation and Prequalification. “Rapid access to those listed products is critical not only for prompt diagnosis and timely treatment but also for effectively containing the spread of the virus.\"</p><p>WHO previously listed <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://extranet.who.int/prequal/sites/default/files/document_files/eul-mpxv_list-of-mpxv-ivds.pdf\">Alinity m MPXV assay, manufactured by Abbott Molecular Inc.</a> under EUL on 3 October. </p><p>In 2024, 19 countries in Africa have reported over 40 000 suspected mpox cases with most remaining unconfirmed due to limited testing capacity, especially in LMICs. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo—the hardest-hit country—testing has significantly increased in 2024, following efforts to decentralize testing with support from WHO and partners. However, the proportion of tested cases remains low, accounting for 40-50% of the suspected cases.</p><p>WHO is working with manufacturers of the EUL-listed products and national regulatory authorities in affected countries to facilitate domestic registration or emergency listing. Fast-tracking approvals and applying reliance principles will enhance access to quality-assured mpox tests.</p><p>Overall, WHO has received over 60 expressions of interest for the EUL review of mpox diagnostic tests.

It assists decision-making for procurement by UN, partner agencies and Member States at international, regional and national levels. Under EUL, the manufacturers must commit to continue generating any missing information in order to fulfil prequalification requirements. Once this information is available, a prequalification application should be submitted to complete the full process for achieving a recommendation for international procurement in both emergency and non-emergency settings.</p><h3><strong>Note to editors</strong></h3><p>On 31 October 2024, a correction was made to the first sentence of the seventh paragraph of this news release as noted below.</p><p>The sentence in the original news release read:</p><p>In 2024, 18 countries have reported over 40 000 suspected mpox cases with most remaining unconfirmed due to limited testing capacity, especially in LMICs. </p><p>This was changed to: </p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">In 2024, 19 countries in Africa have reported over 40 000 suspected mpox cases with most remaining unconfirmed due to limited testing capacity, especially in LMICs. </span></p><p></p>",

    "lead": "The World Health Organization (WHO) today published a new report on tuberculosis revealing that approximately 8.2 million people were newly diagnosed with TB in 2023 – the highest number recorded since WHO began global TB monitoring in 1995. This represents a notable increase from 7.5 million reported in 2022, placing TB again as the leading infectious disease killer in 2023, surpassing COVID-19.WHO’sGlobal Tuberculosis Report 2024highlights mixed progress in the global fight against TB, with persistent challenges such as significant underfunding. While the number of TB-related deaths decreased from 1.32 million in 2022 to 1.25 million in 2023, the total number of people falling ill with TB rose slightly to an estimated 10.8 million in 2023.With the disease disproportionately affecting people in 30 high-burden countries, India (26%), Indonesia (10%), China (6.8%), the Philippines (6.8%) and Pakistan (6.3%) together accounted for 56% of the global TB burden. According to the report, 55% of people who developed TB were men, 33% were women and 12% were children and young adolescents.“The fact that TB still kills and sickens so many people is an outrage, when we have the tools to prevent it, detect it and treat it,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “WHO urges all countries to make good on the concrete commitments they have made to expand the use of those tools, and to end TB.”In 2023, the gap between the estimated number of new TB cases and those reported narrowed to about 2.7 million, down from COVID-19 pandemic levels of around 4 million in 2020 and 2021. This follows substantial national and global efforts to recover from COVID-related disruptions to TB services. The coverage of TB preventive treatment has been sustained for people living with HIV and continues to improve for household contacts of people diagnosed with TB.However, multidrug-resistant TB remains a public health crisis. Treatment success rates for multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB) have now reached 68%. But, of the 400 000 people estimated to have developed MDR/RR-TB, only 44% were diagnosed and treated in 2023.Funding gaps and challengesGlobal funding for TB prevention and care decreased further in 2023 and remains far below target. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which bear 98% of the TB burden, faced significant funding shortages. Only US$ 5.7 billion of the US$ 22 billion annual funding target was available in 2023, equivalent to only 26% of the global target.The total amount of international donor funding in LMICs has remained at around US$1.1 – 1.2 billion per year for several years. The United States government remains the largest bilateral donor for TB. The While Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global Fund) is the top contribution to international funder of the TB response, especially in LMICs. is important, it remains However, resources remain insufficient to cover essential TB service needs. The report emphasizes that sustained financial investment is crucial for the success of TB prevention, diagnosis, and treatment efforts.Globally, TB research remains severely underfunded with only one-fifth of the US$ 5 billion annual target reached in 2022. This impedes the development of new TB diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines. WHO continues leading efforts to advance the TB vaccine agenda, including with the support of the TB Vaccine Accelerator Council launched by the WHO Director-General.Complex drivers of the epidemicFor the first time, the report provides estimates on the percentage of TB-affected households that face catastrophic costs (exceeding 20% of annual household income) to access TB diagnosis and treatment in all LMICs. These indicate that half of TB-affected households face such catastrophic costs.A significant number of new TB cases are driven by 5 major risk factors: undernutrition, HIV infection, alcohol use disorders, smoking (especially among men), and diabetes. Tackling these issues, along with critical determinants like poverty and GDP per capita, requires coordinated multisectoral action.“We are confronted with a multitude of formidable challenges: funding shortfalls and catastrophic financial burden on those affected, climate change, conflict, migration and displacement, pandemics, and drug-resistant tuberculosis, a significant driver of antimicrobial resistance,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Global Tuberculosis Programme. “It is imperative that we unite across all sectors and stakeholders, to confront these pressing issues and ramp up our efforts.”Global milestones and targets for reducing the TB disease burden are off-track, and considerable progress is needed to reach other targets set for 2027 ahead of the second UN High-Level Meeting. WHO calls on governments, global partners, and donors to urgently translate the commitments made during the 2023 UN High-Level Meeting on TB into tangible actions. Increased funding for research, particularly for new TB vaccines, is essential to accelerate progress and achieve the global targets set for 2027.Note to editorsOn 31 October 2024, a correction was made to this news release as noted below.The sentence in the original news release read:The total amount of international donor funding in LMICs has remained at around US$ 1.1–1.2 billion per year for several years.

Over 250 000 pilgrims from 3 countries, Indonesia, Malaysia and Oman, were issued Hajj health cards in 2024, as part of the pilot collaboration between WHO and Saudi Arabia. This test-phase demonstrated that each country was able to use global standards to issue their own national versions of the card, enhancing the pilgrims’ safety and quality of care while undertaking the Hajj.</p><p>WHO and Saudi Arabia agreed to further collaborate to improve and expand upon the successful pilot programme for the Hajj health card. The expertise and support from the Saudi government and their digital implementing partner LEAN, will enable increased data security and essential technical support to additional countries joining the Hajj health card programme. </p><p>“This exciting partnership between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the World Health Organization to expand the Hajj health card initiative enhances the safety and well-being of millions of pilgrims,” said Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO). “By leveraging digital health solutions, we strengthen quality of care, and help strengthen health systems in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and around the world.\"</p><h2>Eighty countries joined the WHO’s digital health certification network</h2><h2></h2><p>WHO launched the Global Digital Health Certification Network (GDHCN) in 2023 building on a successful collaboration with the European Union and other partnering countries to support COVID-19 vaccination certificates.

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has certified Egypt as malaria-free, marking a significant public health milestone for a country with more than 100 million inhabitants. The achievement follows a nearly 100-year effort by the Egyptian government and people to end a disease that has been present in the country since ancient times. </p><p>“Malaria is as old as Egyptian civilization itself, but the disease that plagued pharaohs now belongs to its history and not its future,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This certification of Egypt as malaria-free is truly historic, and a testament to the commitment of the people and government of Egypt to rid themselves of this ancient scourge. I congratulate Egypt on this achievement, which is an inspiration to other countries in the region, and shows what’s possible with the right resources and the right tools.”</p><p>Egypt is the third country to be awarded a malaria-free certification in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region following the United Arab Emirates and Morocco, and the first since 2010. Globally, a total of 44 countries and 1 territory have reached this milestone.</p><p>“Receiving the malaria elimination certificate today is not the end of the journey but the beginning of a new phase. We must now work tirelessly and vigilantly to sustain our achievement through maintaining the highest standards for surveillance, diagnosis and treatment, integrated vector management and sustaining our effective and rapid response to imported cases. Our continued multisectoral efforts will be critical to preserving Egypt's malaria-free status,” said H.E. Dr Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, Deputy Prime Minister of Egypt.</p><p>\"I reaffirm that we will continue with determination and strong will to safeguard the health of all people in Egypt under the wise leadership's guidance and proceed with enhancing our healthcare system, this will remain a cornerstone in protecting the lives of all people living in and visiting Egypt.”</p><p>Certification of malaria elimination is granted by WHO when a country has proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the chain of indigenous malaria transmission by <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes has been interrupted nationwide for at least the previous three consecutive years. A country must also demonstrate the capacity to prevent the re-establishment of transmission.</p><h2>Egypt’s journey to elimination</h2><p>Malaria has been traced as far back as 4000 B.C.E. in Egypt, with genetic evidence of the disease found in Tutankhamun and other ancient Egyptian mummies.</p><p>Early efforts to reduce human-mosquito contact in Egypt began in the 1920s when the country prohibited the cultivation of rice and agricultural crops near homes. With most of Egypt’s population living along the banks of the Nile River and malaria prevalence as high as 40%, the country designated malaria a notifiable disease in 1930 and later opened its first malaria control station focused on diagnosis, treatment and surveillance. </p><p>“Today, Egypt has proven that with vision, dedication, and unity we can overcome the greatest challenges. This success in eliminating malaria is not just a victory for public health but a sign of hope for the entire world, especially for other endemic countries in our region. This achievement is the result of sustained, robust surveillance investments in a strong, integrated health system, where community engagement and partnerships have enabled progress. Furthermore, collaboration and support to endemic countries, such as Sudan, remain a priority,” said Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean.</p><p>By 1942, malaria cases in Egypt had spiked to more than 3 million as a result of the Second World War population displacement, the disruption of medical supplies and services, and the invasion of <em>Anopheles arabiensis,</em> a highly efficient mosquito vector, among other factors. Egypt succeeded in controlling the malaria outbreak through the establishment of 16 treatment divisions and the recruitment of more than 4000 health workers.</p><p>The construction of the Aswan Dam, completed in 1969, created a new malaria risk for the country, as standing water produced breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Egypt, in collaboration with Sudan, launched a rigorous vector control and public health surveillance project to rapidly detect and respond to malaria outbreaks. </p><p>By 2001, malaria was firmly under control and the Ministry of Health and Population set its sights on preventing the re-establishment of local malaria transmission.

          "Malaria has been traced as far back as 4000 B.C.E. in Egypt, with genetic evidence of the disease found in Tutankhamun and other ancient Egyptian mummies.",
          "Early efforts to reduce human-mosquito contact in Egypt began in the 1920s when the country prohibited the cultivation of rice and agricultural crops near homes. With most of Egypt’s population living along the banks of the Nile River and malaria prevalence as high as 40%, the country designated malaria a notifiable disease in 1930 and later opened its first malaria control station focused on diagnosis, treatment and surveillance.",
          "“Today, Egypt has proven that with vision, dedication, and unity we can overcome the greatest challenges. This success in eliminating malaria is not just a victory for public health but a sign of hope for the entire world, especially for other endemic countries in our region. This achievement is the result of sustained, robust surveillance investments in a strong, integrated health system, where community engagement and partnerships have enabled progress. Furthermore, collaboration and support to endemic countries, such as Sudan, remain a priority,” said Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean.",
          "By 1942, malaria cases in Egypt had spiked to more than 3 million as a result of the Second World War population displacement, the disruption of medical supplies and services, and the invasion of Anopheles arabiensis, a highly efficient mosquito vector, among other factors. Egypt succeeded in controlling the malaria outbreak through the establishment of 16 treatment divisions and the recruitment of more than 4000 health workers.",
          "The construction of the Aswan Dam, completed in 1969, created a new malaria risk for the country, as standing water produced breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Egypt, in collaboration with Sudan, launched a rigorous vector control and public health surveillance project to rapidly detect and respond to malaria outbreaks.",
          "By 2001, malaria was firmly under control and the Ministry of Health and Population set its sights on preventing the re-establishment of local malaria transmission. Egypt rapidly contained a small outbreak of malaria cases in the Aswan Governorate in 2014 through early case identification, prompt treatment, vector control and public education.",
          "Malaria diagnosis and treatment are provided free-of-charge to the entire population in Egypt regardless of legal status, and health professionals are trained nationwide to detect and screen for malaria cases including at borders. Egypt’s strong cross-border partnership with neighbouring countries, including Sudan, has been instrumental for preventing the re-establishment of local malaria transmission, paving the way for the country to be officially certified as malaria-free."

          "Since the escalation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon on 17 September 2024, WHO has verified 23 attacks on health care in Lebanon that have led to 72 deaths and 43 injuries among health workers and patients. Fifteen incidents impacted health facilities, while 13 impacted health transport. Hospitals in Lebanon are already under massive strain as they strive to sustain essential health services while dealing with an unprecedented influx of injured people. Understaffed and under-resourced, the health system has been struggling to maintain uninterrupted services to all those in need with supplies being depleted and health workers exhausted.",
          "Increasing conflict, intense bombardment and insecurity are forcing a growing number of health facilities to shut down, particularly in the south. Out of 207 primary health care centres and dispensaries in conflict-affected areas, 100 are now closed. Hospitals have had to close or evacuate due to structural damage or their proximity to areas of intense bombardment. As of today, 5 hospitals have been evacuated and another 5 partially evacuated, with critical cancer and dialysis patients referred to other hospitals also overwhelmed by increasing health needs. Dialysis centres are having to operate an extra three shifts to accommodate the referred patients while being under-resourced for essential blood testing supplies and personnel.",

    "content_html": "<p>The <a href=\"/initiatives/who-youth-engagement/who-youth-council\">WHO Youth Council</a> has launched its first <a href=\"/publications/m/item/youth-declaration-on-creating-healthy-societies\">Youth Declaration on Creating Healthy Societies</a>, with a range of calls to action informed and developed by young people from around the world and geared towards empowering youth to play a central role in creating healthier and safer societies for all.</p><p>\"The WHO Youth Council is proud to be issuing its first Youth Declaration on Creating Healthy Societies,\" said Kate Ndocko, WHO Youth Council member. \"This Declaration represents our collective commitment and priorities to help communities, especially youth, at local, regional and global levels, to be healthier and more resilient in the face of the many health challenges the world faces today as well as the ones ahead.\"</p><p>The Declaration was launched today during the <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.worldhealthsummit.org/summit.html\">World Health Summit</a> taking place in Berlin. It outlines 10 calls for action that place youth at the centre of co-creating healthier societies globally, and explaining what is needed for this to succeed. The calls to action ensure:</p><ul><li>Access, equity and inclusion for youth in education by removing barriers and designed to reflect diverse healthcare needs for individuals and communities.</li><li>Comprehensive national curricula on health, climate change and digital literacy.</li><li>Quality and adaptive education through flexible and responsive learning environments.</li><li>Youth engagement and leadership in the design and implementation of health policies and programmes.</li><li>Inclusive, accessible and prevention-focused healthcare, including for young people from marginalized and vulnerable groups.</li><li>Investment in young people to empower them to become leaders and drive solutions in the areas of health, climate change and education.</li><li>Brave spaces for healthy environments are created that protect young people from social and institutional barriers, and keep them safe from violence, harassment and other harmful practices.</li><li>Inclusion of young people by governments, international and civil society organizations to co-create policies on priority health needs.</li><li>Valuing the experiences of young people, including their diversity and views, in the development and implementation of health polices.</li><li>Greater support for grassroots youth organizations as a means to investing in future generations.</li></ul><p>“WHO is committed to amplifying the voices of young people to realise our shared vision of health for all,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “The Youth Declaration on Creating Healthy Societies, issued by the WHO Youth Council, does just that, channelling the ideas, advice and action of youth into a powerful call for change, and showing what can be achieved when youth are actively engaged in shaping their health and futures.”</p><p>Rehman Hassan, a WHO Youth Council Member from the Act4Food campaign of the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), said: “We can no longer afford to squander the advice, skills, and energy of young people in transforming our communities, policies and the planet at large. Pandemics and epidemics, conflicts, the spread of misinformation, and the health risk posed by climate change, amongst other issues, are threatening the health and well-being of billions of people. Young people are the most underrepresented group in governance, yet half of the world’s population is aged under 30. It is high time we engage them and incorporate their solutions for a healthier way forward. The Youth Council and its constituent organizations, working with WHO, is committed to charting this healthier course for the present and future.”</p><p>The WHO Youth Council was established in 2023 and is a dynamic network aimed at amplifying the voices and experiences of young people and leveraging their expertise, energy, and ideas to promote public health. The Youth Council’s members are youth representatives of health and non-health organizations and movements. They advise and actively engage with the WHO Director-General and WHO senior leadership on ensuring health policies and programmes reflect the expertise, innovation and needs of young people around the world. The WHO Youth Council also serves as a platform for designing and incubating new initiatives and for expanding existing youth engagement initiatives of WHO. </p><h3>Editor’s notes</h3><p>The following organizations are represented on the WHO Youth Council: Act4Food, a campaign of the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN); Africa Public Health Students Network Initiative (AfricaPHSN); Climate Cardinals; Commonwealth Youth Health Network (CYHN) - Commonwealth Secretariat; Digital Transformations for Health Lab (DTH-Lab); European Network of Medical Residents in Public Health (EuroNet MRPH); Grassroot Soccer; Healthy Caribbean Coalition/Healthy Caribbean Youth; Innovation for Health Equity in Africa; International Federation of Medical Students' Association (IFMSA); International Pharmaceutical Students' Federation (IPSF); International Student One Health Alliance (ISOHA); International Student Surgical Network (InciSioN); International Youth Alliance for Family Planning; International Youth Health Organization; Orygen; The International LGBTQI Youth &amp; Student Organisation (IGLYO); UN Major Group for Children and Youth (MGCY); Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM); World Medical Association Junior Doctors Network (WMA JDN); World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM); Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network; Young Professionals in Foreign Policy (YPFP); Youth Alliance (a branch from the Healthy Latin America Coalition -CLAS-); and Youth and Environment Europe.</p><p>While in Berlin, the WHO Youth Council held an intensive three-day event, facilitated and supported by the <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/home\">Bertelsmann Stiftung</a>, to generate ideas for collaboration, action and future work.

    "content_html": "<p>A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) finds that vaccines against 23 pathogens (excluding gonorrhea) could reduce the number of antibiotics needed by 22% or 2.5 billion defined daily doses globally every year, supporting worldwide efforts to address antimicrobial resistance (AMR). While some of these vaccines are already available but underused, others would need to be developed and brought to the market as soon as possible.</p><p>AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines, making people sicker and increasing the risk of illness, death and the spread of infections that are difficult to treat. AMR is driven largely by the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials, yet, at the same time, many people around the world do not have access to essential antimicrobials. Each year, nearly 5 million deaths are associated with AMR globally.</p><p>Vaccines are an essential part of the response to reduce AMR as they prevent infections, reduce the use and overuse of antimicrobials, and slow the emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens.</p><p>The new report expands on a <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://gh.bmj.com/content/8/7/e011341\">WHO study</a> published in BMJ Global Health last year. It estimates that vaccines already in use against pneumococcus pneumonia, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type B (Hib, a bacteria causing pneumonia and meningitis) and typhoid could avert up to 106 000 of the deaths associated with AMR each year. An additional 543 000 deaths associated with AMR could be averted annually when new vaccines for tuberculosis (TB) and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae,</em> are developed and rolled out globally. While new TB vaccines are in clinical trials, one against <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>is in early stage of development.</p><p>“Addressing antimicrobial resistance starts with preventing infections, and vaccines are among the most powerful tools for doing that,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Prevention is better than cure, and increasing access to existing vaccines and developing new ones for critical diseases, like tuberculosis, is critical to saving lives and turning the tide on AMR.” </p><h3>Vaccines are key to preventing infection</h3><p>Vaccinated people have fewer infections and are protected against potential complications from secondary infections that may need antimicrobial medicines or require admission to hospital. The report analyzed the impact of already licensed vaccines as well as vaccines in various stages of development.</p><p>Every year, vaccines against:</p><ul><li><em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>could save 33 million antibiotic doses, if the Immunization Agenda 2030 target of 90% of the world’s children were vaccinated, as well as older adults;</li><li>Typhoid could save 45 million antibiotic doses, if their introduction was accelerated in high-burden countries;</li><li>Malaria caused by <em>Plasmodium falciparum </em>could save<em> </em>up to 25 million antibiotic doses, which are often misused to try to treat malaria;</li><li>TB could have the highest impact once they are developed, saving between 1.2 to 1.9 billion antibiotic doses – a significant portion of the 11.3 billion doses used annually against the diseases covered in this report.</li></ul><h3>Vaccines could significantly reduce the substantial economic costs of AMR</h3><p>Globally, the hospital costs of treating resistant pathogens evaluated in the report are estimated at US$ 730 billion each year. If vaccines could be rolled out against all the evaluated pathogens, they could save a third of the hospital costs associated with AMR.</p><p><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" name=\"_Hlk178935945\">A comprehensive, </a><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240082496\">people-centred</a> approach applied across health systems is needed to prevent, diagnose and treat infections. This approach recognizes vaccination as core to preventing AMR and especially impactful when combined with other interventions.</p><p>At the 79th United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting on AMR on 26 September, world leaders approved a <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/26-09-2024-world-leaders-commit-to-decisive-action-on-antimicrobial-resistance\">political declaration</a> committing to a clear set of targets and actions, including reducing the estimated 4.95 million human deaths associated with bacterial AMR annually by 10% by 2030.

Based on these evaluations, WHO advises vaccine manufacturers and regulatory authorities on the implications for future updates to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition.

These meetings are timed to balance the availability of the latest epidemiological, immunological, and virological data, with the kinetics of vaccine-induced protection and the lead time manufacturers need to update the antigen composition of authorized COVID-19 vaccines. </p><p>The purpose of this statement is to guide the scientific community and vaccine manufacturers as to which data should be generated ahead of the December 2024 TAG-CO-VAC deliberations. </p><p>To inform decisions on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition,<sup>1-4</sup> the TAG-CO-VAC reviews data (see Table) on the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the antigenic characteristics of previously and currently circulating variants. This includes the analysis of naïve animal antisera in one-way and two-way neutralization tests, as well as immunogenicity data that assess the breadth and durability of immune responses, including neutralizing antibody responses, using sera from sequentially immunized or infected animals and pre-and post-vaccination human sera. The TAG-CO-VAC also considers vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates of currently approved COVID-19 vaccines, particularly those that control for time since vaccination and that provide variant-specific estimates across different vaccine platforms. Further examples of published data reviewed by TAG-CO-VAC and used to inform decisions on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition can be found in the annexes accompanying each statement.<sup>1-4</sup></p><p>In addition, the TAG-CO-VAC reviews available data from vaccine manufacturers, including animal and/or human studies demonstrating the breadth and durability of immune responses elicited by currently authorized vaccines, as well as any vaccine candidates in development. Vaccine manufacturers are also asked to provide observational epidemiological data that demonstrate the efficacy or effectiveness of their authorized COVID-19 vaccines, as well as any vaccine candidates in development. </p><p>At this stage, the key antisera and antigens of interest for the December 2024 decision-making meeting for demonstrating breadth include antisera to: BA.2 (<em>other historical reference viruses – e.g., index, Alpha, BA.1 – are also useful for determining antigenic relationships</em>), XBB.1.5, JN.1, KP.2, KP.3.1.1 and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Antisera of interest are animal sera after single or sequential exposure and human sera after boost with monovalent JN.1, KP.2 or XBB.1.5, vaccines. Both pre- and post-vaccination sera should be included and for all antisera, neutralizing antibody titers should be analyzed against at least one variant that emerged after the vaccine antigen, where feasible. Analysis of this antisera against the same panel of virus antigens as well as other new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants will provide insight into antigenic characteristics of previous and emerging variants. Emerging variants include the list of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest (VOI) and Variants Under Monitoring (VUM) maintained on the WHO <a href=\"/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>. Relative VE estimates should be calculated during periods of circulation of XBB, JN.1, KP.3.1.1 or other emerging variant(s) in human populations across age groups with separate VE estimates for each of the following vaccine antigen compositions: monovalent JN.1, monovalent KP.2 or monovalent XBB.1.5.</p><p>In preparation for the December 2024 meeting, the TAG-CO-VAC encourages the scientific community and vaccine manufacturers to prioritize generating and sharing the data outlined here to ensure evidence-informed deliberations on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition; please contact the TAG-CO-VAC Secretariat: [<a href=\"mailto:tagcovac@who.int\" target=\"_blank\">tagcovac@who.int</a>]. </p><p> </p><table cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-width:1px;border-style:solid;border-color:#bcb4b4;width:844px;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:28.2947%;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;border-color:#aea9a9;\" width=\"217\"><p><strong>Type of data</strong></p></td><td style=\"width:71.7054%;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;border-color:#aea9a9;\" width=\"384\"><p><strong>Comments</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:28.2947%;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;border-color:#aea9a9;\" width=\"217\"><p>SARS-CoV-2 genetic evolution</p></td><td style=\"width:71.7054%;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;border-color:#aea9a9;\" width=\"384\"><p>Key variants include the list of Variants of Interest (VOI) and Variants Under Monitoring (VUM).

This is another example of the incredible progress we have made against neglected tropical diseases and gives hope to many other nations still fighting against lymphatic filariasis that they too can eliminate this disease.”</p><p>Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a debilitating parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes. For centuries, this disease has afflicted millions worldwide, causing pain, chronic, severe swelling, serious disability, and social stigmatization. </p><h2>Effective country-level investments</h2><p>Over the past few decades, Brazil has implemented integrated actions to eliminate lymphatic filariasis, including the development of a national plan to fight this disease in 1997, the mass distribution of antiparasitic drugs, vector control activities, and strong surveillance, particularly in the most affected areas. With these efforts, the country achieved the end of disease transmission in 2017. </p><p>The elimination of lymphatic filariasis was also one of the goals of the <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.paho.org/pt/noticias/7-2-2024-em-evento-com-diretores-da-opas-e-da-oms-brasil-lanca-programa-para-eliminacao\">Brasil Saudável program</a>, a multisectoral initiative aimed at ending socially determined diseases with a whole-of-government approach and civil society participation, including the involvement of affected people in the implementation of disease control efforts. The programme was launched in February 2024 by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in a ceremony with the participation of Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General and Dr Jarbas Barbosa, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and WHO Regional Director for the Americas. In the post-elimination phase, Brazil, PAHO, and WHO will continue to closely monitor for possible resurgence of infections. </p><p>“This milestone is the result of years of dedication, hard work, and collaboration among health workers, researchers, and authorities in Brazil”, said Dr Jarbas Barbosa, PAHO Director and WHO Regional Director for the Americas. “Brazil’s extensive and unified health system, coupled with solid specialized laboratory expertise and robust surveillance were essential to interrupt the chain of transmission, inspiring other countries to advance towards the elimination of lymphatic filariasis and other neglected tropical diseases”.<strong></strong></p><h2>Global progress</h2><p>Globally, Brazil joins 19 other countries and territories that have been validated by WHO for having eliminated lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. These are Malawi and Togo in the African Region; Egypt and Yemen in the Eastern Mediterranean Region; Bangladesh, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand in the South-East Asia Region; and Cambodia, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Marshall Islands, Niue, Palau, Tonga, Vanuatu, Viet Nam and Wallis and Futuna in the Western Pacific Region.</p><p>In the Americas, three endemic countries (Dominican Republic, Guyana, and Haiti) still require mass drug administration to stop transmission and are working to achieve the elimination target.</p><p>In addition to being the 20<sup>th</sup> country to be validated for elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem, Brazil has also become the 53<sup>rd</sup> country to have eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease, globally.<strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"><em></em></strong></p><p><strong>Note to the editor</strong></p><p>Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a neglected tropical disease. Infection occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. Infection is usually acquired in childhood and causes hidden damage to the lymphatic system. </p><p>The painful and profoundly disfiguring visible manifestations of the disease – lymphoedema, elephantiasis and scrotal swelling – occur later in life and can lead to permanent disability. These patients are not only physically disabled, but suffer mental, social and financial losses contributing to stigma and poverty.</p><p>Elimination of lymphatic filariasis is possible by stopping the spread of the infection through preventive chemotherapy. The WHO-recommended preventive chemotherapy strategy for lymphatic filariasis elimination is mass drug administration (MDA). MDA involves administering an annual dose of medicines to the entire at-risk population. The medicines used have a limited effect on adult parasites but effectively reduce the density of microfilariae in the bloodstream and prevent the spread of parasites to mosquitoes. </p><p>In 2023, 657 million people in 39 countries and territories were living in areas that require preventive chemotherapy to stop the spread of infection. In the Americas, Costa Rica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago were removed from the WHO list of lymphatic filariasis endemic countries in 2011.

          "Over the past few decades, Brazil has implemented integrated actions to eliminate lymphatic filariasis, including the development of a national plan to fight this disease in 1997, the mass distribution of antiparasitic drugs, vector control activities, and strong surveillance, particularly in the most affected areas. With these efforts, the country achieved the end of disease transmission in 2017.",
          "The elimination of lymphatic filariasis was also one of the goals of the Brasil Saudável program , a multisectoral initiative aimed at ending socially determined diseases with a whole-of-government approach and civil society participation, including the involvement of affected people in the implementation of disease control efforts. The programme was launched in February 2024 by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in a ceremony with the participation of Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General and Dr Jarbas Barbosa, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and WHO Regional Director for the Americas. In the post-elimination phase, Brazil, PAHO, and WHO will continue to closely monitor for possible resurgence of infections.",
          "“This milestone is the result of years of dedication, hard work, and collaboration among health workers, researchers, and authorities in Brazil”, said Dr Jarbas Barbosa, PAHO Director and WHO Regional Director for the Americas. “Brazil’s extensive and unified health system, coupled with solid specialized laboratory expertise and robust surveillance were essential to interrupt the chain of transmission, inspiring other countries to advance towards the elimination of lymphatic filariasis and other neglected tropical diseases”."

          "Globally, Brazil joins 19 other countries and territories that have been validated by WHO for having eliminated lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. These are Malawi and Togo in the African Region; Egypt and Yemen in the Eastern Mediterranean Region; Bangladesh, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand in the South-East Asia Region; and Cambodia, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Marshall Islands, Niue, Palau, Tonga, Vanuatu, Viet Nam and Wallis and Futuna in the Western Pacific Region.",
          "In the Americas, three endemic countries (Dominican Republic, Guyana, and Haiti) still require mass drug administration to stop transmission and are working to achieve the elimination target.",
          "In addition to being the 20 th country to be validated for elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem, Brazil has also become the 53 rd country to have eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease, globally.",
          "Note to the editor",
          "Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a neglected tropical disease. Infection occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. Infection is usually acquired in childhood and causes hidden damage to the lymphatic system.",
          "The painful and profoundly disfiguring visible manifestations of the disease – lymphoedema, elephantiasis and scrotal swelling – occur later in life and can lead to permanent disability. These patients are not only physically disabled, but suffer mental, social and financial losses contributing to stigma and poverty.",
          "Elimination of lymphatic filariasis is possible by stopping the spread of the infection through preventive chemotherapy. The WHO-recommended preventive chemotherapy strategy for lymphatic filariasis elimination is mass drug administration (MDA). MDA involves administering an annual dose of medicines to the entire at-risk population. The medicines used have a limited effect on adult parasites but effectively reduce the density of microfilariae in the bloodstream and prevent the spread of parasites to mosquitoes.",
          "In 2023, 657 million people in 39 countries and territories were living in areas that require preventive chemotherapy to stop the spread of infection. In the Americas, Costa Rica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago were removed from the WHO list of lymphatic filariasis endemic countries in 2011. The 2021–2030 neglected tropical disease road map targets the prevention, control, elimination and eradication of 20 diseases and disease groups by 2030. Progress against lymphatic filariasis and other neglected tropical diseases alleviates the human and economic burden that they impose on the world’s most disadvantaged communities."

This guidance aims to support stronger country-led research and development (R&amp;D) ecosystems to advance health science so that new, safe and effective health interventions can be made more accessible and affordable globally for people everywhere, faster. </p><p>For the first time, WHO offers recommendations for national health authorities, regulatory authorities, funders and others on how they can best facilitate clinical trials to generate evidence on health interventions. It addresses challenges such as poor trial design, limited diversity of participants, insufficient infrastructure and bureaucratic efficiencies, which cost time, money and lives.</p><p>Global divides between high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are leading to serious inequities in clinical trials. In 2022, there were 27 133 trials <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/monitoring/number-of-clinical-trials-by-year-country-who-region-and-income-group\">taking place</a> in the world’s 86 HICs compared to 24 791 in 131 LMICs. At times, LMICs have been targeted for inclusion in clinical trials due to their disease burdens, only for the resulting data to be used in getting health interventions authorized in HICs, but not in the LMICs. </p><p>“Strengthening country-led research and development and embedding clinical trials in routine clinical and public health services will ensure faster and more equitable access to safe and effective interventions, helping people become healthier,” said Dr Jeremy Farrar, WHO’s Chief Scientist. “This new guidance aims to improve the diversity of trial participants to ensure research benefits the broadest range of people possible, decisively moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach.” </p><p>According to <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/monitoring/number-of-trial-registrations-by-year-location-disease-and-phase-of-development\">2022 data</a>, less than 5% of clinical trials included pregnant women and only 13% included children. This has lowered the quality of evidence, affecting care and access to interventions. The absence of adequate testing in underrepresented populations can lead to a cautious approach in treating them, which negatively impacts on their health. Furthermore, this gap in representation can also leave people from these groups less willing to accept health recommendations. </p><p>The guidance includes practical considerations for setting up trials to include pregnant and lactating women, given they have unique healthcare needs. In general, at-risk populations should be involved from the earliest stages. To facilitate this, safety should be assessed as an initial priority, for instance, by reviewing comparable interventions or expediting pre-clinical studies for these groups. Appropriate procedures for consent and assent are key, particularly for children. </p><p>The guidance recommends putting patient, participant and community engagement at the heart of organizing clinical trials, to ensure that research planning, delivery and dissemination meets public needs and maintains trust. </p><p>The new guidance also seeks to strengthen national R&amp;D ecosystems through sustainable financing, to support better decision-making, accelerate access to health innovation and build more robust and effective national and global health research environments.</p><p>The guidance was developed in response to World Health Assembly resolution <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA75/A75_R8-en.pdf\">WHA 75.8</a> in an extensive and inclusive process, involving nearly 3000 stakeholders from various sectors across 48 countries. The guidance covers trials for any health intervention, including, but not limited to pharmaceutical medicines; vaccines; diagnostics; nutritional measures; cognitive, behavioural and psychological interventions; preventive care; digital and public health approaches; and traditional or herbal measures.</p>",

It addresses challenges such as poor trial design, limited diversity of participants, insufficient infrastructure and bureaucratic efficiencies, which cost time, money and lives.",
          "Global divides between high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are leading to serious inequities in clinical trials. In 2022, there were 27 133 trials taking place in the world’s 86 HICs compared to 24 791 in 131 LMICs. At times, LMICs have been targeted for inclusion in clinical trials due to their disease burdens, only for the resulting data to be used in getting health interventions authorized in HICs, but not in the LMICs.",
          "“Strengthening country-led research and development and embedding clinical trials in routine clinical and public health services will ensure faster and more equitable access to safe and effective interventions, helping people become healthier,” said Dr Jeremy Farrar, WHO’s Chief Scientist. “This new guidance aims to improve the diversity of trial participants to ensure research benefits the broadest range of people possible, decisively moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach.”",
          "According to 2022 data , less than 5% of clinical trials included pregnant women and only 13% included children. This has lowered the quality of evidence, affecting care and access to interventions. The absence of adequate testing in underrepresented populations can lead to a cautious approach in treating them, which negatively impacts on their health. Furthermore, this gap in representation can also leave people from these groups less willing to accept health recommendations.",
          "The guidance includes practical considerations for setting up trials to include pregnant and lactating women, given they have unique healthcare needs. In general, at-risk populations should be involved from the earliest stages. To facilitate this, safety should be assessed as an initial priority, for instance, by reviewing comparable interventions or expediting pre-clinical studies for these groups. Appropriate procedures for consent and assent are key, particularly for children.",
          "The guidance recommends putting patient, participant and community engagement at the heart of organizing clinical trials, to ensure that research planning, delivery and dissemination meets public needs and maintains trust.",
          "The new guidance also seeks to strengthen national R&D ecosystems through sustainable financing, to support better decision-making, accelerate access to health innovation and build more robust and effective national and global health research environments.",
          "The guidance was developed in response to World Health Assembly resolution WHA 75.8 in an extensive and inclusive process, involving nearly 3000 stakeholders from various sectors across 48 countries. The guidance covers trials for any health intervention, including, but not limited to pharmaceutical medicines; vaccines; diagnostics; nutritional measures; cognitive, behavioural and psychological interventions; preventive care; digital and public health approaches; and traditional or herbal measures."

But to make this vision a reality, we need both resources and collaboration,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. No single organization can do it alone. We call on governments, partners, and donors to come together, invest strategically, and ensure that these life-saving innovations reach those who need them most.”</p><p>“The digital revolution has the potential to unleash a health revolution,” said ITU Secretary-General Doreen Bogdan-Martin. “At ITU, universal meaningful connectivity is a priority because digital is a catalyst for delivering targets in key sectors such as health and education. We call for greater collaboration between the health and tech sectors, including the development of strong digital public infrastructure, essential for the delivery of digital health services that can benefit people everywhere without leaving anyone behind.”</p><p>Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases, are responsible for over 74% of global deaths annually, many of which are preventable. While significant progress has been made in combating NCDs, the integration of digital health technologies into mainstream health systems remains a challenge. The report shows that there is an urgent need to harness these technologies to scale up effective interventions and mitigate the growing burden on healthcare systems worldwide.</p><p>Four major risk factors linked to our everyday environment – tobacco use, unhealthy diet, the harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity – drive responses in our bodies that also increase NCD risk: raised blood pressure, obesity, raised blood glucose and raised cholesterol. Digital tools, including mobile messaging and chatbots, can support individuals to understand their modifiable risk factors and encourage them to develop healthier habits.</p><p>People living with NCDs require regular monitoring and continuous management, and many need long term and specialized care. Digital tools such as telemedicine can help them to overcome barriers to accessing healthcare. Real-time data and tools for health care professionals can also help them make informed decisions about their patients.  </p><p>While over 60% of countries have developed a digital health strategy, there is often a lack of integration of new technologies into the existing health infrastructure. The report calls for countries to invest in digital public infrastructure, and promote standards and interoperability which can overcome critical barriers to realizing the full potential of digital health.</p><p>The report serves as a blueprint for action, complementing the <a href=\"/initiatives/gidh\">WHO Global Initiative on Digital Health</a> and Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025.

That makes investing in services and programmes for adolescent health both a moral imperative and an economic no-brainer.”</p><p>The publication was launched at an event on the margins of the United Nations’ <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.un.org/en/summit-of-the-future\">Summit of the Future</a>. It highlights a number of troubling trends in adolescent health observed over the last decade, pointing to the urgent need for action. </p><p>At least 1 in 7 adolescents globally now suffer from a mental disorder, for instance, with particularly high rates of depression and anxiety.  Anaemia among adolescent girls remains prevalent, at levels similar to those in 2010, while close to 1 in 10 adolescents are obese.  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including syphilis, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes that commonly occur among youth are rising, and if left untreated, can have lifelong implications for health.  </p><p>Meanwhile violence, including bullying, affects millions of young people worldwide each year, with  <a href=\"/news/item/29-07-2024-adolescent-girls-face-alarming-rates-of-intimate-partner-violence\">devastating impacts</a> on their physical and mental health.<strong></strong></p><p>Concerningly, attempts to roll-back adolescents’ access to sexual and reproductive health care and comprehensive sexuality education have escalated amidst a growing backlash against gender equality and human rights. Restrictive age of consent policies are limiting their access to STI and HIV services. Such measures can marginalize young people, reduce health-seeking behaviour, and lead to lasting negative health impacts. </p><p>The study emphasizes other broader fundamental challenges to the future of adolescents including climate change, conflict, and inequality. </p><p>The authors also highlight that gains are possible with the right investment and support.  For example, adolescent HIV infections have declined, due to coordinated and persistent efforts in this area. Adolescent pregnancy and harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage have reduced. In addition, many positive trends in health outcomes are linked to more time in school, especially for girls; since 2000, the number of secondary-school-age children out of school decreased by nearly 30%.</p><p>Against this backdrop, the findings make a strong case for investing in adolescent health and well-being, with attention to foundational elements including education, healthcare, and nutrition.  The authors call for enacting and implementing laws and policies that protect adolescent health and rights, for health systems and services to be more responsive to adolescents’ unique needs, and for the prioritization of youth engagement and empowerment across research, programming, and policymaking. </p><p>“Adolescents are powerful and incredibly creative forces for good when they are able to shape the agenda for their well-being and their future,” said Rajat Khosla, Executive Director of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH), which co-hosted the event where the publication as launched. “Leaders must listen to what young people want and ensure they are active partners and decision-makers. They are critical for the world’s future social, economic, and political stability, and if given the platform they need, they can help make a better and healthier world possible for everyone.” </p><p>Earlier this year, world leaders committed to accelerate efforts to  <a href=\"/news/item/30-05-2024-countries-commit-to-recover-lost-progress-in-maternal--newborn---child-survival\">improve maternal and child health</a>, including adolescent health, at the World Health Assembly.  Implementing these commitments, as well as those reflected in the UN’s Pact for the Future, will be critical to protecting and promoting the health and well-being of current and future generations. </p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;font-size:18px;font-weight:700;text-align:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Notes for editors </span></p><p>The publication, which was published in <a href=\"https://www.jahonline.org/issue/S1054-139X(24)X0004-X\" title=\"https://www.jahonline.org/issue/S1054-139X(24)X0004-X\">the Journal of Adolescent Health</a>, was released at a high-level event convened on the margins of the UN General Assembly.

That makes investing in services and programmes for adolescent health both a moral imperative and an economic no-brainer.”",
          "The publication was launched at an event on the margins of the United Nations’ Summit of the Future . It highlights a number of troubling trends in adolescent health observed over the last decade, pointing to the urgent need for action.",
          "At least 1 in 7 adolescents globally now suffer from a mental disorder, for instance, with particularly high rates of depression and anxiety.  Anaemia among adolescent girls remains prevalent, at levels similar to those in 2010, while close to 1 in 10 adolescents are obese.  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including syphilis, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes that commonly occur among youth are rising, and if left untreated, can have lifelong implications for health.",
          "Meanwhile violence, including bullying, affects millions of young people worldwide each year, with devastating impacts on their physical and mental health.",
          "Concerningly, attempts to roll-back adolescents’ access to sexual and reproductive health care and comprehensive sexuality education have escalated amidst a growing backlash against gender equality and human rights. Restrictive age of consent policies are limiting their access to STI and HIV services. Such measures can marginalize young people, reduce health-seeking behaviour, and lead to lasting negative health impacts.",
          "The study emphasizes other broader fundamental challenges to the future of adolescents including climate change, conflict, and inequality.",
          "The authors also highlight that gains are possible with the right investment and support.  For example, adolescent HIV infections have declined, due to coordinated and persistent efforts in this area. Adolescent pregnancy and harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage have reduced. In addition, many positive trends in health outcomes are linked to more time in school, especially for girls; since 2000, the number of secondary-school-age children out of school decreased by nearly 30%.",
          "Against this backdrop, the findings make a strong case for investing in adolescent health and well-being, with attention to foundational elements including education, healthcare, and nutrition.  The authors call for enacting and implementing laws and policies that protect adolescent health and rights, for health systems and services to be more responsive to adolescents’ unique needs, and for the prioritization of youth engagement and empowerment across research, programming, and policymaking.",
          "“Adolescents are powerful and incredibly creative forces for good when they are able to shape the agenda for their well-being and their future,” said Rajat Khosla, Executive Director of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH), which co-hosted the event where the publication as launched. “Leaders must listen to what young people want and ensure they are active partners and decision-makers. They are critical for the world’s future social, economic, and political stability, and if given the platform they need, they can help make a better and healthier world possible for everyone.”",
          "Earlier this year, world leaders committed to accelerate efforts to improve maternal and child health , including adolescent health, at the World Health Assembly.  Implementing these commitments, as well as those reflected in the UN’s Pact for the Future, will be critical to protecting and promoting the health and well-being of current and future generations.",
          "Notes for editors",
          "The publication, which was published in the Journal of Adolescent Health , was released at a high-level event convened on the margins of the UN General Assembly.

          "The Summit of the Future takes place on September 22 and 23, 2024, seeking new consensus around how the international system can evolve to better meet the needs of current and future generations."

This is the only way to end the suffering of civilians and save lives.All hostages and all those arbitrarily detained must be released immediately and unconditionally.Humanitarians must have safe and unimpeded access to those in need.We cannot do our jobs in the face of overwhelming need and ongoing violence. More than 41 000 Palestinians in Gaza – the majority of them civilians, including women, children, older persons and at times entire families – have reportedly been killed, and more than 95 500 have been injured, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. It is estimated that a quarter of the injured in Gaza, or around 22 500 people, will require lifelong specialized rehabilitation and assistive care including individuals with severe limb injuries, amputations, spinal cord damage, traumatic brain injuries, and major burns.More than 2 million Palestinians are without protection, food, water, sanitation, shelter, health care, education, electricity and fuel – the basic necessities to survive. Families have been forcibly displaced, time and time again, from one unsafe place to the next, with no way out.Women and girls’ dignity, safety, health and rights have been severely compromised.The risk of famine persists with all 2.1 million residents still in urgent need of food and livelihood assistance as humanitarian access remains restricted.Healthcare has been decimated. More than 500 attacks on health care have been recorded in Gaza.Aid hubs have been forced to relocate and re-build many times over; convoys carrying life-saving aid have been shot at, delayed and denied access; and relief workers have been killed in unprecedented numbers. The number of aid workers killed in Gaza in the past year is the highest ever in a single crisis.Unnecessary and disproportionate force unleashed in the West Bank, combined with escalating settler violence, house demolitions, forced displacement and discriminatory movement restrictions, have caused increased fatalities and casualties.The war is also jeopardizing the future for all Palestinians and rendering eventual recovery far from reach.Meanwhile, close to 100 hostages remain in Gaza, while freed hostages have reported ill treatment, including sexual violence.The parties’ conduct over the last year makes a mockery of their claim to adhere to international humanitarian law and the minimum standards of humanity that it demands.Civilians must be protected and their essential needs must be met. There must be accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.Humanitarian and aid organizations have been doing their utmost to provide relief in Gaza and the West Bank, often at great personal risk, and with many aid workers paying the ultimate price.Our capacity to deliver is indisputable if we are granted the access we need. The first round of the polio vaccination campaign, reaching more than 560,000 children under the age of 10, is but one example. The second round of vaccinations must be carried out safely and reach all children in Gaza.We urge world leaders, once again, to wield their influence to ensure respect for international humanitarian law, international human rights law and the rulings of the International Court of Justice – through diplomatic pressure and cooperation in ending impunity.Let us be clear: The protection of civilians is a bedrock principle for the global community and in all countries’ interest.

Without decisive action, such as that outlined in the final text of the <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.un.org/pga/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/09/FINAL-Text-AMR-to-PGA.pdf\">draft political declaration</a> for the  meeting, AMR will cause even more global suffering, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to medicines, making people sicker and increasing the spread of infections that are difficult to treat, leading to illness and deaths. The intergovernmental negotiations for the declaration were co-facilitated by Malta and Barbados. The <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.un.org/pga/71/2016/09/21/press-release-hl-meeting-on-antimicrobial-resistance/\">first UN High-level Meeting on AMR</a> took place in 2016. </p><p>“Antimicrobial resistance threatens a century of medical progress and could return us to the pre-antibiotic era, where infections that are treatable today could become a death sentence,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, who will address the high-level meeting on AMR. “This is a threat for all countries at all income levels, which is why a strong, accelerated and well-coordinated global response is needed urgently.” </p><p>UNGA79 takes place at a crucial moment as the world continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerates efforts to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Despite significant strides, progress towards health targets remains off track, exacerbated by ongoing humanitarian, social, and climate crises. Millions of people still lack access to life-saving health services, highlighting the link between health and sustainable development.  </p><p>The Summit of the Future, which will take place on 22 and 23 September, will bring together world leaders to forge a new international consensus on how to deliver better in the present, including ensuring global decision making is guided by science, achieving the SDGs and safeguarding the future. During the Summit, Heads of State and high-ranking government officials are expected to endorse the Pact for the Future, which will include a Global Digital Compact and a Declaration on Future Generations. Health priorities are well-reflected in the outcomes, including the importance of access to health services and achieving universal health coverage.  </p><p>During the week, WHO officials will participate in official and informal health-focused events ranging from digital health, maternal, child and adolescent health, communicable and noncommunicable diseases, and mental health, to action on climate change, advancing progress toward Universal Health Coverage, and pandemic preparedness and response. </p><p>“Strong health systems, equitable access to health services, and robust pandemic preparedness are vital for a safer and healthier world,” Dr Tedros said. “We must harness the power of digital technologies to bridge gaps in access to health services and build resilient systems that can meet the multiple overlapping health challenges of our world, from outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics to climate change and the burden of noncommunicable diseases.” </p><p>The UN General Assembly takes place during WHO’s first Investment Round, a series of engagements and ongoing efforts to secure sustainable financing for WHO’s core work for the period of 2025-2028. Dr Tedros and WHO representatives will be conveying the importance of investing in global health and of a robust and fully funded WHO to work with countries in advancing health for all. On 23 September, Dr Tedros and European Investment Bank President Nadia Calviño will hold a live-streamed fireside chat moderated by Suzanne Lynch of Politico on why investing in primary healthcare is critical at a time of increased shocks caused by disease outbreaks like mpox.</p><p>This will be followed later in the day by the European Investment Bank and WHO co-hosting a high-level roundtable under the new Health Impact Investment Platform, which will spotlight country level action to boost vaccination and community-based health.

    "content_html": "<p>Around 560 000 children under ten years old were vaccinated against polio during the first round of an emergency vaccination campaign conducted in three phases from 1-12 September 2024 in the Gaza Strip. </p><p>The 12-day campaign provided novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) to 558 963 children, following meticulous planning and coordination. This involved the use of an extensive network of teams, vaccinating at selected fixed sites at health facilities and outreach posts. Mobile and transit teams actively reached out to families living in shelter homes, tents, and camps for the displaced, alongside community workers engaging families to raise awareness ahead of and during the campaign. For each phase, an area-specific humanitarian pause of nine hours daily was agreed to ensure the safety of communities and health workers, and enable vaccination efforts. </p><p>“Health and community workers have shown incredible resilience, carrying out this campaign at unprecedented scale and speed under the toughest conditions in Gaza. Swift action by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative—from the moment the virus was detected to the launch of the vaccination campaign—speaks to the effectiveness of the polio programme. In areas where humanitarian pauses took place, the campaign brought not just vaccines, but moments of calm. As we prepare for the next round in four weeks, we’re hopeful these pauses will hold, because this campaign has clearly shown the world what’s possible when peace is given a chance,” said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Representative for the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). </p><p>“It was critical this ambitious campaign was carried out quickly, safely and effectively to protect children in the Gaza Strip and neighbouring countries from the life-altering poliovirus,” said Jean Gough, UNICEF Special Representative in the State of Palestine. “The progress made in this first round is encouraging, but the job is far from done. We are poised to finish the task and call on all involved to ensure we can do so in the next round in four weeks' time, for the sake of children everywhere.”</p><p>Partners at all levels recognize common operational challenges faced during these efforts, including devastated infrastructure, from health facilities to roads, limited trained healthcare workers, access issues due to insecurity, limited fuel for generators used to safely store vaccines and freeze ice packs, and constant population movements. However, these issues were addressed in a timely manner, with the key support of the Palestinian Ministry of Health and UNRWA, to enable planned vaccination activities.</p><p>Despite these challenges and the conditions that families in the Gaza Strip have endured over the past 11 months, families flocked to health facilities to get their children vaccinated. This can be attributed to traditionally positive health seeking behaviour among the Palestinian people and an impactful campaign to raise awareness and mobilize the public. </p><p>The original target for the campaign was 640 000 children, estimated in the absence of an accurate survey, which may have been an over-estimate, as the population continues to move from place to place, and people are fleeing and being killed due to the ongoing hostilities. During the campaign, trained monitoring teams were deployed to oversee vaccination efforts.

WHO’s assessment for prequalification is based on information submitted by the manufacturer, Bavarian Nordic A/S, and review by the European Medicines Agency, the regulatory agency of record for this vaccine.</p><p>“This first prequalification of a vaccine against mpox is an important step in our fight against the disease, both in the context of the current outbreaks in Africa, and in future,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We now need urgent scale up in procurement, donations and rollout to ensure equitable access to vaccines where they are needed most, alongside other public health tools, to prevent infections, stop transmission and save lives.”</p><p>The MVA-BN vaccine can be administered in people over 18-years of age as a 2-dose injection given 4 weeks apart. After prior cold storage, the vaccine can be kept at 2–8°C for up to 8 weeks.<strong></strong></p><p>“The WHO prequalification of the MVA-BN vaccine will help accelerate ongoing procurement of the mpox vaccines by governments and international agencies such as Gavi and Unicef to help communities on the frontlines of the ongoing emergency in Africa and beyond,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. “The decision can also help national regulatory authorities to fast-track approvals, ultimately increasing access to quality-assured mpox vaccine products.”</p><p>The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization reviewed all available evidence and  <a href=\"/publications/i/item/who-wer-9934-429-456\">recommended</a> the use of MVA-BN vaccine in the context of an mpox outbreak for persons at high risk of exposure. While MVA-BN is currently not licensed for persons under 18 years of age, this vaccine may be used “off-label” in infants, children and adolescents, and in pregnant and immunocompromised people. This means vaccine use is recommended in outbreak settings where the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks.</p><p>WHO also recommends single-dose use in supply-constrained outbreak situations. WHO emphasizes the need to collect further data on vaccine safety and effectiveness in these circumstances. </p><p>Available data shows that a single-dose MVA-BN vaccine given before exposure has an estimated 76% effectiveness in protecting people against mpox, with the 2-dose schedule achieving an estimated 82% effectiveness. Vaccination after exposure is less effective than pre-exposure vaccination. </p><p>Good safety profile and vaccine performance has been consistently demonstrated in clinical studies, as well as in real-world use during the ongoing global outbreak since 2022. In light of the changing epidemiology and emergence of new virus strains, it remains important to collect as much data as possible on vaccine safety and effectiveness in different contexts.</p><p>Since the triggering of the emergency use listing for mpox vaccines by WHO Director-General on 7 August 2024, WHO<strong> </strong>has conducted product and programmatic suitability assessments of MVA-BN vaccine. </p><p>“The findings of the assessments are particularly relevant in the context of the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) related to the upsurge of mpox in Africa,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, WHO Director for Regulation and Prequalification. “We are progressing with prequalification and emergency use listing procedures with manufacturers of two other mpox vaccines: LC-16 and ACAM2000. We have also received 6 expressions of interest for mpox diagnostic products for emergency use listing so far.”</p><p>The escalating mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries was declared a PHEIC by the WHO Director-General on 14 August 2024.  </p><p>Over 120 countries have confirmed more than 103 000 cases of mpox since the onset of the global outbreak in 2022. In 2024 alone, there were 25 237 suspected and confirmed cases and 723 deaths from different outbreaks in 14 countries of the African Region (based on data from 8 September 2024). </p><h3>Editor’s note:<strong style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></strong></h3><p>WHO Prequalification (PQ) and Emergency Use Listing (EUL) are mechanisms used to evaluate quality, safety and efficacy of medical products, such as vaccines, diagnostics and medicines (optional: including biotherapeutics), and product suitability for use in an low- and middle-income country context.

Gen. Abdul Fatah Al-Burhan, Chairman of Sudan’s Transitional Sovereignty Council; Deputy Chairman of Sudan’s Sovereignty Council Dr Malik Agar; and Federal Minister of Health Dr Haitham Mohamed Ibrahim Awadallah. The discussions centered on the devastating impact of the ongoing conflict and the critical need for unhindered humanitarian access to ensure that life-saving aid reaches all those in need, regardless of their location.“The international community has seemingly forgotten about Sudan and is paying little heed to the conflict tearing it apart, with serious repercussions for the region,” Dr Tedros said during a press conference held today in Port Sudan. “That is why I have come to Sudan. I am here, with my sister Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Director, to meet with the wide range of partners involved in the response, and to call for urgent and scaled up action to provide more resources, more access to humanitarian aid, and more security to health workers and the patients they serve.”He added: “We are calling on the world to wake up and help Sudan out of the nightmare it is living through. ... We must not fail the people of Sudan.”Much of Sudan’s health system has been devastated by the conflict, with more than 100 attacks on healthcare facilities in the over 500 days of conflict leading to significant casualties among health workers and patients. The insecurity has forced many health workers to flee with their families, worsening the shortage of medical staff. This exodus has further weakened the health system's ability to provide essential services, leaving many Sudanese without access to critical care.The high-level WHO mission included a visit to a nutrition stabilization center supported by WHO, where Dr Tedros and Dr Balkhy saw firsthand the impact of the malnutrition crisis gripping Sudan. Currently, 3.6 million children are acutely malnourished, with 730 000 suffering from severe acute malnutrition. The ongoing conflict has exacerbated food insecurity, making it increasingly difficult to deliver essential nutrition and health services to vulnerable populations.At an internally displaced persons camp, Dr Tedros and Dr Balkhy saw the difficult living conditions the people face. The camp's residents are struggling with a lack of food, medicine, and clean water, exposing them to heightened risk of disease outbreaks and other health threats. The daily risks include threat of gender-based violence, particularly against the estimated four million women and girls at risk due to the ongoing conflict.Dr Balkhy emphasized the critical need to respect the sanctity of healthcare, in line with international humanitarian law. \"Sudan’s health infrastructure is in ruins, with many facilities destroyed, looted, or abandoned. To rebuild and stabilize the health system, there must be significant investment not only in restoring facilities but also in strengthening the health workforce,\" Dr Balkhy said. She linked this to the broader economic aspect, noting that without a functioning health system, the economic recovery and future stability of Sudan are at risk.Following the mission, Dr Tedros and Dr Balkhy underscored the need for concerted international action – both to advance peace and provide the necessary short- and long-term aid. \"Our priority is to ensure that every Sudanese in need receives the assistance they require, wherever they are in the country. This will only be possible through sustained peace, substantial investment in health infrastructure, and full, unimpeded access for humanitarian efforts across Sudan by whatever means needed, including both cross-line and cross-border from neighbouring countries.“The only way forward is peace, for which the warring parties themselves have the greatest responsibility, with support from the international community. The world must not look away—this crisis demands our immediate and collective response.\"The conflict has left some 25 million people — more than half of the country’s population — in dire need of humanitarian aid. Of these, 14.7 million require urgent assistance for a range of life-saving support, for which the humanitarian sector has requested US$ 2.7 billion, which is less than half of the funding required.WHO’s current funding gap for the Sudan health crisis is concerning, with only 24% received out of the total WHO ask, severely limiting the ability to address the crisis.The high-level visit also included the inauguration of the new premises of WHO’s office in Port Sudan, expanding WHO’s ability to reach people affected by the crisis.",

Of these, 14.7 million require urgent assistance for a range of life-saving support, for which the humanitarian sector has requested US$ 2.7 billion, which is less than half of the funding required. WHO’s current funding gap for the Sudan health crisis is concerning, with only 24% received out of the total WHO ask, severely limiting the ability to address the crisis. The high-level visit also included the inauguration of the new premises of WHO’s office in Port Sudan, expanding WHO’s ability to reach people affected by the crisis."

Fifteen (15) of the 16 Committee Members and the two Advisors to the Committee participated in the meeting.</p><p>The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) joined in person and welcomed the participants. The opening remarks by the Director-General are available <a href=\"/news-room/speeches/item/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-ihr-emergency-committee-meeting-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024---14-august-2024\">here</a>. </p><p>The Representative of the Office of Legal Counsel briefed the Members and Advisers on their roles and responsibilities and identified the mandate of the Emergency Committee under the relevant articles of the IHR. The Ethics Officer from the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics provided the Members and Advisors with an overview of the WHO Declaration of Interests process. The Members and Advisors were made aware of their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature that may give rise to a perceived or actual conflict of interest. They were additionally reminded of their duty to maintain the confidentiality of the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee. Each Member and Advisor was surveyed, with no conflicts of interest identified.</p><p>The Representative of the Office of Legal Counsel then facilitated the election of officers of the Committee, in accordance with the rules of procedures and working methods of the Emergency Committee. Professor Dimie Ogoina was elected as Chair of the Committee, Professor Inger Damon as Vice-Chair, and Professor Lucille Helen Blumberg as Rapporteur, all by acclamation. </p><p>The meeting was handed over to the Chair who introduced the objectives of the meeting, which were to provide views to the Director-General on whether the event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and if so, to provide views on the potential proposed temporary recommendations.  </p><h2>Session open to representatives of States Parties invited to present their views</h2><p>The WHO Secretariat presented an overview of the global epidemiological situation of mpox, highlighting that, during the first six months of 2024, the 1854 confirmed cases of mpox reported by States Parties in the WHO African Region account for 36% (1854/5199) of the cases observed worldwide. Of these confirmed cases in the WHO African region in 2024, 95% (1754/1854) were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), that is experiencing an upsurge of cases of mpox, with more than 15,000 clinically compatible cases and over 500 deaths reported, already exceeding the number of cases observed in the DRC in 2023.</p><p>The upsurge of mpox cases in the DRC is being driven by outbreaks associated with two sub-clades of clade I monkeypox virus (MPXV) – clade Ia and clade Ib. Clade I mpox was classically described in studies conducted by WHO in the 1980’s to have a mortality rate of approximately 10%, with most deaths occurring in children.</p><p>MPXV clade Ia is endemic in the DRC, the disease primarily affects children, data available for 2024 show an aggregated case fatality rate of 3.6%, and the spread is likely sustained through multiple modes of transmission including person-to-person transmission following zoonotic introduction in a community. </p><p>MPXV clade Ib is a new strain of MPXV that emerged in the DRC  is transmitting between people, presumed via sexual contact, which has been spreading in the eastern part of the country. Although first characterized in 2024, estimates suggest it emerged around September 2023. The outbreak associated with clade Ib in the DRC primarily affects adults and is spreading rapidly, sustained largely, but not exclusively, through transmission linked to sexual contact and amplified in networks associated with commercial sex and sex workers. </p><p>Since July 2024, cases of mpox due to MPXV clade Ib, epidemiologically and phylogenetically linked to the outbreak in the eastern provinces of DRC, have been detected in four countries, neighbouring the DRC, which had not reported cases of mpox before: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.</p><p>Additionally, in 2024, cases of mpox linked to MPXV clade Ia have been reported in the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo, and cases linked to MPXV clade II have been reported in Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria and South Africa.</p><p>The clinical presentation of mpox associated with MPXV clade Ia has historically been characterized by more severe disease than that associated with MPXV clade II. Clade IIb viruses circulated during the multi-country outbreak that constituted a PHEIC from July 2022 to May 2023. There is, as yet, insufficient information available to fully characterize mpox severity due to clade Ib as data are emerging and, so far, few deaths were recorded, precluding age-stratified analyses.</p><p>The secretariat outlined challenges in understanding the true extent of infection, epidemiologic trends and morbidity and mortality, thus cautioning overinterpretation of available data to calculate crude CFRs by different clades/outbreaks.</p><p>The assessed risk presented by the WHO Secretariat – grouping geographical areas as a result of the assessment of population groups affected, predominant modes of transmission, and MPXV clades involved –, was: “high” for eastern DRC and neighbouring countries; “high” for areas of the DRC where mpox is known to be endemic; “moderate” for Nigeria and countries of West, Central and East Africa where mpox is endemic; and “moderate” for other countries in Africa and around the world. </p><p>The WHO Secretariat additionally provided an overview of the actions already taken to support readiness and response interventions in States Parties experiencing the upsurge of cases of mpox and facing such risk. These include, inter alia: the release of USD 1.45 million from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies; initiating the process for including Emergency Use Listing two mpox vaccines; coordinating with partners and stakeholders, including to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; the development of a regional response plan, costed at an initial USD 15 million, and more.</p><p>Representatives of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda updated the Committee on the mpox epidemiological situation in their countries and the current response efforts, needs and challenges. Although most reported few cases of MPXV clade Ib related mpox, Burundi reported one hundred confirmed cases of mpox associated with clade Ib since July 2024, identified in multiple districts and 28% of cases were amongst children less than five years of age. </p><p>Members of, and Advisors to, the Committee then engaged in questions and answers with the presenters. The questions and discussions focused around the issues and challenges enumerated below:</p><ul><li>The observed complex and dynamic evolution of the multiple outbreaks driving the upsurge of mpox, and related international spread, of mpox in the DRC and neighbouring countries. Elements underpinning such observation, and representing reasons for concern, including:<ul><li>Scientific uncertainties and evidence gaps (e.g., role of ecological changes in the spread of mpox, modes of disease transmission, transmission dynamics, risk factors, disease severity and case fatality rate associated with the different MPXV clades, outcome of pregnancy in women infected with different MPXV clades); </li><li>Adequacy of capacities, recognizing capacities gained during COVID-19, and heterogeneity thereof, across States Parties for surveillance, diagnostic capacities, surveillance modalities at borders, access to clinical care, integration of HIV/STI services in prevention and treatment, and risk communication and community engagement, vaccination delivery, and other capacities to support prevention, readiness and response activities; </li><li>Lack of full understanding of the geographical spread and detailed epidemiology of the dynamic mpox outbreaks, including of molecular epidemiology, to optimize targeted prevention and control measures, including risk communication and community engagement with local partners to enable appropriate support and behavior modifications, as well as the targeted use of mpox vaccines in at risk groups; </li><li>Availability and access to laboratory tests that can be used in challenging environments, and where necessary, methods to distinguish between circulating MPXV clades; and </li><li>An incomplete mapping of mpox-related research and development efforts underway, noting several initiatives underway, including a WHO and Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) consultation to be held in August 2024;</li></ul></li><li>The unpredictability and lack of financial resources at both, national and international levels to scale up and sustain interventions to prevent and control the spread of mpox, despite the development of costed global, regional and national response plans; </li><li>The needs-based access to mpox vaccines, given the current limited available globally; the currently limited production of the vaccine, conditional to orders placed to the manufacturer; and the extensive time to develop legal agreements in relation to donation of mpox vaccines, as opposed to direct procurement. With respect to access to vaccines, the WHO Secretariat informed the Committee of its ongoing work with numerous partners through the Interim coordination mechanism for medical countermeasures (i-MCM-Net), including Gavi and the United Nations Children's Fund on the coordination of the donation and allocation process in an equitable, needs-based manner;</li><li>The access to the antiviral drug tecovirimat, considering that both, the minimum amount for orders to be placed with the manufacturer and the price of the product represent key challenges for many States Parties. While evidence is being gathered on its use for the treatment of cases of mpox, it can be accessed under protocol for Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Experimental Interventions (MEURI); and</li><li>The need for information on the implementation, by States Parties, of the standing recommendation for mpox issued on 21 August 2023. </li></ul><h2>Deliberative session</h2><p>Following the session open to invited States Parties, the Committee reconvened in a closed session to examine the questions in relation to whether the event constitutes a PHEIC or not, and if so, to consider the temporary recommendations drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.</p><p>The Chair reminded the Committee Members of their mandate and recalled that a PHEIC is defined in the IHR as an <em>“extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated international response”</em>.</p><p><strong>The Committee was unanimous in expressing the views that the ongoing upsurge of mpox meets the criteria of a PHEIC and that the Director-General be advised accordingly.</strong></p><p>The considerations underpinning the unanimous views of the Committee further elaborated upon issues and challenges addressed during the question and answers session. </p><p>The Committee considered the event as <strong>“extraordinary”</strong> because of (a) the increase in mpox clade I disease occurrence in the DRC and the emergence of the new MPXV clade Ib, the human-to-human transmission context in which it is occurring, its rapid spread in some settings, and available evidence suggesting that MPXV clade I is associated with a more severe clinical presentation with respect to MPXV clade II; (b) the diverse, complex, dynamic, and rapidly evolving epidemiology observed across States Parties in the WHO African Region in terms of: overall rapid increase of the number of cases reported in some settings, differences in population age-groups affected, routes and modes sustaining transmissions in different contexts; and (c) the severity of the clinical presentation in children and immunocompromised individuals, including people living with uncontrolled HIV infection or advanced HIV disease, as well as the long-term consequences of MPXV infection.</p><p>Additionally, the Committee strongly underscored that its level of concern is further heightened by (a) uncertainties and gaps in knowledge and evidence related to (i) multiple epidemiological aspects, including drivers of transmission, morbidity and mortality associated with infections with different MPXV sub-clades; (ii) the incompleteness and uncertainties of available epidemiological data and considered by the Committee, due to the limitations of current surveillance (e.g., sub-optimal levels of case detection and case reporting), the availability and performance of laboratory diagnostics, and ongoing conflicts and humanitarian challenges in certain areas of the DRC experiencing the upsurge of mpox, that, ultimately, hamper the implementation of control measures; (iii) the impact of control measures, including the targeted use of vaccines and their overall effectiveness; and (b) the risk of occurrence of additional mutations of MPXV clade I and clade II, and their subsequent emergence and spread in the context of limited capacity to implement control measures. </p><p>The Committee considered that the event <strong>“</strong><strong>constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease”</strong> because of (a) the documented recent spread of MPXV clade Ib from eastern DRC to Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda; (b) the limited capacity to control transmission in endemic situations and in areas of upsurge through enhanced surveillance enabling the implementation of targeted response interventions that are ultimately subordinated to (i) the unavailability of sustainable funding, and (ii) the limited ability to access vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; and (c) the challenges in implementing concerted surveillance and response interventions in contiguous areas of bordering States Parties, in particular where borders are porous.</p><p>The Committee considered that the event <strong>“requires a coordinated international response”</strong>. The Committee noted that (a) mpox is endemic in parts of Africa, with surges increasingly reported, and also resulting in a multi-country outbreak determined to constitute a PHEIC in 2022-2023; and (b) the event is occurring in the context of standing recommendations issued by the Director-General in August 2023 under IHR provisions and following the termination of the afore mentioned PHEIC; the presence of the “WHO Strategic framework for enhancing prevention and control of mpox- 2024-2027”; and the activation for mpox of the i-MCM-Net. In that light and noting the declaration of the event as a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security by the Africa CDC on 13 August 2024, the Committee considered that international cooperation requires enhanced and coordination, in particular with respect to (a) the facilitation of equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; and (b) the mobilization of financial resources.</p><p><strong>The Committee subsequently considered the draft of the temporary recommendations proposed by</strong> <strong>the WHO </strong><strong>Secretariat</strong>, briefly presented during the meeting. The Committee indicated that it would be giving further consideration to the proposed temporary recommendations while finalizing the report of the meeting. </p><p>The Committee noted that, in his opening remarks, the Director-General communicated the 12-month extension of the current <a href=\"/publications/m/item/standing-recommendations-for-mpox-issued-by-the-director-general-of-the-world-health-organization-(who)-in-accordance-with-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-(ihr)\">standing recommendations for mpox</a>, which were set to expire on 20 August 2024. The Committee also noted that, should the Director-General determine that the upsurge of mpox constitutes a PHEIC, it would be the first time, since the entry into force of the Regulations, that temporary and standing recommendations to States Parties related to the same public health risk would coexist. </p><p>Therefore, the Committee underscored that any temporary recommendation that may be issued by the Director-General should be very specific and targeted, and hence, not duplicate the standing recommendations.</p><p>Notwithstanding that both, temporary and standing recommendations constitute non-binding advice to States Parties, the Committee advised that mechanisms to monitor the uptake, implementation and impact of such recommendations should be embedded in the set of temporary recommendations to States Parties that the Director-General may issue in relation to the event considered. <strong></strong></p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>The Committee reiterated its concern regarding the evolution of the multi-faceted upsurge of mpox, including the many uncertainties surrounding it and the capacities in place to control the spread of mpox in States Parties experiencing the outbreaks, or in States Parties that may have to do so as a result of further international spread. </p><p>The Committee recognized the critical role of coordinated international cooperation in supporting States Parties’ efforts to control the spread of mpox in the WHO African Region – including in facilitating access to and use of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; mobilizing financial resources for States Parties experiencing the upsurge of disease; and synergic initiatives by WHO and partners, including Africa CDC. </p><p>Nevertheless, the Committee indicated that the development of strategic approaches for States Parties to become more self-reliant in controlling the spread of mpox are warranted. To that effect, the Committee considers that the determination by the Director-General that the upsurge of mpox constitutes a PHEIC would stimulate States Parties facing the outbreaks to more effectively commit and employ domestic resources.<strong> </strong></p><h3 align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Temporary recommendations issued by the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) to States Parties in relation to the public health emergency of international concern associated with the upsurge of mpox </h3><p>These temporary recommendations are issued to States Parties experiencing the upsurge of mpox, <strong>including, but not limited to, the</strong> <strong>Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda</strong>. </p><p>They are intended to be implemented by those States Parties in addition to the current <a href=\"/publications/m/item/standing-recommendations-for-mpox-issued-by-the-director-general-of-the-world-health-organization-(who)-in-accordance-with-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-(ihr)\"><strong>standing recommendations for mpox</strong></a>, which will be extended until 20 August 2025 and are presented at the end of this document for easy reference. </p><p>In the context of the global efforts to prevent and control the spread of mpox disease outlined in the <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240092907\">WHO Strategic framework for enhancing prevention and control of mpox- 2024-2027</a>, the aforementioned <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/standing-recommendations-for-mpox-issued-by-the-director-general-of-the-world-health-organization-(who)-in-accordance-with-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-(ihr)\"><strong>standing recommendations</strong></a> apply to <strong>all States Parties</strong>.<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> </span></p><p>All current WHO interim technical guidance can be accessed on <a href=\"/emergencies/outbreak-toolkit/disease-outbreak-toolboxes/mpox-outbreak-toolbox\">this page</a> of the WHO website.

          "The WHO Secretariat presented an overview of the global epidemiological situation of mpox, highlighting that, during the first six months of 2024, the 1854 confirmed cases of mpox reported by States Parties in the WHO African Region account for 36% (1854/5199) of the cases observed worldwide. Of these confirmed cases in the WHO African region in 2024, 95% (1754/1854) were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), that is experiencing an upsurge of cases of mpox, with more than 15,000 clinically compatible cases and over 500 deaths reported, already exceeding the number of cases observed in the DRC in 2023.",
          "The upsurge of mpox cases in the DRC is being driven by outbreaks associated with two sub-clades of clade I monkeypox virus (MPXV) – clade Ia and clade Ib. Clade I mpox was classically described in studies conducted by WHO in the 1980’s to have a mortality rate of approximately 10%, with most deaths occurring in children.",
          "MPXV clade Ia is endemic in the DRC, the disease primarily affects children, data available for 2024 show an aggregated case fatality rate of 3.6%, and the spread is likely sustained through multiple modes of transmission including person-to-person transmission following zoonotic introduction in a community.",
          "MPXV clade Ib is a new strain of MPXV that emerged in the DRC  is transmitting between people, presumed via sexual contact, which has been spreading in the eastern part of the country. Although first characterized in 2024, estimates suggest it emerged around September 2023. The outbreak associated with clade Ib in the DRC primarily affects adults and is spreading rapidly, sustained largely, but not exclusively, through transmission linked to sexual contact and amplified in networks associated with commercial sex and sex workers.",
          "Since July 2024, cases of mpox due to MPXV clade Ib, epidemiologically and phylogenetically linked to the outbreak in the eastern provinces of DRC, have been detected in four countries, neighbouring the DRC, which had not reported cases of mpox before: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.",
          "Additionally, in 2024, cases of mpox linked to MPXV clade Ia have been reported in the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo, and cases linked to MPXV clade II have been reported in Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria and South Africa.",
          "The clinical presentation of mpox associated with MPXV clade Ia has historically been characterized by more severe disease than that associated with MPXV clade II. Clade IIb viruses circulated during the multi-country outbreak that constituted a PHEIC from July 2022 to May 2023. There is, as yet, insufficient information available to fully characterize mpox severity due to clade Ib as data are emerging and, so far, few deaths were recorded, precluding age-stratified analyses.",
          "The secretariat outlined challenges in understanding the true extent of infection, epidemiologic trends and morbidity and mortality, thus cautioning overinterpretation of available data to calculate crude CFRs by different clades/outbreaks.",
          "The assessed risk presented by the WHO Secretariat – grouping geographical areas as a result of the assessment of population groups affected, predominant modes of transmission, and MPXV clades involved –, was: “high” for eastern DRC and neighbouring countries; “high” for areas of the DRC where mpox is known to be endemic; “moderate” for Nigeria and countries of West, Central and East Africa where mpox is endemic; and “moderate” for other countries in Africa and around the world.",
          "The WHO Secretariat additionally provided an overview of the actions already taken to support readiness and response interventions in States Parties experiencing the upsurge of cases of mpox and facing such risk. These include, inter alia: the release of USD 1.45 million from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies; initiating the process for including Emergency Use Listing two mpox vaccines; coordinating with partners and stakeholders, including to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; the development of a regional response plan, costed at an initial USD 15 million, and more.",
          "Representatives of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda updated the Committee on the mpox epidemiological situation in their countries and the current response efforts, needs and challenges. Although most reported few cases of MPXV clade Ib related mpox, Burundi reported one hundred confirmed cases of mpox associated with clade Ib since July 2024, identified in multiple districts and 28% of cases were amongst children less than five years of age.",
          "Members of, and Advisors to, the Committee then engaged in questions and answers with the presenters. The questions and discussions focused around the issues and challenges enumerated below:"

          "The observed complex and dynamic evolution of the multiple outbreaks driving the upsurge of mpox, and related international spread, of mpox in the DRC and neighbouring countries. Elements underpinning such observation, and representing reasons for concern, including: Scientific uncertainties and evidence gaps (e.g., role of ecological changes in the spread of mpox, modes of disease transmission, transmission dynamics, risk factors, disease severity and case fatality rate associated with the different MPXV clades, outcome of pregnancy in women infected with different MPXV clades); Adequacy of capacities, recognizing capacities gained during COVID-19, and heterogeneity thereof, across States Parties for surveillance, diagnostic capacities, surveillance modalities at borders, access to clinical care, integration of HIV/STI services in prevention and treatment, and risk communication and community engagement, vaccination delivery, and other capacities to support prevention, readiness and response activities; Lack of full understanding of the geographical spread and detailed epidemiology of the dynamic mpox outbreaks, including of molecular epidemiology, to optimize targeted prevention and control measures, including risk communication and community engagement with local partners to enable appropriate support and behavior modifications, as well as the targeted use of mpox vaccines in at risk groups; Availability and access to laboratory tests that can be used in challenging environments, and where necessary, methods to distinguish between circulating MPXV clades; and An incomplete mapping of mpox-related research and development efforts underway, noting several initiatives underway, including a WHO and Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) consultation to be held in August 2024;",

          "The needs-based access to mpox vaccines, given the current limited available globally; the currently limited production of the vaccine, conditional to orders placed to the manufacturer; and the extensive time to develop legal agreements in relation to donation of mpox vaccines, as opposed to direct procurement. With respect to access to vaccines, the WHO Secretariat informed the Committee of its ongoing work with numerous partners through the Interim coordination mechanism for medical countermeasures (i-MCM-Net), including Gavi and the United Nations Children's Fund on the coordination of the donation and allocation process in an equitable, needs-based manner;",
          "The access to the antiviral drug tecovirimat, considering that both, the minimum amount for orders to be placed with the manufacturer and the price of the product represent key challenges for many States Parties. While evidence is being gathered on its use for the treatment of cases of mpox, it can be accessed under protocol for Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Experimental Interventions (MEURI); and",

          "Following the session open to invited States Parties, the Committee reconvened in a closed session to examine the questions in relation to whether the event constitutes a PHEIC or not, and if so, to consider the temporary recommendations drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.",
          "The Chair reminded the Committee Members of their mandate and recalled that a PHEIC is defined in the IHR as an “extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated international response” .",
          "The Committee was unanimous in expressing the views that the ongoing upsurge of mpox meets the criteria of a PHEIC and that the Director-General be advised accordingly.",
          "The considerations underpinning the unanimous views of the Committee further elaborated upon issues and challenges addressed during the question and answers session.",
          "The Committee considered the event as “extraordinary” because of (a) the increase in mpox clade I disease occurrence in the DRC and the emergence of the new MPXV clade Ib, the human-to-human transmission context in which it is occurring, its rapid spread in some settings, and available evidence suggesting that MPXV clade I is associated with a more severe clinical presentation with respect to MPXV clade II; (b) the diverse, complex, dynamic, and rapidly evolving epidemiology observed across States Parties in the WHO African Region in terms of: overall rapid increase of the number of cases reported in some settings, differences in population age-groups affected, routes and modes sustaining transmissions in different contexts; and (c) the severity of the clinical presentation in children and immunocompromised individuals, including people living with uncontrolled HIV infection or advanced HIV disease, as well as the long-term consequences of MPXV infection.",
          "Additionally, the Committee strongly underscored that its level of concern is further heightened by (a) uncertainties and gaps in knowledge and evidence related to (i) multiple epidemiological aspects, including drivers of transmission, morbidity and mortality associated with infections with different MPXV sub-clades; (ii) the incompleteness and uncertainties of available epidemiological data and considered by the Committee, due to the limitations of current surveillance (e.g., sub-optimal levels of case detection and case reporting), the availability and performance of laboratory diagnostics, and ongoing conflicts and humanitarian challenges in certain areas of the DRC experiencing the upsurge of mpox, that, ultimately, hamper the implementation of control measures; (iii) the impact of control measures, including the targeted use of vaccines and their overall effectiveness; and (b) the risk of occurrence of additional mutations of MPXV clade I and clade II, and their subsequent emergence and spread in the context of limited capacity to implement control measures.",
          "The Committee considered that the event “ constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” because of (a) the documented recent spread of MPXV clade Ib from eastern DRC to Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda; (b) the limited capacity to control transmission in endemic situations and in areas of upsurge through enhanced surveillance enabling the implementation of targeted response interventions that are ultimately subordinated to (i) the unavailability of sustainable funding, and (ii) the limited ability to access vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; and (c) the challenges in implementing concerted surveillance and response interventions in contiguous areas of bordering States Parties, in particular where borders are porous.",
          "The Committee considered that the event “requires a coordinated international response” . The Committee noted that (a) mpox is endemic in parts of Africa, with surges increasingly reported, and also resulting in a multi-country outbreak determined to constitute a PHEIC in 2022-2023; and (b) the event is occurring in the context of standing recommendations issued by the Director-General in August 2023 under IHR provisions and following the termination of the afore mentioned PHEIC; the presence of the “WHO Strategic framework for enhancing prevention and control of mpox- 2024-2027”; and the activation for mpox of the i-MCM-Net. In that light and noting the declaration of the event as a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security by the Africa CDC on 13 August 2024, the Committee considered that international cooperation requires enhanced and coordination, in particular with respect to (a) the facilitation of equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; and (b) the mobilization of financial resources.",
          "The Committee subsequently considered the draft of the temporary recommendations proposed by the WHO Secretariat , briefly presented during the meeting. The Committee indicated that it would be giving further consideration to the proposed temporary recommendations while finalizing the report of the meeting.",
          "The Committee noted that, in his opening remarks, the Director-General communicated the 12-month extension of the current standing recommendations for mpox , which were set to expire on 20 August 2024. The Committee also noted that, should the Director-General determine that the upsurge of mpox constitutes a PHEIC, it would be the first time, since the entry into force of the Regulations, that temporary and standing recommendations to States Parties related to the same public health risk would coexist.",
          "Therefore, the Committee underscored that any temporary recommendation that may be issued by the Director-General should be very specific and targeted, and hence, not duplicate the standing recommendations.",
          "Notwithstanding that both, temporary and standing recommendations constitute non-binding advice to States Parties, the Committee advised that mechanisms to monitor the uptake, implementation and impact of such recommendations should be embedded in the set of temporary recommendations to States Parties that the Director-General may issue in relation to the event considered."

          "The Committee reiterated its concern regarding the evolution of the multi-faceted upsurge of mpox, including the many uncertainties surrounding it and the capacities in place to control the spread of mpox in States Parties experiencing the outbreaks, or in States Parties that may have to do so as a result of further international spread.",
          "The Committee recognized the critical role of coordinated international cooperation in supporting States Parties’ efforts to control the spread of mpox in the WHO African Region – including in facilitating access to and use of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; mobilizing financial resources for States Parties experiencing the upsurge of disease; and synergic initiatives by WHO and partners, including Africa CDC.",
          "Nevertheless, the Committee indicated that the development of strategic approaches for States Parties to become more self-reliant in controlling the spread of mpox are warranted. To that effect, the Committee considers that the determination by the Director-General that the upsurge of mpox constitutes a PHEIC would stimulate States Parties facing the outbreaks to more effectively commit and employ domestic resources."

These pauses in fighting would allow children and families to safely reach health facilities and community outreach workers to get to children who cannot access health facilities for polio vaccination. Without the humanitarian pauses, the delivery of the campaign will not be possible. </p><p>During each round of the campaign, the Palestinian Ministry of Health (MoH), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and partners, will provide two drops of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) to more than 640 000 children under ten years of age.  </p><p>The poliovirus was detected in July 2024 in environmental samples from Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. Worryingly, three children presenting with suspected acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), a common symptom of polio, have since been reported in the Gaza Strip. Their stool samples have been sent for testing to the Jordan National Polio Laboratory. </p><p>Over 1.6 million doses of nOPV2, which is used to stop cVDPV2 transmission, will be delivered to the Gaza Strip. The deliveries of the vaccines and the cold chain equipment are expected to transit through Ben Gurion Airport before arriving in the Gaza Strip by the end of August. It is essential that the transport of the vaccines and cold chain is facilitated at every step of the journey to ensure their timely reception, clearance and ultimately delivery in time for the campaign. </p><p>Detailed plans to support vaccinators and social mobilizers to reach eligible children across the Gaza Strip have been finalized. Vaccination will be administered by 708 teams, including at hospitals, field hospitals, and primary health care centres in each municipality of the Gaza Strip. Around 2700 health workers, including mobile teams and community outreach workers, will support the delivery of both rounds of the campaign. This will be supported by awareness-raising efforts to mitigate the risks of polio infection.   </p><p>At least 95 per cent vaccination coverage during each round of the campaign is needed to prevent the spread of polio and reduce the risk of its re-emergence, given the severely disrupted health, water and sanitation systems in the Gaza Strip. </p><p>Other requirements for successful campaign delivery include sufficient cash, fuel and functional telecommunication networks to reach communities with information about the campaign.  </p><p>Further efforts are underway to strengthen and expand poliovirus surveillance and routine immunization.  </p><p>The Gaza Strip has been polio-free for the last 25 years. Its reemergence, which the humanitarian community has warned about for the last ten months, represents yet another threat to the children in the Gaza Strip and neighboring countries.  A ceasefire is the only way to ensure public health security in the Gaza Strip and the region.   </p><h3>Notes for editors  </h3><ul type=\"disc\"><li>On 16 July 2024, wastewater test results confirmed that cVDPV2 was detected      in six samples collected on 23 June 2024 from Khan Younis and Deir al      Balah ES sites in the Gaza Strip.

On top of outbreaks of other mpox clades in DRC and other countries in Africa, it’s clear that a coordinated international response is needed to stop these outbreaks and save lives.”</p><p>WHO Regional Director for Africa Dr Matshidiso Moeti said, “Significant efforts are already underway in close collaboration with communities and governments, with our country teams working on the frontlines to help reinforce measures to curb mpox. With the growing spread of the virus, we’re scaling up further through coordinated international action to support countries bring the outbreaks to an end.” </p><p>Committee Chair Professor Dimie Ogoina said, “The current upsurge of mpox in parts of Africa, along with the spread of a new sexually transmissible strain of the monkeypox virus, is an emergency, not only for Africa, but for the entire globe. Mpox, originating in Africa, was neglected there, and later caused a global outbreak in 2022. It is time to act decisively to prevent history from repeating itself.\"</p><p>This PHEIC determination is the second in two years relating to mpox. Caused by an Orthopoxvirus, mpox was first detected in humans in 1970, in the DRC. The disease is considered endemic to countries in central and west Africa.</p><p>In July 2022, the multi-country outbreak of mpox was declared a PHEIC as it spread rapidly via sexual contact across a range of countries where the virus had not been seen before. That PHEIC was declared over in May 2023 after there had been a sustained decline in global cases.</p><p>Mpox has been reported in the DRC for more than a decade, and the number of cases reported each year has increased steadily over that period. Last year, reported cases increased significantly, and already the number of cases reported so far this year has exceeded last year’s total, with more than 15 600 cases and 537 deaths. </p><p>The emergence last year and rapid spread of a new virus strain in DRC, clade 1b, which appears to be spreading mainly through sexual networks, and its detection in countries neighbouring the DRC is especially concerning, and one of the main reasons for the declaration of the PHEIC.</p><p>In the past month, over 100 laboratory-confirmed cases of clade 1b have been reported in four countries neighbouring the DRC that have not reported mpox before: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Experts believe the true number of cases to be higher as a large proportion of clinically compatible cases have not been tested.</p><p>Several outbreaks of different clades of mpox have occurred in different countries, with different modes of transmission and different levels of risk.</p><p>The two vaccines currently in use for mpox are recommended by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, and are also approved by WHO-listed national regulatory authorities, as well as by individual countries including Nigeria and the DRC.</p><p>Last week, the Director-General triggered the process for Emergency Use Listing for mpox vaccines, which will accelerate vaccine access for lower-income countries which have not yet issued their own national regulatory approval. Emergency Use Listing also enables partners including Gavi and UNICEF to procure vaccines for distribution. </p><p>WHO is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers on potential vaccine donations, and coordinating with partners through the interim Medical Countermeasures Network to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools.</p><p>WHO anticipates an immediate funding requirement of an initial US$ 15 million to support surveillance, preparedness and response activities. A needs assessment is being undertaken across the three levels of the Organization.</p><p>To allow for an immediate scale up, WHO has released US$ 1.45 million from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies and may need to release more in the coming days. The Organization appeals to donors to fund the full extent of needs of the mpox response. </p><p> </p>",

On top of outbreaks of other mpox clades in DRC and other countries in Africa, it’s clear that a coordinated international response is needed to stop these outbreaks and save lives.”",
          "WHO Regional Director for Africa Dr Matshidiso Moeti said, “Significant efforts are already underway in close collaboration with communities and governments, with our country teams working on the frontlines to help reinforce measures to curb mpox. With the growing spread of the virus, we’re scaling up further through coordinated international action to support countries bring the outbreaks to an end.”",
          "Committee Chair Professor Dimie Ogoina said, “The current upsurge of mpox in parts of Africa, along with the spread of a new sexually transmissible strain of the monkeypox virus, is an emergency, not only for Africa, but for the entire globe. Mpox, originating in Africa, was neglected there, and later caused a global outbreak in 2022. It is time to act decisively to prevent history from repeating itself.\"",
          "This PHEIC determination is the second in two years relating to mpox. Caused by an Orthopoxvirus, mpox was first detected in humans in 1970, in the DRC. The disease is considered endemic to countries in central and west Africa.",
          "In July 2022, the multi-country outbreak of mpox was declared a PHEIC as it spread rapidly via sexual contact across a range of countries where the virus had not been seen before. That PHEIC was declared over in May 2023 after there had been a sustained decline in global cases.",
          "Mpox has been reported in the DRC for more than a decade, and the number of cases reported each year has increased steadily over that period. Last year, reported cases increased significantly, and already the number of cases reported so far this year has exceeded last year’s total, with more than 15 600 cases and 537 deaths.",
          "The emergence last year and rapid spread of a new virus strain in DRC, clade 1b, which appears to be spreading mainly through sexual networks, and its detection in countries neighbouring the DRC is especially concerning, and one of the main reasons for the declaration of the PHEIC.",
          "In the past month, over 100 laboratory-confirmed cases of clade 1b have been reported in four countries neighbouring the DRC that have not reported mpox before: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Experts believe the true number of cases to be higher as a large proportion of clinically compatible cases have not been tested.",
          "Several outbreaks of different clades of mpox have occurred in different countries, with different modes of transmission and different levels of risk.",
          "The two vaccines currently in use for mpox are recommended by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, and are also approved by WHO-listed national regulatory authorities, as well as by individual countries including Nigeria and the DRC.",
          "Last week, the Director-General triggered the process for Emergency Use Listing for mpox vaccines, which will accelerate vaccine access for lower-income countries which have not yet issued their own national regulatory approval. Emergency Use Listing also enables partners including Gavi and UNICEF to procure vaccines for distribution.",
          "WHO is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers on potential vaccine donations, and coordinating with partners through the interim Medical Countermeasures Network to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools.",
          "WHO anticipates an immediate funding requirement of an initial US$ 15 million to support surveillance, preparedness and response activities. A needs assessment is being undertaken across the three levels of the Organization.",
          "To allow for an immediate scale up, WHO has released US$ 1.45 million from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies and may need to release more in the coming days. The Organization appeals to donors to fund the full extent of needs of the mpox response."

    "content_html": "<p>The thirty-ninth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the<strong> </strong>international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO Director-General on 08 July 2024 with committee members and advisers meeting via video conference with affected countries, supported by the WHO Secretariat. The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in the context of the global target of interruption and certification of WPV1 eradication by 2026 and interruption and certification of cVDPV2 elimination by 2028. Technical updates were received about the situation in the following countries: Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Pakistan, Senegal, and Somalia.</p><h2>Wild poliovirus</h2><p>Since the last Emergency Committee meeting, twelve new WPV1 cases were reported, five from Afghanistan and seven from Pakistan bringing the total to 14 in 2024. The number of WPV1 positive environmental samples in Pakistan in 2024 is 186 compared to 126 during all of 2023. The number of WPV1 positive environmental samples in Afghanistan in 2024 is 44 compared to 62 in all of 2023. </p><p>There has been an upward trend of WPV1 detection in Pakistan since mid-2023, mainly in the environmental samples from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan provinces. In Afghanistan, there is increased WPV1 detection in the environmental samples in the South Region since late 2023, in addition to reporting of two WPV1 cases. The committee noted the conclusion of recently held meeting of the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on polio eradication in Afghanistan and Pakistan that despite overall progress, endemic transmission has been re-established in the historic reservoirs of Kandahar (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan) and there is risk of its re-establishment in Karachi and Quetta Block of Pakistan. Review of the molecular epidemiology indicates that there has been progressive elimination of the genetic cluster ‘YB3C’ in 2022 and 2023, with its last detection in November 2023 in Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan. However, there has been persistent transmission of YB3A genetic cluster since May 2022, resulting into its split into two: YB3A4A and YB3A4B. The YB3A4A is a shared cluster in the northern and southern cross-border corridors across Afghanistan and Pakistan, while the YB3A4B is mainly active in Pakistan.<br/></p><p>Both Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to implement an intensive and synchronized campaign schedule focusing on improved vaccination coverage in the endemic zones and effective and timely response to WPV1 detections elsewhere in each country. Both countries implemented two nationwide and two sub-national vaccination campaigns during the first half of 2024. During the June 2024 nation-wide vaccination campaign, Afghanistan for the first time after more than five years, utilized house-to-house vaccination strategy in the South Region with exception of the Kandahar province, which is a very encouraging development. The campaign quality in the endemic East Region of Afghanistan has reportedly been high in 2024. Nationally, 95% of the target children (aged &lt; 5 years) in Afghanistan were reached by house-to-house vaccination strategy during the June 2024 campaign and 5% through other modalities. The campaign quality in the areas with house-to-house to vaccination is significantly better than the areas using other modalities. During April 2024 nationwide campaign in Afghanistan, 17% of the vaccination volunteers were women, representing about 3% improvement since December 2023.  In Pakistan, the campaign quality in the endemic zone of South KP and historic WPV1 reservoirs continues to face challenges relating to operational implementation and increasing insecurity particularly in the KP and Balochistan provinces. Despite recent progress in the endemic South KP in Pakistan, there are concerning numbers of missed children during the recent campaigns (ranging from 5000 to 700,000) due to insecurity, boycotts and programme quality issues. Key AFP surveillance performance indicators are not meeting the targets in some of the districts of South KP of Pakistan. In addition to seasonal movement patterns within and between the two endemic countries, the continued return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan compounds the challenges faced. The scale of the displacement increases the risk of cross-border poliovirus spread as well as spread within both the countries.  This risk is being managed and mitigated in both countries through vaccination at border crossing points and the updating of micro-plans in the districts of origin and return. The programme continues to closely coordinate with IOM and UNHCR.<br/></p><p>There has been no transmission of WPV1 in the African Region in 2024. Following an independent Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) in Malawi and Mozambique, the WPV1 outbreak in the African Region has been declared closed as of May 2024.<br/></p><p>In summary, the available data indicate that globally transmission of WPV1 is geographically limited to the two WPV1 endemic countries; however, there has been geographical spread within the two countries in 2023 and 2024.</p><h2>Circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV)</h2><p>In 2024, there have been 72 cases confirmed with cVDPV, of which 68 are cVDPV2 and four are cVDPV1. Of the 72 cases in 2024, 30 (42%) have occurred in Nigeria. Algeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia, Mozambique, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Uganda, and Zimbabwe have detected cVDPV in the environment but have not detected any cases.<br/></p><p> A total of 527 cases have been confirmed with cVDPV in all of 2023, of which 393 are cVDPV2 and 134 are cVDPV1. Of the 527 cVDPV cases reported in 2023, 224 (43%) have occurred in the DR Congo. </p><p>There are two newly infected countries reporting cVDPV2 since the last meeting: Ethiopia and Equatorial Guinea. Both Ethiopia and Equatorial Guinea experienced importations, from South Sudan and Chad respectively.  In 2024, the number of circulating cVDPV2 emergence groups detected to date is 13, compared to 27 in 2023, 22 in 2022, 29 in 2021, 36 in 2020, and 44 in 2019. Of the 13 emergence groups circulating in 2024, two are a newly detected this year, both derived from the novel OPV2 vaccine. There have now been 17 nOPV2 derived cVDPV2 emergences since 2021.<br/></p><p>All the four cVDPV1 cases in 2024 have been reported from DR Congo. In 2023, a total of 134 cVDPV1 cases were reported including 106 from DR Congo, 24 from Madagascar, and four from Mozambique. Last cVDPV1 detection from Madagascar was in September 2023 and from Mozambique in November 2023.<br/></p><p>The committee noted that in the African Region, which now, exclusively uses novel OPV2 for outbreak response, there has been a total of 16 new cVDPV2 emergences detected that have emerged from novel OPV2 use, while there has been one such emergence identified in Egypt in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The committee noted that much of the risk for cVDPV outbreaks can be linked to a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, a high concentration of zero dose and under-immunized children and population displacement. These factors are most evident in northern Yemen, northern Nigeria, south-central Somalia and eastern DR Congo.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus still remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months.  The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Ongoing risk of WPV1 international spread:</span>  </p><p>Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of WPV1 remains:</p><ul><li>Spread of WPV1 transmission back into formerly endemic areas and core reservoirs of Afghanistan (Kandahar) and Pakistan (Karachi, Peshawar, Quetta Block), that represents a significant risk to the gains made during the last two years.</li><li>The WPV1 transmission has essentially re-established in Kandahar (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan).</li><li>This epidemiological context is particularly concerning at the outset of high transmission season in both endemic countries.</li><li>Despite overall resumption of house-to-house vaccination campaigns in Southern Afghanistan, Kandahar province continues to implement site-to-site or mosque-to-mosque campaigns, which has been shown to be less effective than the house-to-house strategy;</li><li>Certain geographies and population pockets in the epidemiologically critical areas of Pakistan continue to have inconsistent campaign quality and substantial number of unimmunized and under-immunized children</li><li>High-risk mobile populations in Pakistan represent a specific risk of international spread to Afghanistan in particular, compounded by ongoing significant movement the returnees from Pakistan into a number of provinces of Afghanistan;</li><li>Any setback in Afghanistan poses a risk to the programme in Pakistan due to high population movement.</li></ul><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Ongoing risk of cVDPV international spread:</span></p><p>Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 appears to remain high although numbers of cVDPV1 cases have gone down:</p><ul><li>Ongoing cross border spread including into newly re-infected countries such as Ethiopia and Equatorial Guinea</li><li>Continued cVDPV2 transmission in the critical areas of Nigeria, with more than 40% of the global cVDPV2 cases in 2024 and it’s potential to amplify the transmission</li><li>The cVDPV2 transmission in the Horn of Africa seems to be intensifying during the first half of 2024. The Horn of Africa countries continue to face humanitarian and health emergencies making it very challenging to implement high-quality vaccination campaigns in a timely manner.</li><li>There is a large pool of unimmunized susceptible children in the Northern Governorates of Yemen</li><li>Despite the decreasing number of cVDPV cases, the transmission continues to be detected in DR Congo, as recent as April 2024 for cVDPV1 and March 2024 for cVDPV2</li><li>The ever-widening gap in population intestinal mucosal immunity in young children since the withdrawal of OPV2 in 2016 and consequently high concentration of zero dose children in certain areas;</li><li>Insecurity in many areas that are the source of cVDPV transmission.</li></ul><p>Contributing factors include:</p><ul><li>Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by humanitarian emergencies including conflict and protracted complex emergencies. This poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to polio outbreaks.</li><li>Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in northern Yemen and Somalia which have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for extended periods of more than a year.</li></ul><h2>Risk categories</h2><p>The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:</p><ol><li>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3.</li><li>States infected with cVDPV2, with or without evidence of local transmission.</li><li>States previously infected by WPV1 or cVDPV within the last 24 months.</li></ol><p>Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:</p><ul><li>Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.</li><li>Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period.</li><li>These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps.</li></ul><p>Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be remain on a ‘watch list’ for a further 12 months for a period of heightened monitoring.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations.<br/> </p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">TEMPORARY RECOMMENDATIONS</span></strong></p><p><strong>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread </strong></p><p><strong>WPV1 </strong></p><table><tbody><tr style=\"height:25%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Afghanistan</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 22 May 2024</td></tr><tr style=\"height:25%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Pakistan</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 4 June 2024</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>cVDPV1</strong></p><table style=\"height:108.995px;\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:32.7088%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Madagascar</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 16 September 2023</td></tr><tr style=\"height:27.1773%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Mozambique</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 6 November 2023</td></tr><tr style=\"height:40.1135%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 27 April 2024</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These countries should:</p><ul><li>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.</li><li>Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (&gt; four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.</li><li>Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers.</li><li>Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.</li><li>Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (road, air and / or sea).</li><li>Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.</li><li>Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication. Countries which have not yet introduced IPV2 into their schedules should urgently implement this. Once available, countries should also consider introducing the hexavalent vaccine now approved by Gavi.</li><li>Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected.</li><li>Provide to the Director-General a regular report on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel.</li></ul><p><strong>States infected with cVDPV2, with or without evidence of local transmission:</strong></p><table><tbody><tr style=\"height:16.666666666666668%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">1. Algeria</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 27 February 2024</td></tr><tr style=\"height:16.666666666666668%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">2. Angola</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 30 March 2024</td></tr><tr style=\"height:16.666666666666668%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">3. Benin</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 5 December 2023</td></tr><tr style=\"height:16.666666666666668%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">4. Botswana</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 25 July 2023</td></tr><tr style=\"height:16.666666666666668%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">5.

Moreover, consequent to persistent transmission in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the YB3A genetic cluster of WPV1 has split into two, YB3A4A and YB3A4B. The YB3A4A is a shared cluster in the northern and southern cross-border corridors across Afghanistan and Pakistan, while the YB3A4B is mainly active in Pakistan.<br/></p><p>The committee appreciates the recent steps taken (June 2024) by the Afghanistan Polio Programme towards resumption of house-to-house campaigns in Southern Afghanistan, and notes with concern that Kandahar Province in the region continues to have a large pool of susceptible children due to inability to implement house-to-house campaigns, yet. The committees notes that the overall women’s inclusion in vaccination campaigns remains around 20% in Afghanistan, leading to inadequate access to all children in some areas. The committee is encouraged by the appointment of the Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication in Pakistan. The Committee encourages Afghanistan and Pakistan polio programmes to maintain coordination, aiming to rapidly improve the access and quality of vaccination campaigns to be able to reach the Goal-1 of the GPEI strategy. </p><p>The committee is encouraged by the closure of WPV1 outbreak in the African Region and appreciates the efforts of National Governments and the GPEI in this regard. It is important to maintain high population immunity through routine immunization to avert the risk of future WPV1 outbreaks in the African Region.<br/></p><p>The committee noted the ongoing transmission of cVDPV in the African Region and that many of the cVDPV infected countries remain conflict affected, disrupting routine immunization as well as polio vaccination campaigns. The committee also noted that other health emergencies and disease outbreaks (cholera, measles, dengue, malaria, etc.) in several countries of the African Region are making it very challenging to implement timely and high-quality polio vaccination campaigns. The committee noted the deteriorating cVDPV epidemiology in the Horn of Africa, with concurrent humanitarian and other health related challenges. The committee noted ongoing substantial role of mobile populations in sustaining the cVDPV transmission across several countries. The committee also noted that context-specific tailored interventions will be critical to implement high-quality campaigns and ultimately stop the cVDPV outbreaks in the current complex scenario, with varying challenges in different countries and sub-national geographies. Synchronized sub-regional approaches and strong cross-border coordination will also be critical to jointly address the challenges relating to permeable borders and common operational challenges across countries. The committee encourages the countries to document and share the best practices and suggests that GPEI facilitates that.<br/></p><p>The committee noted that novel OPV2 continues to demonstrate high genetic stability compared to Sabin OPV2. However, the risk of new cVDPV2 emergences will remain in the event of long intervals (&gt; 4 weeks) between outbreak response campaigns and low vaccination quality.<br/></p><p>The committee noted the ongoing supply related challenges regarding novel OPV2 and is encouraged by the prospects for improvement during the second half of 2024, including possible arrival of a second supplier in the market. The committee considered that securing of vaccine supply was a critical issue and that there should be planning to ensure a more robust vaccine supply beyond admission of a new supplier. While encouraging countries to declare public health emergencies following detection of a new outbreak, such crucial actions need to be supported by the GPEI in ensuring vaccine availability.<br/></p><p>The committee noted that 20 countries in the African Region are yet to introduce a second dose of IPV in their Routine Immunization schedules. Moreover, a number cVDPV outbreak affected countries continue to have low IPV1 coverage. It is important to take urgent steps to introduce IPV2 in the Routine Immunization of the remaining countries and improve IPV1 coverage, especially in the outbreak affected countries. The committee is encouraged by the prequalification of the Hexavalent Vaccine and availability of GAVI support for its introduction., starting in 2025. The committee appreciates the GPEI plan on integration and encourages to take all steps to implement that and utilize all possible opportunities to boost population immunity against polio, including the Big Catch up. </p>The committee noted the ongoing GPEI efforts to maintain sensitive surveillance for polioviruses, and that epidemiological and genetic data indicates need for further quality improvement in the WPV1 endemic countries as well as the cVDPV affected countries. The Committee suggested to fast-track the efforts to improve speed of detection to inform rapid response, with special focus on high-risk geographies and populations<p>The committee noted the review of the International Health Regulations and that amendments to the Regulations were possible in 2024 but that these have not yet come into effect. The Committee felt it was still too early to discontinue the PHEIC as the risk of exportation of both WPV and cVDPVs remains significant, noting also that there has been geographical spread of WPV1 in the Pakistan and Afghanistan epidemiological block in 2023 and 2024.<br/></p><p>Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPVs, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 12 continues to constitute a PHEIC with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States previously infected by WPV1 or cVDPV within the last 24 months’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective, 12 August 2024.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

          "Since the last Emergency Committee meeting, twelve new WPV1 cases were reported, five from Afghanistan and seven from Pakistan bringing the total to 14 in 2024. The number of WPV1 positive environmental samples in Pakistan in 2024 is 186 compared to 126 during all of 2023. The number of WPV1 positive environmental samples in Afghanistan in 2024 is 44 compared to 62 in all of 2023.",
          "There has been an upward trend of WPV1 detection in Pakistan since mid-2023, mainly in the environmental samples from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan provinces. In Afghanistan, there is increased WPV1 detection in the environmental samples in the South Region since late 2023, in addition to reporting of two WPV1 cases. The committee noted the conclusion of recently held meeting of the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on polio eradication in Afghanistan and Pakistan that despite overall progress, endemic transmission has been re-established in the historic reservoirs of Kandahar (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan) and there is risk of its re-establishment in Karachi and Quetta Block of Pakistan. Review of the molecular epidemiology indicates that there has been progressive elimination of the genetic cluster ‘YB3C’ in 2022 and 2023, with its last detection in November 2023 in Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan. However, there has been persistent transmission of YB3A genetic cluster since May 2022, resulting into its split into two: YB3A4A and YB3A4B. The YB3A4A is a shared cluster in the northern and southern cross-border corridors across Afghanistan and Pakistan, while the YB3A4B is mainly active in Pakistan.",
          "Both Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to implement an intensive and synchronized campaign schedule focusing on improved vaccination coverage in the endemic zones and effective and timely response to WPV1 detections elsewhere in each country. Both countries implemented two nationwide and two sub-national vaccination campaigns during the first half of 2024. During the June 2024 nation-wide vaccination campaign, Afghanistan for the first time after more than five years, utilized house-to-house vaccination strategy in the South Region with exception of the Kandahar province, which is a very encouraging development. The campaign quality in the endemic East Region of Afghanistan has reportedly been high in 2024. Nationally, 95% of the target children (aged < 5 years) in Afghanistan were reached by house-to-house vaccination strategy during the June 2024 campaign and 5% through other modalities. The campaign quality in the areas with house-to-house to vaccination is significantly better than the areas using other modalities. During April 2024 nationwide campaign in Afghanistan, 17% of the vaccination volunteers were women, representing about 3% improvement since December 2023.  In Pakistan, the campaign quality in the endemic zone of South KP and historic WPV1 reservoirs continues to face challenges relating to operational implementation and increasing insecurity particularly in the KP and Balochistan provinces. Despite recent progress in the endemic South KP in Pakistan, there are concerning numbers of missed children during the recent campaigns (ranging from 5000 to 700,000) due to insecurity, boycotts and programme quality issues. Key AFP surveillance performance indicators are not meeting the targets in some of the districts of South KP of Pakistan. In addition to seasonal movement patterns within and between the two endemic countries, the continued return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan compounds the challenges faced. The scale of the displacement increases the risk of cross-border poliovirus spread as well as spread within both the countries.  This risk is being managed and mitigated in both countries through vaccination at border crossing points and the updating of micro-plans in the districts of origin and return. The programme continues to closely coordinate with IOM and UNHCR.",
          "There has been no transmission of WPV1 in the African Region in 2024. Following an independent Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) in Malawi and Mozambique, the WPV1 outbreak in the African Region has been declared closed as of May 2024.",
          "In summary, the available data indicate that globally transmission of WPV1 is geographically limited to the two WPV1 endemic countries; however, there has been geographical spread within the two countries in 2023 and 2024."

The committee noted that much of the risk for cVDPV outbreaks can be linked to a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, a high concentration of zero dose and under-immunized children and population displacement. These factors are most evident in northern Yemen, northern Nigeria, south-central Somalia and eastern DR Congo."

          "The committee appreciates the recent steps taken (June 2024) by the Afghanistan Polio Programme towards resumption of house-to-house campaigns in Southern Afghanistan, and notes with concern that Kandahar Province in the region continues to have a large pool of susceptible children due to inability to implement house-to-house campaigns, yet. The committees notes that the overall women’s inclusion in vaccination campaigns remains around 20% in Afghanistan, leading to inadequate access to all children in some areas. The committee is encouraged by the appointment of the Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication in Pakistan. The Committee encourages Afghanistan and Pakistan polio programmes to maintain coordination, aiming to rapidly improve the access and quality of vaccination campaigns to be able to reach the Goal-1 of the GPEI strategy.",
          "The committee is encouraged by the closure of WPV1 outbreak in the African Region and appreciates the efforts of National Governments and the GPEI in this regard. It is important to maintain high population immunity through routine immunization to avert the risk of future WPV1 outbreaks in the African Region.",
          "The committee noted the ongoing transmission of cVDPV in the African Region and that many of the cVDPV infected countries remain conflict affected, disrupting routine immunization as well as polio vaccination campaigns. The committee also noted that other health emergencies and disease outbreaks (cholera, measles, dengue, malaria, etc.) in several countries of the African Region are making it very challenging to implement timely and high-quality polio vaccination campaigns. The committee noted the deteriorating cVDPV epidemiology in the Horn of Africa, with concurrent humanitarian and other health related challenges. The committee noted ongoing substantial role of mobile populations in sustaining the cVDPV transmission across several countries. The committee also noted that context-specific tailored interventions will be critical to implement high-quality campaigns and ultimately stop the cVDPV outbreaks in the current complex scenario, with varying challenges in different countries and sub-national geographies. Synchronized sub-regional approaches and strong cross-border coordination will also be critical to jointly address the challenges relating to permeable borders and common operational challenges across countries. The committee encourages the countries to document and share the best practices and suggests that GPEI facilitates that.",
          "The committee noted that novel OPV2 continues to demonstrate high genetic stability compared to Sabin OPV2. However, the risk of new cVDPV2 emergences will remain in the event of long intervals (> 4 weeks) between outbreak response campaigns and low vaccination quality.",
          "The committee noted the ongoing supply related challenges regarding novel OPV2 and is encouraged by the prospects for improvement during the second half of 2024, including possible arrival of a second supplier in the market. The committee considered that securing of vaccine supply was a critical issue and that there should be planning to ensure a more robust vaccine supply beyond admission of a new supplier. While encouraging countries to declare public health emergencies following detection of a new outbreak, such crucial actions need to be supported by the GPEI in ensuring vaccine availability.",
          "The committee noted that 20 countries in the African Region are yet to introduce a second dose of IPV in their Routine Immunization schedules. Moreover, a number cVDPV outbreak affected countries continue to have low IPV1 coverage. It is important to take urgent steps to introduce IPV2 in the Routine Immunization of the remaining countries and improve IPV1 coverage, especially in the outbreak affected countries. The committee is encouraged by the prequalification of the Hexavalent Vaccine and availability of GAVI support for its introduction., starting in 2025. The committee appreciates the GPEI plan on integration and encourages to take all steps to implement that and utilize all possible opportunities to boost population immunity against polio, including the Big Catch up.",
          "The committee noted the ongoing GPEI efforts to maintain sensitive surveillance for polioviruses, and that epidemiological and genetic data indicates need for further quality improvement in the WPV1 endemic countries as well as the cVDPV affected countries. The Committee suggested to fast-track the efforts to improve speed of detection to inform rapid response, with special focus on high-risk geographies and populations",
          "The committee noted the review of the International Health Regulations and that amendments to the Regulations were possible in 2024 but that these have not yet come into effect. The Committee felt it was still too early to discontinue the PHEIC as the risk of exportation of both WPV and cVDPVs remains significant, noting also that there has been geographical spread of WPV1 in the Pakistan and Afghanistan epidemiological block in 2023 and 2024.",
          "Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPVs, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 12 continues to constitute a PHEIC with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States previously infected by WPV1 or cVDPV within the last 24 months’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective, 12 August 2024."

    "content_html": "<p>In the last 12 years, the number of infants under six months of age globally who are exclusively breastfed has increased by more than 10%. This means 48% of infants worldwide now benefit from this healthy start in life. It translates to hundreds of thousands of babies whose lives have been saved by breastfeeding.<br/></p><p>While this significant leap brings us closer to the World Health Organization target of increasing exclusive breastfeeding to at least 50% by 2025, there are persistent challenges that must be addressed.<br/></p><p>When mothers receive the support they need to breastfeed their babies, everyone benefits. Improving breastfeeding rates could save over 820 000 children’s lives each year, according to the latest available data. </p><p>During this critical period of early growth and development, the antibodies in breastmilk protect babies against illness and death. This is especially important during emergencies, when breastfeeding guarantees a safe, nutritious, and accessible food source for infants and young children. Breastfeeding reduces the burden of childhood illness, and the risk of certain types of cancers and noncommunicable diseases for mothers. </p><p>This World Breastfeeding Week, under the theme “Closing the gap: Breastfeeding support for all”,<em> </em>UNICEF and WHO are emphasizing<em> </em>the need to improve breastfeeding support as a critical action for reducing health inequity and protecting the rights of mothers and babies to survive and thrive.<br/></p><p>An estimated 4.5 billion people – that’s more than half of the world’s population – do not have full coverage of essential health services, so many women do not receive the support they need to optimally breastfeed their babies. This includes access to trained, empathetic and respectful health advice and counselling throughout a woman’s breastfeeding journey. </p><p>Reliable data collection is key to tackling healthcare inequalities and ensuring mothers and families are provided with timely, effective breastfeeding support. Currently, only half of all countries collect data on breastfeeding rates. To support progress, data also needs to be available on policy actions that make breastfeeding possible such as family friendly employment policies, regulation of the marketing of breastmilk substitutes, and investment in breastfeeding. Improving monitoring systems will help boost the effectiveness of breastfeeding policies and programmes, inform better decision-making, and ensure support systems can be adequately financed.<br/></p><p>When breastfeeding is protected and supported, women are more than twice as likely to breastfeed their infants. This is a shared responsibility. Families, communities, healthcare workers, policymakers, and other decision-makers all play a central role by:    </p><ul><li>increasing investment in programmes and policies that protect and support breastfeeding through dedicated national budgets; <br/></li><li>implementing and monitoring family friendly workplace policies, such as paid maternity leave, breastfeeding breaks and access to affordable and good-quality childcare; <br/></li><li>ensuring mothers who are at-risk in emergencies or under-represented communities, receive breastfeeding protection and support in line with their unique needs, including timely, effective breastfeeding counselling as part of routine health coverage;</li><li>improving monitoring of breastfeeding programmes and policies to inform and further improve breastfeeding rates; and<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"></span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">developing and enforcing laws restricting the marketing of breast-milk substitutes, including digital marketing practices, with monitoring to routinely report the Code violations.</span></li></ul><p>###</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> </span></p><h3>About UNICEF</h3><p>UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children.

This is the largest medical evacuation outside Gaza since October 2023.“I am immensely grateful to the United Arab Emirates for evacuating sick and severely injured patients from Gaza and providing them with lifesaving medical care,” said Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean. “This initiative is a clear demonstration of the intra-regional solidarity that is urgently needed. Support to people in the Region must start from the Region. Thousands more inside Gaza remain at risk without access to advanced medical care. I urge Member States who are able to receive and care for more patients to do so.”The patients include 35 children and 50 adults, who were transferred from Gaza via Kerem Shalom to Ramon Airport in Israel, with support from WHO.

We also call for evacuations to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, to be restored. Thousands of sick people are suffering needlessly. Above all, and as always, we call for a ceasefire.”The evacuation, originally scheduled for 29 July, was postponed, adding significant challenges to the operation and diverting scarce resources.Despite damaged roads, insecurity, and risks to their own safety, the WHO team organized and managed the transfer of patients from various areas in Gaza to the Kerem Shalom crossing under extremely challenging conditions.Prior to the evacuation, 9 patients were transferred by WHO and partners on July 27 from northern Gaza to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) field hospital in Deir al-Balah for stabilization and further movement. Other patients were picked up from five locations in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. Some critically injured patients, who had already been relocated to the final departure point in the south, were accommodated and cared for at the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) field hospital in Deir al-Balah, in coordination with WHO, following the postponement of the mission. WHO and the International Medical Corps team provided medical supplies, electricity, safe water and sanitation facilities at the hospital as it is still being set up.During the evacuation, patients underwent back-to-back transfer at Kerem Shalom, where they boarded buses, organized by WHO, heading to the airport after security checks. WHO provided wheelchairs to ensure patients could safely switch buses at the crossing, arranged access to food, water and medical professionals during the entire journey within Gaza and en route to the airport, and supported patient documentation.Other partners supporting the evacuation included the emergency medical teams Cadus and International Medical Corps, MSF Belgium and PRCS.Since October 2023, around 5000 people have been evacuated for treatment outside Gaza, with over 80% receiving care in Egypt, Qatar and the UAE. Over 10 000 more people in Gaza still need medical evacuation. Today’s evacuation follows previous ones to Spain and Belgium from Cairo, coordinated by WHO. Twenty patients have been evacuated to these countries in the past few days.WHO continues to call on the international community to intensify efforts to ensure safe, sustained, timely, and organized medical evacuations.",

Almost 1 in 6 (16%) experienced such violence in the past year. </p><p>“Intimate partner violence is starting alarmingly early for millions of young women around the world,” said Dr Pascale Allotey, Director of WHO’s Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research Department. “Given that violence during these critical formative years can cause profound and lasting harms, it needs to be taken more seriously as a public health issue – with a focus on prevention and targeted support.”</p><p>Partner violence can have devastating impacts on young people’s health, educational achievement, future relationships, and lifelong prospects. From a health perspective, it heightens the likelihood of injuries, depression, anxiety disorders, unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, and many other physical and psychological conditions. </p><h2>High rates of violence against adolescent girls reflect deeply entrenched inequalities</h2><p>This study draws on existing data to provide, for the first time, a detailed analysis of the prevalence of physical and/or sexual partner violence experienced by 15–19-year-old girls who have been in intimate relationships. It also identifies broader social, economic and cultural factors that increase their risks. </p><p>While violence against adolescent girls occurs everywhere, the authors highlight significant differences in prevalence. Based on WHO’s estimates, the worst affected regions are Oceania (47%) and central sub-Saharan Africa (40%), for instance, while the lowest rates are in central Europe (10%) and central Asia (11%). Between countries, there is also a substantive range: from an estimated 6% adolescent girls subjected to such violence in the least affected countries, to 49% in those with the highest rates.  </p><p>The new analysis found that intimate partner violence against adolescent girls is most common in lower-income countries and regions, in places where there are fewer girls in secondary school, and where girls have weaker legal property ownership and inheritance rights compared to men. Child marriage (before the age of 18 years) significantly escalates risks, since spousal age differences create power imbalances, economic dependency, and social isolation – all of which increase the likelihood of enduring abuse.</p><h2>Adolescent girls need targeted services and support</h2><p>The study highlights the urgent need to strengthen support services and early prevention measures tailored for adolescents, alongside actions to advance women’s and girls’ agency and rights – from school-based programmes that educate both boys and girls on healthy relationships and violence prevention, to legal protections, and economic empowerment. Since many adolescents lack their own financial resources, they can face particular challenges in leaving abusive relationships. </p><p>“The study shows that to end gender-based violence, countries need to have policies and programmes in place that increase equality for women and girls,” said study author Dr Lynnmarie Sardinha, Technical Officer for Violence Against Women Data and Measurement at WHO. “This means ensuring secondary education for all girls, securing gender-equal property rights and ending harmful practices such as child marriage, which are often underpinned by the same inequitable gender norms that perpetuate violence against women and girls.”</p><p>Currently, no country is on track to eliminate violence against women and girls by the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal target date. Ending child marriage – which affects 1 in 5 girls globally – and expanding girls’ access to secondary education will be critical factors for reducing partner violence against adolescent girls. </p><p>WHO supports countries to measure and address violence against women, including efforts to strengthen prevention and response within the health care sector. New WHO guidelines on prevention of child marriage are planned for release by the end of 2024.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Notes for editors</strong></p><p>The study, <em>Intimate partner violence against adolescent girls: regional and national prevalence estimates and associated country-level factors</em>, analyzes both lifetime prevalence and prevalence over the past 12 months of physical and/or sexual partner violence against 15-19 year old girls.

Mostly carried out on infants and young girls, it can inflict severe immediate and long-term physical and psychological damage, including infection, later childbearing complications, and post-traumatic stress disorder.<o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></p><p>“The Women’s (Amendment) Act, 2015 – a pivotal milestone in advancing gender equality – is the culmination of years of advocacy, community engagement, and education aimed at eradicating this harmful practice and meeting the Sustainable Development Goal targets (5.3). It is, therefore, crucial that these legal protections remain in place. <o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></p><p>“The decision to maintain the FGM ban aligns with The Gambia's international and regional commitments to prevent harmful practices against girls and women, consistent with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the Maputo Protocol protecting African women’s rights.<o:p></o:p></p><p>“In addition to recognizing this critical decision by the national parliament, we commend the tireless efforts of survivors, activists, civil society organizations, and faith-based groups working to end FGM. Upholding the ban supports these grassroots initiatives, which are pivotal in ending all forms of violence, including harmful practices, against girls and women and delivering a safer and healthier future for girls and women in The Gambia and elsewhere.  <o:p></o:p></p><p>“The fragility of progress to end FGM cannot be overstated. Assaults on women’s and girls’ rights in countries around the globe have meant that hard-won gains are in danger of being lost. In some countries, advancements have stalled or reversed due pushback against girls’ and women's rights, instability, and conflict, disrupting services and prevention programmes. <o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></p><p>“That is why legislative bans on FGM, while a crucial foundation for interventions, cannot alone end FGM.

      "description": "Joint statement by UNICEF Executive Director, Catherine Russell, UNFPA Executive Director, Natalia Kanem, WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, UN Women Executive Director, Sima Bahous, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk  “Following the vote today by the National Assembly of The Gambia, we commend the country’s decision to uphold the ban on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), reaffirming its commitments to human rights, gender equality, and protecting the health and well-being of girls and women. “FGM involves cutting or removing some or all of the external female genitalia. Mostly carried out on infants and young girls, it can inflict severe immediate and long-term physical and psychological damage, including infection, later childbearing complications, and post-traumatic stress disorder.“The Women’s (Amendment) Act, 2015 – a pivotal milestone in advancing gender equality – is the culmination of years of advocacy, community engagement, and education aimed at eradicating this harmful practice and meeting the Sustainable Development Goal targets (5.3). It is, therefore, crucial that these legal protections remain in place. “The decision to maintain the FGM ban aligns with The Gambia's international and regional commitments to prevent harmful practices against girls and women, consistent with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the Maputo Protocol protecting African women’s rights.“In addition to recognizing this critical decision by the national parliament, we commend the tireless efforts of survivors, activists, civil society organizations, and faith-based groups working to end FGM. Upholding the ban supports these grassroots initiatives, which are pivotal in ending all forms of violence, including harmful practices, against girls and women and delivering a safer and healthier future for girls and women in The Gambia and elsewhere.  “The fragility of progress to end FGM cannot be overstated. Assaults on women’s and girls’ rights in countries around the globe have meant that hard-won gains are in danger of being lost. In some countries, advancements have stalled or reversed due pushback against girls’ and women's rights, instability, and conflict, disrupting services and prevention programmes. “That is why legislative bans on FGM, while a crucial foundation for interventions, cannot alone end FGM. Today, more than 73 per cent of girls and women aged 15 to 49 in the country have already undergone this harmful practice, with many subjected to it before their fifth birthday.  “Recent months have emphasized the need for continued advocacy to advance gender equality, end violence against girls and women, and secure the gains made to accelerate progress to end FGM. It also underscores the importance of engaging with communities and grassroots organizations, working with traditional, political, and religious leaders, training health workers, and raising awareness effectively on the harms caused by the practice.  “Supporting survivors of FGM remains as urgent as ever. Many suffer from long-term physical and psychological harm that can result from the procedure, and need comprehensive medical and psychological care to heal from the scars inflicted by this harmful practice.   “We remain steadfast in our commitment to support the government, civil society, and communities in The Gambia in the fight against FGM. Together, we must not rest until we ensure that all girls and women can live free from violence and harmful practices and that their rights, bodily integrity, and dignity are upheld.\"   About UNICEF UNICEF works in some of the world's toughest places, to reach the world's most disadvantaged children.

Of this, 209 million people lived with alcohol dependence. </p><p>\"Substance use severely harms individual health, increasing the risk of chronic diseases, mental health conditions, and tragically resulting in millions of preventable deaths every year. It places a heavy burden on families and communities, increasing exposure to accidents, injuries, and violence,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"To build a healthier, more equitable society, we must urgently commit to bold actions that reduce the negative health and social consequences of alcohol consumption and make treatment for substance use disorders accessible and affordable.\"</p><p>The report highlights the urgent need to accelerate actions globally towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)  target 3.5 by 2030 by reducing alcohol and drug consumption and improving access to quality treatment for substance use disorders.<strong></strong></p><h2>Health consequences of alcohol consumption </h2><p>The report highlights that despite some reduction in the alcohol-related death rates since 2010, the overall number of deaths due to alcohol consumption remains unacceptably high and amounts to 2.6 million in 2019, with the highest numbers in the European Region and the African region. </p><p>The death rates due to alcohol consumption per litre of alcohol consumed are highest in low-income countries and lowest in high-income countries.  </p><p>Of all deaths attributable to alcohol in 2019, an estimated 1.6 million deaths were from noncommunicable diseases, including 474 000 deaths from cardiovascular diseases and 401 000 from cancer. </p><p>Some 724 000 deaths were due to injuries, such as those from traffic crashes, self-harm and interpersonal violence. Another 284 000 deaths were linked to communicable diseases. For example, alcohol consumption has been shown to increase the risk of HIV transmission resulting from an increased risk of unprotected sex and by increasing the risk of TB infection and mortality by suppressing a wide range of immune responses.</p><p>The highest proportion (13%) of alcohol-attributable deaths in 2019 were among young people aged 20–39 years.<strong data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;--darkreader-inline-bgcolor:transparent;\"></strong></p><h2>Alcohol consumption trends</h2><p>Total alcohol per capita consumption in the world population decreased slightly from 5.7 litres in 2010 to 5.5 litres in 2019. The highest levels of per capita consumption in 2019 were observed in the WHO European Region (9.2 litres) and the Region of Americas (7.5 litres). </p><p>The level of alcohol consumption per capita among drinkers amounts on average to 27 grams of pure alcohol per day, roughly equivalent to two glasses of wine, two bottles of beer (33cl) or two servings of spirits (4cl). This level and frequency of drinking is associated with increased risks of numerous health conditions and associated mortality and disability.</p><p>In 2019, 38% of current drinkers had engaged in heavy episodic drinking, defined as consuming at least 60g of pure alcohol on one or more occasions in the preceding month – roughly equivalent to 4 or 5 glasses of wine, bottles of beer or servings of spirits. Continuous heavy drinking was highly prevalent among men. </p><p>Globally, 23.5% of all 15–19 year olds were current drinkers. Rates of current drinking were highest among 15–19-year-olds in the European region (45.9%) followed by the Americas (43.9%).<strong></strong></p><h2>Treatment gap for substance use disorders</h2><p>Effective treatment options for substance use disorders exist, but treatment coverage remains incredibly low. The proportion of people in contact with substance use treatment services ranged from less than 1% to no more than 35% in 2019, in countries providing this data. </p><p>Most of the 145 countries that reported data did not have a specific budget line or data on governmental expenditures for treatment of substance use disorders.

It marks the first neglected tropical disease to be eliminated in the country.</p><p>Chad is the first country to be acknowledged for eliminating a neglected tropical disease in 2024, becoming the 51<sup>st</sup> country to have achieved such target globally, and marking the first step beyond the midpoint to the global threshold of 100 countries set for 2030. The 100-country target is one of the four global overarching targets set by the <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240010352\" target=\"_blank\">Road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021–2030</a>. </p><p><em>“I congratulate the government and the people of Chad for this achievement. It is great to see Chad join the growing group of countries that have eliminated at least one NTD. The 100-country target is nearer and within reach” </em>said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. </p><p>Sleeping sickness can cause flu-like symptoms initially but eventually causing behaviour change, confusion, sleep cycle disturbances or even coma, often leading to death. Improved access to early diagnosis and treatment, as well as surveillance and response has proven that countries can control and eventually eliminate transmission.  </p><p>So far, seven countries have been validated by WHO for eliminating the gambiense form of human African trypanosomiasis: Togo (2020), Benin (2021), Côte d’Ivoire (2021), Uganda (2022), Equatorial Guinea (2022), Ghana (2023), and Chad (2024). The rhodesiense form of the disease has been eliminated as a public health problem in one country, Rwanda, as validated by WHO in 2022. </p><p><em>\"The elimination of the gambiense form of human African trypanosomiasis in Chad reflects our commitment to improving the health of our people. This achievement results from years of dedicated efforts by our health workers, communities, and partners. We will continue this momentum to tackle other neglected tropical diseases and ensure a healthier future for all Chadians\"</em> said Hon. Dr Abdel Modjid Abderahim Mahamat, Minister of Health, Chad.</p><p>As of June 2024, across the WHO African region, 20 countries have eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease, with Togo having eliminated 4 diseases and Benin and Ghana having eliminated 3 diseases each. </p><p><strong>Note to the editor:</strong></p><p>Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by the Trypanosoma parasite.

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) congratulates Chad for having eliminated the gambiense form of human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, as a public health problem. It marks the first neglected tropical disease to be eliminated in the country.",
          "Chad is the first country to be acknowledged for eliminating a neglected tropical disease in 2024, becoming the 51 st country to have achieved such target globally, and marking the first step beyond the midpoint to the global threshold of 100 countries set for 2030. The 100-country target is one of the four global overarching targets set by the Road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021–2030 .",
          "“I congratulate the government and the people of Chad for this achievement. It is great to see Chad join the growing group of countries that have eliminated at least one NTD. The 100-country target is nearer and within reach” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.",
          "Sleeping sickness can cause flu-like symptoms initially but eventually causing behaviour change, confusion, sleep cycle disturbances or even coma, often leading to death. Improved access to early diagnosis and treatment, as well as surveillance and response has proven that countries can control and eventually eliminate transmission.",
          "So far, seven countries have been validated by WHO for eliminating the gambiense form of human African trypanosomiasis: Togo (2020), Benin (2021), Côte d’Ivoire (2021), Uganda (2022), Equatorial Guinea (2022), Ghana (2023), and Chad (2024). The rhodesiense form of the disease has been eliminated as a public health problem in one country, Rwanda, as validated by WHO in 2022.",
          "\"The elimination of the gambiense form of human African trypanosomiasis in Chad reflects our commitment to improving the health of our people. This achievement results from years of dedicated efforts by our health workers, communities, and partners. We will continue this momentum to tackle other neglected tropical diseases and ensure a healthier future for all Chadians\" said Hon. Dr Abdel Modjid Abderahim Mahamat, Minister of Health, Chad.",
          "As of June 2024, across the WHO African region, 20 countries have eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease, with Togo having eliminated 4 diseases and Benin and Ghana having eliminated 3 diseases each.",

The report outlines the unprecedented humanitarian crisis, characterized by soaring levels of civilian mortality and morbidity, forced displacements, destruction of essential infrastructure and targeting of the health-care system. It notes that mass displacements, severe overcrowding and scant access to water, sanitation and health care for displaced people significantly increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks. It outlines the work WHO has done to respond to the crisis, including coordination of the health response with partners, and high-risk missions to hospitals to assess conditions, deliver critical supplies, coordinate the deployment of emergency medical teams, and support patient evacuation. The report calls for a ceasefire, access for humanitarian workers and aid, and adherence to international humanitarian law."

The package of amendments to the Regulations will strengthen global preparedness, surveillance and responses to public health emergencies, including pandemics.</span><br/></p><p>The historic decisions taken today demonstrate a common desire by Member States to protect their own people, and the world’s, from the shared risk of public health emergencies and future pandemics,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “The amendments to the International Health Regulations will bolster countries' ability to detect and respond to future outbreaks and pandemics by strengthening their own national capacities, and coordination between fellow States, on disease surveillance, information sharing and response. This is built on commitment to equity, an understanding that health threats do not recognize national borders, and that preparedness is a collective endeavor.\"<br/></p><p>Dr Tedros added: The decision to conclude the Pandemic Agreement within the next year demonstrates how strongly and urgently countries want it, because the next pandemic is a matter of when, not if. Today’s strengthening of the IHR provides powerful momentum to complete the Pandemic Agreement, which, once finalized, can help to prevent a repeat of the devastation to health, societies and economies caused by COVID-19.</p><p><strong></strong>The new amendments to the IHR include:</p><ul><li><strong>introducing a definition of a pandemic emergency</strong> to trigger more effective international collaboration in response to events that are at risk of becoming, or have become, a pandemic. The pandemic emergency definition represents a higher level of alarm that builds on the existing mechanisms of the IHR, including the determination of  public health emergency of international concern. According to the definition, a pandemic emergency is a communicable disease that has, or is at high risk of having, wide geographical spread to and within multiple States, exceeds or is at high risk of exceeding the capacity of health systems to respond in those States; causes, or is at high risk of causing, substantial social and/or economic disruption, including disruption to international traffic and trade; and requires rapid, equitable and enhanced coordinated international action, with whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches;</li><br/><li><strong>a commitment to solidarity and equity</strong> on strengthening access to medical products and financing. This includes establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to support identification of, and access to, financing required to “equitably address the needs and priorities of developing countries, including for developing, strengthening and maintaining core capacities,” and other pandemic emergency prevention, preparedness and response-related capacities; </li><br/><li><strong>establishment of the States Parties Committee to facilitate the effective implementation of the amended Regulations</strong>. The Committee will promote and support cooperation among States Parties for the effective implementation of the IHR; and </li><br/><li><strong>creation of National IHR Authorities</strong> to improve coordination of implementation of the Regulations within and among countries.</li></ul><p>“The experience of epidemics and pandemics, from Ebola and Zika to COVID-19 and mpox, showed us where we needed better public health surveillance, response and preparedness mechanisms around the world,” said Dr Ashley Bloomfield of New Zealand, Co-Chair of the Working Group on Amendments to the IHR (WGIHR), and of the Drafting Group that guided the negotiations of the package of amendments during the WHA. “Countries knew what had to be done and we did it. I am so proud to be a part of this.” </p><p>Fellow WGIHR Co-Chair Dr Abdullah Assiri, of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, added: “The amendments to the International Health Regulations strengthen mechanisms for our collective protections and preparedness against outbreak and pandemic emergency risks. Today’s powerful show of global support for stronger Regulations also provide a great boost for the process to negotiate a much-needed international Pandemic Agreement.”</p><h2><strong></strong><strong>Plan agreed for finalizing negotiations on a Pandemic Agreement</strong></h2><p>Countries <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA77/A77_ACONF15-en.pdf\">agreed</a> to continue negotiating the proposed Pandemic Agreement to improve international coordination, collaboration and equity to prevent, prepare for and respond to future pandemics. </p><p>WHO’s Member States decided to extend the mandate of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body, <a href=\"/news/item/01-12-2021-world-health-assembly-agrees-to-launch-process-to-develop-historic-global-accord-on-pandemic-prevention-preparedness-and-response\">established in December 2021</a>, to finish its work to negotiate a Pandemic Agreement within a year, by the World Health Assembly in 2025, or earlier if possible at a special session of the Health Assembly in 2024.</p><p>“There was a clear consensus amongst all Member States on the need for a further instrument to help the world better fight a full-blown pandemic,” said Ms Precious Matsoso of South Africa, Co-Chair of both the Pandemic Accord Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) and the Drafting Group on the INB and IHR agenda items at the WHA. </p><p>Fellow INB Co-Chair Roland Driece, from the Netherlands, said: “Today’s great result in approving amendments to the International Health Regulations will provide the momentum we need to finalize the Pandemic Agreement.

WHO responded to 72 acute and protracted graded health emergencies in 2023, including complex crises, natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks, and conflicts.  Thanks to over 900 partners, more than 107 million people across 29 countries and two regions were targeted for support by the health cluster in the reporting period. Operational impediments included restricted access for humanitarian workers and supplies, and poor funding of humanitarian response plans and for local partners. The report highlighted a critical funding gap for WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, hindering its ability to respond effectively. It called for increased and sustained funding, a more strategic approach to building long-term resilience, and stronger health systems to address future emergencies.  <br/></p><p data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>Related documents</strong></p><ul data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><li><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA77/A77_11-en.pdf\">A77/11</a> Report on WHO’s work in health emergencies; Public health emergencies: preparedness and response</li><li><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA77/A77_4-en.pdf\">A77/4</a> Consolidated report by the Director-General<br/></li></ul><p data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>Related links</strong></p><ul data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><li><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/overview\">WHO’s work in emergencies</a> </li><li><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/funding/health-emergency-appeals/2024\">WHO's Health Emergency Appeal 2024</a> </li></ul><p data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> </p><h3 data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Independent report on WHO’s work in emergencies  </h3><p data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">The Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee for the WHO Health Emergencies Programme (IOAC) is mandated to oversee and guide WHO’s work in emergencies, to advise the Director-General on issues within its mandate and to report its findings to the Health Assembly. </p><p data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">On Thursday, 30 May, delegates noted the report of the committee.

The committee noted a steep increase in humanitarian health needs globally, and WHO’s increasing role in addressing these. The committee expressed serious concerns over the ongoing spread of dengue and cholera across different regions, recommending that WHO complete a risk mapping for dengue as a matter of urgency and step up its efforts to address the global shortage of oral cholera vaccines.

The Society conducts a broad range of programmes and activities that are central to healthy ageing through a comprehensive approach that includes geriatric assessment, clinical treatment, nutritional support, rehabilitation and palliative care. It carries out innovative research on multimorbidity in older age and related biomarkers, and develops guidance and care models to support person-centred and integrated health services, dealing with issues such as access to palliative care. Results of this work include the development of local care standards on how to manage polypharmacy and hypertension among older persons with multimorbidity. These standards are applied nationwide, with training programmes reaching a range of personnel, including 4000 caregivers of older persons and over 140 000 geriatric physicians, enabling them to upgrade their skills. The Society has also pioneered the creation of standards for age-friendly hospitals.

NIMHANS involves young people as change agents within district youth-empowerment centres in order to bridge the gap between young people, their families and an ever-changing society (reaching about 6 million young people). In addition, it is engaged in a national initiative for child protection, mental health and psychosocial care (reaching more than 3 million people). Other major programmes led by the Institute include urban mental health and integrating mental health issues arising out of climate change into primary mental health care delivery, as well as training and accrediting community volunteers to deliver mental health first aid: 18 000 gatekeepers have been trained to facilitate the early identification of suicide risk and to intervene. NIMHANS has initiated numerous digital technology initiatives, including: the Digital Academy, whose courses have been followed by 2500 health care providers.

Results of this work include the development of local care standards on how to manage polypharmacy and hypertension among older persons with multimorbidity. These standards are applied nationwide, with training programmes reaching a range of personnel, including 4000 caregivers of older persons and over 140 000 geriatric physicians, enabling them to upgrade their skills. The Society has also pioneered the creation of standards for age-friendly hospitals. After piloting this work in 53 institutions, 90% of health care institutions in Beijing are now meeting these standards. The Society also works to strengthen the collaboration between those involved in academia, research and industry.",
          "Dr Ahmed Hamed Saif Al Wahaibi is a family physician who has made an important contribution to integrating high-quality care of older people within primary health care in Oman. Most recently, he has been leading the Elderly Care Section in the Primary Health Care Department of the Ministry of Health. He has contributed to the development of a national programme for older persons that provides screening, assessment and early interventions as part of primary health care for people aged 60 years and older. The programme aims to prevent diseases, provide continuity of care from health care settings to patients’ homes, maximize independence and enable older persons to have access to community resources. Building on this work, Dr Al Wahaibi has helped to develop an electronic health record system, used by a multidisciplinary team, which includes the assessment findings regarding the health status of older persons, and links these findings with the support services available within primary health care. He works to strengthen the capacity of nurses to carry out these assessments and to engage local communities in the planning, management and evaluation of the primary health care services available for older people."

          "The 2024 award was jointly bestowed to Professor Bontle Mbongwe, Botswana and the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), India",
          "The National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore, India delivers state-of-the-art clinical care, carrying out training and research as well as involving the communities it serves. It collaborates with central and state governments in framing, informing and implementing national policies and strategies such as the National Mental Health Policy (2014), the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, and the National Suicide Prevention Strategy (2022). NIMHANS involves young people as change agents within district youth-empowerment centres in order to bridge the gap between young people, their families and an ever-changing society (reaching about 6 million young people). In addition, it is engaged in a national initiative for child protection, mental health and psychosocial care (reaching more than 3 million people). Other major programmes led by the Institute include urban mental health and integrating mental health issues arising out of climate change into primary mental health care delivery, as well as training and accrediting community volunteers to deliver mental health first aid: 18 000 gatekeepers have been trained to facilitate the early identification of suicide risk and to intervene. NIMHANS has initiated numerous digital technology initiatives, including: the Digital Academy, whose courses have been followed by 2500 health care providers. A national helpline for psychosocial support and mental health services was launched during the first wave of COVID-19. In 2022, the Institute established the National Tele Mental Health Programme to provide equitable, affordable and high-quality mental health care across all Indian States.",
          "Professor Bontle Mbongwe from Botswana is a renowned public health advocate and a passionate tobacco control activist. Through country-level consultations that she initiated during the negotiation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, Botswana’s Control of Smoking Act, 1992, was amended in 2004 to restrict smoking in public places to protect children, pregnant women and workers, raise the minimum-age restrictions for selling tobacco products, prohibiting their sale to persons under 18 years and ban tobacco advertising and promotion. In 2008, Professor Mbongwe’s research contributed to influencing government policies away from the use of mercury-containing devices in health care facilities towards mercury-free alternatives. In 2014, she boldly challenged the tobacco industry by successfully advocating for the introduction of a 30% tobacco levy in Botswana. She then contributed to the country’s Tobacco Control Act, 2021. Her relentless work helped raising of the minimum-age restriction for selling tobacco products, prohibiting their sale to persons under 21 years, banning the sale of single sticks of cigarettes as well as requiring tobacco products to be sold by licensed persons only. She established the first civil society Anti-Tobacco Network in Botswana and plays an important role in building a network of media and nongovernmental organizations committed to tobacco control in her home country as well as in the rest of Africa and beyond."

The latest data of 2022 from the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation indicate that more than 150 000 solid organ transplants (≤ 10% of global needs) are performed worldwide annually, which is an increase of 52% compared with 2010.",

          "WHO is tasked to develop a global strategy on donation and transplantation, to be presented to the Assembly for adoption in 2026.

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) launched its first-ever  <a href=\"/about/funding/invest-in-who/investment-round\">Investment Round</a> on Sunday as part of a broader plan to transform the way the Organization is funded heading into an era of climate change, mass migration, pandemic threats, an ageing world population, and turbulent geopolitics.</p><p>The launch, on the eve of the Seventy-Seventh World Health Assembly, marks the start of a year-long series of engagements and events, co-hosted by countries, where Member States and other donors will be invited to contribute funds to WHO’s strategy for 2025 through 2028 and show high-level political commitment to WHO and global health. </p><p>The Investment Round will culminate in November with a major pledging event to be hosted by Brazil around the G20 Leaders’ Summit.</p><p>“It’s about ensuring WHO is fully funded and improving the quality of the funding we receive. Much of the funding we receive is unpredictable, reactive, and tightly defined,” Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, opening the high-level event on the eve of the Health Assembly. “The Investment Round aims to change that, by generating funding that is more flexible, predictable, and resilient.”</p><p>WHO’s third investment case, to be launched at the Health Assembly on Tuesday 28 May, estimates that full funding of the strategy, the <a href=\"/about/general-programme-of-work/fourteenth\">Fourteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 14)</a>, will contribute to saving 40 million lives from 2025-2028.</p><h2><strong>High-level support for Investment Round</strong></h2><p>During Sunday’s high-level event, the Government of Brazil announced that as part of its G20 presidency, the country will host high-level events including at the Leaders’ Summit in November to support the Investment Round and rally countries to join the initiative. </p><p>“Global problems need global solutions, and no other organization has turned out to be in a better position to provide us a chance to come to global solutions,” Brazil’s Minister of Health Nísia Trindade said in a video address. “We will use the convening power of G20 to help mobilize efforts to make the Investment Round a success.” </p><p>Qatar Minister of Health Dr Hanan Mohamed Al Kuwari announced a contribution of US$ 4 million in fully flexible funds to the Investment Round, and an intention to contribute further.</p><p>“Health care is a fundamental human right and we must continue to invest in the World Health Organization to safeguard our health. Unity is the key to our success,” Dr Mohamed Al Kuwari said.</p><p>France, Germany, and Norway announced that they would serve as co-hosts for the Investment Round. </p><p>“The WHO must be the guardian of scientific rigour, the whistleblower, and above all, the orchestra conductor, in Geneva and in each of its Member States, of the actions of all those involved in global health,” said Frédéric Valletoux, Minister Delegate in charge of Health and Prevention, France.</p><p>“We as Member States need to deliver more predictable, more flexible, and sufficient funding of the WHO,” Norway’s Health Minister Jan Christian Vestre said. “Norway is committed to co-host the Investment Round, which will be an important step in securing the Organization more sustainable financing.” </p><p>Further statements of support for the Investment Round came from Dr Gabriel Leung representing the Institute of Philanthropy, and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is WHO’s Ambassador for Global Health Financing.</p><p>Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley accepted a Global Health Leaders Award for lifetime achievement from WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and gave a statement supporting the WHO Investment Round and noting how important it was for Small Island Developing States.</p><p>“We live in a world where we ought to know better, and I say so on the launch of this Investment Round largely because what is being asked for is miniscule in proportion to where money is being spent elsewhere,” Ms Mottley said.<strong></strong></p><p>As part of Sunday’s event, prizes were awarded to winners of the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of WHO’s Health for All Film Festival by Indian actor, filmmaker and social advocate Nandita Das, a member of the distinguished international festival jury.</p><p>The launch event featured performances by internationally-acclaimed Egyptian opera singer Farrah El-Dibany and Franco-American pianist Jeff Cohen.</p><p>A post-event reception was hosted by Germany at WHO headquarters, opened by Karl Lauterbach, Federal Minister of Health. The reception also featured remarks from basketball star and childhood obesity control champion Pau Gasol, and a performance by Sherrie Silver, choreographer, dancer, actor, UN development advocate and philanthropist, and a troupe of young dancers.</p><h2><strong>Matching WHO’s funding to its obligations</strong></h2><p>The WHO Executive Board approved the Investment Round in January, noting that funding had not kept pace with the Organization’s mandate to promote well-being, prevent disease, expand access to health care, and coordinate the world’s response to a growing number of health emergencies brought on by war, disease outbreaks, and natural disasters.</p><p>By 2022-23, Member States’ assessed contributions (membership dues) covered only 13% of WHO’s budget, which left the Organization reliant on voluntary, often earmarked and unpredictable contributions to fund its work, a dynamic that created uncertainty and inefficiency across the Organization and left areas where approved activities went unfunded.</p><p>Holding an Investment Round was one of the key recommendations put forward by the Member State-led WHO Working Group on Sustainable Financing and approved by Member States to make WHO a predictably, sustainably, flexibly funded organization. Member States have also approved an increase in their assessed contributions, on the pathway to providing 50% of WHO’s base budget by 2030. With the Investment Round, WHO is seeking to expand its donor base by mobilizing new contributions from the WHO Member States that have not yet provided voluntary contributions and by tapping into new private sector donors through the WHO Foundation. <br/></p>",

          "The WHO Executive Board approved the Investment Round in January, noting that funding had not kept pace with the Organization’s mandate to promote well-being, prevent disease, expand access to health care, and coordinate the world’s response to a growing number of health emergencies brought on by war, disease outbreaks, and natural disasters.",
          "By 2022-23, Member States’ assessed contributions (membership dues) covered only 13% of WHO’s budget, which left the Organization reliant on voluntary, often earmarked and unpredictable contributions to fund its work, a dynamic that created uncertainty and inefficiency across the Organization and left areas where approved activities went unfunded.",
          "Holding an Investment Round was one of the key recommendations put forward by the Member State-led WHO Working Group on Sustainable Financing and approved by Member States to make WHO a predictably, sustainably, flexibly funded organization. Member States have also approved an increase in their assessed contributions, on the pathway to providing 50% of WHO’s base budget by 2030. With the Investment Round, WHO is seeking to expand its donor base by mobilizing new contributions from the WHO Member States that have not yet provided voluntary contributions and by tapping into new private sector donors through the WHO Foundation."

The awards were announced today at a special event launching WHO’s Investment Round on the eve of the Seventy-Seventh World Health Assembly in Geneva.</p><p>The event, opened by WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and attended by High-Level Representatives of Member States and celebrities from the cinema and arts domain, saw winning films announced for eight different categories, while three films received special mentions from the jury.</p><p>This is the fifth year of the Film Festival which received almost 1000 entries from filmmakers around the world on issues ranging from gender equity and war trauma to burnout, climate change and healthy ageing. Of these, 61 shortlisted films were judged by a panel of distinguished professionals, artists and activists, including renowned actors and advocates, Nandita Das, Sharon Stone and Alfonso Herrera; filmmaker and producer, Apolline Traoré; Olympic swimmer and UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Yusra Mardini; multidisciplinary artist, Mário Macilau; and film director, Paul Jerndal. They were joined by senior United Nations officials and WHO staff.</p><p>“WHO’s Health for All Film Festival gathers many powerful stories about a variety of health experiences from people from all over the world,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Listening to the stories of people affected by health issues helps us to understand people’s lived experiences and move towards achieving better health for all.”</p><p>From the official selection, one “Grand Prix”<em> </em>is awarded for each of the three main competition categories: Universal health coverage, Health emergencies, and Better health and well-being, which align with <a href=\"/data/stories/the-triple-billion-targets-a-visual-summary-of-methods-to-deliver-impact\">WHO’s Triple Billion Targets</a>.</p><p>Nandita Das, Indian actor, filmmaker and social advocate, who has served twice on the jury of the Cannes Film Festival and has acted in more than 40 feature films in 10 different languages said: “I am delighted to be a juror for WHO’s Health For All Film Festival. Films can create awareness, challenge prejudices, ask uncomfortable questions and tell stories that need to be told. Health is personally and collectively, our right and responsibility. So to celebrate films that focus on these issues is important. I am glad that l have the opportunity to announce the winners of the 5th edition of this annual event.”</p><p>Four special prizes were also given for a Student-produced film, a film on Physical Activity and Health, a film on Migrants and Refugees Health and a Very Short Film.</p><p>The theme of mental health featured heavily in this year’s winning entries, including a powerful and moving short film from France about the difficulties of supporting a relative diagnosed with a severe disease. The film depicts a 14-year-old who copes with heavy responsibilities while living alone with her mother, who has cancer. </p><p>Another winning film, from Türkiye, captures the survival and recovery of a young Syrian refugee mother in southern Türkiye who spent five days trapped under building rubble in the aftermath of the earthquakes of 6 February 2023. The moving film details her rehabilitation progress including learning to walk again.<br/> </p><h2>List of films awarded</h2><p><strong>Universal Health Coverage \"Grand Prix\": <em>“The Visionary Women of Indonesia”</em></strong> – Indonesia / Disabilities; Blindness; Rehabilitation<br/>Directed by Nalin Narang (Australia) from The Fred Hollows Foundation / Documentary – Duration 5’10’’</p><p><strong>Health Emergencies \"Grand Prix\": <em>“Journey Beyond the Rubble”</em></strong>– Türkiye / Natural disasters; Earthquake; Internally displaced persons<br/>Directed by Mumen Sayed Issa and Atheer Salem Bahr (Türkiye) from the Independent Doctors Association / Documentary – Duration 7’09’’</p><p><strong>Better Health and Well-being</strong><strong></strong><strong>\"Grand Prix\":  </strong><strong>Equal place </strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong><em>“Color”</em></strong> – Spain / Gender equity<br/>Directed by Eva Jakubovska (Poland/Spain) / Fiction – Duration 8’</p><p><em><strong>“The Pure”</strong></em> <em>– Iran</em> / Social determinants of health; Access to hygiene<br/>Directed by Masoud Mashouf (Iran) / Fiction – Duration 4’37’’</p><p><strong>Special Prize Physical Activity and Health Film: <em>\"Ping Pong Parkinsons”</em></strong> – United States of America / Mental health; Parkinson; Physical activity<br/>Directed by Dave Steck (United States of America) from Numeric Pictures company / Documentary - Duration 3’06’’</p><p><strong>Special Prize Migrants and Refugees Health Film: <em>“Dalal's Story”</em></strong> – Iraq / Trauma; War; Refugees health; Mental health <br/>Directed by Alexandra Cordukes from Laundry Lane Productions (Australia) / Animation – Duration 6’15’’</p><p><strong>Student Film Prize: <em>“Mom &amp; Me, and that...

Between 2019 and 2021, global life expectancy dropped by 1.8 years to 71.4 years (back to the level of 2012). Similarly, global healthy life expectancy dropped by 1.5 years to 61.9 years in 2021 (back to the level of 2012).</p><p>The 2024 report also highlights how the effects have been felt unequally across the world. The WHO regions for the Americas and South-East Asia were hit hardest, with life expectancy dropping by approximately 3 years and healthy life expectancy by 2.5 years between 2019 and 2021. In contrast, the Western Pacific Region was minimally affected during the first two years of the pandemic, with losses of less than 0.1 years in life expectancy and 0.2 years in healthy life expectancy. </p><p>“There continues to be major progress in global health, with billions of people who are enjoying better health, better access to services, and better protection from health emergencies,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “But we must remember how fragile progress can be. In just two years, the COVID-19 pandemic erased a decade of gains in life expectancy. That's why the new Pandemic Agreement is so important: not only to strengthen global health security, but to protect long-term investments in health and promote equity within and between countries.”</p><h3>Noncommunicable diseases remain the top killer</h3><p>COVID-19 rapidly emerged as a leading cause of death, ranking as the third highest cause of mortality globally in 2020 and the second in 2021. Nearly 13 million lives were lost during this period. The latest estimates reveal that except in the African and Western Pacific regions, COVID-19 was among the top five causes of deaths, notably becoming the leading cause of death in the Americas for both years. </p><p>The WHO report also highlights that noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as ischemic heart disease and stroke, cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and diabetes were the biggest killers before the pandemic, responsible for 74% of all deaths in 2019. Even during the pandemic, NCDs continued to account for 78% of non-COVID deaths. </p><h3>Increasing obesity and malnutrition</h3><p>The world faces a massive and complex problem of a double burden of malnutrition, where undernutrition coexists with overweight and obesity. In 2022, over one billion people aged five years and older were living with obesity, while more than half a billion were underweight. Malnutrition in children was also striking, with 148 million children under five years old affected by stunting (too short for age), 45 million suffering from wasting (too thin for height), and 37 million overweight. </p><p>The report further highlights the significant health challenges faced by persons with disabilities, refugees and migrants. In 2021, about 1.3 billion people, or 16% of the global population, had disability. This group is disproportionately affected by health inequities resulting from avoidable, unjust and unfair conditions. </p><p>Access to healthcare for refugees and migrants remains limited, with only half of the 84 countries surveyed between 2018 and 2021 providing government-funded health services to these groups at levels comparable to their citizens. This highlights the urgent need for health systems to adapt and address the persisting inequities and changing demographic needs of global populations.</p><h3>Progress towards the Triple Billion targets and SDGs</h3><p>Despite setbacks caused by the pandemic, the world has made some progress towards achieving the Triple Billion targets and health-related indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p><p>Since 2018, an additional 1.5 billion people achieved better health and well-being. Despite gains, rising obesity, high tobacco use and persistent air pollution hinder progress. </p><p>Universal Health Coverage expanded to 585 million more people, falling short of the goal for one billion. Additionally, only 777 million more people are likely to be adequately protected during health emergencies by 2025, falling short of the one billion target set in WHO’s 13<sup>th</sup> General Programme of Work. This protection is increasingly important as the effects of climate change and other global crises increasingly threaten health security.</p><p>“While we have made progress towards the Triple Billion targets since 2018, a lot still needs to be done. Data is WHO’s superpower. We need to use it better to deliver more impact in countries,” said Dr Samira Asma, WHO Assistant Director-General for Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact. “Without accelerating progress, it is unlikely that any of the health SDGs will be met by 2030.”</p><h3>Editors’ note:</h3><p>The <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/data/gho/publications/world-health-statistics\">World Health Statistics report</a> is WHO’s annual compilation of the most recent available data on health and health-related indicators.

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Task Team on Climate Change, Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) and Malaria, in partnership with Reaching the Last Mile (RLM), has released a major scoping review published in <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://academic.oup.com/trstmh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/trstmh/trae026/7656506?searchresult=1\">Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</a>. The review of 42 693 articles reveals that there is not yet sufficient understanding of the actual and potential impacts of human-induced changes to climate patterns on malaria and NTDs. <strong></strong></p><p>Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns are altering the spread of vector-borne diseases,  with significant implications for human health and placing additional strain on systems. As the geographic range of disease vectors like mosquitoes expands, so does the risk of introducing – or reintroducing – these diseases to new, unprepared areas. The findings of this review highlight that these shifts in prevalence, incidence, range and intensity of malaria and a number of NTDs may be felt hardest in those communities already disproportionately impacted by them.     </p><p>“The findings presented in this major review highlight the need for more comprehensive, collaborative, and standardized modelling, so that we can better understand and predict the effects of climate change on malaria and NTDs, both directly and indirectly,” said Dr Ibrahima Socé Fall, Director of WHO’s Global NTD Programme, who led the study. “This important and timely review reveals alarming trends and is a call to urgent action. Malaria transmission is likely to shift both polewards and to higher altitude, while the mosquito vector responsible for transmission of dengue and chikungunya is predicted to continue to expand its range. If we are to protect and build upon the hard-won victories of the past two decades, the time to mobilize is now.”</p><p>Despite this, the paper highlights that published research has too often focused on low-disease burden countries with High Access to Quality Healthcare (using HAQI measurement). Given that the effects of climate change on malaria and NTDs will vary significantly by disease and location, exhibiting non-linear patterns and evolving over time, this focus presents what the Task Team calls a growing emergency for the communities that have been historically underserved in relation to these long-overlooked diseases. </p><p>“The climate crisis has the potential to reverse decades of progress in global health and development, said Tala Al-Ramahi, Chief Strategy Officer of Reaching the Last Mile. “Greater investment in research is urgently needed to support the development of timely and evidence-based interventions, and to allow us to anticipate and mitigate the worst consequences of climate change on human health.”</p><p>With just 34% of studies reviewed (174 studies) addressing mitigation strategies and 5% (24 studies) looking at adaptation methods, this review further highlights the lack of evidence required to protect the gains made against malaria and NTDs in recent decades. Our collective progress could unravel at the hands of a climate in crisis. </p><p>“We have recently seen the consequences of extreme weather events on malaria, and they are only predicted to become more commonplace. The paper provides a clarion call for mitigation and evidence responsive adaptation to climate change,” said Dr Daniel Ngamije Madandi, Director of the WHO’s Global Malaria Programme. “As the impact of climate change is likely to be disproportionately borne by the poorest people, who are also disproportionately affected by malaria and NTDs, a more equitable, comprehensive and sustainable response is needed.”</p><p>In order to assess the impact of climate change on malaria and NTDs, this state-of-the-art scoping review analysed peer-reviewed papers and grey literature published between January 2010 and October 2023, with investigators summarizing the identified data and analysing the distribution of studies by country. </p><p>In total, 42 693 records were retrieved, from which 1543 full-text papers were examined. Researchers correlated the number of publications with national disease burdens, the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQI), and climate vulnerability scores. Of the 511 papers that met the inclusion criteria, 185 papers addressed malaria, 181 focused on dengue and chikungunya, and 53 reported outcomes on leishmaniasis. Other NTDs, however, were significantly under-represented, having not been sufficiently studied. </p><p><strong><em># # #</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p><h3>Note to the editor</h3><p>“Climate change, malaria and neglected tropical diseases: a scoping review” is published in the <em>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</em> (2024; 0: 1–18).

In 2022, WHO Member States set out an ambitious target of reducing the annual number of adult syphilis infections by ten-fold by 2030, from 7.1 million to 0.71 million. Yet, new syphilis cases among adults aged 15-49 years increased by over 1 million in 2022 reaching 8 million. The highest increases occurred in the Region for the Americas and the African Region. </p><p>Combined with insufficient decline seen in the reduction of new HIV and viral hepatitis infections, the report flags threats to the attainment of the related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.</p><p>“The rising incidence of syphilis raises major concerns”, said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Fortunately, there has been important progress on a number of other fronts including in accelerating access to critical health commodities including diagnostics and treatment. We have the tools required to end these epidemics as public health threats by 2030, but we now need to ensure that, in the context of an increasingly complex world, countries do all they can to achieve the ambitious targets they set themselves”. </p><h2>Increasing incidence of sexually transmitted infections</h2><p>Four curable STIs – syphilis (<em>Treponema pallidum</em>), gonorrhea (<em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>), chlamydia (<em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>), and trichomoniasis (<em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>) – account for over 1 million infections daily. The report notes a surge in adult and maternal syphilis (1.1 million) and associated congenital syphilis (523 cases per 100 000 live births per year) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, there were 230 000 syphilis-related deaths.</p><p>New data also show an increase in multi-resistant gonorrhoea. As of 2023, out of 87 countries where enhanced gonorrhoea antimicrobial resistance surveillance was conducted, 9 countries reported elevated levels (from 5% to 40%) resistance to ceftriaxone, the last line treatment for gonorrhoea. WHO is monitoring the situation and has updated its recommended treatment to reduce the spread of this multi-resistant gonorrhoea strain. </p><p>In 2022, around 1.2 million new hepatitis B cases and nearly 1 million new hepatitis C cases were recorded. The estimated number of deaths from viral hepatitis rose from 1.1 million in 2019 to 1.3 million in 2022 despite effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment tools. </p><p>New HIV infections only reduced from 1.5 million in 2020 to 1.3 million in 2022. Five key population groups — men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, sex workers, transgender individuals, and individuals in prisons and other closed settings — still experience significantly higher HIV prevalence rates than the general population. An estimated 55% of new HIV infections occur among these populations and their partners. HIV-related deaths continue to be high. In 2022, there were 630 000 HIV related deaths, 13% of these occurring in children under the age of 15 years.</p><h2>Gains in expanding service access <br/></h2><p>Efforts by countries and partners to expand STIs, HIV and hepatitis services are bringing formidable gains. WHO has validated 19 countries for eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV and/or syphilis, reflecting investments in testing and treatment coverage for these diseases among pregnant women. Botswana and Namibia are on the path to eliminating HIV, with Namibia being the first country to submit a dossier to be evaluated for the triple elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis.<br/></p><p>Globally, HIV treatment coverage reached 76%, with 93% of people receiving treatment achieving suppressed viral loads. Efforts to increase HPV vaccination and screening for women with HIV are ongoing.

WHO’s revised Programme Budget for 2022–2023 was US$ 6726.1 million,\r\n    incorporating lessons learned from the pandemic response and addressing\r\n    emerging health priorities.  <o:p></o:p><br/></p><p>With 96% of WHO country offices providing 174 country\r\n    reports on achievements, the report shows progress towards 46 targets and\r\n    highlights challenges. <br/></p><h2>Triple billion targets <o:p></o:p></h2><p>“The world is off track to reach most of the triple billion\r\n    targets and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals,” said Dr Tedros\r\n    Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “However, with concrete and\r\n    concerted action to accelerate progress, we could still achieve a substantial\r\n    subset of them. Our goal is to invest even more resources where they matter\r\n    most—at the country level—while ensuring sustainable and flexible financing to\r\n    support our mission.” <o:p></o:p><br/></p><p>The report shows advancement in several key areas,\r\n    including healthier populations, universal health coverage (UHC), and health\r\n    emergencies protection. <o:p></o:p><br/></p><p>Related to healthier populations, the current trajectory\r\n    indicates the target of 1 billion more people enjoying better health and\r\n    well-being will likely be met by 2025, driven primarily by improvements in air\r\n    quality and access to water, sanitation and hygiene measures. <o:p></o:p><br/></p><p>In terms of UHC, 30% of countries are moving ahead in\r\n    coverage of essential health services and providing financial protection.

Further details on the publicly available data reviewed by the TAG-CO-VAC can be found in the accompanying data annex. Unpublished and/or confidential data reviewed by the TAG-CO-VAC are not shown.</p><h2>Summary of available evidence<br/></h2><ul><li>SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate and evolve; there are genetic changes in important regions of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.</li><li>As of April 2024, nearly all (&gt;94%) SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences in publicly available databases are derived from JN.1, and these variants continue to displace existing XBB lineage variants (e.g. EG.5). This displacement indicates greater fitness of JN.1 derived variants as compared to other circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in the human population. </li><li>Several JN.1 derived variants (e.g. JN.1.13.1, JN.1.11.1, KP.2) have independently evolved changes in the spike protein at epitopes involving amino acid residues 346 and/or 456. Substitutions at these amino acid residues have been identified in previous SARS-CoV-2 variants (e.g. R346T in BQ.1 and XBB; F456L in EG.5 and HK.3) and are within epitopes known to be targeted by neutralizing antibodies. </li><li>Given the displacement of XBB lineage variants by JN.1 derived variants, it is likely that, in the near-term, circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants will be derived from JN.1.</li><li>In immunologically naïve animal and human sera, XBB.1.5 and JN.1 are antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants. In non-naïve animals and humans, post-monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination sera, with or without recent prior infection, neutralize XBB.1.5 and its derivatives including EG.5, HK.3, HV.1, as well as BA.2.86 and JN.1. However, neutralization titres against JN.1 in published and unpublished studies were typically lower (2-5-fold) than those against the homologous XBB.1.5 immunizing antigen. There are further reductions in cross neutralization of JN.1 variants with F456L and/or R346T substitutions.</li><li>Secondary analysis of published immunogenicity data demonstrates that an additional vaccine dose with an updated vaccine antigen results in an average 40% increase in neutralizing antibodies to that variant as compared to vaccines with a previous vaccine antigen. Using statistical modeling, the predicted additional effectiveness of a vaccine dose with an updated vaccine antigen may be approximately 23-33% against severe disease as compared to a previous vaccine antigen and 11-25% against symptomatic disease.</li><li>In a context of high infection- and vaccine-derived immunity in the population, contemporary vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates are mostly relative (rVE), rather than absolute (comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals), and demonstrate the added protection of recent vaccination over and above pre-existing infection- and vaccine-derived immunity:<ul><li>Bivalent (index virus and BA.1- or BA.4/5) mRNA vaccines and a Beta-based protein vaccine continue to offer protection against severe disease during periods of XBB descendent lineage circulation. Protection against symptomatic disease and infection is lower and wanes more rapidly over several months. </li><li>Monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccines were introduced into some vaccination programmes in the last quarter of 2023. Protection against severe disease during periods of XBB descendent lineage circulation is high during the first three months after vaccination, but protection against symptomatic disease is lower. </li><li>There are fewer studies estimating rVE for the monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccines during periods of JN.1 descendent lineage circulation. These initial studies show some additional protection offered during the first three months after vaccination, but point towards a slight reduction in VE against JN.1, as compared to XBB.1 lineage variants, for protection against severe and symptomatic disease. These observations are consistent with reductions in neutralizing antibody titres observed in preclinical and clinical immunogenicity studies of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee sera against JN.1 derived variants.</li></ul></li><li>Preclinical data shared confidentially with the TAG-CO-VAC by vaccine manufacturers show that immunization of naïve mice, as well as mice previously immunized with SARS-CoV-2 variants, with monovalent JN.1-containing vaccine candidates elicits higher neutralizing antibody responses to JN.1 and its emerging descendent variants, as compared to responses elicited by currently approved vaccines. A single immunogenicity study in humans of a monovalent JN.1-containing vaccine candidate suggests that a JN.1 vaccine antigen is likely to produce higher neutralising antibodies to co-circulating JN.1 variants (e.g., KP.2) than an XBB.1.5 or related vaccine antigen.</li></ul><p>The TAG-CO-VAC acknowledges several limitations of the available data: </p><ul><li>There are persistent and increasing gaps in genetic/genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 globally, including low numbers of samples sequenced and limited geographic diversity. The TAG-CO-VAC strongly supports the establishment of the WHO <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/groups/who-coronavirus-network\">Coronavirus Network</a> (CoViNet) to help address this information gap.</li><li>The trajectory of further SARS-CoV-2 evolution indicates that JN.1 will likely be the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 variants, in the near term. However, the timing, specific mutations and antigenic characteristics, and the potential public health impact of newly emerged (e.g. KP.2) and future variants remain unknown. The TAG-CO-VAC strongly supports the ongoing work of the TAG-VE. </li><li>Although neutralizing antibody titres have been shown to be important correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and of estimates of vaccine effectiveness, there are multiple components of immune protection elicited by infection and/or vaccination. Data on the immune responses following XBB or JN.1 descendent lineage infection or XBB.1.5 vaccination are largely restricted to neutralizing antibodies and data on other aspects of the immune response, including cellular immunity, are limited. </li><li>Immunogenicity data against currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants are not available for all COVID-19 vaccines. </li><li>Estimates of rVE against recently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including XBB or JN.1 descendent lineages, are limited in terms of the number of studies, geographic diversity, vaccine platforms evaluated, populations assessed, duration of follow-up and comparative estimates for monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccines versus other formulations delivered during the same time period. </li></ul><h2>Recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition<br/></h2><p>As of April 2024, nearly all circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants reported in publicly available databases are JN.1 derived variants. As virus evolution is expected to continue from JN.1, future formulations of COVID-19 vaccines should aim to induce enhanced neutralizing antibody responses to JN.1 and its descendent lineages. One approach recommended by TAG-CO-VAC is the use of a <strong>monovalent JN.1 lineage</strong> (GenBank: PP298019, GISAID: EPI_ISL_18872762) antigen in vaccines.</p><p>The continued use of the current monovalent XBB.1.5 formulation will offer protection given the neutralizing antibody responses to early JN.1 descendent lineages, and the evidence from early rVE studies against JN.1. However, it is expected that the ability for XBB.1.5 vaccination to protect against symptomatic disease may be less robust as SARS-CoV-2 evolution continues from JN.1. Other formulations and/or platforms that achieve robust neutralizing antibody responses against currently circulating variants, particularly JN.1 descendent lineages, can also be considered.</p><p>In accordance with <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1\">WHO SAGE policy</a>, vaccination programmes should continue to use any of the WHO emergency-use listed or prequalified COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination should not be delayed in anticipation of access to vaccines with an updated composition. WHO stresses the importance of access to and equity in the use of all available COVID-19 vaccines.</p><h2>Further data requirements and considerations<em> </em></h2><p>Given the limitations of the evidence upon which the recommendations above are derived and the anticipated continued evolution of the virus, the TAG-CO-VAC strongly encourages generation of data on immune responses and clinical endpoints (i.e. VE) on the performance of all currently approved COVID-19 vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, and candidate vaccines with an updated antigen over time.</p><p>As previously stated, the TAG-CO-VAC continues to encourage the further development of vaccines that may improve protection against infection and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. </p><h2><em>Note to editors:</em> <br/></h2><p>On 7 May 2024, the following text in this statement:</p><p>\"One approach recommended by TAG-CO-VAC is the use of a monovalent JN.1 lineage (GenBank: OY817255.1, GISAID: EPI_ISL_18538117, WHO Biohub: 2024-WHO-LS-001) antigen in vaccines.\"</p><p>was replaced with:</p><p>\"One approach recommended by TAG-CO-VAC is the use of a monovalent JN.1 lineage (GISAID: EPI_ISL_19096142, WHO Biohub: 2024-WHO-LS-001) antigen in vaccines.\" <br/></p> <p>The GenBank and GISAID accession numbers of the virus sequence given as an example JN.1 lineage in the version of the statement published on 26 April 2024 lacked an insertion in the spike N-terminal domain (i.e. ins16MPLF) that is usually present in JN.1 and its descendent lineages.

In non-naïve animals and humans, post-monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination sera, with or without recent prior infection, neutralize XBB.1.5 and its derivatives including EG.5, HK.3, HV.1, as well as BA.2.86 and JN.1. However, neutralization titres against JN.1 in published and unpublished studies were typically lower (2-5-fold) than those against the homologous XBB.1.5 immunizing antigen. There are further reductions in cross neutralization of JN.1 variants with F456L and/or R346T substitutions.",
          "Secondary analysis of published immunogenicity data demonstrates that an additional vaccine dose with an updated vaccine antigen results in an average 40% increase in neutralizing antibodies to that variant as compared to vaccines with a previous vaccine antigen. Using statistical modeling, the predicted additional effectiveness of a vaccine dose with an updated vaccine antigen may be approximately 23-33% against severe disease as compared to a previous vaccine antigen and 11-25% against symptomatic disease.",
          "In a context of high infection- and vaccine-derived immunity in the population, contemporary vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates are mostly relative (rVE), rather than absolute (comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals), and demonstrate the added protection of recent vaccination over and above pre-existing infection- and vaccine-derived immunity: Bivalent (index virus and BA.1- or BA.4/5) mRNA vaccines and a Beta-based protein vaccine continue to offer protection against severe disease during periods of XBB descendent lineage circulation. Protection against symptomatic disease and infection is lower and wanes more rapidly over several months. Monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccines were introduced into some vaccination programmes in the last quarter of 2023. Protection against severe disease during periods of XBB descendent lineage circulation is high during the first three months after vaccination, but protection against symptomatic disease is lower. There are fewer studies estimating rVE for the monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccines during periods of JN.1 descendent lineage circulation. These initial studies show some additional protection offered during the first three months after vaccination, but point towards a slight reduction in VE against JN.1, as compared to XBB.1 lineage variants, for protection against severe and symptomatic disease. These observations are consistent with reductions in neutralizing antibody titres observed in preclinical and clinical immunogenicity studies of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee sera against JN.1 derived variants.",

The vaccine and emergency vaccination activities are funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which funds the global meningitis vaccine stockpile, and supports lower-income countries with routine vaccination against meningitis.  </p><p>Nigeria is one of the 26 meningitis hyper-endemic countries of Africa, situated in the area known as the African Meningitis Belt. Last year, there was a 50% jump in annual meningitis cases reported across Africa. </p><p>In Nigeria, an outbreak of <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> (meningococcus) serogroup C outbreak led to 1742 suspected meningitis cases, including 101 confirmed cases and 153 deaths in seven of 36 Nigerian states (Adamawa, Bauchi, Gombe, Jigawa, Katsina, Yobe, Zamfara) between 1 October 2023 and 11 March 2024. To quell the deadly outbreak, a vaccination campaign has been undertaken on 25--28 March 2024 to initially reach more than one million people aged 1-29 years.</p><p>Meningitis is a serious infection that leads to the inflammation of the membranes (meninges) that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord. There are multiple causes of meningitis, including viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic pathogens. Symptoms often include headache, fever and stiff neck. Bacterial meningitis is the most serious, can also result in septicaemia (blood poisoning), and can seriously disable or kill within 24 hours those that contract it.  </p><p>“Meningitis is an old and deadly foe, but this new vaccine holds the potential to change the trajectory of the disease, preventing future outbreaks and saving many lives,” said<strong> Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General</strong>. “Nigeria’s rollout brings us one step closer to our goal to eliminate meningitis by 2030.”</p><p>The revolutionary new vaccine offers a powerful shield against the five major strains of the meningococcal bacteria (A, C, W, Y and X) in a single shot. All five strains cause meningitis and blood poisoning. This provides broader protection than the current vaccine used in much of Africa, which is only effective against the A strain. </p><p>The new vaccine has the potential to significantly reduce meningitis cases and advance progress in defeating meningitis. This is especially important for countries like Nigeria where multiple serogroups are prevalent. The new vaccine uses the same technology as the meningitis A conjugate vaccine (MenAfriVac®), which wiped out meningococcal A epidemics in Nigeria. </p><p>“Northern Nigeria, particularly the states of Jigawa, Bauchi and Yobe were badly hit by the deadly outbreak of meningitis, and this vaccine provides health workers with a new tool to both stop this outbreak but also put the country on a path to elimination,” said<strong> Prof. Muhammad Ali Pate of the Nigerian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare</strong>. “We’ve done a lot of work preparing health workers and the health system for the rollout of this new vaccine. We got an invaluable support from our populations despite this fasting period and from our community leaders especially the Emir of Gumel in Jigawa state who personally launched the vaccination campaign in the state. We’ll be monitoring progress closely and hopefully expanding the immunization in the coming months and years to accelerate progress.”</p><p>This new multivalent conjugate vaccine was 13 years in the making and was based on a partnership between PATH and the Serum Institute of India. Financing from the UK government’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office was critical to its development. </p><p>In July 2023, WHO prequalified the new Men5CV vaccine (which has brand name MenFive®) and in October 2023 issued an official recommendation to countries to introduce the new vaccine. Gavi allocated resources for the Men5CV rollout in December 2023, which is currently available for outbreak response through the emergency stockpile managed by the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision, while roll-out through mass preventive campaigns is expected to start in 2025 across countries of the Meningitis Belt.  </p><p>“The rollout of one million vaccines in northern Nigeria will help save lives, prevent long-term illness and boost our goal of defeating meningitis globally by 2030,” said <strong>Andrew Mitchell, UK Minister for Development and Africa.</strong> “This is exactly the kind of scientific innovation, supported by the UK, which I hope is replicated in years to come to help us drive further breakthroughs, including wiping out other diseases.”</p><p>WHO has been supporting the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) in responding to the meningitis outbreak in the country. This includes disease surveillance, active case finding, sample testing, and case management. WHO and partners have also played a vital role in supporting Nigeria to prepare for the rollout of the new vaccine and training health workers. </p><p>“Year after year, meningococcal meningitis has tormented countries across Africa,” said <strong>Dr Nanthalile Mugala, PATH's Chief of Africa Region</strong>. “The introduction of MenFive® in Nigeria heralds a transformative era in the fight against meningococcal meningitis in Africa. Building on the legacy of previous vaccination efforts, this milestone reflects over a decade of unwavering, innovative partnerships. The promise of MenFive® lies not just in its immediate impact but in the countless lives it stands to protect in the years to come, moving us closer to a future free from the threat of this disease.”</p><p>In 2019, WHO and partners launched the<a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240026407\"> </a><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/342010/9789240026407-eng.pdf?sequence=1\">global roadmap to defeating meningitis by 2030</a>.  The roadmap sets a comprehensive vision <em>towards a world free of meningitis,</em> and has three goals: </p>- elimination of bacterial meningitis epidemics; <br/><pbr>- reduction of cases of vaccine-preventable bacterial meningitis by 50% and deaths by 70%; and<br/>- reduction of disability and improvement of quality of life after meningitis due to any cause.</pbr><p>“With outbreaks of infectious diseases on the rise worldwide, new innovations such as MenFive® are critical in helping us fight back,\" said<strong> Aurélia Nguyen, Chief Programme Officer at Gavi</strong>, the Vaccine Alliance, which funds the global stockpile as well as vaccine rollout in lower-income countries. \"This first shipment signals the start of Gavi support for a multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MMCV) program, which, with the required donor funding for our next five years of work, will see pentavalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines rolled out in high-risk countries. Thanks to vaccines, we have eliminated large and disruptive outbreaks of meningitis A in Africa: now we have a tool to respond to other serogroups that still cause large outbreaks resulting in long-term disability and deaths.\" </p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">Following Nigeria’s meningitis vaccine campaign, a major milestone on the road to defeat meningitis is the international summit on meningitis taking place in Paris in April 2024 where leaders will come together to celebrate progress, identify challenges and assess next steps.

          "WHO has been supporting the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) in responding to the meningitis outbreak in the country. This includes disease surveillance, active case finding, sample testing, and case management. WHO and partners have also played a vital role in supporting Nigeria to prepare for the rollout of the new vaccine and training health workers.",
          "“Year after year, meningococcal meningitis has tormented countries across Africa,” said Dr Nanthalile Mugala, PATH's Chief of Africa Region . “The introduction of MenFive® in Nigeria heralds a transformative era in the fight against meningococcal meningitis in Africa. Building on the legacy of previous vaccination efforts, this milestone reflects over a decade of unwavering, innovative partnerships. The promise of MenFive® lies not just in its immediate impact but in the countless lives it stands to protect in the years to come, moving us closer to a future free from the threat of this disease.”",
          "In 2019, WHO and partners launched the global roadmap to defeating meningitis by 2030 .  The roadmap sets a comprehensive vision towards a world free of meningitis, and has three goals:",
          "“With outbreaks of infectious diseases on the rise worldwide, new innovations such as MenFive® are critical in helping us fight back,\" said Aurélia Nguyen, Chief Programme Officer at Gavi , the Vaccine Alliance, which funds the global stockpile as well as vaccine rollout in lower-income countries. \"This first shipment signals the start of Gavi support for a multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MMCV) program, which, with the required donor funding for our next five years of work, will see pentavalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines rolled out in high-risk countries. Thanks to vaccines, we have eliminated large and disruptive outbreaks of meningitis A in Africa: now we have a tool to respond to other serogroups that still cause large outbreaks resulting in long-term disability and deaths.\"",
          "Following Nigeria’s meningitis vaccine campaign, a major milestone on the road to defeat meningitis is the international summit on meningitis taking place in Paris in April 2024 where leaders will come together to celebrate progress, identify challenges and assess next steps. It is also an opportunity for country leaders and key partners to commit politically and financially to accelerate progress towards eliminating meningitis as a public health problem by 2030."

    "content_html": "<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240091672\">2024 Global Hepatitis Report</a>, the number of lives lost due to viral hepatitis is increasing. The disease is the second leading infectious cause of death globally -- with 1.3 million deaths per year, the same as tuberculosis, a top infectious killer.</p><p>The report, released at the World Hepatitis Summit, highlights that despite better tools for diagnosis and treatment, and decreasing product prices, testing and treatment coverage rates have stalled. But, reaching the WHO elimination goal by 2030 should still be achievable, if swift actions are taken now.</p><p>New data from 187 countries show that the estimated number of deaths from viral hepatitis increased from 1.1 million in 2019 to 1.3 million in 2022. Of these, 83% were caused by hepatitis B, and 17% by hepatitis C. Every day, there are 3500 people dying globally due to hepatitis B and C infections.</p><p>“This report paints a troubling picture: despite progress globally in preventing hepatitis infections, deaths are rising because far too few people with hepatitis are being diagnosed and treated,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “WHO is committed to supporting countries to use all the tools at their disposal - at access prices - to save lives and turn this trend around.”</p><p>Updated WHO estimates indicate that 254 million people live with hepatitis B and 50 million with hepatitis C in 2022. Half the burden of chronic hepatitis B and C infections is among people 30–54 years old, with 12% among children under 18 years of age. Men account for 58% of all cases.</p><p>New incidence estimates indicate a slight decrease compared to 2019, but the overall incidence of viral hepatitis remains high. In 2022, there were 2.2 million new infections, down from 2.5 million in 2019. </p><p>These include 1.2 million new hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million new hepatitis C infections. More than 6000 people are getting newly infected with viral hepatitis each day.</p><p>The revised estimates are derived from enhanced data from national prevalence surveys. They also indicate that prevention measures such as immunization and safe injections, along with the expansion of hepatitis C treatment, have contributed to reducing the incidence. </p><h2>Global progress and gaps in diagnosis and treatment</h2><p>Across all regions, only 13% of people living with chronic hepatitis B infection had been diagnosed and approximately 3% (7 million) had received antiviral therapy at the end of 2022. Regarding hepatitis C, 36% had been diagnosed and 20% (12.5 million) had received curative treatment.</p><p>These results fall well below the global targets to treat 80% of people living with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C by 2030. However, they do indicate slight but consistent improvement in diagnosis and treatment coverage since the last reported estimates in 2019. Specifically, hepatitis B diagnosis increased from 10% to 13% and treatment from 2% to 3%, and hepatitis C diagnosis from 21% to 36% and treatment from 13% to 20%.</p><p>The burden of viral hepatitis varies regionally. The WHO African Region bears 63% of new hepatitis B infections, yet despite this burden, only 18% of newborns in the region receive the hepatitis B birth-dose vaccination. In the Western Pacific Region, which accounts for 47% of hepatitis B deaths, treatment coverage stands at 23% among people diagnosed, which is far too low to reduce mortality. </p><p>Bangladesh, China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Russian Federation and Viet Nam, collectively shoulder nearly two-thirds of the global burden of hepatitis B and C. Achieving universal access to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in these ten countries by 2025, alongside intensified efforts in the African Region, is essential to get the global response back on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><h2>Disparities in pricing and service delivery</h2><p>Despite the availability of affordable generic viral hepatitis medicines, many countries fail to procure them at these lower prices.</p><p>Pricing disparities persist both across and within WHO regions, with many countries paying above global benchmarks, even for off-patent drugs or when included in voluntary licensing agreements. For example, although tenofovir for treatment of hepatitis B is off patent and available at a global benchmark price of US$2.4 per month, only 7 of the 26 reporting countries paid prices at or below the benchmark. </p><p>Similarly, a 12-week course of pangenotypic sofosbuvir/daclatasvir to treat hepatitis C is available at a global benchmark price of US$60, yet only 4 of 24 reporting countries paid prices at or below the benchmark.</p><p>Service delivery remains centralized and vertical, and many affected populations still face out-of-pocket expenses for viral hepatitis services. </p><p>Only 60% of reporting countries offer viral hepatitis testing and treatment services free of charge, either entirely or partially, in the public sector. Financial protection is lower in the African Region, where only about one third of reporting countries provide these services free of charge.</p><h2>Recommendations for accelerating hepatitis elimination</h2><p>The report outlines a series of actions to advance a public health approach to viral hepatitis, designed to accelerate progress towards ending the epidemic by 2030. They include:</p><ul><li>expanding access to testing and diagnostics;</li><li>shifting from policies to implementation for equitable treatment;</li><li>strengthening primary care prevention efforts;</li><li>simplifying service delivery, optimizing product regulation and supply;</li><li>developing investment cases in priority countries;</li><li>mobilizing innovative financing;</li><li>using improved data for action; and</li><li>engaging affected communities and civil society and advancing research for improved diagnostics and potential cures for hepatitis B. </li></ul><h2>Funding remains a challenge</h2><p>Funding for viral hepatitis both at a global level or within dedicated country health budgets, is not sufficient to meet the needs.

The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in the context of the global target of interruption and certification of WPV1 eradication by 2026 and interruption and certification of cVDPV2 elimination by 2028. Technical updates were received about the situation in the following countries: Afghanistan, Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Indonesia, Liberia, Mozambique, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Sudan.</p><h2>Wild poliovirus</h2><p>There have been two new cases of WPV1 in Pakistan reported in 2024, both cases were detected in Balochistan province (Chaman and Dera Bugti districts). The significant increase in environmental detections have been sustained with 125 positive samples in 2023 and 34 positive samples to date in 2024. These detections indicate the spread of WPV1 from the endemic zone of Afghanistan (East Region) to other regions in Afghanistan (Balkh, Kabul and Southern provinces centered on Kandahar) to the traditional reservoirs of Pakistan (Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta Block) and neighboring or transit districts.</p><p>Both countries have made progress towards interrupting transmission of the two surviving genetic clusters of WPV1 (the YB3C cluster is endemic in Pakistan and the YB3A cluster is endemic in Afghanistan). In 2023, Afghanistan reported six cases of WPV1 belonging to the YB3A cluster from the East Region of the country. The 62 environmental samples that were positive for WPV1 all belong to the YB3A cluster. In 2023, Pakistan reported six cases of WPV1, three WPV1 cases belong to its endemic YB3C cluster whilst the other three WPV1 cases belong to the YB3A cluster closely related to strains circulating in East Region of Afghanistan. Pakistan also detected 125 WPV1 isolates from environmental samples collected during 2023 of which 119 belong to the YB3A cluster and are closely related to the strains circulating in Afghanistan. There is evidence to suggest that some of the YB3A strains detected in Afghanistan in late 2023 were reintroduced into Afghanistan by returnees from Pakistan. The most recent YB3C detection was reported in October 2023. The number of environmental samples in Pakistan tested rose from 1199 in 2022 to 2182 in 2023. In Afghanistan, the number of samples decreased from 698 in 2022 to 521 in 2023 but maintained quality.</p><p>The WPV1 epidemiology reported by Afghanistan is incomplete. In late January, shipments, testing and related reporting of WPV1 samples in Afghanistan were suspended due to concern about the testing and notification of a positive WPV1 sample by the Regional Reference Laboratory (RRL) in Islamabad. Following outreach and collaboration, this sample has been referred to the Global Specialized Laboratory (GSL) in Atlanta USA for retesting and has now been confirmed as positive. On 18 March Afghanistan also reported 10 positive environmental samples collected in January. The shipment of samples to the RRL in Islamabad resumed on 15 March. It is estimated that the testing backlog of more than 1400 stool and wastewater samples will be cleared by mid-April 2024.</p><p>Both Afghanistan and Pakistan are implementing an intensive and synchronized campaign schedule focusing on improved vaccination coverage in the endemic zones and effective and timely response to WPV1 detections elsewhere in each country. At least 175 million vaccinations are planned for implementation in both countries between January and June 2024. Coverage in the East Region (Nangarhar, Kunar, Nuristan and Laghman) has been strengthened through increased supervision, oversight and monitoring as well as expanded to include children under 10 due to the age profile of the infected children and related historical accessibility challenges in the East Region. Vaccination coverage has also improved in the South Region (Hilmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan, Zabul and Nimrod) through intensified collaboration with humanitarian partners and other modalities but remains suboptimal with an estimated 200 000 children who remain unreached. Across south KP, efforts have focused on access improvement, higher quality surveillance and integrated vaccine delivery in selected Union Councils around North Waziristan and Bannu in particular, whilst enhancing operational coordination and community engagement. Outbreak response elsewhere in Pakistan has focused on the traditional reservoirs and the vaccination of mobile populations including those impacted directly or indirectly by the repatriation of undocumented migrants to Afghanistan.</p><p>In addition to seasonal movement patterns within and between both countries, this return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan has compounded the challenges faced. More than 600 000 returnees have been recorded to date by IOM and UNHCR with estimates of up to 1 700 000 affected. The scale of the displacement increases the risk of cross-border poliovirus spread as well as spread within both countries. This risk is being managed and mitigated in both countries through vaccination at border crossing points and the updating of micro-plans in the districts of origin and return. The programme will continue to closely coordinate with IOM and UNHCR.</p><p>Twenty months have now elapsed since the last recorded WPV1 case in Mozambique with onset of paralysis on 10 August 2022. More than two years have now elapsed since the single WPV1 case reported in Malawi. Outbreak response assessments (OBRA) were conducted in Mozambique and Malawi in November 2023. In Mozambique, there are encouraging signs that imported WPV1 transmission has stopped but 12 months of complete surveillance data is not yet available. In Malawi, the OBRA team concluded that imported WPV1 transmission has most likely stopped. Geographic proximity means that the outbreak will be closed together rather than separately. Closure of the outbreak will be by the WHO African Regional office following review by the Regional Commission for Certification.</p><h2>Circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV)</h2><p>There are five newly reinfected countries reporting cVDPV2 since the last meeting: Angola, Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone and South Sudan. In South Sudan, there has been a new emergence; in the other four countries, reinfection has been due to importation events with Angola importing two different cVDPV2 emergence groups. Furthermore, a new cVDPV2 has been detected in Mozambique. In Côte d’Ivoire, there has been a rapid increase in environmental samples that have tested positive for cVDPV2.</p><p>There have been new emergences of cVDPV2 detected in Sudan and Mozambique. In Indonesia there has been a recurrence of cVDPV2, after an interval of 10 months with no detections, with three new cases and an environmental sample testing positive, all with links to Madura Island in East Java. Additionally, there has been a VDPV1 detected in Central Papua which is under further investigation.</p><p>There has been no new country reporting cVDPV1.</p><p>In 2023, there have been 522 cases confirmed with cVDPV, of which 388 are cVDPV2 and 133 are cVDPV1. The trend is downwards with 882 cVDPV cases in 2022 of which 689 were cVDPV2 and 193 were cVDPV1. Of these 522 cases, 223 (43%) have occurred in the DR Congo. Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Rep. Congo, Egypt, Malawi, Senegal and Sudan have detected cVDPV in the environment but have not detected any cases. In 2024, only Nigeria has detected cases, while Algeria, Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Sudan have detected cVDPV in the environment. Most countries have been infected by imported viruses, while three countries, Zimbabwe, Indonesia and Israel have been infected despite not having used any type of OPV2 prior to detection of cVDPV2.</p><p>In 2023, the number of separate cVDPV2 emergence groups detected was 25, of which eight were new emergences, of which six originated from nOPV2. This compares to 19 emergence groups detected in 2022, 28 in 2021, 35 in 2020, and 44 in 2019. There have now been 14 nOPV2 derived emergence groups since 2021.</p><p>The committee noted that in the African Region, which now uses novel OPV2 exclusively, there has been a total of 10 new cVDPV2 emergences detected that have emerged from novel OPV2 use, while there has been one such emergence identified in Egypt in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The detection of nOPV2-derived VDPV2 strains, including cVDPV2, is an expected finding with increased nOPV2 use. The vaccine nOPV2 continues to demonstrate significantly higher genetic stability and substantially lower likelihood of reversion to neurovirulence relative to Sabin OPV2. Since first use in March 2021, approximately 821 million doses of nOPV2 have been administered in the African Region. It is estimated that the 10 emergences from AFR represent an 82% lower risk of emergence by nOPV2 than Sabin OPV2 in the African Region.</p><p>The committee noted that much of the risk for cVDPV outbreaks can be linked to a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, a high concentration of zero dose and under-immunized children and population displacement. These factors are most evident in northern Yemen, northern Nigeria, south central Somalia and eastern DR Congo, but also in northern Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Mali, South Sudan and Sudan.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus still remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Ongoing risk of WPV1 international spread:</span>  </p><p>Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of WPV1 remains:</p><ul><li>re-infection of epidemiologically critical areas and historical reservoirs like Karachi and the Quetta Block in Pakistan and Kandahar in Afghanistan represents a significant risk to the gains made during the last 18 months;</li><li>the actual spread of WPV1 lineages seen predominantly in Afghanistan in 2022 now being detected in Pakistan in 2023 and 2024;</li><li>high-risk mobile populations in Pakistan represent a specific risk of international spread to Afghanistan in particular, compounded by the large number of returnees from Pakistan into a number of provinces of Afghanistan;</li><li>the large pool of unvaccinated ‘zero dose’ and underimmunized children in southern Afghanistan constitutes a major risk;</li><li>some areas of Afghanistan still only allow site to site or mosque to mosque immunization response, which has been shown to be less effective than the house to house modality;</li><li>although it is likely transmission of WPV1 has been interrupted in Malawi and Mozambique, the route from Pakistan to Africa remains unknown;</li><li>pockets of insecurity in the remaining endemic transmission zones; and</li><li>any setback in Afghanistan poses a risk to the programme in Pakistan due to high population movement.</li></ul><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Ongoing risk of cVDPV international spread:</span></p><p>Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 appears to remain high:</p><ul><li>the outbreak of cVDPV1 in and ongoing high transmission of cVDPV2 in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and cVDPV2 in north-western Nigeria, which have caused international spread to neighboring countries;</li><li>ongoing cross border spread including into newly re-infected countries such as Angola, Liberia, Senegal and Sierra Leone;</li><li>the new emergence of cVDPV2 in South Sudan, which whole genome sequencing (WGS) indicates the origin of the virus is novel OPV2, despite that the vaccine has never been used in the country. However, South Sudan shares many land borders with countries that have used novel OPV2 in the years 2022 – 2023, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, DR Congo and CAR;</li><li>the ever-widening gap in population intestinal mucosal immunity in young children since the withdrawal of OPV2 in 2016 and consequently high concentration of zero dose children in certain areas; and</li><li>insecurity in those areas that are the source of cVDPV transmission.</li></ul><p>Contributing factors include:</p><ul><li>Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by humanitarian emergencies including conflict and protracted complex emergencies. This poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to polio outbreaks. </li><li>Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in northern Yemen and Somalia which have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for extended periods of more than a year.</li></ul><h3>Risk categories</h3><p>The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:</p><ol><li>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3.</li><li>States infected with cVDPV2, with or without evidence of local transmission.</li><li>States previously infected by WPV1 or cVDPV within the last 24 months.<br/></li></ol><p>Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:</p><ul><li>Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.</li><li>Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period.</li><li>These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps.</li></ul><p>Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be remain on a ‘watch list’ for a further 12 months for a period of heightened monitoring.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations.<br/> </p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">TEMPORARY RECOMMENDATIONS</span></strong></p><p><strong>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread </strong></p><p><strong>WPV1 </strong></p><table><tbody><tr style=\"height:25%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Afghanistan</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 23 January 2024</td></tr><tr style=\"height:25%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Malawi</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 19 November 2021</td></tr><tr style=\"height:25%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Mozambique </td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 10 August 2022</td></tr><tr style=\"height:25%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Pakistan</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 29 February 2024</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>cVDPV1</strong></p><table style=\"height:131px;\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:20%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Madagascar</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 16 September 2023</td></tr><tr style=\"height:20%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Mozambique</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 6 November 2023</td></tr><tr style=\"height:20%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Malawi</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 1 December 2022</td></tr><tr style=\"height:20%;\"><td style=\"width:50%;\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</td><td style=\"width:50%;\">most recent detection 24 November 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These countries should:</p><ul><li>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.</li><li>Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (&gt; four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.</li><li>Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers.</li><li>Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.</li><li>Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (road, air and / or sea).</li><li>Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.</li><li>Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication. Countries which have not yet introduced IPV2 into their schedules should urgently implement this.

          "There have been two new cases of WPV1 in Pakistan reported in 2024, both cases were detected in Balochistan province (Chaman and Dera Bugti districts). The significant increase in environmental detections have been sustained with 125 positive samples in 2023 and 34 positive samples to date in 2024. These detections indicate the spread of WPV1 from the endemic zone of Afghanistan (East Region) to other regions in Afghanistan (Balkh, Kabul and Southern provinces centered on Kandahar) to the traditional reservoirs of Pakistan (Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta Block) and neighboring or transit districts.",
          "Both countries have made progress towards interrupting transmission of the two surviving genetic clusters of WPV1 (the YB3C cluster is endemic in Pakistan and the YB3A cluster is endemic in Afghanistan). In 2023, Afghanistan reported six cases of WPV1 belonging to the YB3A cluster from the East Region of the country. The 62 environmental samples that were positive for WPV1 all belong to the YB3A cluster. In 2023, Pakistan reported six cases of WPV1, three WPV1 cases belong to its endemic YB3C cluster whilst the other three WPV1 cases belong to the YB3A cluster closely related to strains circulating in East Region of Afghanistan. Pakistan also detected 125 WPV1 isolates from environmental samples collected during 2023 of which 119 belong to the YB3A cluster and are closely related to the strains circulating in Afghanistan. There is evidence to suggest that some of the YB3A strains detected in Afghanistan in late 2023 were reintroduced into Afghanistan by returnees from Pakistan. The most recent YB3C detection was reported in October 2023. The number of environmental samples in Pakistan tested rose from 1199 in 2022 to 2182 in 2023. In Afghanistan, the number of samples decreased from 698 in 2022 to 521 in 2023 but maintained quality.",
          "The WPV1 epidemiology reported by Afghanistan is incomplete. In late January, shipments, testing and related reporting of WPV1 samples in Afghanistan were suspended due to concern about the testing and notification of a positive WPV1 sample by the Regional Reference Laboratory (RRL) in Islamabad. Following outreach and collaboration, this sample has been referred to the Global Specialized Laboratory (GSL) in Atlanta USA for retesting and has now been confirmed as positive. On 18 March Afghanistan also reported 10 positive environmental samples collected in January. The shipment of samples to the RRL in Islamabad resumed on 15 March. It is estimated that the testing backlog of more than 1400 stool and wastewater samples will be cleared by mid-April 2024.",
          "Both Afghanistan and Pakistan are implementing an intensive and synchronized campaign schedule focusing on improved vaccination coverage in the endemic zones and effective and timely response to WPV1 detections elsewhere in each country. At least 175 million vaccinations are planned for implementation in both countries between January and June 2024. Coverage in the East Region (Nangarhar, Kunar, Nuristan and Laghman) has been strengthened through increased supervision, oversight and monitoring as well as expanded to include children under 10 due to the age profile of the infected children and related historical accessibility challenges in the East Region. Vaccination coverage has also improved in the South Region (Hilmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan, Zabul and Nimrod) through intensified collaboration with humanitarian partners and other modalities but remains suboptimal with an estimated 200 000 children who remain unreached. Across south KP, efforts have focused on access improvement, higher quality surveillance and integrated vaccine delivery in selected Union Councils around North Waziristan and Bannu in particular, whilst enhancing operational coordination and community engagement. Outbreak response elsewhere in Pakistan has focused on the traditional reservoirs and the vaccination of mobile populations including those impacted directly or indirectly by the repatriation of undocumented migrants to Afghanistan.",
          "In addition to seasonal movement patterns within and between both countries, this return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan has compounded the challenges faced. More than 600 000 returnees have been recorded to date by IOM and UNHCR with estimates of up to 1 700 000 affected. The scale of the displacement increases the risk of cross-border poliovirus spread as well as spread within both countries. This risk is being managed and mitigated in both countries through vaccination at border crossing points and the updating of micro-plans in the districts of origin and return. The programme will continue to closely coordinate with IOM and UNHCR.",
          "Twenty months have now elapsed since the last recorded WPV1 case in Mozambique with onset of paralysis on 10 August 2022. More than two years have now elapsed since the single WPV1 case reported in Malawi. Outbreak response assessments (OBRA) were conducted in Mozambique and Malawi in November 2023. In Mozambique, there are encouraging signs that imported WPV1 transmission has stopped but 12 months of complete surveillance data is not yet available. In Malawi, the OBRA team concluded that imported WPV1 transmission has most likely stopped. Geographic proximity means that the outbreak will be closed together rather than separately. Closure of the outbreak will be by the WHO African Regional office following review by the Regional Commission for Certification."

In South Sudan, there has been a new emergence; in the other four countries, reinfection has been due to importation events with Angola importing two different cVDPV2 emergence groups. Furthermore, a new cVDPV2 has been detected in Mozambique. In Côte d’Ivoire, there has been a rapid increase in environmental samples that have tested positive for cVDPV2.",
          "There have been new emergences of cVDPV2 detected in Sudan and Mozambique. In Indonesia there has been a recurrence of cVDPV2, after an interval of 10 months with no detections, with three new cases and an environmental sample testing positive, all with links to Madura Island in East Java. Additionally, there has been a VDPV1 detected in Central Papua which is under further investigation.",
          "There has been no new country reporting cVDPV1.",
          "In 2023, there have been 522 cases confirmed with cVDPV, of which 388 are cVDPV2 and 133 are cVDPV1. The trend is downwards with 882 cVDPV cases in 2022 of which 689 were cVDPV2 and 193 were cVDPV1. Of these 522 cases, 223 (43%) have occurred in the DR Congo. Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Rep. Congo, Egypt, Malawi, Senegal and Sudan have detected cVDPV in the environment but have not detected any cases. In 2024, only Nigeria has detected cases, while Algeria, Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Sudan have detected cVDPV in the environment. Most countries have been infected by imported viruses, while three countries, Zimbabwe, Indonesia and Israel have been infected despite not having used any type of OPV2 prior to detection of cVDPV2.",
          "In 2023, the number of separate cVDPV2 emergence groups detected was 25, of which eight were new emergences, of which six originated from nOPV2. This compares to 19 emergence groups detected in 2022, 28 in 2021, 35 in 2020, and 44 in 2019. There have now been 14 nOPV2 derived emergence groups since 2021.",
          "The committee noted that in the African Region, which now uses novel OPV2 exclusively, there has been a total of 10 new cVDPV2 emergences detected that have emerged from novel OPV2 use, while there has been one such emergence identified in Egypt in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The detection of nOPV2-derived VDPV2 strains, including cVDPV2, is an expected finding with increased nOPV2 use. The vaccine nOPV2 continues to demonstrate significantly higher genetic stability and substantially lower likelihood of reversion to neurovirulence relative to Sabin OPV2. Since first use in March 2021, approximately 821 million doses of nOPV2 have been administered in the African Region. It is estimated that the 10 emergences from AFR represent an 82% lower risk of emergence by nOPV2 than Sabin OPV2 in the African Region.",
          "The committee noted that much of the risk for cVDPV outbreaks can be linked to a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, a high concentration of zero dose and under-immunized children and population displacement. These factors are most evident in northern Yemen, northern Nigeria, south central Somalia and eastern DR Congo, but also in northern Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Mali, South Sudan and Sudan."

    "content_html": "<p>A WHO-led multi-agency mission accessed Al-Shifa Hospital in north Gaza on 5 April to conduct a preliminary assessment of the extent of destruction and identify needs to guide future efforts to restore the facility. The highly complex mission was conducted in close partnership with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), United Nations Department for Safety and Security (UNDSS), and in collaboration with the acting Hospital Director.</p><p>Prior to the mission, WHO’s efforts to reach the hospital to medically evacuate patients and staff and conduct an assessment were denied, delayed or impeded 6 times between 25 March and 1 April.</p><p>Like the majority of the north, Al-Shifa Hospital ­– once the largest and most important referral hospital in Gaza – is now an empty shell after the latest siege. No patients remain at the facility. Most of the buildings are extensively damaged or destroyed and the majority of equipment is unusable or reduced to ashes. The WHO team said that the scale of devastation has left the facility completely non-functional, further reducing access to life-saving health care in Gaza. Restoring even minimal functionality in the short term seems implausible and will require substantial efforts to assess and clear the grounds for unexploded ordnance to ensure safety and accessibility for partners to bring in equipment and supplies. </p><p>The hospital’s emergency department, surgical, and maternity ward buildings are extensively damaged due to explosives and fire. The western wall of the emergency department and northern wall of the neonatal intensive care department (NICU) have been torn down. At least 115 beds in what once was the emergency department have been burnt and 14 incubators in the NICU destroyed, among other assets. An in-depth assessment by a team of engineers is needed to determine if these buildings are safe for future use. </p><p>The hospital's oxygen plant has been destroyed, leaving Kamal Adwan Hospital as the only source of medical oxygen production in the north. Further comprehensive assessment is essential to evaluate the functionality of vital equipment such as CT scanners, ventilators, sterilization devices, and surgical equipment, including surgical tools and anaesthesia devices. The current situation has left north Gaza without CT scanning capabilities and significantly diminished laboratory capacity, severely compromising effective diagnosis, which will increase avoidable deaths.  </p><p>Numerous shallow graves have been dug just outside the emergency department, and the administrative and surgical buildings. In the same area, many dead bodies were partially buried with their limbs visible. During the visit, WHO staff witnessed at least 5 bodies lying partially covered on the ground, exposed to the heat. The team reported a pungent smell of decomposing bodies engulfing the hospital compound. Safeguarding dignity, even in death, is an indispensable act of humanity.</p><p>According to the acting Hospital Director, patients were held in abysmal conditions during the siege. They endured severe lack of food, water, health care, hygiene and sanitation, and were forced to relocate between buildings at gun point. At least 20 patients have reportedly died due to the lack of access to care and limited movement authorized for health personnel. </p><p>Despite deconfliction, yesterday’s mission faced significant delays at the military checkpoint en route to Al-Shifa Hospital. On the same day, another WHO-led mission bound for Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals in northern Gaza – to deliver medical supplies, fuel, deploy emergency medical teams, and support referral of critical patients – encountered unnecessary delays, including the detention of a supply truck driver who was part of the convoy. He was detained for over an hour at a separate location, out of view of the mission team. Eventually this mission was aborted due to safety concerns as the delays left insufficient time for safe completion and return before nightfall.</p><p>Between mid-October and end March, over half of all WHO missions have been denied, delayed, impeded or postponed. As health needs soar, the lack of a functional deconfliction system is a major obstacle in delivering humanitarian aid – including medical supplies, fuel, food and water to hospitals – anywhere close to the scale needed.  </p><p>Six months – half a year – into the war, the destruction of Al-Shifa Hospital and Nasser Medical Complex has broken the backbone of the already ailing health system.

          "A WHO-led multi-agency mission accessed Al-Shifa Hospital in north Gaza on 5 April to conduct a preliminary assessment of the extent of destruction and identify needs to guide future efforts to restore the facility. The highly complex mission was conducted in close partnership with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), United Nations Department for Safety and Security (UNDSS), and in collaboration with the acting Hospital Director.",
          "Prior to the mission, WHO’s efforts to reach the hospital to medically evacuate patients and staff and conduct an assessment were denied, delayed or impeded 6 times between 25 March and 1 April.",
          "Like the majority of the north, Al-Shifa Hospital ­– once the largest and most important referral hospital in Gaza – is now an empty shell after the latest siege. No patients remain at the facility. Most of the buildings are extensively damaged or destroyed and the majority of equipment is unusable or reduced to ashes. The WHO team said that the scale of devastation has left the facility completely non-functional, further reducing access to life-saving health care in Gaza. Restoring even minimal functionality in the short term seems implausible and will require substantial efforts to assess and clear the grounds for unexploded ordnance to ensure safety and accessibility for partners to bring in equipment and supplies.",
          "The hospital’s emergency department, surgical, and maternity ward buildings are extensively damaged due to explosives and fire. The western wall of the emergency department and northern wall of the neonatal intensive care department (NICU) have been torn down. At least 115 beds in what once was the emergency department have been burnt and 14 incubators in the NICU destroyed, among other assets. An in-depth assessment by a team of engineers is needed to determine if these buildings are safe for future use.",
          "The hospital's oxygen plant has been destroyed, leaving Kamal Adwan Hospital as the only source of medical oxygen production in the north. Further comprehensive assessment is essential to evaluate the functionality of vital equipment such as CT scanners, ventilators, sterilization devices, and surgical equipment, including surgical tools and anaesthesia devices. The current situation has left north Gaza without CT scanning capabilities and significantly diminished laboratory capacity, severely compromising effective diagnosis, which will increase avoidable deaths.",
          "Numerous shallow graves have been dug just outside the emergency department, and the administrative and surgical buildings. In the same area, many dead bodies were partially buried with their limbs visible. During the visit, WHO staff witnessed at least 5 bodies lying partially covered on the ground, exposed to the heat. The team reported a pungent smell of decomposing bodies engulfing the hospital compound. Safeguarding dignity, even in death, is an indispensable act of humanity.",
          "According to the acting Hospital Director, patients were held in abysmal conditions during the siege. They endured severe lack of food, water, health care, hygiene and sanitation, and were forced to relocate between buildings at gun point. At least 20 patients have reportedly died due to the lack of access to care and limited movement authorized for health personnel.",
          "Despite deconfliction, yesterday’s mission faced significant delays at the military checkpoint en route to Al-Shifa Hospital. On the same day, another WHO-led mission bound for Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals in northern Gaza – to deliver medical supplies, fuel, deploy emergency medical teams, and support referral of critical patients – encountered unnecessary delays, including the detention of a supply truck driver who was part of the convoy. He was detained for over an hour at a separate location, out of view of the mission team. Eventually this mission was aborted due to safety concerns as the delays left insufficient time for safe completion and return before nightfall.",
          "Between mid-October and end March, over half of all WHO missions have been denied, delayed, impeded or postponed. As health needs soar, the lack of a functional deconfliction system is a major obstacle in delivering humanitarian aid – including medical supplies, fuel, food and water to hospitals – anywhere close to the scale needed.",
          "Six months – half a year – into the war, the destruction of Al-Shifa Hospital and Nasser Medical Complex has broken the backbone of the already ailing health system. Prior to the latest siege, WHO and partners had supported the revival of basic services at Al-Shifa Hospital, and Nasser Medical Complex was regularly supplied to continue serving as the main hospital in south Gaza. These efforts are now lost.",
          "As WHO marks World Health Day tomorrow, under the theme “My health, my right”, this basic right is utterly out of reach for the civilians of Gaza. Access to health care in Gaza has become totally inadequate, and the ability of WHO and partners to help is constantly disrupted and impeded.",
          "Of the 36 main hospitals that used to serve over 2 million Gazans, only 10 remain somewhat functional, with severe limitations on the types of services they can deliver. The proposed military incursion into Rafah can only result in further diminution of access to health care and would have unimaginable health consequences.  The systematic dismantling of health care must end.",
          "WHO repeats its calls for the protection of patients, health and humanitarian workers, health infrastructure, and civilians. Hospitals must not be militarized, misused, or attacked. WHO demands an effective, transparent and workable deconfliction mechanism, and safety guarantees, ensuring that the movement of aid within Gaza, including through checkpoints, is safe, predictable and expedited. WHO calls for additional land crossings to allow access into and across Gaza more safely and directly.",
          "As famine looms, disease outbreaks spread, and traumatic injuries increase, WHO calls for unimpeded access of humanitarian aid into and across the Gaza Strip, and a lasting ceasefire."

Countries that will receive kits in the coming weeks in this largest-ever global deployment include those currently severely impacted by cholera outbreaks, such as Ethiopia, Somalia, Syria, and Zambia. This programme will improve the timeliness and accuracy of outbreak detection and response by boosting routine surveillance and testing capacity and helping rapidly identify probable cholera cases. Critically, it will also help countries monitor trends and build an evidence base for future preventive programmes, supporting the achievement of national cholera control and elimination targets.  </p><p>The global cholera diagnostics programme is funded and coordinated by <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.gavi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance</a> (Gavi), with procurement and delivery to countries led by <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.unicef.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UNICEF</a>, and undertaken in collaboration with the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC), and <a href=\"/home\" target=\"_blank\">WHO</a>. It was developed in partnership with <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.finddx.org/\" target=\"_blank\">FIND</a>, who led development of a target product profile describing the required characteristics of cholera RDTs, and other organizations. <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.finddx.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20240403_tpp_surveillance_cholera_FV_EN.pdf\"></a>These initial shipments signal the start of the programme, which aims to see partners deploy RDTs to additional countries that have expressed interest in the future. Long-term sustainability of the programme depends on successful fundraising for Gavi’s next strategic period, from 2026 to 2030. </p><p>Through this effort, rapid diagnostic tests from two manufacturers – that have to-date been supplied via WHO and UNICEF for use in outbreak response – will now be used routinely for cholera surveillance. Pilot studies across the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Niger and Nepal, funded by Gavi and led by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and Epicentre/ Médecins Sans Frontières have helped increase understanding of effective rapid testing strategies. Preliminary insights from these studies, which are still ongoing, have helped inform programme design – making the rollout of these tests at scale more effective. </p><p>Cholera has been surging globally since 2021, with high case fatality rates despite availability of simple, effective and affordable treatment. The large number of outbreaks has led to unprecedented demand for vaccines from impacted countries. While global oral cholera vaccine supply has increased eighteen-fold between 2013 and 2023, the large and sustained spike in demand compared to the current availability has put a strain on the global stockpile. Preventive vaccination campaigns have had to be delayed to preserve doses for emergency outbreak response efforts. Recurring outbreaks in countries where emergency vaccination campaigns have already been implemented further highlight the need for improved speed and accuracy in identifying areas with new or persistent transmission – enabling these areas to be targeted during initial outbreak response efforts. </p><p>In 2021, the Gavi Board approved US$ 55 million in funding to support a diagnostics programme between 2022 and- 2025 across cholera, yellow fever, measles, rubella, meningococcal meningitis and typhoid  – with the aim to improve disease surveillance, outbreak detection and response and the design of preventive programmes. Gavi then opened a cholera diagnostics application window in June 2023 – which is still open – and so far 14 countries have submitted applications and been approved by an Independent Review Committee of experts. In 2023, Gavi also launched a preventive cholera vaccination programme, to support countries with long-term cholera control – a strategy that has successfully led to a decrease in outbreaks of diseases such as yellow fever and meningitis.   </p><p>Cholera is an acute intestinal infection that spreads through food and water contaminated with faeces containing the bacterium <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>.  The rise in cholera is driven by continued gaps in access to safe water and sanitation, and failure to quickly detect outbreaks and limit their spread. The communities impacted often do not have access to basic health services, a situation made worse by climate-related factors, conflict and population displacement. In the face of the ongoing surge, partners working on cholera control have urgently called on countries, manufacturers and other partners to invest in the timely outbreak response and case management, rapid access to treatment, increased production of affordable vaccines, and urgent improvements in access to basic water and sanitation services in impacted communities.</p><p>To be effective, these multisectoral strategies for the control of cholera must be guided by timely and reliable cholera surveillance data. Surveillance not only supports the early detection of and quick response to an outbreak, but also plays a central role in providing stakeholders in other cholera prevention and control pillars with the data they need to target, design, implement, and evaluate interventions. In 2023, the GTFCC updated recommendations in favor of strategic, routine and systematic testing of suspected cholera cases and the expanded use of RDTs to strengthen cholera surveillance. The global cholera RDT procurement program provides the additional support required for eligible countries to implement these recommendations.  </p><p>“We are experiencing an unprecedented multi-year upsurge in cholera cases worldwide, and today’s announcement provides a critical boost in the fight against the disease. The rise in infections is being driven by continued gaps in access to safe water and sanitation, and our inability to reach vulnerable communities that are being put further at risk by climate change, conflict and displacement,” said <strong>Aurélia</strong> <strong>Nguyen</strong><strong>, Chief Programme Officer at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.</strong> “Routine use of diagnostics will bolster cholera surveillance in impacted countries, and must be leveraged to better target vaccination efforts, which play a critical role in multisectoral cholera prevention and control programmes.” </p><p>“Despite cholera being preventable and easily treatable, children continue to suffer from this potentially fatal disease. This is why we are working with partners on all fronts and in novel ways to stem outbreaks,” said <strong>Leila Pakkala, Director of UNICEF Supply Division</strong><strong>.</strong> “Surveillance diagnostics help pinpoint hotspots with great precision. This allows partners to target cholera vaccines to exactly the time and place where the limited supply will save the most lives.”</p><p>“It’s a tragedy that cholera—a preventable and treatable disease—continues to afflict and kill today. We need urgent action on all fronts, including commitment by countries to clean water, sanitation and hygiene,” said <strong>Dr Michael Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme</strong>. “WHO welcomes the deployment of these rapid cholera tests. They will equip health workers with the critical and timely data needed to stop outbreaks early and direct efforts to better prevent and treat cholera.” </p><p>“Cholera is now spreading to areas that have been free from the disease for many years, demanding a swift, multifaceted strategy to direct limited resources to critical areas and save lives.

          "The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and WHO today signed a new Memorandum of Understanding, reaffirming the critical role that parliamentarians play in enabling good health to foster stable and equitable societies.",
          "The new five-year memorandum was signed by Mr Martin Chungong, IPU Secretary General, and Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, at the 148th IPU Assembly , which is taking place in Geneva from 23 to 27 March 2024. Both organizations commit to continue working together to promote, provide and protect the health and well-being of all people, everywhere. It renews a historic commitment made in 2018 to leverage their respective scientific and political mandates to address persistent and emerging challenges facing populations worldwide.",
          "The memorandum reinforces critical areas of cooperation that align with global health priorities, namely universal health coverage, global health security, health promotion and reducing health inequities, especially in relation to sexual and reproductive health and rights.",
          "It also adds new cross-cutting areas of work, including responding to climate change, support to the government-led negotiations on a new pandemic agreement, and sustainable financing for health. This includes collaboration on this year’s first WHO Investment Round to overcome the historic imbalance between assessed and voluntary contributions, the distortions this creates, and the issues WHO faces with insufficiently predictable and flexible financing.",
          "WHO Member States are staging their latest round of negotiations on an international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response before scheduled consideration of a proposal for adoption at the 77 th World Health Assembly in May 2024. The proposed agreement aims to provide a basis for international cooperation that was lacking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parliaments are instrumental in supporting the process towards adoption, as well as in guiding the follow-up considerations at a national level.",
          "Dr Tedros said: “Parliamentarians play an essential role in setting policies, prioritizing investments and ensuring accountability to advance public health. Political leadership in service of the public saves lives and protects health by ensuring communities and countries are better prepared and designed to be healthier and safer. WHO looks forward to working even closer with the IPU and parliamentarians worldwide to advance efforts to protect and promote people’s well-being, from negotiating a pandemic agreement to prevent a repeat of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, to investing in universal health coverage.”",
          "Mr Martin Chungong, IPU Secretary General, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic was not an isolated occurrence. Another pandemic will happen. It is not a question of if, but when.

          "Milestones of the IPU and WHO’s previous collaboration include a landmark IPU resolution in 2019 on achieving universal health coverage, a number of practical resources for parliamentarians such as a recent handbook on universal health coverage , and numerous events which have brought together health experts and parliamentarians.",

Preventive vaccination campaigns have had to be delayed to preserve doses for emergency outbreak control efforts, creating a vicious cycle.

          "Global production capacity in 2024 is forecast to be 37-50 million doses but will likely continue to be inadequate to serve the needs of millions of people directly affected by cholera. Only one manufacturer, EuBiologics, currently produces the vaccine; while the company is doing its utmost to maximize output, more doses are needed. Currently, new manufacturers are not expected to join the market before 2025; they must be fast-tracked. The same urgency and innovation that we saw for COVID-19 must be applied to cholera.",
          "Additional manufacturers planning to enter the market need to accelerate their efforts and make doses available at affordable prices.",
          "We appeal to vaccine manufacturers, governments, donors and partners to prioritize an urgent scale-up of vaccine production, and to invest in all the efforts needed to prevent and control cholera."

The World Health Organization (WHO) contributed to the analysis of the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor Study (GBD) 2021 data. </p><p>Neurological conditions are now the leading cause of ill health and disability worldwide. The overall amount of disability, illness and premature death (known as disability-adjusted life years, DALYs) caused by neurological conditions has increased by 18% since 1990.</p><p>Over 80% of neurological deaths and health loss occur in low- and middle-income countries, and access to treatment varies widely: high-income countries have up to 70 times more neurological professionals per 100 000 people than low- and middle-income countries. </p><p>“Neurological conditions cause great suffering to the individuals and families they affect, and rob communities and economies of human capital,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This study should serve as an urgent call to action to scale up targeted interventions to allow the growing number of people living with neurological conditions to access the quality care, treatment and rehabilitation they need. It is more important than ever to ensure brain health is better understood, valued and protected, from early childhood to later life.”</p><p>The top ten neurological conditions contributing to loss of health in 2021 were stroke, neonatal encephalopathy (brain injury), migraine, dementia, diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage), meningitis, epilepsy, neurological complications from preterm birth, autism spectrum disorder, and nervous system cancers. </p><p>Overall, neurological conditions cause more disability and health loss in men compared to women, but there are some conditions like migraine or dementia where women are disproportionately affected.</p><p>Since 1990, the absolute number of individuals living with, or dying from, neurological conditions has increased, while age-standardized DALY rates have dropped. This means that increases in absolute numbers are mainly driven by demographic change and people living longer. </p><p>Diabetic neuropathy was the fastest growing neurological condition. The number of people with diabetic neuropathy has more than tripled globally since 1990, rising to 206 million cases in 2021. This increase is in line with the worldwide increase in diabetes. Other conditions such as neurological complications from COVID-19 (for example, cognitive impairment and Guillain-Barré syndrome) did previously not exist and now account for over 23 million cases.</p><p>At the same time, neurological burden and health loss due to other conditions decreased by 25% or more since 1990 as a result of improved prevention (including vaccines), care and research: tetanus, rabies, meningitis, neural tube defects, stroke, neurocysticercosis (parasitic infection that affects the central nervous system), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and neonatal encephalopathy (brain injury). </p><p>The study also examined 20 modifiable risk factors for potentially preventable neurological conditions such as stroke, dementia and idiopathic intellectual disability. </p><p>Eliminating key risk factors – most importantly, high systolic blood pressure and ambient and household air pollution – could prevent up to 84% of stroke DALYs. Similarly, preventing exposure to lead could reduce the burden of idiopathic intellectual disability by 63.1%, and reducing high fasting plasma glucose levels could reduce the burden of dementia by 14.6%. Smoking significantly contributed to stroke, dementia and multiple sclerosis risk.<strong></strong></p><h2>More investments needed to improve treatment, care and quality of life<strong></strong><br/></h2><p>At the World Health Assembly in 2022, Member States adopted the <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240076624\"></a><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240076624\">Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders 2022–2031</a> (IGAP) with an ambitious scope to address the long standing neglect of neurological disorders. <br/></p><p>“The Intersectoral Global Action Plan 2022–2031 sets out a roadmap for countries to improve prevention, early identification, treatment and rehabilitation of neurological disorders.

In addition to this paid work, it has been estimated that women perform an estimated 76% of all unpaid care activities. Work that is done primarily by women tends to be paid less and have poor working conditions.</p><p>The report highlights that low pay and demanding working conditions are commonly found in the health and care sector. Devaluing caregiving, which is work performed primarily by women, negatively impacts wages, working conditions, productivity and the economic footprint of the sector.</p><p>The report illustrates that decades of chronic underinvestment in health and care work is contributing to a growing global crisis of care. With stagnation in progress towards universal health coverage (UHC), resulting in 4.5 billion people lacking full coverage of essential health services, women may take on even more unpaid care work. The deleterious impact of weak health systems combined with increasing unpaid health and care work are further straining the health of caregivers and the quality of services.</p><p>“The ‘Fair share’ report highlights how gender-equitable investments in health and care work would reset the value of health and care and drive fairer and more inclusive economies,” said Jim Campbell, WHO Director for Health Workforce. “We are calling upon leaders, policy-makers and employers to action investment: it is time for a fair share for health and care.”</p><p>The report presents policy levers to better value health and care work:</p><ol><li>Improve working conditions for all forms of health and care work, especially for highly feminised occupations</li><li>Include women more equitably in the paid labour workforce</li><li>Enhance conditions of work and wages in the health and care workforce and ensure equal pay for work of equal value</li><li>Address the gender gap in care, support quality care work and uphold the rights and well-being of caregivers   </li><li>Ensure that national statistics account for, measure and value all health and care work</li><li>Invest in robust public health systems</li></ol><p>Investments in health and care systems not only accelerate progress on UHC, they redistribute unpaid health and care work. When women participate in paid health and care employment, they are economically empowered and health outcomes are better. Health systems need to recognize, value and invest in all forms health and care work.</p><p> </p>",

          "The report outlines underinvestment in health systems results in a vicious cycle of unpaid health and care work, lowering women’s participation in paid labour markets, harming women’s economic empowerment and hampering gender equality.",
          "Women comprise 67% of the paid global health and care workforce. In addition to this paid work, it has been estimated that women perform an estimated 76% of all unpaid care activities. Work that is done primarily by women tends to be paid less and have poor working conditions.",
          "The report highlights that low pay and demanding working conditions are commonly found in the health and care sector. Devaluing caregiving, which is work performed primarily by women, negatively impacts wages, working conditions, productivity and the economic footprint of the sector.",
          "The report illustrates that decades of chronic underinvestment in health and care work is contributing to a growing global crisis of care. With stagnation in progress towards universal health coverage (UHC), resulting in 4.5 billion people lacking full coverage of essential health services, women may take on even more unpaid care work. The deleterious impact of weak health systems combined with increasing unpaid health and care work are further straining the health of caregivers and the quality of services.",
          "“The ‘Fair share’ report highlights how gender-equitable investments in health and care work would reset the value of health and care and drive fairer and more inclusive economies,” said Jim Campbell, WHO Director for Health Workforce. “We are calling upon leaders, policy-makers and employers to action investment: it is time for a fair share for health and care.”",
          "The report presents policy levers to better value health and care work:",
          "Improve working conditions for all forms of health and care work, especially for highly feminised occupations",
          "Include women more equitably in the paid labour workforce",
          "Enhance conditions of work and wages in the health and care workforce and ensure equal pay for work of equal value",
          "Address the gender gap in care, support quality care work and uphold the rights and well-being of caregivers",
          "Ensure that national statistics account for, measure and value all health and care work",
          "Invest in robust public health systems",
          "Investments in health and care systems not only accelerate progress on UHC, they redistribute unpaid health and care work. When women participate in paid health and care employment, they are economically empowered and health outcomes are better. Health systems need to recognize, value and invest in all forms health and care work."

To date, 37 countries have reported switching or intent to switch to a one-dose regimen. </p><p>The commitments announced at the forum mark a watershed moment to accelerate progress on a promise made in 2020, when 194 countries adopted WHO’s <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240014107\">global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer</a>. </p><p>“We have the knowledge and the tools to make cervical cancer history, but vaccination, screening and treatment programmes are still not reaching the scale required,” said <strong>Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</strong>, <strong>WHO Director-General</strong>. “This first global forum is an important opportunity for governments and partners to invest in the global elimination strategy and addressing the inequities that deny women and girls access to the life-saving tools they need.”<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> </span></p><p>In addition to a re-commitment by Indonesia to its National Action Plan 2023, other country  commitments include:</p><ul><li><strong>Democratic Republic of Congo </strong>commits to start introducing the HPV vaccine as early as possible using the WHO-recommended single-dose schedule. We also commit to do everything to get, as early as possible, to the cervical cancer elimination strategy immunization’s coverage target for girls aged 9 to 14 years. </li><li><strong>Ethiopia<em> </em></strong>commits to implement a robust vaccine delivery strategy across the country, targeting at least 95% coverage in 2024 for all 14-year-old girls, regardless of their socioeconomic status, whether in school or out of school. The country also commits to screen 1 million eligible women every year for cervical cancer and to treat 90% of those screened, who present with positive precancerous lesions. Further, HPV single dose has been approved to be introduced this year and scaled up as part of the country’s Expanded Program on Immunization plans.</li><li><strong>Nigeria</strong> launched its HPV vaccine national program this year, adopting  the single-dose schedule for girls 9 to 14 years old, and now commits to achieving at least 80% vaccine coverage of girls. They are committed to continuing to increase coverage of the HPV vaccine through a robust delivery strategy that will meet the girls where they are. For girls who are in school, they will concentrate on school-based delivery; for girls that are not in school, they will commit to implementing outreach activities at key moments in the year, with the target of at least 80% coverage of girls targeted by 2026. </li></ul><p>The nearly US$ 600 million in new funding includes US$ 180 million from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, US$ 10 million from UNICEF, and US$ 400 million from the World Bank.

Due to supply constraints, delivery challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic, just <a href=\"/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/immunization-coverage\">one in five</a> eligible adolescent girls were vaccinated in 2022. And while there are cost-effective and evidence-based tools for screening and treatment, <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.iarc.who.int/faq/cervical-cancer-awareness-month-2021-qa/#0\">fewer than 5% </a>of women in many LMICs are ever screened for cervical cancer.

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization’s (WHO) latest HIV Drug Resistance (HIVDR) Report tells us where drug resistance is growing and offers recommendations for countries to monitor and respond to the potential challenges.</p><p>The report shares some good news and some concerning news. It highlights high levels of HIV viral load suppression (&gt;90%) in populations receiving dolutegravir (DTG)-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, observational and country-generated survey data indicate that levels of HIVDR to DTG are exceeding levels observed in clinical trials. </p><p>Since 2018, WHO has recommended use of dolutegravir as the preferred first- and second-line HIV treatment for all population groups. It is more effective, easier to take, and has fewer side effects than other drugs currently in use. It also has a high genetic barrier to developing drug resistance.</p><p>However, among the four surveys reported, levels of resistance to dolutegravir ranged from 3.9% to 8.6%, and reached 19.6% among people experienced with treatment and transitioned to a DTG-containing ART while having high HIV viral loads. To date, only a few countries have reported survey data to WHO.</p><p>“The worrying evidence of resistance in individuals with unsuppressed viral load despite dolutegravir treatment underscores the necessity for increased vigilance and intensified efforts to optimize the quality of HIV care delivery,” said Dr Meg Doherty, Director, WHO Department of the Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes. “Standardized surveillance of HIV drug resistance is essential for effectively preventing, monitoring, and responding to these challenges”.</p><p>Haiti was the only country to report data from a survey of HIVDR among ART naïve infants or infants starting ART for the first time. One infant, whose mother had received DTG-based ART, was found to have DTG resistance.  Effective management of high viral loads among pregnant and breastfeeding women is critical to prevent transmitting HIV to infants. Increasing routine surveillance for HIVDR among infants newly diagnosed with HIV not yet taking HIV treatment will be important to guide appropriate ART options for the future. </p><h2>Global targets off track</h2><p>In 2022, more than 75% of the 39 million people living with HIV globally were receiving HIV treatment. Countries have implemented the WHO recommendations with 116 of 127 having adopted WHO preferred first-line DTG-based treatment for adults and adolescents, and 74% of reporting low- and middle-income countries adopted viral load monitoring for adults and adolescents. </p><p>But progress towards the SDG targets has stalled as there were still an estimated 1.3 million new HIV infections and 630 000 deaths from HIV-related causes. Between 2017 and 2022, for most countries reporting through the Global AIDS Monitoring (GAM) system, programmatic quality indicators for HIV treatment did not achieve established global targets, which further highlights the need to proactively improve the quality of HIV treatment and care services.  </p><p>In 2022, only 12 of 45 WHO focus countries reported conducting surveys or had integrated the monitoring of HIVDR early warning indicators into routine monitoring and evaluation systems. Many countries continue to miss the mark when it comes to optimizing retention in care, population-level viral load suppression, and switching people with virological failure to different regimens. Additionally, antiretroviral drug stock-outs continue to happen which may negatively impact patient treatment adherence.</p><p>WHO recommends that countries routinely implement standardized surveillance of HIVDR to follow the prevalence and patterns of resistance among people not achieving suppressed viral load. This is critical, as information and data from surveys influence the development of treatment guidelines and inform the quality of treatment programmes.</p><h2>Recommended guidance for country action</h2><p>The report also documents cases of resistance to integrase-strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) after recent exposure to cabotegravir (CAB-LA). Delayed detection and confirmation of HIV infection can increase the risk of developing resistance to INSTIs. Since 2022, WHO has recommended the use of long-acting injectable CAB-LA as an additional HIV prevention option for people at substantial risk of HIV infection. </p><p>Despite the possible risk, WHO recommends the roll-out of CAB-LA for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and calls for the scale-up of PrEP to be accompanied by standardized surveillance of drug resistance among people testing positive for HIV while receiving PrEP.</p><p>Routine monitoring of quality-of-care indicators at both clinic and national levels, followed by addressing any suboptimal performance, remains a cornerstone for the success of ART programmes. Key quality-of-care indicators include on-time ART pick-up, retention on ART, viral load testing coverage, timely second-viral load test, ARV drug stock-outs and timely switch to second-line ART. </p><p>The new HIVDR report emphasizes the importance of strengthening data reporting systems so that countries can effectively monitor and report quality-of-care indicators. It underscores the active engagement by ART clinics and programmes in use of indicator data to develop locally appropriate and sustainable solutions. These efforts are crucial for optimizing service delivery quality, thereby reducing the emergence of drug-resistant HIV.</p><p>Minimizing the spread of HIV drug resistance is a crucial part of the broader global response to antimicrobial resistance that needs coordinated action across all government sectors and levels of society. </p><p> </p>",

          "In 2022, more than 75% of the 39 million people living with HIV globally were receiving HIV treatment. Countries have implemented the WHO recommendations with 116 of 127 having adopted WHO preferred first-line DTG-based treatment for adults and adolescents, and 74% of reporting low- and middle-income countries adopted viral load monitoring for adults and adolescents.",
          "But progress towards the SDG targets has stalled as there were still an estimated 1.3 million new HIV infections and 630 000 deaths from HIV-related causes. Between 2017 and 2022, for most countries reporting through the Global AIDS Monitoring (GAM) system, programmatic quality indicators for HIV treatment did not achieve established global targets, which further highlights the need to proactively improve the quality of HIV treatment and care services.",
          "In 2022, only 12 of 45 WHO focus countries reported conducting surveys or had integrated the monitoring of HIVDR early warning indicators into routine monitoring and evaluation systems. Many countries continue to miss the mark when it comes to optimizing retention in care, population-level viral load suppression, and switching people with virological failure to different regimens. Additionally, antiretroviral drug stock-outs continue to happen which may negatively impact patient treatment adherence.",
          "WHO recommends that countries routinely implement standardized surveillance of HIVDR to follow the prevalence and patterns of resistance among people not achieving suppressed viral load. This is critical, as information and data from surveys influence the development of treatment guidelines and inform the quality of treatment programmes."

          "The report also documents cases of resistance to integrase-strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) after recent exposure to cabotegravir (CAB-LA). Delayed detection and confirmation of HIV infection can increase the risk of developing resistance to INSTIs. Since 2022, WHO has recommended the use of long-acting injectable CAB-LA as an additional HIV prevention option for people at substantial risk of HIV infection.",
          "Despite the possible risk, WHO recommends the roll-out of CAB-LA for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and calls for the scale-up of PrEP to be accompanied by standardized surveillance of drug resistance among people testing positive for HIV while receiving PrEP.",
          "Routine monitoring of quality-of-care indicators at both clinic and national levels, followed by addressing any suboptimal performance, remains a cornerstone for the success of ART programmes. Key quality-of-care indicators include on-time ART pick-up, retention on ART, viral load testing coverage, timely second-viral load test, ARV drug stock-outs and timely switch to second-line ART.",
          "The new HIVDR report emphasizes the importance of strengthening data reporting systems so that countries can effectively monitor and report quality-of-care indicators. It underscores the active engagement by ART clinics and programmes in use of indicator data to develop locally appropriate and sustainable solutions. These efforts are crucial for optimizing service delivery quality, thereby reducing the emergence of drug-resistant HIV.",
          "Minimizing the spread of HIV drug resistance is a crucial part of the broader global response to antimicrobial resistance that needs coordinated action across all government sectors and levels of society."

Hunger and shortages of essential goods exacerbate geopolitical conflicts, ecological degradation and climate change, resulting in more frequent and extreme natural disasters. </p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">The number of crises impacting people’s health has been increasing. During 2023, WHO responded to 65 graded health emergencies worldwide, up from 40 a decade earlier. In the same year, UNHCR issued 43 emergency declarations to scale up support in 29 countries </span>–<span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"> the highest number in decades. United Nations estimates show that 300 million people will need humanitarian assistance and protection in 2024 with over half (165.7 million) in need of emergency health assistance.  </span><br/></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\">“People living with NCDs in humanitarian crises are more likely to see their condition worsen due to trauma, stress, or the inability to access medicines or services. The needs are enormous, but the resources are not,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We must find ways to better integrate NCD care in emergency response, to protect more lives from these avoidable tragedies and improve health security.”</span><br/></p><p>Refugees often face limited access to health care, which can be compounded by poor living conditions, financial difficulties, and precarious legal status. NCDs accounted for a significant proportion of all deaths in the top countries of origin of refugees under UNHCR's mandate: 75% in the Syrian Arab Republic, 92% in Ukraine, 50% in Afghanistan and 28% in South Sudan. </p><p>“As forced displacement grows, we must work to ensure the right to health of refugees, other forcibly displaced people and host communities. It is imperative that the policies, and resources are in place to support the inclusion of refugees in national health systems, including for access to care for noncommunicable diseases,” said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. “We must be innovative, and work with governments and partners to respond to such challenges.”   </p><h2>Building solutions and momentum </h2><p>There are many solutions countries and partners are putting in place to save more lives from NCDs among people affected by humanitarian crises. Since 2017, more than 142 000 WHO NCD kits containing various essential treatments for diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and other medicines have been disseminated.

That day, despite the risks, WHO staff, accompanied by an engineer, managed to reach Nasser Medical Complex on foot.

WHO also published survey results from 115 countries, showing a majority of countries do not adequately finance priority cancer and palliative care services, as part of universal health coverage (UHC). </p><p>The IARC estimates, based on the best sources of data available in countries in 2022, highlight the growing burden of cancer, the disproportionate impact on underserved populations, and the urgent need to address cancer inequities worldwide. </p><p>In 2022, there were an estimated 20 million new cancer cases and 9.7 million deaths. The estimated number of people who were alive within 5 years following a cancer diagnosis was 53.5 million. About 1 in 5 people develop cancer in their lifetime, approximately 1 in 9 men and 1 in 12 women die from the disease. </p><p>The global WHO survey on UHC and cancer shows that only 39% of participating countries covered the basics of cancer management as part of their financed core health services for all citizens, ‘health benefit packages’ (HBP). Only 28% of participating countries additionally covered care for people who require palliative care, including pain relief in general, and not just linked to cancer.</p><h3>Three major cancer types in 2022: lung, breast and colorectal cancers</h3><p>The new estimates available on IARC’s <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://gco.iarc.fr/\">Global Cancer Observatory</a> show that 10 types of cancer collectively comprised around two-thirds of new cases and deaths globally in 2022. Data covers 185 countries and 36 cancers.</p><p>Lung cancer was the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide with 2.5 million new cases accounting for 12.4% of the total new cases. Female breast cancer ranked second (2.3 million cases, 11.6%), followed by colorectal cancer (1.9 million cases, 9.6%), prostate cancer (1.5 million cases, 7.3%), and stomach cancer (970 000 cases, 4.9%). </p><p>Lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer death (1.8 million deaths, 18.7% of the total cancer deaths) followed by colorectal cancer (900 000 deaths, 9.3%), liver cancer (760 000 deaths, 7.8%), breast cancer (670 000 deaths, 6.9%) and stomach cancer (660 000 deaths, 6.8%). Lung cancer’s re-emergence as the most common cancer is likely related to persistent tobacco use in Asia. </p><p>There were some differences by sex in incidence and mortality from the global total for both sexes. For women, the most commonly diagnosed cancer and leading cause of cancer death was breast cancer, whereas it was lung cancer for men. Breast cancer was the most common cancer in women in the vast majority of countries (157 of 185).</p><p>For men, prostate and colorectal cancers were the second and third most commonly occurring cancers, while liver and colorectal cancers were the second and third most common causes of cancer death. For women, lung and colorectal cancer were second and third for both the number of new cases and of deaths.</p><p><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://gco.iarc.who.int/media/globocan/factsheets/cancers/23-cervix-uteri-fact-sheet.pdf\">Cervical cancer</a> was the eighth most commonly occurring cancer globally and the ninth leading cause of cancer death, accounting for 661 044 new cases and 348 186 deaths. It is the most common cancer in women in 25 countries, many of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. Even while recognizing varying incidence levels, cervical cancer can be eliminated as a public health problem, through the scale-up of the <a href=\"/initiatives/cervical-cancer-elimination-initiative\"></a><a href=\"/initiatives/cervical-cancer-elimination-initiative\">WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Initiative</a>.</p><h3>Striking cancer inequity by Human Development Index (HDI)</h3><p>Global estimates reveal striking inequities in the cancer burden according to human development. This is particularly true for breast cancer. In countries with a very high HDI, 1 in 12 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and 1 in 71 women die of it. By contrast, in countries with a low HDI; while only one in 27 women is diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, one in 48 women will die from it.</p><p>“Women in lower HDI countries are 50% less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women in high HDI countries, yet they are at a much higher risk of dying of the disease due to late diagnosis and inadequate access to quality treatment,” explains Dr Isabelle Soerjomataram, Deputy Head of the Cancer Surveillance Branch at IARC.</p><p><a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240088504\">WHO’s global survey of HBPs</a> also revealed significant global inequities in cancer services. Lung cancer-related services were reportedly 4–7 times more likely to be included in a HBP in a high-income than a lower-income country. On average, there was a four-fold greater likelihood of radiation services being covered in a HBP of a high-income than a lower-income country. The widest disparity for any service was stem-cell transplantation, which was 12 times more likely to be included in a HBP of a high-income than a lower-income country.</p><p><strong>“</strong>WHO’s new global survey sheds light on major inequalities and lack of financial protection for cancer around the world, with populations, especially in lower income countries, unable to access the basics of cancer care<strong>,” </strong>said Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Director of the Department of Noncommunicable Diseases at WHO. “WHO, including through its cancer initiatives, is working intensively with more than 75 governments to develop, finance and implement policies to promote cancer care for all. To expand on this work, major investments are urgently needed to address global inequities in cancer outcomes.”</p><h3>Projected cancer burden increase in 2050</h3><p>Over 35 million new cancer cases are predicted in 2050, a 77% increase from the estimated 20 million cases in 2022. The rapidly growing global cancer burden reflects both population ageing and growth, as well as changes to people’s exposure to risk factors, several of which are associated with socioeconomic development. Tobacco, alcohol and obesity are key factors behind the increasing incidence of cancer, with air pollution still a key driver of environmental risk factors. </p><p>In terms of the absolute burden, high HDI countries are expected to experience the greatest absolute increase in incidence, with an additional 4.8 million new cases predicted in 2050 compared with 2022 estimates. Yet the proportional increase in incidence is most striking in low HDI countries (142% increase) and in medium HDI countries (99%). Likewise, cancer mortality in these countries is projected to almost double in 2050.<br/></p><p>“The impact of this increase will not be felt evenly across countries of different HDI levels. Those who have the fewest resources to manage their cancer burdens will bear the brunt of the global cancer burden,” says Dr Freddie Bray, Head of the Cancer Surveillance Branch at IARC.<br/></p><p>“Despite the progress that has been made in the early detection of cancers and the treatment and care of cancer patients–significant disparities in cancer treatment outcomes exist not only between high and low-income regions of the world, but also within countries. Where someone lives should not determine whether they live. Tools exist to enable governments to prioritise cancer care, and to ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality services. This is not just a resource issue but a matter of political will,” says Dr Cary Adams, head of UICC - Union for International Cancer Control.</p><p><strong>Note to editors: </strong></p><p>The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is the cancer agency of the World Health Organization.

Breast cancer was the most common cancer in women in the vast majority of countries (157 of 185).",
          "For men, prostate and colorectal cancers were the second and third most commonly occurring cancers, while liver and colorectal cancers were the second and third most common causes of cancer death. For women, lung and colorectal cancer were second and third for both the number of new cases and of deaths.",
          "Cervical cancer was the eighth most commonly occurring cancer globally and the ninth leading cause of cancer death, accounting for 661 044 new cases and 348 186 deaths. It is the most common cancer in women in 25 countries, many of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. Even while recognizing varying incidence levels, cervical cancer can be eliminated as a public health problem, through the scale-up of the WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Initiative ."

          "Global estimates reveal striking inequities in the cancer burden according to human development. This is particularly true for breast cancer. In countries with a very high HDI, 1 in 12 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and 1 in 71 women die of it. By contrast, in countries with a low HDI; while only one in 27 women is diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, one in 48 women will die from it.",
          "“Women in lower HDI countries are 50% less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women in high HDI countries, yet they are at a much higher risk of dying of the disease due to late diagnosis and inadequate access to quality treatment,” explains Dr Isabelle Soerjomataram, Deputy Head of the Cancer Surveillance Branch at IARC.",
          "WHO’s global survey of HBPs also revealed significant global inequities in cancer services. Lung cancer-related services were reportedly 4–7 times more likely to be included in a HBP in a high-income than a lower-income country. On average, there was a four-fold greater likelihood of radiation services being covered in a HBP of a high-income than a lower-income country. The widest disparity for any service was stem-cell transplantation, which was 12 times more likely to be included in a HBP of a high-income than a lower-income country.",
          "“ WHO’s new global survey sheds light on major inequalities and lack of financial protection for cancer around the world, with populations, especially in lower income countries, unable to access the basics of cancer care ,” said Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Director of the Department of Noncommunicable Diseases at WHO. “WHO, including through its cancer initiatives, is working intensively with more than 75 governments to develop, finance and implement policies to promote cancer care for all. To expand on this work, major investments are urgently needed to address global inequities in cancer outcomes.”"

          "Over 35 million new cancer cases are predicted in 2050, a 77% increase from the estimated 20 million cases in 2022. The rapidly growing global cancer burden reflects both population ageing and growth, as well as changes to people’s exposure to risk factors, several of which are associated with socioeconomic development. Tobacco, alcohol and obesity are key factors behind the increasing incidence of cancer, with air pollution still a key driver of environmental risk factors.",
          "In terms of the absolute burden, high HDI countries are expected to experience the greatest absolute increase in incidence, with an additional 4.8 million new cases predicted in 2050 compared with 2022 estimates. Yet the proportional increase in incidence is most striking in low HDI countries (142% increase) and in medium HDI countries (99%). Likewise, cancer mortality in these countries is projected to almost double in 2050.",
          "“The impact of this increase will not be felt evenly across countries of different HDI levels. Those who have the fewest resources to manage their cancer burdens will bear the brunt of the global cancer burden,” says Dr Freddie Bray, Head of the Cancer Surveillance Branch at IARC.",
          "“Despite the progress that has been made in the early detection of cancers and the treatment and care of cancer patients–significant disparities in cancer treatment outcomes exist not only between high and low-income regions of the world, but also within countries. Where someone lives should not determine whether they live. Tools exist to enable governments to prioritise cancer care, and to ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality services. This is not just a resource issue but a matter of political will,” says Dr Cary Adams, head of UICC - Union for International Cancer Control.",

    "content_html": "<p>WHO has awarded its first-ever certificates validating progress in eliminating industrially produced trans fatty-acids to five countries. Denmark, Lithuania, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand have each demonstrated they have a best practice policy for industrially produced trans-fatty acids (iTFA) elimination in effect, supported by adequate monitoring and enforcement systems. WHO also released results from the first five years of its <a href=\"/teams/nutrition-and-food-safety/replace-trans-fat\">REPLACE initiative</a> to eliminate iTFA.</p><p>While the ambitious target set by WHO in 2018—to fully eliminate iTFA from the global food supply by the end of 2023—was not met, there has been remarkable progress made towards this goal in every region of the world. In 2023 alone, new best-practice policies became effective in 7 countries (Egypt, Mexico, Moldova, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Philippines, and Ukraine). </p><p>Trans-fatty acids (TFA) are semisolid to solid fats that occur in two forms: industrially produced and naturally occurring. Intake of TFA is associated with increased risk of heart attacks and death from heart disease. TFA have no known health benefits, and foods high in iTFA (e.g. fried foods, cakes and ready meals) are often high in sugar, fat and salt.</p><p>A total of 53 countries have now best practice policies in effect for tackling iTFA in food, vastly improving the food environment for 3.7 billion people, or 46% of the world’s population, as compared to 6% just 5 years ago. These policies are expected to save approximately 183 000 lives a year.</p><p>“Trans fat has no known health benefit, but huge health risks,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “We are very pleased that so many countries have introduced policies banning or limiting trans fat in food. But introducing a policy is one thing; implementing it is another. I congratulate Denmark, Lithuania, Poland, Saudi Arabia and Thailand, who are leading the world in monitoring and enforcing their trans fat policies. We urge other countries to follow their lead.”</p><p>Accelerating efforts to achieving best-practice policies in just 8 countries with the highest needs would eliminate 90% of the global iTFA burden, representing a unique opportunity to see in our lifetime a world free from deaths attributable to iTFA.</p><p>The WHO validation programme for iTFA elimination recognizes those countries which went beyond introducing best practice policies by ensuring rigorous monitoring and enforcement systems in place. Monitoring and enforcing compliance with policies is critical to maximizing and sustaining the health benefits of iTFA elimination.</p><p>Best practices in iTFA elimination policies follow WHO criteria and limit iTFA use in all settings. There are two best-practice policy options: 1) mandatory national limit of 2 grams of iTFA per 100 grams of total fat in all foods; and 2) mandatory national ban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated oils (a major source of trans fat) as an ingredient in all foods. For some countries, an optimal programme would implement both policies, due to the sources of trans fat.</p><p>“Trans fat elimination is economically, politically, and technically feasible and saves lives at virtually no cost to governments or consumers. This harmful compound is unnecessary, and no one misses it when it’s gone,” said Dr Tom Frieden, President and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives. \"We are winning the battle against trans fat, but countries without regulations are at risk of becoming dumping grounds for TFA products. Governments and the food industry have a responsibility to ensure that doesn’t happen.\"</p><p>WHO also encourages food manufacturers—the producers of raw materials and final food products—to eliminate iTFA from their products. The food industry has made good progress so far, as presented in a <a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789240079854\">November 2023 WHO repor</a>t. </p><p>Despite recent successes in eliminating iTFA from food globally, over half of the world's population remain unprotected from its harmful impacts, thus putting them at a potential risk of increasing heart disease.</p><p>While countries should continue to strive for total elimination of iTFA, based on what has been achieved in the 5 years since the global call for elimination, WHO proposes a revised new target for virtual elimination of iTFA globally by 2025. The target includes: </p><ul><li>best-practice elimination policies are passed in countries that account for at least 90% of the total global iTFA burden.</li><li>best practice policies are passed in countries that account for at least 70% of the total burden within regions.</li></ul><p>Eliminating iTFA is a powerful way to prevent heart disease and the high costs to individuals and economies in medical treatment and lost productivity. WHO remains committed to supporting countries in their efforts and celebrating their achievements.</p><p>The next application cycle for the iTFA elimination validation programme will open in March 2024 and applications will be received on a continued basis.</p><h3>For editors<br/></h3><p>The World Health Organization has partnered with Resolve to Save Lives, a not-for-profit organization, to support the development and implementation of the REPLACE action package.

Across the Gaza Strip, the few remaining hospitals find themselves in ever more dire circumstances, with hostilities often preventing access for patients and supplies, and health workers managing on little rest and scarce supplies.</p></div><div><p>The mission was carried out along with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the United Nations Department of Safety and Security, and Médecins Sans Frontières.</p></div><div><p>The last humanitarian mission to northern Gaza took place on 12 January.</p></div><div><p>Yesterday‘s mission, which delivered 19 000 liters of fuel to Al-Shifa Hospital, faced delays at the checkpoint. The roads leading to the hospital were severely damaged, and the desperation in northern Gaza was apparent, as thousands of civilians surrounded the UN vehicles and fuel truck in the hopes of finding food and water, also delaying the mission.</p></div><div><p>In Al-Shifa Hospital, the mission saw that the functionality has improved since the last visit ten days ago. A significant decrease in the number of displaced people, from 40 000 to 10 000 was observed. There are 120 health and care workers, and 300 patients. The hospital conducts 5-10 surgeries daily, mainly trauma cases that require immediate care.</p></div><div><p>Essential services such as basic laboratory and radiological facilities remain operational, along with emergency care, a surgical unit with three operation theaters, post-operative care, and a dialysis unit. There are plans to reopen a 9-bed ICU over the coming days.</p></div><div><p>There are no maternity or pediatric services, and shortages of specialized doctors, medicines, and medical supplies such as orthopedic equipment. These units could become operational again, but will require a consistent supply of fuel, oxygen, medical supplies, and other aid. <br/></p></div><div><p>The hospital’s primary oxygen plant has been destroyed. They are relying on a smaller plant.</p></div><div><p>Seven out of 24 hospitals remain open in northern Gaza. These are only partially functioning, without enough specialized medical staff to manage the volume and range of injuries, nor sufficient medicines and medical supplies, fuel, clean water, or food for patients or staff. Additionally, two Ministry of Health primary healthcare centers in northern Gaza are partially functional but lack essential supplies, including syringes and vaccines needed for routine immunization. <br/></p></div><div><p>Intensified military presence and hostilities in southern Gaza are also placing patients and health workers at risk, and compromising access to health care. They are severely obstructing the movement of health workers, ambulances, and health partners' ability to resupply hospitals, eroding their functionality. WHO staff say the situation for hospitals in Khan Yunis is “catastrophic and indescribable.”  <br/></p></div><div><p>In southern Gaza, which used to have 12 hospitals, only 7 remain partially functional. A further two, Al-Kheir Hospital and Nasser Medical Complex, are only minimally functional and now inaccessible. <br/></p></div><div><p>WHO is extremely concerned about reports of Al-Kheir Hospital, a small NGO-run hospital with around 30 beds, facing military incursions and several health workers being detained. Communication with the hospital is no longer possible. <br/></p></div><div><p>Due to evacuation orders in neighborhoods surrounding Nasser Medical Complex--the largest hospital in the south--and continuous hostilities in the vicinity of the hospital, the Ministry of Health reports that large numbers of wounded people are on the hospital grounds.</p></div><div><p>An international emergency medical team deployed at Nasser says that no one can enter or exit the facility due to ongoing bombardment close by.  <br/></p></div><div><p>Health staff are reported to be digging graves on hospital grounds due to the large numbers of deaths anticipated and the need to manage dead bodies. This horrifying situation should never take place in any hospital. <br/></p></div><div><p>Hostilities around Al-Amal Hospital are risking the facility becoming non-functional, as ambulances and injured patients reportedly cannot access the facility. <br/></p></div><div><p>WHO again calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, active protection of civilians and health care, and sustained access for the delivery of critical aid across the Strip.</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: Reference to a partner was removed at their request.</em></p></div>",

LMMs are unique in their mimicry of human communication and ability to carry out tasks they were not explicitly programmed to perform. LMMs have been adopted faster than any consumer application in history, with several platforms – such as ChatGPT, Bard and Bert – entering the public consciousness in 2023. </p><p>“Generative AI technologies have the potential to improve health care but only if those who develop, regulate, and use these technologies identify and fully account for the associated risks,” said Dr Jeremy Farrar, WHO Chief Scientist. “We need transparent information and policies to manage the design, development, and use of LMMs to achieve better health outcomes and overcome persisting health inequities.”</p><h3>Potential benefits and risks</h3><p>The new WHO guidance outlines five broad applications of LMMs for health: </p><ul><li>Diagnosis and clinical care, such as responding to patients’ written queries;</li><li>Patient-guided use, such as for investigating symptoms and treatment;</li><li>Clerical and administrative tasks, such as documenting and summarizing patient visits within electronic health records;</li><li>Medical and nursing education, including providing trainees with simulated patient encounters, and;</li><li>Scientific research and drug development, including to identify new compounds. <br/></li></ul><p>While LMMs are starting to be used for specific health-related purposes, there are also documented risks of producing false, inaccurate, biased, or incomplete statements, which could harm people using such information in making health decisions. Furthermore, LMMs may be trained on data that are of poor quality or biased, whether by race, ethnicity, ancestry, sex, gender identity, or age.</p><p>The guidance also details broader risks to health systems, such as accessibility and affordability of the best-performing LMMs. LMMS can also encourage ‘automation bias’ by health care professionals and patients, whereby errors are overlooked that would otherwise have been identified or difficult choices are improperly delegated to a LMM. LMMs, like other forms of AI, are also vulnerable to cybersecurity risks that could endanger patient information or the trustworthiness of these algorithms and the provision of health care more broadly. </p><p>To create safe and effective LMMs, WHO underlines the need for engagement of various stakeholders: governments, technology companies, healthcare providers, patients, and civil society, in all stages of development and deployment of such technologies, including their oversight and regulation. </p><p>“Governments from all countries must cooperatively lead efforts to effectively regulate the development and use of AI technologies, such as LMMs,” said Dr Alain Labrique, WHO Director for Digital Health and Innovation in the Science Division.</p><h3>Key recommendations</h3><p>The new WHO guidance includes recommendations for governments, who have the primary responsibility to set standards for the development and deployment of LMMs, and their integration and use for public health and medical purposes. For example, governments should: </p><ul><li>Invest in or provide not-for-profit or public infrastructure, including computing power and public data sets, accessible to developers in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors, that requires users to adhere to ethical principles and values in exchange for access.</li><li>Use laws, policies and regulations to ensure that LMMs and applications used in health care and medicine, irrespective of the risk or benefit associated with the AI technology, meet ethical obligations and human rights standards that affect, for example, a person’s dignity, autonomy or privacy.</li><li>Assign an existing or new regulatory agency to assess and approve LMMs and applications intended for use in health care or medicine – as resources permit. </li><li>Introduce mandatory post-release auditing and impact assessments, including for data protection and human rights, by independent third parties when an LMM is deployed on a large scale. The auditing and impact assessments should be published and should include outcomes and impacts disaggregated by the type of user, including for example by age, race or disability.</li></ul><p>The guidance also includes the following key recommendations for developers of LMMs, who should ensure that:</p><ul><li>LMMs are designed not only by scientists and engineers. Potential users and all direct and indirect stakeholders, including medical providers, scientific researchers, health care professionals and patients, should be engaged from the early stages of AI development in structured, inclusive, transparent design and given opportunities to raise ethical issues, voice concerns and provide input for the AI application under consideration.</li><li>LMMs are designed to perform well-defined tasks with the necessary accuracy and reliability to improve the capacity of health systems and advance patient interests. Developers should also be able to predict and understand potential secondary outcomes. </li></ul><h3>Editor’s note</h3><p>The new document on Ethics and governance of AI for health Guidance on large multi-modal models is based on WHO’s guidance published in June 2021.

Health-care services are also critical for breaking the cycle that too often leaves communities in a perilous state and reliant on yet more emergency assistance,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p><p>Support in 2024 will enable life-saving health care, distribution of critical health supplies and equipment, along with maintenance of essential health services to ensure continuous care. The funding supports direct access to health care for communities in hard-to-reach areas, in partnerships with local organizations, and effective response to monitor, share information and document outbreaks and attacks on health workers. Other important actions are maintenance of existing health-care systems and building resilience against future threats.</p><p>The appeal notes the positive value of funding to supporting people with humanitarian needs. Every US$ 1 invested in WHO delivers a return on investment of at least US$ 35. </p><p>The funding would go to the African Region, with US$ 334 million; the Eastern Mediterranean Region, with US$ 705 million; the European region, with US$ 183 million; the Western Pacific Region, with US$ 15.2 million; the South-East Asia Region, with US$ 49 million; and the Americas Region, with US$ 131 million.</p><p>“With the support of donors, we will save lives, meet critical health needs for the most vulnerable, and help communities emerge from crises with a greater ability to tackle future health threats. WHO appreciates all support received in 2023, which allowed us to assist millions of people. As we enter 2024, the solidarity and support of the international community is needed more than ever,” said Dr Tedros.</p><h2>Launch event</h2><p><strong><a href=\"/news-room/events/detail/2024/01/15/default-calendar/who-s-health-emergency-appeal-2024\">Launch of the WHO Health Emergency Appeal 2024</a></strong><br/>15 January 2024 | 15:00-16:00 CET (Geneva time) | Webcast</p><p> </p>",

    "content_html": "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has certified Cabo Verde as a malaria-free country, marking a significant achievement in global health. With this announcement, Cabo Verde joins the ranks of 43 countries and 1 territory that WHO has awarded this certification.</p><p>Cabo Verde is the third country to be certified in the WHO African region, joining Mauritius and Algeria which were certified in 1973 and 2019 respectively. Malaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounted for approximately 95% of global malaria cases and 96% of related deaths in 2021. </p><p>Certification of malaria elimination will drive positive development on many fronts for Cabo Verde.  Systems and structures built for malaria elimination have strengthened the health system and will be used to fight other mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever. Travellers from non-malaria endemic regions can now travel to the islands of Cabo Verde without fear of local malaria infections and the potential inconvenience of preventive treatment measures. This has the potential to attract more visitors and boost socio-economic activities in a country where tourism accounts for approximately 25 per cent of GDP.</p><p>“I salute the government and people of Cabo Verde for their unwavering commitment and resilience in their journey to eliminating malaria,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “WHO’s certification of Cabo Verde being malaria-free is testament to the power of strategic public health planning, collaboration, and sustained effort to protect and promote health. Cabo Verde's success is the latest in the global fight against malaria, and gives us hope that with existing tools, as well as new ones including vaccines, we can dare to dream of a malaria-free world.”</p><p>Certification of malaria elimination is the official recognition by WHO of a country’s malaria-free status. The certification is granted when a country has shown – with rigorous, credible evidence – that the chain of indigenous malaria transmission by <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes has been interrupted nationwide for at least the past three consecutive years.  A country must also demonstrate the capacity to prevent the re-establishment of transmission.</p><p>“The certification as a malaria-free country has a huge impact, and it's taken a long time to get to this point. In terms of the country's external image, this is very good, both for tourism and for everyone else. The challenge that Cabo Verde has overcome in the health system is being recognised”, said the Cabo Verde´s Prime Minister, Ulisses Correia e Silva.</p><p>Cabo Verde, an archipelago of 10 islands in the Central Atlantic Ocean, has faced significant malaria challenges. Before the 1950s, all islands were affected by malaria. Severe epidemics were regular occurrences in the most densely populated areas until targeted interventions were implemented. Through the targeted use of insecticide spraying, the country eliminated malaria twice: in 1967 and 1983. However, subsequent lapses in vector control led to a return of the disease. Since the last peak of malaria cases in the late 1980s, malaria in Cabo Verde has been confined to two islands: Santiago and Boa Vista, which have now both been malaria-free since 2017.</p><p> “Cabo Verde’s achievement is a beacon of hope for the African Region and beyond. It demonstrates that with strong political will, effective policies, community engagement and multisectoral collaboration, malaria elimination is an achievable goal,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “The attainment of this milestone by Cabo Verde is an inspiring example for other nations to follow.”</p><p>Cabo Verde's journey to malaria elimination has been long and received a boost with the inclusion of this objective in its national health policy in 2007. A strategic malaria plan from 2009 to 2013 laid the groundwork for success, focusing on expanded diagnosis, early and effective treatment, and the reporting and investigating all cases. To stem the tide of imported cases from mainland Africa, diagnosis and treatment were provided free of charge to international travellers and migrants.</p><p>In 2017 the country turned an outbreak into an opportunity. Cabo Verde identified problems and made improvements, leading to zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years.</p><p>During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the country safeguarded progress; efforts focused on improving the quality and sustainability of vector control and malaria diagnosis, strengthening malaria surveillance - especially at ports, airports, in the capital city and areas with a risk of malaria re-establishment. </p><p>Collaboration between the Ministry of Health and various government departments focused on the environment, agriculture, transportation, tourism, and more, played a pivotal role in Cabo Verde's success. The inter-ministerial commission for vector control, chaired by the Prime Minister was key to elimination. The collaborative effort and the commitment of community-based organizations and NGOs demonstrate the importance of a holistic approach to public health.</p><p>As Cabo Verde celebrates this monumental achievement, the global community commends its leaders, healthcare professionals, and citizens for their dedication to eliminating malaria and creating a healthier future for all.</p><p> </p><h3>Note to the editor</h3><p><strong>WHO malaria-free certification </strong></p><p>The final decision on awarding a malaria-free certification rests with the WHO Director-General, based on a recommendation by the independent Technical Advisory Group on Malaria Elimination and Certification.
