          "Five years ago on 31 December 2019, WHO’s Country Office in China picked up a media statement by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission from their website on cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, China. In the weeks, months and years that unfolded after that, COVID-19 came to shape our lives and our world.",
          "At WHO, we went to work immediately as the new year dawned. WHO employees activated emergency systems on 1 January 2020, and informed the world on 4 January. By 9-12 January, WHO had published its first set of comprehensive guidance for countries, and on 13 January, we brought together partners to publish the blueprint of the first SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test.",
          "All along, we convened experts and ministries of health from around the world, gathered and analysed data, and shared what was reported, what we learned and what it meant for people. Read about WHO’s actions in this interactive timeline .",
          "As we mark this milestone, let’s take a moment to honour the lives changed and lost, recognize those who are suffering from COVID-19 and long COVID, express gratitude to the health workers who sacrificed so much to care for us, and commit to learning from COVID-19 to build a healthier tomorrow.",
          "We continue to call on China to share data and access so we can understand the origins of COVID-19. This is a moral and scientific imperative. Without transparency, sharing, and cooperation among countries, the world cannot adequately prevent and prepare for future epidemics and pandemics.",

          "WHO is appalled by yesterday’s raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital, which put the last major health facility in North Gaza out of service. The systematic dismantling of the health system and a siege for over 80 days on North Gaza puts the lives of the 75,000 Palestinians remaining in the area at risk. Initial reports indicate that some areas of the hospital were burnt and severely damaged during the raid, including the laboratory, surgical unit, engineering and maintenance department, operations theatre, and the medical store. Earlier in the day, twelve patients and a female health staff were reportedly forced to evacuate to destroyed and non-functional Indonesian Hospital where it is not possible to provide any care, while the majority of the staff, stable patients and companions were moved to a nearby location. Additionally, some people were reportedly stripped and forced to walk toward southern Gaza. Over the last two months, the area around the hospital has remained highly volatile and attacks on the hospitals and on health workers have occurred almost daily. This week, bombardments in its vicinity reportedly killed 50 people, including five health workers from Kamal Adwan Hospital. Kamal Adwan is now empty. Yesterday evening, the remaining 15 critical patients, 50 caregivers and 20 health workers were transferred to Indonesian Hospital, which lacks the necessary equipment and supplies to provide adequate care. The movement and treatment of these critical patients under such conditions pose grave risks to their survival. WHO is deeply concerned for their wellbeing, as well as for the Kamal Adwan Hospital director who has been reportedly detained during the raid. WHO lost contact with him since the raid began. An urgent WHO mission to Indonesian Hospital is being planned for tomorrow to assess the situation at the facility, provide basic medical supplies, food and water, and safely move critical patients to Gaza City for continued care. The raid on the Kamal Adwan hospital follows escalating restrictions on access and repeated attacks. Since early October 2024, WHO has verified at least 50 attacks on health on or near the hospital. Despite the increasingly dire needs for emergency and trauma services and supplies, only 10 out of 21 WHO missions to Kamal Adwan have been partially facilitated between early October and December. During these missions, 45 000 liters of fuel, medical supplies, blood, and food were delivered, and 114 patients along with 123 companions were transferred to Al-Shifa Hospital. But the deployment of international emergency medical teams has been repeatedly denied. WHO and partners' efforts to sustain the hospitals’ operations have been undone. With Kamal Adwan and Indonesian hospitals entirely out of service, and Al-Awda Hospital barely able to function, and severely damaged due to recent airstrikes, the healthcare lifeline for those in North Gaza is reaching a breaking point. WHO calls for urgently ensuring that hospitals in North Gaza can be supported to become functional again. Hospitals have once again become battlegrounds, reminiscent of the destruction of the health system in Gaza City earlier this year. Since October 2023, WHO has repeatedly issued urgent calls to protect health workers and hospitals as per international humanitarian law —yet these calls remain unheard. Health facilities, workers and patients are always off limits. They must be actively protected and never be attacked, nor used for military purposes. The principles of precaution, distinction and proportionality under International Humanitarian Law are absolute and always apply."

The event was attended by WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, French President H.E. Emmanuel Macron, alongside dozens of health ministers, international representatives, donors, and local French partners.",
          "The WHO Academy is a revolutionary project which will contribute to a better trained health workforce around the world, through the most ambitious lifelong training programme ever designed in the field of public health. More concretely, through trainings delivered in Lyon and everywhere in the world on its online platform, it will give access to the critical skills and competencies as well as to the latest knowledge and know-how in terms of public health to health professionals, policy-makers, and WHO’s own workforce.",
          "Thanks to partnerships built with the best academic and research institutes in public health around the globe, the WHO Academy intends to address identified weaknesses in health systems – the first of which being the growing global shortage of health and care workers, projected to reach 10 million by 2030, but also the widening gap in terms of access to the latest research and innovation. The majority of this shortfall will be felt in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa. With the view to build and share access to the most advanced technology for health and care and research and development in the field of health, including AI, the Academy will bring additional capacity and efficiency directly to health systems.",
          "Launched seven years ago, this pioneering initiative has been made possible through generous support from the Government of France, the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, Lyon City and Métropole, and other global partners. The WHO Academy’s new state-of-the-art campus spans 11 000 square meters and includes: twenty-two training rooms, two distance-learning rooms, a simulation centre, an emergency operations centre, a TV recording studio, a modern auditorium and a library.",
          "The Academy also has an online learning platform that democratizes access to world-class health education. This platform features free, cutting-edge courses on priority health topics, ensuring that professionals across the globe can access high-quality training, regardless of their location.",
          "President Emmanuel Macron said: \"Today we can be proud to open in the city of Lyon the doors of a new global institution, which will bring the best in terms of health training and innovation to the world. The latest tech and AI developments will be very powerful to make health care more accessible everywhere. This investment will benefit us all, because better trained health workers are absolutely critical to make our world safer, including to prevent and respond to future pandemics. I trust this strong partnership with WHO will demonstrate our trust in its capacity to guide our health policies across the globe and to coordinate our actions, to be always more efficient to serve our people on the ground.\"",
          "Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General said: “WHO is known for producing world-class technical products – guidelines, norms, and standards – but translating these into real-world action has been hindered by a lack of institutionalized training. Often, our technical products sit unused on shelves or unread in inboxes. The WHO Academy will be game-changing, a first-of-its-kind global health learning centre that will equip health and care workers, policy-makers, and our own global workforce with the competencies and skills they need to transform health systems and deliver health for all.\"",
          "The shortage of health-care workers is one of the greatest challenges to global health. It has left millions without access to essential health-care services, such as immunization, maternal care, treatment for communicable diseases, and more.",
          "Through the WHO Academy, thousands of health professionals will be trained each year. By 2028, the Academy aims to train 3 million health-care workers, including nurses, clinicians, and midwives, along with 900 senior decision-makers and 13 000 public health managers. The WHO Academy will produce 50 to 80 courses annually from 2025 to 2028, totalling approximately 260 new courses by 2028.",
          "The WHO Academy represents a bold step forward in closing the global health workforce gap. By providing high-quality, accessible education and training to health professionals worldwide, the Academy will play a key role in strengthening health systems, improving service delivery, and advancing health equity."

This report contains crucial data for policy-making and recommendations for urgent action to save lives.”",

This may be influenced by the levels of national commitments to address the issue: within the African Region, only 15% of countries had a national strategy or plan for drowning prevention, compared to 45% of countries in the European Region.",

Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Philanthropies, WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries, and 108th mayor of New York City. “For more than a decade, Bloomberg Philanthropies has supported governments and local organizations that are leading effective drowning prevention efforts.

The report entitled, “Global spending on health Emerging from the pandemic” has been published in alignment with the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Day campaign marked annually on 12 December. The campaign’s focus for 2024 is on improving financial protection for people everywhere to access health services they need.",

Yet, WHO’s report shows that out-of-pocket spending remained the main source of health financing in 30 low- and lower middle-income countries. In 20 of these countries, more than half of total health spending in the country was paid for by patients out of their pocket, which contributes to the cycle of poverty and vulnerability.",

Even in high-income countries, out-of-pocket payments lead to financial hardship and unmet need, particularly among the poorest households. Most recent health accounts data show that in over a third of high-income countries, more than 20% of total health spending was paid out-of-pocket.",

          "Around 846 million people aged between 15 and 49 are living with genital herpes infections – more than 1 in 5 of this age-group globally – according to new estimates released today. At least 1 person each second – 42 million people annually – is estimated to acquire a new genital herpes infection.",
          "Most of the time, these infections cause no or few symptoms. However, for some people they lead to painful genital sores and blisters that can recur throughout life, causing significant discomfort and often requiring multiple healthcare visits. According to the estimates, more than 200 million people aged 15 to 49 suffered at least one such symptomatic episode in 2020.",
          "The authors of the study, published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections , say that new treatments and vaccines are needed to reduce adverse health effects of the herpes virus and control its spread.",
          "“While most people with a genital herpes infection experience few symptoms, with so many infections genital herpes still causes pain and distress for millions globally and strains already overburdened health systems,” said Dr Meg Doherty, Director of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes at WHO. “Better prevention and treatment options are urgently needed to reduce herpes transmission and will also contribute to reducing the transmission of HIV.”",
          "Currently, there is no cure for herpes, although treatments can relieve symptoms. In addition to sores, genital herpes can also on occasion lead to serious complications, including neonatal herpes – a rare condition most likely to occur when a mother acquires the infection for the first time in late pregnancy and then transmits the virus to her baby during childbirth.",
          "There are two types of the herpes simplex virus (HSV), known as HSV-1 and HSV-2, both of which can lead to genital herpes. According to the estimates, 520 million people in 2020 had genital HSV-2, which is transmitted during sexual activity. From a public health perspective, genital HSV-2 is more serious since it is substantially more likely to cause recurrent outbreaks, accounts for around 90% of symptomatic episodes, and is linked to a three-fold increased risk of getting HIV.",
          "Unlike HSV-2, HSV-1 primarily spreads during childhood through saliva or skin to skin contact around the mouth to cause oral herpes, with cold sores or mouth ulcers the most common symptoms. In those without previous infection, however, HSV-1 can be acquired through sexual contact to cause genital infection in adolescence or adulthood. Some 376 million people are estimated to have had genital HSV-1 infections in 2020. Of these, 50 million are estimated also to have HSV-2 as it is possible to have both types at the same time.",
          "While the 2020 estimates show virtually no difference in the prevalence of genital HSV-2 compared to 2016, estimated genital HSV-1 infections are higher. Over recent years, several countries have observed changing patterns of transmission in HSV-1, with adult genital infections increasing as childhood oral infections decline. Reduced oral spread during childhood may be linked to factors like less crowded living conditions and improved hygiene, which then increases susceptibility to the virus at older ages. The authors note that these increases may also partially reflect changes in methods and additional data sources.",
          "“Stigma around genital herpes means it has been discussed too little, despite affecting millions of people globally. Not enough has been done to address this common infection,” said Dr Sami Gottlieb, an author of the report and Medical Officer within WHO’s Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research including the UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP). “Expanded research and investment in developing new herpes vaccines and therapies, and their equitable use, could play a critical role in improving quality of life for people around the world.”",
          "While they are not fully effective at stopping its spread, correct and consistent use of condoms reduces risks of herpes transmission. People with active symptoms should avoid sexual contact with other people, since herpes is most contagious when sores are present. WHO recommends that people with symptoms of genital herpes should be offered HIV testing and if needed, pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention.",
          "In line with its Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections for 2022-2030 , WHO works to increase awareness about genital herpes infections and related symptoms, improve access to antiviral medications, and promote related HIV prevention efforts. It is also working to advance research and development of new tools for the prevention and control of herpes infections, such as vaccines, treatments and topical microbicides.",
          "Earlier this year, a new study showed that genital herpes infections not only cause significant health impacts but also major economic costs – amounting to an estimated US $35 billion a year worldwide – through health care expenditures and productivity loss."

The Committee, however, noted that the most intense WPV1 transmission is in the southern cross border epidemiological corridor comprising of Quetta Block of Pakistan and South Region of Afghanistan. Moreover, WPV1 transmission is seemingly re-establishing in historical core reservoirs of Karachi and Peshawar of Pakistan. Review of the molecular epidemiology indicates that there has been progressive elimination of the genetic cluster ‘YB3C’ in 2022 and 2023, with its last detection in November 2023 in Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. However, there has been persistent transmission of YB3A genetic cluster since May 2022, resulting in its split into two: YB3A4A and YB3A4B. The YB3A4A is a shared cluster in the northern and southern cross-border corridors across Afghanistan and Pakistan, while the YB3A4B is mainly active in Pakistan.",
          "Both Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to implement an intensive and synchronized campaign schedule focusing on improved vaccination coverage in the endemic zones and effective and timely response to WPV1 detections elsewhere in each country. Both countries implemented two nationwide rounds each in 2024 so far; Afghanistan implemented an additional four and Pakistan an additional six sub-national vaccination rounds. After very encouraging progress towards implementing house-to-house campaigns in all of Afghanistan during the first half of 2024, Afghanistan programme has recently gone back to implementing site-to-site modality campaigns. The Committee was concerned about this recent development, since site-to-site campaigns are not able to reach all the children in Afghanistan especially those of younger age and girls, which may lead to a further upsurge of WPV1 with geographical spread in Afghanistan and beyond. In Pakistan, the campaign quality in the endemic zone of South KP and historic WPV1 reservoirs continues to face challenges relating to operational implementation and increasing insecurity (including attacks on health works) particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. Despite some recent progress in the endemic South KP in Pakistan, there are concerning numbers of missed children during the recent campaigns (ranging from 5000 to 700 000) due to insecurity, boycotts, and programme quality issues. Key AFP surveillance performance indicators are not meeting the targets in some of the districts of South KP of Pakistan. In addition to seasonal movement patterns within and between the two endemic countries, the continued return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan compounds the challenges faced. The scale of the displacement increases the risk of cross-border poliovirus spread as well as spread within both the countries. This risk is being managed and mitigated in both countries through vaccination at border crossing points and the updating of micro-plans in the districts of origin and return. The programme continues to closely coordinate with IOM and UNHCR.",
          "In summary, the available data indicate that globally transmission of WPV1 is geographically limited to the two WPV1 endemic countries; however, there has been geographical spread and intensifying transmission within the two endemic countries in 2024."

French Guiana reported three cVDPV3 positive environmental samples while Guinea reported three paralytic cases.",
          "The Committee noted that much of the risk for cVDPV outbreaks can be linked to a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, a high concentration of zero dose and under-immunized children along with continued population displacement. These factors are currently most evident in northern Yemen where response immunization has not yet happened due to insecurity and conflict as well as northern Nigeria, south-central Somalia, eastern DR Congo and oPt."

          "Additional considerations",
          "The Committee noted that GPEI Polio Oversight Board (POB) in its recent meeting in mid-October 2024, revised the timeline for the GPEI Strategy 2022 – 2026, up to 2029. The strategy under the revised timeline, aims to stopping WPV1 transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan by end-2025 and certification of WPV1 eradication by end-2027; and stopping cVDPV2 outbreaks globally by end-2026 and certification cVDPV2 elimination by 2029. The bOPV Cessation will be considered after certification of eradication of WPV1 and certification of elimination of cVDPV2 by the Global Certification Commission on Poliomyelitis Eradication.",
          "The Committee expressed concern about the intensifying WPV1 transmission in Afghanistan and Pakistan with significant increase in the number of paralytic cases and geographic spread in 2024. Consequent to persistent WPV1 transmission, the YB3A genetic cluster of WPV1 has split into two, indicating significant number of under-immunized children in both the remaining endemic countries. Continuing WPV1 transmission despite the ongoing campaigns implementation indicates the need for an in-depth programme review and adjustment in current programme strategies. The review should inform the programme planning and implementation in the crucial upcoming low transmission season from December 2024 through May 2025.",
          "The Committee is concerned about the inability to implement house-to-house campaigns and very low engagement of women health workers in Afghanistan, putting infants and young children especially the girls, at high risk of missing polio vaccination. This situation may jeopardize all the gains made in Afghanistan over the last two years, including in the East Region where polio epidemiology has been seemingly improving during the last few months.",
          "The Committee noted the high-level political commitment for polio eradication in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Committee urged that the political commitment must translate into meaningful steps at the operational level to enhance community engagement and implement high-quality vaccination campaigns to stop the current intense WPV1 transmission and avert the risk of national and international spread. Specifically in Afghanistan the Committee recommended resumption of house-to-house campaigns and employment of more female vaccinators to enhance community acceptability.",
          "The Committee noted the ongoing transmission of cVDPV in the African Region; particularly in northern Nigeria, where the transmission has lately intensified. The reports about continued sub-optimal quality vaccination campaigns and lack of community engagement are concerning for the Committee. The Committee noted the recent review and planning exercise of the Nigeria polio programme and urged to immediately put in place the plans to address the challenges in northern Nigeria. Though, the number of cVDPV cases have declined in DR Congo in 2024, the Committee considers that the country is still at high-risk of continuing outbreaks and needs to further boost population immunity through high-quality vaccination efforts. The Committee is encouraged by the improving cVDPV1 situation in the African Region; however, expressed concern about the recent detection of a new cVDPV1 emergence in DR Congo, indicating some population pockets with low immunity.",
          "The Committee expressed concern about the inability to implement immunization response in the northern Yemen, with continued reporting of cases. The Committee is also concerned about the surveillance related challenges in northern Yemen. The committee is encouraged by the coordinated immunization response in Gaza and appreciated the efforts of all stakeholders towards implementing the response.",
          "The committee noted the detection of cVDPV3 in Guinea and French Guiana after more than two years and urged timely and high-quality surveillance and immunization response to stop these outbreaks.",
          "The committee noted that many of the cVDPV infected countries remain conflict affected, disrupting routine immunization as well as polio vaccination campaigns. The committee also noted that other health emergencies and disease outbreaks (cholera, measles, dengue, malaria, etc.) in several countries are making it very challenging to implement timely and high-quality polio vaccination campaigns. The committee noted that context-specific tailored interventions will be critical to implement high-quality campaigns and ultimately stop the cVDPV outbreaks in the current complex scenario, with varying challenges in different countries and sub-national geographies. Synchronized sub-regional approaches and strong cross-border coordination will also be critical to jointly address the challenges relating to permeable borders and common operational challenges across countries.",
          "The committee noted some good practices in several countries, particularly on cross-border collaboration and surveillance, and on community and professional engagement. The committee encourages the countries to document and share the best practices and suggests that GPEI facilitates that.",
          "The Committee noted the importance of maintaining sensitive surveillance in the polio infected and high-risk countries and that the GPEI should provide all possible support in this regard under the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan. The developed countries should also maintain quality surveillance for polioviruses, considering the ongoing importation risk recently highlighted by cVDPV detection in Spain and French Guiana. High-quality surveillance is fundamental to ensure early detection and timely response to importations and newly emerged outbreaks.",
          "The committee noted that novel OPV2 continues to demonstrate high genetic stability compared to Sabin OPV2. However, the risk of new cVDPV2 emergences will remain in the event of long intervals (> 4 weeks) between outbreak response campaigns and low vaccination quality.",
          "The Committee noted that the amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) through resolution WHA77.17 (2024), were notified to States Parties on 19 September 2024 and that they would come into effect on 19 September 2025 for 192 States Parties.  Regarding any potential effects of these amendments on the Committee, the Secretariat informed that it would be premature to assess any such effects at this time but would brief the Committee ahead of their entry into force in September 2025.",
          "Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPVs, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment, and on 3 December 2024 determined that the poliovirus situation continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective, 3 December 2024."

          "Nearly five years since COVID-19 was first reported, a new global report on infection prevention and control (IPC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) shows there has been slow progress in addressing critical gaps to prevent healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).",
          "A large proportion of HAIs can be prevented with improved IPC practices and basic water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services, which are also a highly cost-effective \"best buy\" to reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in health-care settings. This report, launched at a G7 side-event hosted by Italy, provides a baseline assessment for policymakers, IPC professionals, health care workers and stakeholders to guide action.",
          "The report finds that though 71% of countries now have an active IPC programme, just 6% met all of the WHO IPC minimum requirements in 2023-2024. This is well behind the target of more than 90% by 2030 set in the WHO Global action plan and monitoring framework on IPC. The report also highlights that patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have up to 20 times higher risk of acquiring infections during health-care delivery than in high-income countries (HICs).",
          "“The COVID-19 pandemic, along with outbreaks of Ebola, Marburg and mpox are the most dramatic demonstrations of how pathogens can spread rapidly and be amplified in health care settings. These healthcare-associated infections are a daily threat in every hospital and clinic, not only during epidemics and pandemics,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Every country can and must do more to prevent infections in health facilities, and control them when they strike.”",
          "HAIs prolong hospital stays and result in complications such as sepsis and in some cases disability or death.  Addressing HAIs through improved IPC is also critical to reduce the risk of AMR, as recent estimates indicate that 136 million antibiotic resistant HAIs occur each year.",
          "The report found that health-care facilities face significant financial and resource challenges, including a lack of IPC professionals and budgets, especially in LMICs. Nearly a quarter of countries reported shortages in their supply of personal protective equipment in 2023.",
          "New data from WHO and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that up to 3.5 million patients could die each year from HAIs without urgent action. Improving IPC measures at every level will help to reduce the number of deaths. The modelling estimated that IPC interventions at the point of care in health facilities, coordinated by Ministries of Health or established networks, could avert up to 821 000 deaths per year by 2050. Such an intervention would also yield annual savings in health-care expenditure as high as US$ 112 billion and generate economic gains of up to US$ 124 billion.",
          "“WHO is committed to supporting countries to ensure that by 2030, everyone accessing and providing health care is safe from HAIs,” said Dr Bruce Aylward, WHO Assistant Director-General, Universal Health Coverage, Life Course. “Fulfilling all IPC minimum requirements at the national and healthcare-facility levels should be a priority for all countries, to protect patients and health-care workers, and prevent unnecessary suffering”."

          "The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) is hereby transmitting the report of the second meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) Emergency Committee (Committee) regarding the upsurge of mpox 2024 , held on Friday 22 November 2024, from 12:00 to 17:00 CET.",
          "Notwithstanding some progress towards controlling the spread of mpox resulting from national and international response efforts, the Committee noted the rising number and continuing geographic spread of mpox cases, especially those due to monkeypox virus clade Ib infection; the operational challenges in the field in need of stronger national commitments; as well as the need to mount and sustain a cohesive response across countries and partners. The Committee advised that the event continues to meet the criteria of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and provided its views regarding the proposed temporary recommendations.",
          "The WHO Director-General expresses his most sincere gratitude to the Chair, Members, and Advisors of the Committee. The WHO Director-General concurs with the advice of the Committee that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC for the reasons detailed in the proceedings of the meeting below, and issues revised temporary recommendations in relation to this PHEIC, which are presented at the end of this document.",
          "Proceedings of the meeting",
          "Sixteen (16) Members of, and two Advisors to, the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) Emergency Committee (Committee) were convened by teleconference, via Zoom, on Friday, 22 November 2024, from 12:00 to 17:00 CET. Thirteen (13) of the 16 Committee Members, and one of the two Advisors to the Committee participated in the meeting.",
          "The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) delegated the WHO Deputy Director-General to welcome the Committee Members and Advisors, and invited Government Officials designated to present to the Committee on behalf of the five invited States Parties – Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.",
          "The WHO Deputy Director-General recalled that the determination of the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), on 14 August 2024, was a call for national authorities to invest energetically to prevent and control the transmission of monkeypox virus (MPXV) with particular focus on clade Ib, to reduce the risk of international spread of mpox, and for the international community to act cohesively and intensely with all the tools and resources available for the prevention and control of mpox.",
          "Highlighting the evolution of mpox globally (see details under the heading “Session open to representatives of States Parties invited to present their views), the WHO Deputy Director-General stressed that, since the Committee last met in August 2024, the situation has become more complex and continues to require a coordinated international response, including in all countries and especially in those with limited number of mpox cases before wider spread of disease may occur. He outlined the constructive collaborations and efforts of WHO and numerous partners, including the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), to scale up the response at regional, national and sub-national levels; and the establishment, by WHO and partners, of the Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM) as part of the interim Medical Countermeasures Network endorsed by WHO Member States, to support the equitable allocation and distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. The WHO Deputy Director-General outlined a number of challenges States Parties are facing to interrupt the transmission of mpox, including a number of concurrent health emergencies and competing health priorities, hence requiring political commitment and resources to further scale up targeted and integrated interventions at local levels.",
          "The Representative of the Office of Legal Counsel briefed the Members and Advisors on their roles and responsibilities and identified the mandate of the Committee under the relevant articles of the IHR. The Ethics Officer from the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics provided the Members and Advisors with an overview of the WHO Declaration of Interests process. The Members and Advisors were made aware of their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature that may give rise to a perceived or actual conflict of interest. They were additionally reminded of their duty to maintain the confidentiality of the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee. Each Member and Advisor was surveyed, with no conflicts of interest identified.",
          "The meeting was handed over to the Chair who introduced the objectives of the meeting, which were to provide views to the WHO Director-General on whether the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, and if so, to provide views on the potential proposed temporary recommendations.",
          "Session open to representatives of States Parties invited to present their views",
          "The WHO Secretariat presented an overview of the global epidemiological situation of mpox, all MPXV clades included, highlighting that, since the Committee last met in August 2024, MPXV transmission has been reported in all six WHO Regions. While the WHO African Region represents the largest contributor to the global increase of mpox cases due to clades Ia, Ib and IIa, mpox in the WHO Western Pacific Region has been increasing due to an MPXV clade IIb outbreak among men who have sex with men reported from Australia.",
          "With regards to the spread of MPXV clade Ib in the WHO African Region, since the Committee last met, the WHO Secretariat presented that the foci of transmission are in the DRC, with clade Ib now detected in six provinces, including in the urban area of the capital Kinshasa. MPXV clade Ib has also spread in neighbouring countries, including in Burundi (2,083 mpox cases, growing in the urban areas of Bujumbura and Gitega) and Uganda (582 mpox cases, growing in the capital Kampala) with established sustained community transmission; and Kenya (17 mpox cases) and Rwanda (37 mpox cases) with clusters of mpox cases (data reported as of 19 November 2024).",
          "Additionally, travel-related cases of MPXV clade Ib infection, mostly epidemiologically linked to the above-mentioned countries, have been detected in eight countries in the following WHO Regions – African Region (Zambia and Zimbabwe); Americas Region (United States of America); European Region (Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, transmission within the household of the case occurred); and South-East Asian Region (India and Thailand).",
          "Available data from the sub-national level in the DRC shows that the observed dynamics of transmission of MPXV clade Ib are changing over time and are diverse across affected health zones. Since MPXV clade Ib was first detected in September 2023 in South Kivu province in the health zone of Kamituga, the most affected age group has shifted from adults, where transmission was first observed and appears to have been sustained by contact within commercial sexual networks, to younger age groups, including children, and sustained by household and likely broader community transmission through close physical contact.",
          "The same epidemiological characteristics are being observed in the capital Kinshasa, where the outbreak is largely driven by transmission between adults, but where steadily more children are being reported as a result of close physical contact within households and/or the community. It is worth noting that, regardless of the circulating MPXV clades, adults of 50 years of age or older are less affected, likely due to the immunity conferred by prior vaccination against smallpox.",
          "The WHO Secretariat indicated that information about mortality in confirmed cases of mpox, regardless of the MPXV clade, is limited. In the DRC, based on routine syndromic surveillance data, deaths attributed to mpox are predominant in rural areas known to be endemic for MPXV clade Ia – with variable case fatality rates observed across those areas, but being consistently higher in children under 5 years of age.",
          "Outside the DRC, deaths associated with MPXV clade Ib infection have been reported in Burundi (1), Uganda (2) and Kenya (1).",
          "The WHO Secretariat presented the assessed risk by MPXV clades and further expressed in terms of overall public health risk where any given clade/s is/are circulating, and risk of national and international spread, as: Clade Ib – high public health risk and high risk of national/international spread; Clade Ia – high public health risk and moderate risk of national/international spread; Clade II – moderate public health risk and moderate risk of national/international spread.",
          "The WHO Secretariat subsequently provided an update on actions WHO has taken, with States Parties and partners, following the issuance of the temporary recommendations on 19 August 2024, the extension of the standing recommendations for mpox , and the WHO appeal: mpox public health emergency 2024 , and based on the WHO Mpox global strategic preparedness and response plan, September 2024-February 2025 ; the Africa CDC-WHO Mpox Continental Preparedness and Response Plan for Africa, September 2024-February 2025 ; A coordinated research roadmap – Mpox virus - Immediate research next steps to contribute to control the outbreak (2024) .",
          "In addition to the overview provided by the WHO Deputy Director-General, the WHO Secretariat provided detailed updates on progress and challenges related to the following areas of the response, including: collaborative surveillance, safe and scalable clinical care, community protection, access to countermeasures, including diagnostics and vaccines (over 1.1 million doses of MVA-BN vaccine allocated to date), operations (deployment of human resources, dispatch of personal protective equipment, diagnostic tests, etc. to the field), funding (of the 87.4 million USD needed as per WHO appeal, 40.6 million USD were received or pledged; 3.5 million USD were released from the WHO's Contingency Funds for Emergencies), and coordination with partners.",
          "Representatives of Burundi, the DRC, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda updated the Committee on the mpox epidemiological situation in their countries and their current response efforts, needs and challenges. Mpox vaccine is currently being used in the DRC and Rwanda, and there are plans to use it in Kenya and Uganda, whereas vaccination against mpox is currently not encompassed by the response strategy of Burundi.",
          "Members of, and the Advisor to, the Committee then engaged in questions and answers with the WHO Secretariat and invited Government Officials, on the issues and challenges presented.",
          "The determination that the upsurge of mpox constitutes a PHEIC in August 2024 was regarded by States Parties attending the meeting as having boosted domestic response efforts and the mobilization of international resource to support those efforts.",
          "However, the lack of information at national and local levels, including the suboptimal implementation of response interventions, was regarded as an obstacle to progress in controlling and interrupting MPXV transmission. Examples to that effect related to the proportion of suspected mpox cases tested; the time from diagnosis to subsequent isolation of mpox cases; the trend of mpox test positivity rate; the proportion of contacts that have completed the follow-up period; the proportion of mpox cases with an unknown epidemiological link, and trend thereof; and challenges with mpox vaccination implementation. Challenges with vaccination implementation include: the current vaccination coverage in countries with mpox vaccines, including in targeted at risk groups; the proportion of contacts that have received mpox vaccine; the time elapsed between the last exposure of an unvaccinated contact; and the administration of mpox vaccine.",
          "The observed multifaceted dynamics of the spread of MPXV was discussed at length in terms of (a) the expansion of transmission from within known commercial sexual networks, and subsequently within households, and to the wider community with sustained transmission; (b) opportunities to refine the risk assessment approach, considering lower geographical levels and vulnerable subsets of population; and (c) the potential for predictive mathematical modeling approaches to anticipate MPXV spread both within countries and internationally.",
          "Aspects related to the use of mpox vaccines as part of the response were discussed, including, but not limited to, (a) progress with global and domestic regulatory issues; (b) challenges for use of mpox vaccines in infants, children, adolescents, and immunocompromised persons (as per WHO vaccine position paper , August 2024); (c) need to implement vaccination as part of an integrated targeted response to interrupt MPXV transmission in hotspots at the local level, as opposed to a broader geographical use of the vaccine; (d) uncertainties related to the effectiveness of post-exposure use of the vaccine; (e) possible inclusion of studies to assess vaccine effectiveness in vaccine deployment plans; and (f) approaches to overcome vaccine hesitancy.",
          "The coordination between Africa CDC and WHO in supporting States Parties’ response efforts in implementing the Africa CDC-WHO Mpox Continental Preparedness and Response Plan for Africa, September 2024-February 2025 was reported as collaborative, constructive and progressive. WHO and Africa CDC have a joint continental incident management team based in Kinshasa, DRC. A significant achievement of this coordination is the alignment of the vaccine allocation process and the AAM with the Technical Review Committee and the vaccination group within the Continental IMST.",
          "Deliberative session",
          "Following the session open to invited States Parties, the Committee reconvened in a closed session to examine the questions in relation to whether the event constitutes a PHEIC or not, and if so, to consider the temporary recommendations drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.",
          "The Chair reminded the Committee Members of their mandate and recalled that a PHEIC is defined in the IHR as an “extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated international response” .",
          "The Committee was unanimous in expressing the views that the ongoing upsurge of mpox still meets the criteria of a PHEIC and that the Director-General be advised accordingly.",
          "The overarching consideration underpinning the advice of the Committee is the limited effectiveness and efficiency of the response implemented at local level, particularly in Burundi and the DRC, to interrupt MPXV transmission – specifically in terms of surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, contact tracing, and community education and engagement. If duly and systematically implemented early on, such interventions could substantially contribute to the interruption of transmission both locally and globally, especially considering that access to mpox vaccine is often challenging, and the strategic use of vaccine has yet to be fully implemented.",
          "On that basis, and further elaborating upon issues addressed during the question and answers session, the Committee considered that:",
          "The event is “ extraordinary ” because of (a) the increased number of mpox cases and geographical expansion of foci of MPXV clade Ib transmission within States Parties; (b) the evolving dynamics of MPXV clade Ib transmission – from within known commercial sexual networks, to within households, to the wider community – resulting in the infection of broader age-groups, and/or vulnerable population groups, and/or co-infection and co-circulation with other MPXV clades and/or pathogens, and, hence, generating uncertainties and unknowns in terms of morbidity and mortality, and, consequently, leading to new response challenges, including regarding clinical care; (c) the risk of MPVX clade Ib mutations in the context of sustained community transmission, resulting in new dynamics of transmission and/or associated with new morbidity and mortality patterns (e.g. changes of transmissibility and/or virulence); (d) the ongoing prevalence of MPXV clade Ia infections in DRC with new foci of sexual network disease transmission in the capital Kinshasa.",
          "The event “ constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease ” because of (a) the documented recent exportation of MPVX clade Ib cases from States Parties where that clade is circulating to others within the WHO African Region and at least three additional WHO Regions; (b) the epidemiological link of exported MPVX clade Ib cases in the areas where exposure occurred is not known; (c) the risk that MPXV, and clade Ib in particular, is introduced in States Parties that may not comply with reporting requirement to WHO under IHR provisions, and/or may not have the capacities to implement response interventions.",
          "The event “requires a coordinated international response” through (a) intensified engagement of international partners with national authorities to (i) raise the profile of mpox as public health priority, and (ii) strengthen prevention and response operations at the local level through the deployment of dedicated human resources and supplies; (b) mobilization of financial resources and their effective and efficient use; (c) the facilitation of equitable access to mpox including vaccines and diagnostics, including with the view to build capacity for the local and/or regional production of vaccine in the mid- to longer term.",
          "The Committee indicated the need to start elaborating on the considerations that would inform their future advice to terminate the PHEIC while assessing the three criteria defining a PHEIC.",

          "Notwithstanding that temporary recommendations constitute non-binding advice to States Parties, and noting that it was the first time that a set of temporary recommendations included one related to reporting on the implementation thereof, the WHO Secretariat presented the structure and outcome of the survey to that effect administered to, and completed online by the five States Parties to which the temporary recommendations issued on 19 August 2024 were directed to (Burundi, the DRC, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda). Provided that the Director-General would determine that the event still constitutes a PHEIC, and issue temporary recommendations accordingly, the Committee formulated suggestions to the WHO Secretariat to improve the survey by encompassing the local dimension of the response, and to use the outcome of the survey for shaping the proposed temporary recommendations.",
          "The Committee then considered the revised set of temporary recommendations proposed by the WHO Secretariat, should the Director-Generals determine that the event still constitutes a PHEIC. The Committee had received the proposed set ahead of the meeting and, noting the proposal to extend most of the temporary recommendations issued on 19 August 2024, the Committee formulated suggestions regarding the definition of “hotspot”, referred to in some of the recommendations.",

          "Conclusion",
          "The Committee reiterated its concern regarding the continuing spread of MPXV and uncertainties ensuing, and the effectiveness and efficiency of the response at the local level. The Committee underscored the need for the sustained commitment by national authorities in focusing efforts and resources at the local level to interrupt MPXV transmission, as well as the role of coordinated international cooperation in supporting and complementing such efforts in a synergistic manner. Therefore, the Committee considers that the determination by the WHO Director-General that the upsurge of mpox still constitutes a PHEIC would be warranted.",

          "The catalytic grant fund was established by the International Pathogen Surveillance Network (IPSN) to support partners from low- and middle-income countries to build their capacities in pathogen genomic analysis. This technology analyses the genetic code of viruses, bacteria and other disease-causing organisms to understand, in conjunction with other data, how easily they spread, and how sick they can make people. This data allows scientists and public health teams to track and respond to infectious disease threats, supports the development of vaccines and treatments and empowers countries to take faster decisions.",
          "The fund is hosted by the United Nations Foundation and supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation and Wellcome.",
          "“The IPSN catalytic grant fund has incredible potential to expand pathogen genomic surveillance for all, which we are already seeing through the first round of grantmaking,” said Sara Hersey, Director of Collaborative Intelligence at the WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence. “We are eager to support this work, which plays a key role in pandemic and epidemic prevention worldwide.”",
          "“The IPSN catalytic grant fund recipients will accelerate the benefits of pathogen genomic surveillance in low- and middle-income settings, as well as explore new applications for genomic surveillance, such as wastewater surveillance,” said Manisha Bhinge, Vice President of the Health Initiative at The Rockefeller Foundation. “Pandemics and epidemics continue to be a global threat, further amplified by climate change. There is urgent need for equitable access to these tools and capabilities to protect lives in vulnerable communities.”",
          "One of the recipients, the American University of Beirut, will use wastewater surveillance to study how diseases spread in refugee populations, helping to ensure that people can quickly receive the care and support they need in migration settings. Another grantee, the Pasteur Institute of Laos, will use the funding to develop new methods to track avian flu in live-bird markets, a setting that is often overlooked but vital to millions of people worldwide.",
          "“If we are to protect vulnerable populations from the devastating impacts of disease, we first need to better understand how these pathogens spread, evolve and cause illness. These projects, developed in-country and tailored to local priorities, will generate new insights, knowledge and evidence that will help track global pathogen trends and inform evidence-based decisions to implement effective interventions” said Titus Divala, Interim Head of Epidemics and Epidemiology at Wellcome.",
          "The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil will use the funding to develop an open-source bioinformatics tool that can be used to conduct offline analyses. The tool will be piloted in Latin America with potential for global use, especially in low-resource settings.",
          "\"SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent regional disease outbreaks have underscored the importance of access to genomic surveillance tools in all countries. The IPSN's catalytic investments will generate data and innovative methods to support the much-needed scale-up in LMICs,\" said Simon Harris of the Gates Foundation.",
          "The grantees were announced at the IPSN Global Partners Forum held in Bangkok, Thailand, from 21–22 November. The event was co-hosted by the WHO Regional Offices for South-East Asia and the Western Pacific and the Centre for Pathogen Genomics at the Doherty Institute in Australia. A second round of catalytic grant funds will be made available to IPSN members in 2025.",

          "Delegations from over 110 countries are coming together to produce national roadmaps and negotiate a joint declaration on oral health at the first-ever global oral health meeting organized by the World Health Organization (WHO). The declaration is expected to outline collective commitments from Member States to accelerate the implementation of the Global strategy and action plan on oral health 2023–2030 .",
          "Oral diseases are the most common noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide, affecting an estimated 3.5 billion people. Oral health is often misunderstood as just dental health, overlooking its broader importance. Oral diseases include dental caries or cavities, gum disease, tooth loss, oral cancer, noma and birth defects, affecting the mouth, teeth and facial structures that are essential for eating, breathing and speaking.",
          "\"Oral health is an important part of well-being, yet millions of people lack access to the services they need to protect and promote their oral health,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “WHO calls on all countries to prioritize prevention and expand access to affordable oral health services as part of their journey towards universal health coverage.”",
          "This groundbreaking event, hosted by the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, is part of the preparatory process for the fourth UN High-Level Meeting on NCDs (4 th UN HLM on NCDs) in 2025. It aims to accelerate progress towards UHC, reaffirm political commitments made by Member States, and promote the implementation of the Global strategy and action plan on oral health 2023–2030 .",
          "“Oral health is a crucial aspect of overall health, and Thailand is proud to host this landmark global meeting,” said H.E. Mr Somsak Thepsutin, Minister of Public Health in Thailand. “Our commitment to universal health coverage includes ensuring that all citizens have access to quality oral health services and promoting prevention through our communities, reinforcing our dedication to improving health outcomes for everyone.\"",
          "Key outcomes of the meeting – the Bangkok declaration on oral health – will inform the WHO Director-General’s report for the 4 th UN HLM on NCDs in 2025, ensuring better recognition and integration of oral diseases in the future global NCD agenda.",
          "The Declaration seeks to guarantee oral health as a fundamental human right. It recognizes that improving access to affordable oral health care cannot be achieved without integrating it into primary health care and UHC packages.",
          "During the meeting, it is expected a new global coalition on oral health will be announced, aiming to foster partnerships to enhance the reach and effectiveness of oral health initiatives worldwide.",
          "The WHO first global oral health meeting is being attended by delegations from Member States, UN agencies, international organizations, philanthropic foundations, civil society organizations and other stakeholders dedicated to advancing oral health, NCDs and UHC programmes.",
          "Note to editors:",
          "The Global strategy and action plan on oral health 2023–2030 provides a framework to address challenges in preventing and controlling oral diseases, promoting oral health within the NCD agenda and ensuring that essential services are accessible without financial strain as part of UHC initiative. It outlines six strategic objectives, 100 actions and 11 global targets aimed at reducing the burden of oral diseases, which contribute significantly to the global NCD crisis.",

          "Since 7 October 2023, 47% of attacks on health care – 65 out of 137 – have proven fatal to at least one health worker or patient in Lebanon, as of 21 November 2024.",
          "This is a higher percentage than in any active conflict today across the globe – with nearly half of all attacks on health causing the death of a health worker.",
          "In comparison, the global average is 13.3%, based on the SSA’s figures from 13 countries or territories that reported attacks in the same period, 7 October 2023–18 November 2024 – among them Ukraine, Sudan and the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). In the case of oPt, 9.6% of the total number of incidents has resulted in the death of at least one medical professional or patient.",
          "According to the SSA, 226 health workers and patients were killed in Lebanon and 199 injured between 7 October 2023 and 18 November 2024.",
          "In the same period, the SSA registered a combined total of 1401 attacks on health in oPt, Lebanon and Israel – 1196 in oPt, 137 in Lebanon and 68 in Israel.",
          "Civilian health care has special protection",
          "“These figures reveal yet again an extremely worrying pattern. It’s unequivocal – depriving civilians of access to lifesaving care and targeting health providers is a breach of international humanitarian law. The law prohibits the use of health facilities for military purposes – and even if that is the case, stringent conditions to taking action against them apply, including a duty to warn and to wait after warning,” said WHO Representative in Lebanon Dr Abdinasir Abubakar.",
          "International humanitarian law states that health workers and facilities should always be protected in armed conflicts and never attacked. Health facilities must not be used for military purposes, and there should be accountability for the misuse of health facilities.",
          "“There need to be consequences for not abiding by international law, and the principles of precaution, distinction and proportionality should always be adhered to. It’s been said before, indiscriminate attacks on health care are a violation of human rights and international law that cannot become the new normal, not in Gaza, not in Lebanon, nowhere,” said WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Dr Hanan Balkhy.",
          "The majority of incidents in Lebanon impact health workers",
          "The majority (68%) of incidents in Lebanon registered by the SSA impacted health personnel, a pattern seen repeatedly in the last few years, including in Gaza in the past year. In Lebanon, roughly 63% affected health transport and 26% affected health facilities.",
          "Attacks on health care hit twice. First, when health workers lose their lives or when a health centre is obliterated, and again in the following weeks and months when the injured can’t be treated, those who are dependent on regular care don’t receive it and when children can’t be immunized.",
          "“Casualty numbers among health workers of this scope would debilitate any country, not just Lebanon. But what the numbers alone cannot convey is the long-term impact, the treatments for health conditions missed, women and girls prevented from accessing maternal, sexual and reproductive health services, undiagnosed treatable diseases and, ultimately, the lives lost because of the absence of health care. That is the impact that’s hard to quantify,” said Dr Abubakar.",
          "1 in 10 hospitals in Lebanon directly impacted",
          "The greater the blow to the health workforce, the weaker the longer-term ability of a country to recover from a crisis and deliver health care in a post-conflict setting",
          "Lebanon is a lower middle-income country with a fairly advanced health system that’s been hit hard by multiple crises in recent years. After hostilities in Lebanon escalated in September 2024, the growing number of attacks on health have caused further strain on an already over-burdened system.",
          "Today, the country’s health system is under extreme duress, with 15 out of 153 hospitals having ceased to operate, or only partially functioning. Nabatieh, as an example, one of Lebanon’s 8 governorates, has lost 40% of its hospital bed capacity.",
          "“Attacks on health care of this scale cripple a health system when those whose lives depend on it need it the most. Beyond the loss of life, the death of health workers is a loss of years of investment and a crucial resource to a fragile country going forward,” Dr Balkhy concluded.",
          "So far this year, between 1 January 2024 and 18 November 2024, a total of 1246 attacks on health care were registered globally, in 13 countries or territories, killing 730 health workers and patients and injuring 1255.",
          "Note to editors",
          "The Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care ( SSA ), established in 2017 by the World Health Organization, is an independent global monitoring mechanism whose goal is to collect reliable data on attacks on health care and to then identify patterns of violence that inform risk reduction and resilience measures so that health care is protected. The SSA also provides an evidence base for advocacy against attacks on health care."

          "The first-ever Investment Round of the World Health Organization (WHO) reached a culminating moment during the G20 Leaders' Summit today in Rio de Janeiro, chaired by the President of Brazil, H.E. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Heads of state and government at the G20 voiced strong support for a sustainably funded WHO, additional financial pledges were announced, and incoming G20 Chair South Africa pledged to maintain a focus in 2025 on sustainably financing the Organization.",
          "The support was reflected in the G20 Rio de Janeiro Leaders’ Declaration which said: “We reiterate the central coordinating role of the World Health Organization (WHO) in the global health architecture, supported by adequate, predictable, transparent, flexible and sustainable financing. We support the conducting of the WHO Investment Round as an additional measure for financing the WHO activities.”",
          "The Investment Round is raising funds for WHO’s strategy for global health, the Fourteenth General Programme of Work , which can save an additional 40 million lives over the next four years. The Investment Round has succeeded in shifting WHO’s funding model so that it is more predictable, flexible and resilient.",
          "With the pledges received from Australia, Indonesia and Spain at the Leaders’ Summit, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland shortly afterwards, WHO has now received pledges of US$ 1.7 billion. Including other signed funding agreements and expected funding from partnerships, WHO has funding of US$ 3.8 billion for the next four years. This means that WHO has raised 53% of the US$ 7.1 billion funding needed, successfully increasing predictability as compared to previous periods. WHO, Member States and partners will continue efforts to cover the remaining gap so the Organization can deliver on the strategy for 2025–2028.",
          "The Investment Round has also successfully broadened WHO’s donor base, improving its funding resilience. Since its launch in May, there have been 70 new pledges from Member States, and philanthropic and private sector donors, 39 of which are contributing voluntary funds for the first time. This is making WHO’s funding more diversified and thus marks a milestone in the Organization’s evolution.",
          "Seven of these new donors are low-income countries and 21 are middle-income countries, representing a shift in WHO’s funding base. This shift also demonstrates broad-based recognition of the need to invest in health and in WHO.",
          "Forty-six donors have so far pledged more flexible funding, compared to 35 in the last four years, increasing the ability of WHO to use the funds where they are most needed.",
          "Overall, the Investment Round means that WHO can work more efficiently, better plan the implementation of its Strategy and respond even better to crises.",
          "It is expected that a number of other governments and donors will pledge to the Investment Round in the coming months.",
          "Quotes:",
          "President of Brazil, H.E. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said: “The World Health Organization represents humanity’s greatest ideals. Investment over the next four years will be repaid many times over in well-being gained. It will set the foundation for future generations.”",
          "The Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Olaf Scholz, said: “The work of the WHO benefits all of us. It needs reliable financing from a broad base. Every contribution counts.\"",
          "President of France, Emmanuel Macron, said: “The World Health Organization deserves our support, as our unique common, universal, compass to global health. It is the only organization technically and politically able to coordinate our global action, and edict universal norms and advice in the field of health. As part of this Investment Round, WHO is bringing to life a new Academy, open to all health practitioners around the world, to tackle one of the key investment priorities identified during the COVID crisis, which is human capacity in the health sector. In a nutshell, investing in WHO is investing in the strengthening of our response capacity to health crises and in particular to pandemics.”",
          "President of South Africa H.E. Cyril Ramaphosa, who will Chair the G20 Presidency in 2025, said: “We are proud to carry the baton on from Brazil and continue to spotlight the importance of WHO and the need for sustainable financing towards the goal of health for all.”",
          "President of Indonesia, H.E Mr Prabowo Subianto, said: “I would like to announce that Indonesia is pleased to support international efforts. In this case, we are willing to commit US$ 30 million to bridge the funding gap on WHO activities.”",
          "“The WHO Investment Round is about mobilizing the predictable, flexible funding WHO needs to save lives, prevent disease and make the world a healthier and safer place,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “I thank President Lula for his strong support for WHO and for hosting the culmination of the Investment Round during the G20 Leaders’ Summit, and I thank all donors for their contributions. I am grateful to President Ramaphosa for carrying the baton for sustainable financing for WHO into South Africa’s G20 Presidency next year.”",

          "This decision is expected to facilitate increased and timely access to vaccines in communities where mpox outbreaks are surging. In 2024, cases have been reported across 80 countries, including 19 countries in Africa, based on data as of 31 October 2024 . The Democratic Republic of the Congo, the hardest-hit country, recorded a large majority of suspected cases – over 39 000 – as well as more than 1000 deaths.",
          "Today’s move is particularly relevant as the Government of Japan has announced that it will donate 3.05 million doses of the LC16m8 vaccine, along with specialized inoculation needles, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This is the largest donation package announced to date in response to the current mpox emergency.",
          "LC16m8 is a vaccine developed and manufactured by KM Biologics in Japan. The Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for EUL of vaccines convened to discuss the outcome of the LC16m8 vaccine review, including the product and programmatic suitability assessments. The TAG recommended the vaccine for use in individuals over one year of age as a single dose vaccine, via a multiple puncture technique using a bifurcated needle.",
          "“WHO emergency use listing of the LC16m8 vaccine against mpox marks a significant step in our response to the current emergency, providing a new option to protect all populations, including children,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. “Vaccines are one of the important tools to help contain the outbreak as part of a comprehensive response strategy that also includes improved testing and diagnosis, treatment and care, infection prevention control, and engagement and education within affected communities.”",
          "WHO’s assessment for EUL is based on information submitted by the manufacturer and review by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), the Japanese regulatory agency of record for this vaccine. The LC16m8 vaccine has been used in Japan during previous mpox outbreaks and was shown to be safe and effective, including in people with well-controlled HIV.",
          "The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization reviewed available evidence and recommended the use of LC16m8 vaccine in outbreak settings in children and others with a documented high-risk of exposure to mpox.",
          "However, minimally replicating vaccines, such as LC16m8, should not be used during pregnancy and in people who are immunocompromised. Immunocompromised persons include those with active cancer, transplant recipients, immunodeficiency, and active treatment with immunosuppressive agents. They also include people living with HIV with a current CD4 cell count of <200 cells µl.",
          "The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety reviewed the updated safety data on LC16m8 on 20 September 2024 and recommended that healthcare workers are provided with training on the use of bifurcated needles to prevent injuries and adverse effects. In light of the changing epidemiology and emergence of new virus strains, it remains important to collect as much data as possible on vaccine safety and effectiveness in different contexts.",
          "WHO continues to work closely with manufacturers, global partners and countries to ensure the availability and administration of safe and effective life-saving products.",
          "On 13 September 2024, WHO prequalified the Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) vaccine and expanded its indication to include use in individuals aged 12 years and older on 8 October 2024.",

Products receiving PQ or EUL support decision-making for international, regional and country procurement by UN and partner procurement agencies and Member States. PQ is based on the review of full set of quality, safety and efficacy data on medical products, including risk management plan and programmatic suitability. EUL is a risk benefit assessment to address urgent demands during public health emergencies based on available limited data where the benefits outweigh the risks."

          "The number of adults living with diabetes worldwide has surpassed 800 million, more than quadrupling since 1990, according to new data released in The Lancet on World Diabetes Day. The analysis, conducted by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), highlights the scale of the diabetes epidemic and an urgent need for stronger global action to address both rising disease rates and widening treatment gaps, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).",
          "“We have seen an alarming rise in diabetes over the past three decades, which reflects the increase in obesity, compounded by the impacts of the marketing of unhealthy food, a lack of physical activity and economic hardship,\" said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “To bring the global diabetes epidemic under control, countries must urgently take action. This starts with enacting policies that support healthy diets and physical activity, and, most importantly, health systems that provide prevention, early detection and treatment.”",
          "The study reports that global diabetes prevalence in adults rose from 7% to 14% between 1990 and 2022. LMICs experienced the largest increases, where diabetes rates have soared while treatment access remains persistently low. This trend has led to stark global inequalities: in 2022, almost 450 million adults aged 30 and older – about 59% of all adults with diabetes – remained untreated, marking a 3.5-fold increase in untreated people since 1990. Ninety per cent of these untreated adults are living in LMICs.",
          "The study further reveals substantial global differences in diabetes rates, with the prevalence of diabetes among adults aged 18 and older around 20% in the WHO South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean Regions. These two regions, together with the African Region, have the lowest rates of diabetes treatment coverage, with fewer than 4 in 10 adults with diabetes taking glucose-lowering medication for their diabetes."

By tracking key indicators such as glycaemic control, hypertension and access to essential medicines, countries can improve targeted interventions and policy initiatives. This standardized approach empowers countries to prioritize resources effectively, driving significant improvements in diabetes prevention and care.",
          "WHO’s Global Diabetes Compact , launched in 2021, includes the vision of reducing the risk of diabetes, and ensuring that all people who are diagnosed with diabetes have access to equitable, comprehensive, affordable and quality treatment and care. The work undertaken as part of the Compact will also support the prevention of type 2 diabetes from obesity, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. In addition, the same year, a diabetes resolution was endorsed at the World Health Assembly urging Member States to raise the priority given to the prevention, diagnosis and control of diabetes as well as prevention and management of risk factors such as obesity.",
          "In 2022, WHO established five global diabetes coverage targets to be achieved by 2030. One of these targets is to ensure that 80% of people with diagnosed diabetes achieve good glycemic control. Today’s release underlines the scale and urgency of action needed to advance efforts to close the gap.",
          "The upcoming year 2025 presents a significant opportunity to catalyse action against the alarming rise in diabetes worldwide with the Fourth High-level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) to take place in September. This meeting brings heads of states and governments together to set a powerful vision for preventing and controlling NCDs, including diabetes, through a collective commitment to address root causes and improve access to detection and treatment. By aligning efforts towards the 2030 and 2050 goals, this high-level meeting is a pivotal moment for strengthening global health systems, including primary health care and halting the rise in the diabetes epidemic."

At COP29, countries must grasp the opportunity to commit to ambitious cross-government climate actions that both protect the planet and improves health for all. By working together, we can still change our current course and save lives.”",
          "Dr Micaela Serafini, President, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Switzerland:",
          "“Today, we are in an unacceptable situation where the world’s most vulnerable people are paying the highest price for a problem they did not cause. Solutions to safeguard their health must be prioritized, with the well-being of people placed at the heart of climate action. Failing to do so will take a toll on the very vitals of humanity.”",
          "Jagan Chapagain, Secretary General, The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC):",
          "“From the impacts of extreme heat to the spread of illnesses through floodwaters, from malnutrition as crops fail to mosquito-borne diseases where they haven’t been seen before, the climate crisis is the ultimate health crisis. This report is vital – highlighting how climate change makes us sick and what we need to do about it.”",
          "Jeni Miller, PhD, Executive Director, Global Climate and Health Alliance",
          "“Health workers are seeing the impacts of climate change firsthand, in the suffering of patients and communities they serve. During COP29, it is time for all governments to demonstrate readiness to protect people’s lives by getting serious about bold climate action. Wealthy governments must deliver the funding needed to help the most impacted countries to build their resilience and response to climate shocks. And together, governments must spell out how and when they will achieve the fossil fuel phase out promised at COP28, to deliver a full, healthy, and just clean energy transition.”",
          "Jaber Oufkir, Liaison Officer for Public Health Issues, The International Federation of Medical Students’ Association (IFMSA):",
          "The IFMSA envisions a world where climate change is fundamentally recognized as a health-care emergency. We foresee a future where the health sector leads the charge toward a net-zero economy, prioritizing sustainable practices and advocating for systemic changes. The climate crisis is not just an environmental issue; it’s a health crisis that impacts young people profoundly. Yet, youth voices are often absent from the conversations that could make a real difference. We strongly believe that young perspectives must be front and centre in the fight against climate change and highlight the importance of transparent intergenerational collaboration, creating a space where climate, health, and youth empowerment intersect for change. Our vision calls for actionable commitments from decision-makers to integrate health into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), prioritize health equity, and integrate climate adaptation strategies into public health frameworks. We ultimately envision diligent efforts towards phasing out fossil fuels and taking necessary steps to ensure a sustainable future for all."

          "More than 100 governments today made historic commitments to end childhood violence, including nine pledging to ban corporal punishment – an issue that affects 3 out of every 5 children regularly in their homes. These commitments were made at a landmark event in Bogotá, Colombia, where government delegations are set to agree on a new global declaration aimed at protecting children from all kinds of violence, exploitation and abuse.",
          "Also at the event, which is hosted by the Governments of Colombia and Sweden together with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, several countries committed to improve services for childhood violence survivors or tackle bullying, while others said they would invest in critical parenting support – one of the most effective interventions for reducing violence risks in the home.",
          "“Despite being highly preventable, violence remains a horrific day to day reality for millions of children around the world – leaving scars that span generations,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.  “Today countries made critical pledges that, once enacted, could finally turn the tide on childhood violence. From establishing lifechanging support for families to making schools safer places or tackling online abuse, these actions will be fundamental to protecting children from lasting harm and ill health.”",
          "Over half of all children globally – some 1 billion – are estimated to suffer some form of violence, such as child maltreatment (including corporal punishment, the most prevalent form of childhood violence), bullying, physical or emotional abuse, as well as sexual violence.  Violence against children is often hidden, mostly occurs behind closed doors, and is vastly underreported. WHO estimates that fewer than half of affected children tell anyone they experienced violence and under 10% receive any help.",
          "Such violence not only constitutes a grave violation of children’s rights but also increases the risk of immediate and long-term health issues. For some children, violence results in death or serious injury. Every 13 minutes, a child or adolescent dies as a result of homicide – equating to around 40 000 preventable deaths each year. For others, experiencing violence has devastating and life-long consequences. These include anxiety and depression, risky behaviours like unsafe sex, smoking and substance abuse, and reduced academic achievement.",
          "Evidence shows that violence against children is preventable, with the health sector having a critical role to play. Proven solutions include parenting support to help caregivers avoid violent discipline and build positive relationships with their children; school-based interventions to strengthen life and social skills for children and adolescents, and prevent bullying; child-friendly social and health services for children that experience violence; laws that prohibit violence against children and reduce underlying risk factors such as access to alcohol and guns, and efforts to ensure safer internet use for children. Research has shown that when countries effectively implement such strategies, they can reduce violence against children by as much as 20-50%.",
          "In line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the first global targets for ending violence against children were established in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Progress in reducing overall prevalence of childhood violence has however been slow, despite gains in some individual countries. Around 9 in 10 children still live in countries where prevalent forms of childhood violence such as corporal punishment, or even sexual abuse and exploitation, are not yet prohibited by law.",
          "Over 1000 people are attending this first-ever Ministerial Conference on Violence against Children, including high-level government delegations, children, young people, survivor and civil society allies.",
          "Specific pledges at the event include among others, commitments to end physical punishment, to introduce new digital safety initiatives, increase the legally permitted age of marriage and to invest in parenting education and child protection. WHO provides significant support for efforts to end childhood violence, through technical guidance, guiding effective strategies for prevention and response, and conducting new research and data, including its global status reports."

          "A new World Health Organization (WHO) study published today in eBioMedicine names 17 pathogens that regularly cause diseases in communities as top priorities for new vaccine development. The WHO study is the first global effort to systematically prioritize endemic pathogens based on criteria that included regional disease burden, antimicrobial resistance risk and socioeconomic impact.",
          "The study reconfirms longstanding priorities for vaccine research and development (R&D), including for HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis – three diseases that collectively take nearly 2.5 million lives each year.",
          "The study also identifies pathogens such as Group A streptococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae as top disease control priorities in all regions, highlighting the urgency to develop new vaccines for pathogens increasingly resistant to antimicrobials.",
          "“Too often global decisions on new vaccines have been solely driven by return on investment, rather than by the number of lives that could be saved in the most vulnerable communities,” said Dr Kate O’Brien, Director of the Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals Department at WHO. “This study uses broad regional expertise and data to assess vaccines that would not only significantly reduce diseases that greatly impact communities today but also reduce the medical costs that families and health systems face.”",
          "WHO asked international and regional experts to identify factors that are most important to them when deciding which vaccines to introduce and use. The analysis of those preferences, combined with regional data for each pathogen, resulted in top 10 priority pathogens for each WHO region. The regional lists where then consolidated to form the global list, resulting in 17 priority endemic pathogens for which new vaccines need to be researched, developed and used.",
          "This new WHO global priority list of endemic pathogens for vaccine R&D supports the Immunization Agenda 2030’s goal of ensuring that everyone, in all regions, can benefit from vaccines that protect them from serious diseases. The list provides an equitable and transparent evidence base to set regional and global agendas for new vaccine R&D and manufacturing, and is intended to give academics, funders, manufacturers and countries a clear direction for where vaccine R&D could have the most impact.",
          "This global prioritization exercise for endemic pathogens, complements the WHO R&D blueprint for epidemics , which identified priority pathogens that could cause future epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",
          "The findings of this new report on endemic pathogens are part of WHO’s work to identify and support the research priorities and needs of immunization programmes in low- and middle-income countries, to inform the global vaccine R&D agenda, and to strategically advance development and uptake of priority vaccines, particularly against pathogens that cause the largest public health burden and greatest socioeconomic impact."

The area has been under siege for almost a month, denied basic aid and life-saving supplies while bombardment and other attacks continue. Just in the past few days, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children, and thousands have once again been forcibly displaced.",
          "Hospitals have been almost entirely cut off from supplies and have come under attack, killing patients, destroying vital equipment, and disrupting life-saving services. Health workers and patients have been taken into custody. Fighting has also reportedly taken place inside hospitals.",
          "Dozens of schools serving as shelters have been bombed or forcibly evacuated. Tents sheltering displaced families have been shelled, and people have been burned alive.",

          "Livestock are also dying, crop lands have been destroyed, trees burned to the ground, and agrifood systems infrastructure has been decimated.",
          "The entire Palestinian population in North Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence.",
          "Humanitarian aid cannot keep up with the scale of the needs due to the access constraints. Basic, life-saving goods are not available. Humanitarians are not safe to do their work and are blocked by Israeli forces and by insecurity from reaching people in need.",
          "In a further blow to the humanitarian response, the polio vaccination campaign has been delayed due to the fighting, putting the lives of children in the region at risk.",
          "And this week, the Israeli Parliament adopted legislation that would ban UNRWA and revoke its privileges and immunities. If implemented, such measures would be a catastrophe for the humanitarian response in Gaza, diametrically opposed to the United Nations Charter, with potential dire impacts on the human rights of the millions of Palestinians depending on UNRWA’s assistance, and in violation of Israel’s obligations under international law.",

          "During the event, youth delegates worked collaboratively to draft resolutions addressing topics including climate change, pollution and health, mental health, antimicrobial resistance, the Global Health and Peace Initiative, tuberculosis control, and polio eradication.",
          "In a highlight of the week, delegates adopted a declaration emphasizing the urgent need for a global Pandemic Agreement to protect the world from future pandemics.",
          "The declaration calls upon all WHO Member States to finalize and implement this agreement this year, emphasizing that “only through coordinated action we can protect the lives, well-being, and futures of our generation.”",
          "The statement, reflecting the commitment of the youth delegates, underscores a united call for an equitable, resilient world that leaves no one behind.",
          "Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, welcomed the Global Model WHO delegates, commending their dedication to global health and their commitment to advocacy.",
          "“This generation is instrumental in shaping a safer, fairer, and healthier world, and the voices of today’s youth are essential in driving effective solutions for global health crises,” Dr Tedros said.",
          "The GMWHO not only honed participants’ negotiation skills and deepened their understanding of health governance but also solidified their role as advocates for a more prepared and inclusive global health landscape.",
          "Savannah Jamora, an Australian hospital adminstrator and post graduate law student, held the role of the Global Model WHO conference’s Director-General. She said the conference was an exciting opportunity to introduce young people to the world of global health policy and diplomacy. At the same time, it provided an effective platform for young people to share their expertise, ideas and energy for making a healthier and safer world.",
          "“Young people are more than just the future of global health; they are essential partners in shaping its present,” Savannah said. “By involving youth in health policy, we can tap into their lived experiences, unique perspectives, and innovative ideas, ensuring policies are relevant, effective, and responsive to the needs of future generations.”",
          "She added: “Through the Global Model WHO, young people are given the tools and platform by which they can meaningfully work towards creating a healthier, more equitable world for all.”",
          "The holding of the GMWHO is in line with WHO’s commitment to engage and partner with young people everywhere and find the best ways to empower them, support their action, promote partnerships and ensure their recognition and visibility.",
          "The World Federation of United Nations Associations is a global nonprofit organization representing and coordinating a membership of over 100 national United Nations Associations (UNAs) and their thousands of constituents."

          "Director-General of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “I have asked every Member State and partner to participate in the Investment Round, according to its means. So far, we have 63 pledges, worth more than one billion US dollars. Of these pledges, more than half are from first-time voluntary contributors, including many from the African, Western Pacific and South-East Asian regions. Every contribution counts. Some of the world’s poorest countries have pledged, because they see first-hand the difference that WHO makes.” The Director-General went on to thank the Member States and partners attending the meeting which had already pledged: Germany, Norway, Singapore, South Africa, Türkiye, the European Union, and the Wellcome Trust.",
          "The G20 Leaders’ Summit, scheduled on18-19 November 2024 and to be chaired by the President of Brazil, H.E. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, will be a key moment during which additional G20 countries and other attendees are expected to pledge predictable and flexible funding to WHO.",

          "A third phase of the polio vaccination campaign is set to begin tomorrow in part of the northern Gaza Strip after being postponed from 23 October 2024 due to lack of access and assured, comprehensive humanitarian pauses, intense bombardment, and mass evacuation orders. These conditions made it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination and to organize campaign activities.",
          "The humanitarian pause necessary to conduct the campaign has been assured; however, the area of the pause has been substantially reduced compared to the first round of vaccination in northern Gaza, conducted in September 2024. It is now limited to just Gaza City. Though in the past few weeks, at least 100 000 people have been forced to evacuate from North Gaza towards Gaza City for safety, around 15 000 children under ten years in towns in North Gaza like Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun still remain inaccessible and will be missed during the campaign, compromising its effectiveness. To interrupt poliovirus transmission, at least 90% of all children in every community and neighborhood must be vaccinated. This will be challenging to achieve given the situation.",
          "The final phase of the campaign had aimed to reach an estimated 119 000 children under ten years old in northern Gaza with a second dose of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2). However, achieving this target is now unlikely due to access constraints.",
          "Despite the lack of access to all eligible children in northern Gaza, the Polio Technical Committee for Gaza, including the Palestinian Ministry of Health, World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and partners has taken the decision to resume the campaign. This aims to mitigate the risk of a long delay in reaching as many children as possible with polio vaccine and the opportunity to vaccinate those recently evacuated to Gaza City from other parts of North Gaza.",
          "To overcome challenges posed by the volatile security situation and constant population movement, robust micro plans have been developed to ensure the campaign is responsive to the significant population shifts and displacement in the north, following the first round in September. The campaign will be delivered by 216 teams across 106 fixed sites, 22 of which have been added to ensure increased availability of vaccination in areas where recently displaced people are seeking refuge. Two hundred and nine social mobilizers will be deployed to engage communities and raise awareness around vaccination efforts. The time period for the humanitarian pause has been extended by two hours and is expected to run from 6am to 4pm daily. As in the first two phases, vitamin A will also be co-administered to children between two to ten years in the north to help boost overall immunity.",
          "The campaign in northern Gaza follows the successful implementation of the first two phases of the second round in central and southern Gaza, which reached 451 216 children – 96% of the target in these areas. A total of 364 306 children aged between 2 and 10 years have received vitamin A so far in this round.",
          "Despite the challenges, WHO and UNICEF urge for the humanitarian pauses to be respected to ensure the successful delivery of this second round of the polio vaccination campaign. This is crucial to help curb the spread of polio in Gaza and neighboring countries."

The Xpert Mpox test is easy to operate and delivers results in under 40 minutes. Once the cartridge is placed in the system, the process is fully automated, with real-time PCR detecting viral DNA of monkeypox virus clade II. The GeneXpert system is a near-point-of-care testing option, which can support decentralized testing.",

This tool is a real-time PCR test capable of detecting both mpox clades and delivering results in under 2 hours. It can process multiple samples simultaneously and is suitable for clinical laboratories that handle large volumes of tests.",

It supports countries on their health emergency workforce, the surge deployment of experts and the networking of technical leaders. GHEC was established by WHO in 2023 after the response to the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the need to streamline efforts of existing networks to ensure better-coordinated support to countries.",
          "“WHO and partners are supporting the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries to implement an integrated approach to case detection, contact tracing, targeted vaccination, clinical and home care, infection prevention and control, community engagement and mobilization, and specialized logistical support,” said Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme. “The GHEC enhances the ability of the many effective responders at national and regional levels to collaborate and ensure the success on the ground in interrupting transmission and reducing suffering.”",
          "The first activation of this new support mechanism follows the declaration of mpox as a public health emergency of international concern by WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on 14 August 2024. Eighteen African countries have reported mpox cases this year, and the rapid spread of clade 1b mpox to at least two other regions has raised concerns about further spread.",
          "In collaboration with the International Association of National Public Health Institutes, GHEC is assessing the emergency workforce capacities in 8 countries affected by the mpox outbreak, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi, the two most affected countries. The assessment has so far identified 22 areas that need strengthening, including epidemiology and surveillance, laboratory capacities, infection prevention and control, risk communication and community engagement. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Health Cluster partners have joined in strengthening the coordination set up by the Ministry of Health under the leadership of the public health emergency operations centre.",
          "As of 17 October, WHO has managed the deployment of 56 experts to the affected countries. This includes WHO staff as well as experts mobilized through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and the African Volunteers Health Corps (AVoHC-SURGE). The AVoHC-SURGE responders, coordinated by WHO’s Regional Office for Africa and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, are a growing cohort of professionals with diverse skillsets that can be deployed in the region.",
          "“By mobilizing trained professionals from within the continent, we ensure that responses are not only timely but also contextually relevant,” said Dr Abdou Salam Gueye, Regional Emergency Director for the WHO Regional Office for Africa. “The dedication and expertise of these responders are essential in saving lives and building resilient health systems capable of withstanding future threats.”",
          "Additionally, GOARN is leading the efforts to map the support provided by partners on a bilateral basis to affected countries and the regional coordination structure. This includes the provision of experts, supplies, financial support, capacity strengthening and other activities.",
          "As part of the GHEC activation, on 22 October, technical leaders from affected countries and leaders from other countries, including those who have experienced previous mpox outbreaks, convened to discuss the most effective control measures, share best practices and coordinate their efforts to halt the outbreak.",

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) today published a new report on tuberculosis revealing that approximately 8.2 million people were newly diagnosed with TB in 2023 – the highest number recorded since WHO began global TB monitoring in 1995. This represents a notable increase from 7.5 million reported in 2022, placing TB again as the leading infectious disease killer in 2023, surpassing COVID-19. WHO’s Global Tuberculosis Report 2024 highlights mixed progress in the global fight against TB, with persistent challenges such as significant underfunding. While the number of TB-related deaths decreased from 1.32 million in 2022 to 1.25 million in 2023, the total number of people falling ill with TB rose slightly to an estimated 10.8 million in 2023. With the disease disproportionately affecting people in 30 high-burden countries, India (26%), Indonesia (10%), China (6.8%), the Philippines (6.8%) and Pakistan (6.3%) together accounted for 56% of the global TB burden. According to the report, 55% of people who developed TB were men, 33% were women and 12% were children and young adolescents. “The fact that TB still kills and sickens so many people is an outrage, when we have the tools to prevent it, detect it and treat it,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “WHO urges all countries to make good on the concrete commitments they have made to expand the use of those tools, and to end TB.” In 2023, the gap between the estimated number of new TB cases and those reported narrowed to about 2.7 million, down from COVID-19 pandemic levels of around 4 million in 2020 and 2021. This follows substantial national and global efforts to recover from COVID-related disruptions to TB services. The coverage of TB preventive treatment has been sustained for people living with HIV and continues to improve for household contacts of people diagnosed with TB. However, multidrug-resistant TB remains a public health crisis. Treatment success rates for multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB) have now reached 68%. But, of the 400 000 people estimated to have developed MDR/RR-TB, only 44% were diagnosed and treated in 2023. Funding gaps and challenges Global funding for TB prevention and care decreased further in 2023 and remains far below target. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which bear 98% of the TB burden, faced significant funding shortages. Only US$ 5.7 billion of the US$ 22 billion annual funding target was available in 2023, equivalent to only 26% of the global target. The total amount of international donor funding in LMICs has remained at around US$1.1 – 1.2 billion per year for several years. The United States government remains the largest bilateral donor for TB. The While Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global Fund) is the top contribution to international funder of the TB response, especially in LMICs. is important, it remains However, resources remain insufficient to cover essential TB service needs. The report emphasizes that sustained financial investment is crucial for the success of TB prevention, diagnosis, and treatment efforts. Globally, TB research remains severely underfunded with only one-fifth of the US$ 5 billion annual target reached in 2022. This impedes the development of new TB diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines. WHO continues leading efforts to advance the TB vaccine agenda, including with the support of the TB Vaccine Accelerator Council launched by the WHO Director-General. Complex drivers of the epidemic For the first time, the report provides estimates on the percentage of TB-affected households that face catastrophic costs (exceeding 20% of annual household income) to access TB diagnosis and treatment in all LMICs. These indicate that half of TB-affected households face such catastrophic costs. A significant number of new TB cases are driven by 5 major risk factors: undernutrition, HIV infection, alcohol use disorders, smoking (especially among men), and diabetes. Tackling these issues, along with critical determinants like poverty and GDP per capita, requires coordinated multisectoral action. “We are confronted with a multitude of formidable challenges: funding shortfalls and catastrophic financial burden on those affected, climate change, conflict, migration and displacement, pandemics, and drug-resistant tuberculosis, a significant driver of antimicrobial resistance,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Global Tuberculosis Programme. “It is imperative that we unite across all sectors and stakeholders, to confront these pressing issues and ramp up our efforts.” Global milestones and targets for reducing the TB disease burden are off-track, and considerable progress is needed to reach other targets set for 2027 ahead of the second UN High-Level Meeting. WHO calls on governments, global partners, and donors to urgently translate the commitments made during the 2023 UN High-Level Meeting on TB into tangible actions. Increased funding for research, particularly for new TB vaccines, is essential to accelerate progress and achieve the global targets set for 2027. Note to editors On 31 October 2024, a correction was made to this news release as noted below. The sentence in the original news release read: The total amount of international donor funding in LMICs has remained at around US$ 1.1–1.2 billion per year for several years.

          "Due to the escalating violence, intense bombardment, mass displacement orders, and lack of assured humanitarian pauses across most of northern Gaza, the Polio Technical Committee for Gaza, including the Palestinian Ministry of Health, World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and partners have been compelled to postpone the third phase of the polio vaccination campaign, which was set to begin today. This final phase of the ongoing campaign aimed to vaccinate 119 279 children across northern Gaza.",
          "The current conditions, including ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure continue to jeopardize people’s safety and movement in northern Gaza, making it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination, and health workers to operate.",
          "All logistics, supplies and trained human resources were prepared to vaccinate children across northern Gaza with a second dose of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2), following a first round conducted across the Gaza Strip from 1-12 September 2024. However, given that the area currently approved for temporary humanitarian pauses was substantially reduced—now limited only to Gaza City, a significant decrease from the first round—many children in northern Gaza would have missed out on the polio vaccine dose.",
          "To interrupt poliovirus transmission, at least 90% of all children in every community and neighborhood must be vaccinated – a prerequisite for an effective campaign to interrupt the outbreak and prevent its further spread. Humanitarian pauses are essential for its success, allowing partners to deliver vaccination supplies to health facilities, families to safely access vaccination sites, and mobile teams of health workers to reach children in their communities. A delay in administering a second dose of nOPV2 within six weeks reduces the impact of two closely spaced rounds on concurrently boosting the immunity of all children and interrupting poliovirus transmission. Having a significant number of children miss out on their second vaccine dose will seriously jeopardize efforts to stop the transmission of poliovirus in Gaza. This could also lead to further spread of poliovirus in the Gaza Strip and neighboring countries, with the risk of more children being paralyzed.",
          "Since the rollout of the second round of the polio campaign in Gaza on 14 October 2024, 442 855 children under ten years have been successfully vaccinated in central and south of the Gaza Strip– 94% of the target in these areas. A total of 357 802 children between two to ten years received vitamin A supplements as part of efforts to integrate the delivery of polio vaccine with other essential health services in Gaza.",
          "It is imperative to stop the polio outbreak as soon as possible, before more children are paralyzed and poliovirus spreads further. It is crucial therefore that the vaccination campaign in northern Gaza is facilitated through the implementation of the humanitarian pauses, ensuring access for wherever eligible children are located. WHO and UNICEF urge all parties to ensure that civilians, health workers, and civilian infrastructure, such as schools, shelters, hospitals, are protected and renew their call for an immediate ceasefire."

          "On 21 October, 14 patients and 10 caregivers were transferred from Kamal Adwan in North Gaza to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City during a high-risk, WHO-led joint mission, amid intense hostilities and access restrictions. Despite an initial agreement, the delivery of critical medical supplies, blood, and fuel – resources essential for keeping Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda hospitals operational – was denied just a few hours before the mission began on 20 October. The mission lasted two days, with the team facing delays at successive checkpoints, and during extensive security screenings. The team was forced to stay overnight at Kamal Adwan Hospital, as they were not cleared to proceed to Al-Shifa hospital due to active conflict in the area. Heavy bombardment continued near the hospital throughout the night, causing distress among patients, health workers and the mission team. The team was only able to proceed to Al-Shifa Hospital around midday on 21 October. En route to Al-Shifa, all patients were taken out of the ambulances for a security screening. Some patients on stretchers were left lying on the ground for some time during the screening was conducted, while some partner staff were subjected to humiliating treatment. This was the fourth WHO mission to the north of Gaza since 1 October. So far this month, out of the 21 missions requested by WHO, only 6 were facilitated, the majority being denied or impeded. Kamal Adwan Hospital remains partially functional but is struggling to meet growing needs due to intensified hostilities in the north and a shortage of medical supplies and fuel. A strike near the hospital causing damages to the gate was reported earlier today, 22 October. Currently, there are 95 patients in the hospital, including 15 in intensive care (including four requiring continuous life support) seven of whom are children. Over the last two days, at least 200 severely injured people and 53 dead bodies have been brought to the already overwhelmed hospital. Damaged roads, combined with ongoing hostilities, are severely disrupting safe access to the hospital. If patients, ambulances, and health workers are unable to reach the facility, and partners cannot resupply it, the hospital may soon become non-functional. As hostilities intensify in North Gaza, WHO is deeply concerned about the last two functional hospitals – Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda – which must be protected. A complete lack of health care in North Gaza would make an already catastrophic situation worse, and lead to more lives being lost. One year on, health care continues to be attacked and deprived of supplies and fuel, while WHO’s ability to regularly reach health facilities is severely compromised due to mission delays and denials. WHO reiterates its call for unimpeded access to health facilities, reliable and timely facilitation of missions, sustained flow of aid into and across Gaza, protection of health care, and above all a ceasefire."

          "The Hajj health card, built on the WHO Global Digital Health Certification Network’s public key infrastructure, summarizes critical health information, such as medication needs, allergies, immunization status and pre-existing conditions. The card gives individuals agency over their own health information when they travel to Saudi Arabia so that they can provide authorized health providers access to accurate, up-to-date patient summary information and obtain personalized quality care.",
          "“Today marks a notable progress in WHO’s support to Member States to expand access to safer and person-centered digital health tools for people to improve their access to quality health care when and where they need it,” said Dr Jeremy Farrar, WHO Chief Scientist. “We are thankful for the excellent collaboration with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, participating countries, and the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, and look forward to further support building capacity and infrastructure in countries shifting to more digitized health systems.”",
          "The Hajj is the largest pilgrimage in the world, drawing almost 3 million pilgrims from over 180 countries every year. Over 250 000 pilgrims from 3 countries, Indonesia, Malaysia and Oman, were issued Hajj health cards in 2024, as part of the pilot collaboration between WHO and Saudi Arabia. This test-phase demonstrated that each country was able to use global standards to issue their own national versions of the card, enhancing the pilgrims’ safety and quality of care while undertaking the Hajj.",
          "WHO and Saudi Arabia agreed to further collaborate to improve and expand upon the successful pilot programme for the Hajj health card. The expertise and support from the Saudi government and their digital implementing partner LEAN, will enable increased data security and essential technical support to additional countries joining the Hajj health card programme.",
          "“This exciting partnership between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the World Health Organization to expand the Hajj health card initiative enhances the safety and well-being of millions of pilgrims,” said Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO). “By leveraging digital health solutions, we strengthen quality of care, and help strengthen health systems in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and around the world.\""

          "The GDHCN is based on a robust public key infrastructure (PKI) encryption system that keeps health credentials verifiable and secure, allowing national authorities and health providers to trust the authenticity of health documents across borders without compromising individual privacy.",
          "The initiative aims to bring a digital health future where people can carry internationally recognized health credentials for improved travel and health care access. This enables greater access and control for people over their health information with the ability to select and decide which health information should be shared when seeking care domestically or abroad.",
          "By joining WHO’s certification network, countries can cut down on administration processes, making border controls more efficient and health visits better informed. The global network lays the groundwork for long-term improvements in international health collaboration, enabling future use-cases such as cross-border e-prescriptions, insurance, and even telemedicine."

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) has certified Egypt as malaria-free, marking a significant public health milestone for a country with more than 100 million inhabitants. The achievement follows a nearly 100-year effort by the Egyptian government and people to end a disease that has been present in the country since ancient times.",
          "“Malaria is as old as Egyptian civilization itself, but the disease that plagued pharaohs now belongs to its history and not its future,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This certification of Egypt as malaria-free is truly historic, and a testament to the commitment of the people and government of Egypt to rid themselves of this ancient scourge. I congratulate Egypt on this achievement, which is an inspiration to other countries in the region, and shows what’s possible with the right resources and the right tools.”",
          "Egypt is the third country to be awarded a malaria-free certification in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region following the United Arab Emirates and Morocco, and the first since 2010. Globally, a total of 44 countries and 1 territory have reached this milestone.",
          "“Receiving the malaria elimination certificate today is not the end of the journey but the beginning of a new phase. We must now work tirelessly and vigilantly to sustain our achievement through maintaining the highest standards for surveillance, diagnosis and treatment, integrated vector management and sustaining our effective and rapid response to imported cases. Our continued multisectoral efforts will be critical to preserving Egypt's malaria-free status,” said H.E. Dr Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, Deputy Prime Minister of Egypt.",
          "\"I reaffirm that we will continue with determination and strong will to safeguard the health of all people in Egypt under the wise leadership's guidance and proceed with enhancing our healthcare system, this will remain a cornerstone in protecting the lives of all people living in and visiting Egypt.”",
          "Certification of malaria elimination is granted by WHO when a country has proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the chain of indigenous malaria transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes has been interrupted nationwide for at least the previous three consecutive years. A country must also demonstrate the capacity to prevent the re-establishment of transmission."

          "Malaria has been traced as far back as 4000 B.C.E. in Egypt, with genetic evidence of the disease found in Tutankhamun and other ancient Egyptian mummies.",
          "Early efforts to reduce human-mosquito contact in Egypt began in the 1920s when the country prohibited the cultivation of rice and agricultural crops near homes. With most of Egypt’s population living along the banks of the Nile River and malaria prevalence as high as 40%, the country designated malaria a notifiable disease in 1930 and later opened its first malaria control station focused on diagnosis, treatment and surveillance.",
          "“Today, Egypt has proven that with vision, dedication, and unity we can overcome the greatest challenges. This success in eliminating malaria is not just a victory for public health but a sign of hope for the entire world, especially for other endemic countries in our region. This achievement is the result of sustained, robust surveillance investments in a strong, integrated health system, where community engagement and partnerships have enabled progress. Furthermore, collaboration and support to endemic countries, such as Sudan, remain a priority,” said Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean.",
          "By 1942, malaria cases in Egypt had spiked to more than 3 million as a result of the Second World War population displacement, the disruption of medical supplies and services, and the invasion of Anopheles arabiensis, a highly efficient mosquito vector, among other factors. Egypt succeeded in controlling the malaria outbreak through the establishment of 16 treatment divisions and the recruitment of more than 4000 health workers.",
          "The construction of the Aswan Dam, completed in 1969, created a new malaria risk for the country, as standing water produced breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Egypt, in collaboration with Sudan, launched a rigorous vector control and public health surveillance project to rapidly detect and respond to malaria outbreaks.",
          "By 2001, malaria was firmly under control and the Ministry of Health and Population set its sights on preventing the re-establishment of local malaria transmission. Egypt rapidly contained a small outbreak of malaria cases in the Aswan Governorate in 2014 through early case identification, prompt treatment, vector control and public education.",
          "Malaria diagnosis and treatment are provided free-of-charge to the entire population in Egypt regardless of legal status, and health professionals are trained nationwide to detect and screen for malaria cases including at borders. Egypt’s strong cross-border partnership with neighbouring countries, including Sudan, has been instrumental for preventing the re-establishment of local malaria transmission, paving the way for the country to be officially certified as malaria-free."

          "On 16 October, the Ministry of Public Health of Lebanon confirmed a cholera case, highlighting the escalating health risks amidst ongoing conflict. The case was identified in Akkar governorate in the north of the country, marking the first case since the October 2022-June 2023 outbreak was declared over. Authorities are investigating the extent of the disease’s spread, gathering samples from the patient’s contacts, and assessing potential water contamination.",
          "“WHO has been sounding the alarm on the risk of emerging infectious diseases like cholera resurfacing in Lebanon as a result of poor water and sanitation conditions and the impact of the current conflict,” said Dr Abdinasir Abubakar, WHO Representative in Lebanon. “Our immediate focus now is to enhance surveillance and water sanitation conditions to interrupt transmission and prevent further spread.”",
          "The current resurgence occurs as conflict strains Lebanon’s already overburdened health system, exacerbating displacement, and contributing to a further decline in water and sanitation services and infrastructure. Overcrowded shelters are not equipped to accommodate the increasing number of displaced people, raising the risks of the spread of cholera.",
          "WHO is collaborating closely with the Ministry of Health and partners, leveraging lessons from the last outbreak in October 2022 to contain the disease outbreak and prevent its spread. The 2022-2023 outbreak was the first in Lebanon in over 30 years and was driven by economic decline and inadequate access to clean water and sanitation, resulting in 8,007 suspected cases, 671 lab-confirmed cases, and 23 deaths.",
          "Earlier in August, the Ministry of Public Health launched a preemptive oral cholera vaccination campaign in coordination with WHO, UHNCR, UNICEF and other partners, targeting 350 000 people living in high-risk areas. The campaign, which was interrupted by the escalation in violence, aimed to cover individuals aged one year and above residing in high-risk areas in 5 out of Lebanon’s 8 governorates.",
          "In response to the detection of the current case, WHO has immediately activated a cholera preparedness and response plan to enhance surveillance and contact tracing, including environmental surveillance and water sampling, strengthen laboratory testing capacity, preposition cholera supplies and support infection prevention and control measures in designated treatment centre facilities.",
          "On 4 and 5 October, a WHO shipment of essential health supplies arrived in Beirut to support the response to the ongoing emergency. The shipment of over 116 metric tons included cholera supplies as part of the preparedness and response plan. WHO will continue to procure and preposition essential cholera supplies, including laboratory supplies.",
          "As part of the efforts to contain the outbreak, WHO and the Ministry of Public Health will explore whether to introduce oral cholera vaccines in high-risk areas to interrupt the transmission as early as possible",
          "WHO is also supporting the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre at the Ministry of Public Health to coordinate response activities at national and subnational level in coordination with the health sector. These response activities include maintaining essential health services to ensure no interruption of health delivery while supporting case identification and management at health facilities, as well as strengthening risk communication and community engagement activities so that people are aware of symptoms, risk factors and preventive measures.",
          "By implementing the comprehensive cholera preparedness and response plan, WHO together with MoPH and partners aims to limit transmission, reduce the burden of the disease, and improve overall health outcomes."

The statement, signed by the President of UNITE, members of its board, and parliamentarians around the world, marks a significant commitment from parliamentarians to strengthen pandemic preparedness, response, and equitable access to health.",

The summit aims to translate discussions into actionable policy priorities. It focuses on critical health challenges under four main pillars: Human Rights & Equitable Access to Health, Global Health Architecture & Security, Strengthening of Healthcare Systems, and Sustainable Financing for Health. The signing of the Global Parliamentary Statement in Support of the Pandemic Agreement is one of the summit’s key highlights, demonstrating the critical role of parliamentarians in ensuring global health security and safeguarding populations against future pandemics.",

This statement represents Parliamentarians’ commitment to protect their fellow citizens by ensuring that all countries, regardless of resources, have equitable access to the tools, capacities, resources, and healthcare required during pandemics, including to vaccines, treatments, medical supplies, and vital healthcare information.",

The WHO Pandemic Agreement is an essential step forward in ensuring that every nation has the tools, resources, and capabilities to respond to future health threats.”",
          "The WHO Pandemic Agreement needs to continue to garner broad international support from governments, global health organizations, and civil society. It reflects a shared understanding that pandemics know no borders and that global solidarity is essential for safeguarding the health and well-being of all people. The agreement also underscores the importance of sustainable financing, research and development, and capacity-building efforts to ensure that countries can respond swiftly and effectively to health emergencies.",

Fifteen incidents impacted health facilities, while 13 impacted health transport. Hospitals in Lebanon are already under massive strain as they strive to sustain essential health services while dealing with an unprecedented influx of injured people. Understaffed and under-resourced, the health system has been struggling to maintain uninterrupted services to all those in need with supplies being depleted and health workers exhausted.",
          "Increasing conflict, intense bombardment and insecurity are forcing a growing number of health facilities to shut down, particularly in the south. Out of 207 primary health care centres and dispensaries in conflict-affected areas, 100 are now closed. Hospitals have had to close or evacuate due to structural damage or their proximity to areas of intense bombardment. As of today, 5 hospitals have been evacuated and another 5 partially evacuated, with critical cancer and dialysis patients referred to other hospitals also overwhelmed by increasing health needs. Dialysis centres are having to operate an extra three shifts to accommodate the referred patients while being under-resourced for essential blood testing supplies and personnel.",
          "“The situation in Lebanon is alarming. Attacks on health care debilitate health systems and impede their ability to continue to perform. They also prevent entire communities from accessing health services when they need them the most,” said Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean. “WHO is working tirelessly with the Ministry of Public Health in Lebanon to address critical gaps and support the continuity of essential health services, but what people of Lebanon need most is an immediate ceasefire.”",

On 4 and 5 October, four flights containing medical supplies for trauma care, cholera prevention and mental health treatment arrived from WHO’s logistics hub in Dubai to Beirut. The supplies, currently being distributed to priority hospitals in coordination with the Ministry of Public Health, are enough to treat around 100 000 patients. WHO is working to bring in additional supplies.",

          "The second round of an emergency polio vaccination campaign is scheduled to start on 14 October 2024 in Gaza, to vaccinate an estimated 591 700 children under ten years of age with a second dose of the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) vaccine.",
          "This follows a first round , which was successfully implemented from 1-12 September 2024 and vaccinated 559 161 children, or an estimated 95% of eligible children at governorate level, according to independently conducted post-campaign monitoring. As with the first round, the second round will have three phases, each involving three campaign days and one catch-up day.",
          "A minimum of two doses of nOPV2 are needed to interrupt poliovirus transmission. However, this will only be achieved if at least 90% of all children are vaccinated in all communities and neighbourhoods. In this round, vitamin A will be co-administered alongside polio vaccine, to help boost overall immunity among children between the ages of two and nine years.",
          "The campaign, being conducted by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), and other partners is part of emergency efforts to stop the polio outbreak in Gaza, which was detected on 16 July 2024, and prevent further spread of poliovirus.",
          "Once again, meticulous planning, coordination and implementation will see an extensive network of teams vaccinating at selected health facilities and outreach posts. Mobile teams will actively reach out to families living in shelters, tents and camps for internally displaced people. Local teams will be deployed in areas that need special coordination to reach children, including those who could not receive vaccine in the first round. The first round demonstrated that overwhelming logistical challenges — including operating amid devastated infrastructure and constant population movements — can be overcome through an extraordinarily resilient and dedicated health workforce and strong community demand for polio vaccination, if all parties respect the planned humanitarian pauses.",
          "More than 800 social mobilizers will reach out to families to raise awareness on the importance of taking the second dose as well as on the dates and locations. Radio spots, short message services (SMS) and all digital channels available in Gaza will also amplify these messages. This outreach will continue until the round concludes.",
          "Additionally, logistical and programmatic needs, such as training health and community workers, provision of adequate supplies, recording of data by independent monitors, and demarcation of areas being covered by mobile teams, have been streamlined for the second round.",
          "To cover the two rounds, 1.6 million doses of the vaccines were delivered in the past two months as well as 20 refrigerators, 10 freezers, 100 ice boxes, and 800 vaccine carriers — all equipment required to maintain vaccines at a temperature between 2 and 8°C.",
          "Once again, a humanitarian pause will be a pre-requisite to implementing a successful second round, particularly to ensure all polio workers can operate in a safe and secure environment, and communities and families can obtain vaccination for children without fear.",
          "A substantial constraint to the polio campaign will again be reaching children living in areas outside humanitarian pauses , who were not covered in the last round. This requires coordination and approvals to allow programme supervision and monitoring, which would contribute significantly to ensuring all children, regardless of their location, are vaccinated.",
          "WHO and UNICEF renew their urgent request to all parties to the conflict to implement the necessary humanitarian pauses in Gaza for this second round. This is particularly critical as new evacuation orders in the north of Gaza are threatening access to hospitals and protection of health facilities and health and community workers. Vaccination teams must be protected and allowed to conduct the campaigns safely. We urge all parties to ensure their protection, and that of health facilities and children.",
          "Editors’ notes",
          "Circulating variant poliovirus type 2 was confirmed in Gaza in six environmental samples in July 2024, in a ten-month-old paralysed child in July 2024, and in another five environmental samples collected on 5 September 2024.",

An additional 543 000 deaths associated with AMR could be averted annually when new vaccines for tuberculosis (TB) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, are developed and rolled out globally.

          "The WHO Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) continues to closely monitor the genetic and antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination, and the performance of COVID-19 vaccines against circulating variants. Based on these evaluations, WHO advises vaccine manufacturers and regulatory authorities on the implications for future updates to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. The next decision-making meeting of the TAG-CO-VAC is scheduled for mid-December 2024, after which a statement on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition and an accompanying data annex will be published on the WHO website. These meetings are timed to balance the availability of the latest epidemiological, immunological, and virological data, with the kinetics of vaccine-induced protection and the lead time manufacturers need to update the antigen composition of authorized COVID-19 vaccines.",
          "The purpose of this statement is to guide the scientific community and vaccine manufacturers as to which data should be generated ahead of the December 2024 TAG-CO-VAC deliberations.",
          "To inform decisions on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition, 1-4 the TAG-CO-VAC reviews data (see Table) on the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the antigenic characteristics of previously and currently circulating variants. This includes the analysis of naïve animal antisera in one-way and two-way neutralization tests, as well as immunogenicity data that assess the breadth and durability of immune responses, including neutralizing antibody responses, using sera from sequentially immunized or infected animals and pre-and post-vaccination human sera. The TAG-CO-VAC also considers vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates of currently approved COVID-19 vaccines, particularly those that control for time since vaccination and that provide variant-specific estimates across different vaccine platforms. Further examples of published data reviewed by TAG-CO-VAC and used to inform decisions on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition can be found in the annexes accompanying each statement. 1-4",
          "In addition, the TAG-CO-VAC reviews available data from vaccine manufacturers, including animal and/or human studies demonstrating the breadth and durability of immune responses elicited by currently authorized vaccines, as well as any vaccine candidates in development. Vaccine manufacturers are also asked to provide observational epidemiological data that demonstrate the efficacy or effectiveness of their authorized COVID-19 vaccines, as well as any vaccine candidates in development.",
          "At this stage, the key antisera and antigens of interest for the December 2024 decision-making meeting for demonstrating breadth include antisera to: BA.2 ( other historical reference viruses – e.g., index, Alpha, BA.1 – are also useful for determining antigenic relationships ), XBB.1.5, JN.1, KP.2, KP.3.1.1 and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Antisera of interest are animal sera after single or sequential exposure and human sera after boost with monovalent JN.1, KP.2 or XBB.1.5, vaccines. Both pre- and post-vaccination sera should be included and for all antisera, neutralizing antibody titers should be analyzed against at least one variant that emerged after the vaccine antigen, where feasible. Analysis of this antisera against the same panel of virus antigens as well as other new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants will provide insight into antigenic characteristics of previous and emerging variants. Emerging variants include the list of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest (VOI) and Variants Under Monitoring (VUM) maintained on the WHO website . Relative VE estimates should be calculated during periods of circulation of XBB, JN.1, KP.3.1.1 or other emerging variant(s) in human populations across age groups with separate VE estimates for each of the following vaccine antigen compositions: monovalent JN.1, monovalent KP.2 or monovalent XBB.1.5.",
          "In preparation for the December 2024 meeting, the TAG-CO-VAC encourages the scientific community and vaccine manufacturers to prioritize generating and sharing the data outlined here to ensure evidence-informed deliberations on COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition; please contact the TAG-CO-VAC Secretariat: [ tagcovac@who.int ].",

Studies need to estimate relative VE by time since vaccination or at least provide a measure of time since vaccination, such as the mean or median. They should also provide variant-specific estimates and distinct estimates for each of the following vaccine antigen compositions across different vaccine platforms: monovalent JN.1, monovalent KP.2, or monovalent XBB.1.5. Studies should also provide relative VE for a range of outcomes beyond severe disease, including any infection or symptomatic disease.

          "WHO announced that a fourth WHO-prequalified human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine product, Cecolin® has been confirmed for use in a single-dose schedule. The decision is made based on new data on the product that fulfilled the criteria set out in the WHO’s 2022 recommendations for alternative, off-label use of HPV vaccines in single-dose schedules . This important milestone will contribute to improving sustainable supply of HPV vaccines—allowing more girls to be reached with the vaccines that prevent cervical cancer.",
          "“Unlike most other cancers, we have the ability to eliminate cervical cancer, along with its painful inequities,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “By adding another option for a one-dose HPV vaccination schedule, we have taken another step closer to consigning cervical cancer to history.”",
          "More than 95% of the 660 000 cervical cancer cases occurring globally each year are caused by HPV. Every two minutes, a woman dies from this preventable disease globally, and 90% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Of the 20 hardest hit countries by cervical cancer 19 are in Africa.",
          "HPV vaccine introductions have been hampered by global supply shortages since 2018 and production challenges encountered by one of the manufacturers earlier this year led to further shortfalls, potentially impacting millions of girls in need of HPV vaccines in Africa and Asia.",
          "“Having 90% of girls fully vaccinated with the HPV vaccine by 15 years of age is the target for the first pillar of the WHO global strategy for cervical cancer elimination ,” said Dr Kate O'Brien, Director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals at WHO. “Given the continuing supply challenges, this addition of single-dose vaccine product means countries will have greater choice of vaccines to reach more girls.”",
          "A growing number of vaccine products initially prequalified for use in a 2-dose schedule can now be used in a single-dose schedule. The single-dose use indication for this additional vaccine, Cecolin®, is incorporated into the second edition of WHO’s technical document on considerations for HPV vaccine product choice (reflected in Table 4 of this document). Like for other medications and vaccines, when there is data to support modified use, guided by a clear public health benefit, public health advisory bodies can recommend \"off-label” use , until a manufacturer adds this modified use to their label.",
          "Global data released on 15 July 2024 indicates that the one dose HPV vaccine coverage among girls aged 9-14 years increased from 20% in 2022 to 27% in 2023 . In 2023, 37 countries were implementing the single-dose schedule. As of 10 September 2024, 57 countries are implementing the single-dose schedule.  WHO estimates that the single-dose schedule adoption has resulted in at least 6 million additional girls being reached with HPV vaccines in 2023.",
          "Earlier this year, countries and partners committed nearly US$ 600 million in new funding towards elimination of cervical cancer . Funding includes US$ 180 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, US$ 10 million from UNICEF, and US$ 400 million from the World Bank. Together with the strong continuing commitment by Gavi, these investments will help to accelerate introductions and boost coverage of HPV vaccine among girls by 2030."

This will contribute to a more sustainable supply of HPV vaccines, enabling more girls to receive the vaccine. Walrinvax® is prequalified with a two-dose schedule. Further data will be needed to assess if this vaccine can be recommended for single-dose schedule in the future."

          "In July 2022, WHO Director-General declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in response to a multi-country outbreak of mpox that was rapidly spreading, mainly through sexual contact, in countries where it had not previously been detected. This PHEIC was lifted in May 2023 following a sustained global decline in cases. The emergence of the new Clade Ib and a resurgence of mpox cases in the African region led to the WHO declaration of a PHEIC again on 14 August 2024. The current outbreak in affected African countries also includes other high-risk groups such as pregnant women and children under the age of 18 years, including infants.",
          "Previously, GACVS reviewed the safety of three available mpox vaccines (MVA-BN, LC16m8, and ACAM2000 vaccines) during the second joint meeting of the WHO GACVS and the WHO Advisory Committee on Safety of Medicinal Products, 14–16 December 2022. The summary of the review and recommendations are published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER) [1] . The “Smallpox and mpox (orthopoxviruses): WHO position paper” published in August 2024, provides guidance for the use of currently available vaccines [2] .",
          "On 20 September 2024, the WHO GACVS was updated on safety data from passive and active surveillance from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) on the two 3rd generation vaccines (modified/non-replicating vaccinia virus (MVA)-BN(Jynneos/Imvanex/Imvamune; Bavarian Nordic) and minimally replicating LC16m8 vaccine (KM-Biologics)). The GACVS was updated on post-approval safety data of MBA-BN vaccines and the safety findings from clinical studies on LC16m8 vaccine.",
          "As MVA-BN is a non-replicating vaccine and can be used in pregnant women, considering limited available data, the GACVS was updated on the risk management plan by Bavarian Nordic for the use of MVA-BN mpox vaccines in African countries. GACVS welcomed additional clinical studies planned by Bavarian Nordic to address questions about vaccine use in infants aged 6 months to 2 years, children aged 2 to 12 years and pregnant women.",
          "While current post-approval data indicate that these vaccines have favorable safety profiles in adults that are generally consistent with pre-licensure clinical trial data, close monitoring is recommended to detect any potential safety signal.",
          "Various administration methods (i.e., subcutaneous, intradermal, and bifurcated needle) are used for different types of mpox vaccines. Therefore, particularly for LC16m8 vaccine, special training of healthcare workers in intradermal injection techniques including the use of a bifurcated needle is strongly recommended to minimize possible immunization error-related adverse events. Local reactogenicity to this vaccine administration will also need to be monitored.",
          "GACVS was briefed on how countries prepare for safety monitoring following vaccine introduction. The Committee was then updated on the draft 'WHO Protocol: Cohort Event Monitoring (CEM) for Active Safety Surveillance of Mpox Vaccines.' GACVS emphasized the importance of using a standardized CEM protocol to capture potential safety signals at an early stage following the introduction of the vaccines, particularly given the limited data for high-risk groups such as infants, children under 12, immunocompromised individuals, and pregnant women.",
          "The Committee emphasizes the importance of monitoring the safety of both mpox vaccines MVA-BN and LC16m8, in all target populations where they are used including its off-label use. It is important to note that while MVA-BN can be used in immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women, LC16m8 is not recommended for use in these populations. Special attention should also be given to infants, children, and lactating women.",
          "The Committee encourages the use of tools like Vigiflow, VigiMobile, and the Med Safety App for spontaneous reporting of adverse events. GACVS recommends that public health authorities, researchers, regulatory agencies, marketing authorization holders, and other key stakeholders conduct comprehensive, coordinated vaccine safety surveillance and studies to identify rare or unknown adverse events not detected during clinical trials in these groups. The 'WHO Protocol: Cohort Event Monitoring for Active Safety Surveillance of Mpox Vaccines' will support countries in implementing cohort event monitoring for mpox vaccines.",
          "It was also noted that there are limitations in applying the restrictions for the use of these vaccines in people living with HIV who have a CD4 cell count below 200 cells/μL due to challenges with access to diagnostics and laboratory testing in these settings. Therefore, the Committee recommended communicating the risks and benefits while closely monitoring and ensuring follow-up on the safety of people living with HIV. Also, there needs to be even more vigilant safety monitoring in vaccinated populations with high HIV prevalence for people who are undiagnosed or not receiving clinical management.",

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed the first mpox in vitro diagnostic (IVD) under its Emergency Use Listing (EUL) procedure, an important step in improving global access to mpox testing. The approval for emergency use of the Alinity m MPXV assay, manufactured by Abbott Molecular Inc. , will be pivotal in expanding diagnostic capacity in countries facing mpox outbreaks, where the need for quick and accurate testing has risen sharply. Early diagnosis of mpox enables timely treatment and care, and control of the virus.",
          "Limited testing capacity and delays in confirming mpox cases persist in Africa, contributing to the continued spread of the virus. In 2024, over 30 000 suspected cases have been reported across the region, with the highest numbers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, and Nigeria. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, only 37% of suspected cases have been tested this year.",
          "The presence of the monkeypox virus is confirmed by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), such as real-time or conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as stated in the WHO Interim Guidance on Diagnostic testing for the monkeypox virus (MPXV) . And the recommended specimen type for diagnostic confirmation of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection in suspected cases is lesion material.",
          "The Alinity m MPXV assay is a real-time PCR test that enables detection of monkeypox virus (clade I/II) DNA from human skin lesion swabs. It is specifically designed for use by trained clinical laboratory personnel who are proficient in PCR techniques and IVD procedures. By detecting DNA from pustular or vesicular rash samples, laboratory and health workers can confirm suspected mpox cases efficiently and effectively.",
          "\"This first mpox diagnostic test listed under the Emergency Use Listing procedure represents a significant milestone in expanding testing availability in affected countries,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. “Increasing access to quality-assured medical products is central to our efforts in assisting countries to contain the spread of the virus and protect their people, especially in underserved regions.\"",
          "The EUL process accelerates the availability of life-saving medical products, such as vaccines, tests and treatments, in the context of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On 28 August 2024, WHO called on mpox IVDs manufacturers to submit an expression of interest for EUL , recognizing the urgent need to bolster global testing capacities as the virus continued to spread. The EUL process assesses the quality, safety, and performance of essential health products, such as diagnostic tests, to guide procurement agencies and WHO Member States in making informed decisions for time-limited emergency procurement.",
          "So far, WHO has received three additional submissions for EUL evaluation, and discussions are ongoing with other manufacturers of mpox IVDs to ensure a wider range of quality-assured diagnostic options. This will support countries which have not approved the medical products through their own approval processes to procure the critically needed tests through UN agencies and other procurement partners.",
          "The EUL for Alinity m MPXV assay, allowing for its use, will remain valid as long as the PHEIC, justifying the emergency use of mpox in vitro diagnostics, is in effect.",
          "Information on active EUL applications for mpox IVDs can be found on these WHO webpages ."

The Plan aims at reducing the burden of disease, suffering and deaths from dengue and other Aedes -borne arboviral diseases such as Zika and chikungunya, by fostering a global coordinated response.",
          "The Plan outlines priority actions to control transmission and offers recommendations to affected countries across various sectors, including disease surveillance, laboratory activities, vector control, community engagement, clinical management, and research and development, through a whole-of-society and regional approach.",
          "An estimated four billion people are at risk of infection from arboviruses around the world, and this number is estimated to increase to 5 billion by 2050. Dengue cases have surged across all six WHO regions, and the number of cases has approximately doubled each year since 2021, with over 12.3 million cases as of the end of August this year – almost double the 6.5 million cases reported in all of 2023.",
          "Dengue is endemic in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in South-East Asia, the Western Pacific and the Americas. The situation is equally concerning in Africa, where countries are battling multiple diseases amid conflict and natural disasters, placing additional strain on already fragile health systems. In December 2023, WHO graded the current global dengue upsurge as grade 3, the highest level of emergency for WHO, to support countries to strengthen their surveillance capacities and implement response activities.",
          "“The rapid spread of dengue and other arboviral diseases in recent years is an alarming trend that demands a coordinated response across sectors and across borders,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “From maintaining clean environments to supporting vector control and seeking and providing timely medical care, everyone has a role to play in the fight against dengue. This plan is a roadmap to turn the tide against this disease and other Aedes -borne arboviral diseases, protect vulnerable populations and pave the way for a healthier future.”",
          "Factors such as unplanned urbanization and poor water, sanitation and hygiene practices, climate change and international travel, are facilitating the rapid geographical spread of dengue. The disease is now endemic in more than 130 countries. Similar trends are also observed for other arboviral diseases, such as Zika, chikungunya and more recently the Oropouche virus disease, especially in the Americas. This global escalation underscores the urgent need for a robust strategy to mitigate risks and safeguard populations.",

With these efforts, the country achieved the end of disease transmission in 2017.",
          "The elimination of lymphatic filariasis was also one of the goals of the Brasil Saudável program , a multisectoral initiative aimed at ending socially determined diseases with a whole-of-government approach and civil society participation, including the involvement of affected people in the implementation of disease control efforts. The programme was launched in February 2024 by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in a ceremony with the participation of Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General and Dr Jarbas Barbosa, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and WHO Regional Director for the Americas. In the post-elimination phase, Brazil, PAHO, and WHO will continue to closely monitor for possible resurgence of infections.",

          "Note to the editor",
          "Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a neglected tropical disease. Infection occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. Infection is usually acquired in childhood and causes hidden damage to the lymphatic system.",
          "The painful and profoundly disfiguring visible manifestations of the disease – lymphoedema, elephantiasis and scrotal swelling – occur later in life and can lead to permanent disability. These patients are not only physically disabled, but suffer mental, social and financial losses contributing to stigma and poverty.",
          "Elimination of lymphatic filariasis is possible by stopping the spread of the infection through preventive chemotherapy. The WHO-recommended preventive chemotherapy strategy for lymphatic filariasis elimination is mass drug administration (MDA). MDA involves administering an annual dose of medicines to the entire at-risk population. The medicines used have a limited effect on adult parasites but effectively reduce the density of microfilariae in the bloodstream and prevent the spread of parasites to mosquitoes.",
          "In 2023, 657 million people in 39 countries and territories were living in areas that require preventive chemotherapy to stop the spread of infection. In the Americas, Costa Rica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago were removed from the WHO list of lymphatic filariasis endemic countries in 2011. The 2021–2030 neglected tropical disease road map targets the prevention, control, elimination and eradication of 20 diseases and disease groups by 2030. Progress against lymphatic filariasis and other neglected tropical diseases alleviates the human and economic burden that they impose on the world’s most disadvantaged communities."

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) today released guidance to improve the design, conduct and oversight of clinical trials in countries of all income levels. This guidance aims to support stronger country-led research and development (R&D) ecosystems to advance health science so that new, safe and effective health interventions can be made more accessible and affordable globally for people everywhere, faster.",
          "For the first time, WHO offers recommendations for national health authorities, regulatory authorities, funders and others on how they can best facilitate clinical trials to generate evidence on health interventions. It addresses challenges such as poor trial design, limited diversity of participants, insufficient infrastructure and bureaucratic efficiencies, which cost time, money and lives.",
          "Global divides between high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are leading to serious inequities in clinical trials. In 2022, there were 27 133 trials taking place in the world’s 86 HICs compared to 24 791 in 131 LMICs. At times, LMICs have been targeted for inclusion in clinical trials due to their disease burdens, only for the resulting data to be used in getting health interventions authorized in HICs, but not in the LMICs.",
          "“Strengthening country-led research and development and embedding clinical trials in routine clinical and public health services will ensure faster and more equitable access to safe and effective interventions, helping people become healthier,” said Dr Jeremy Farrar, WHO’s Chief Scientist. “This new guidance aims to improve the diversity of trial participants to ensure research benefits the broadest range of people possible, decisively moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach.”",
          "According to 2022 data , less than 5% of clinical trials included pregnant women and only 13% included children. This has lowered the quality of evidence, affecting care and access to interventions. The absence of adequate testing in underrepresented populations can lead to a cautious approach in treating them, which negatively impacts on their health. Furthermore, this gap in representation can also leave people from these groups less willing to accept health recommendations.",
          "The guidance includes practical considerations for setting up trials to include pregnant and lactating women, given they have unique healthcare needs. In general, at-risk populations should be involved from the earliest stages. To facilitate this, safety should be assessed as an initial priority, for instance, by reviewing comparable interventions or expediting pre-clinical studies for these groups. Appropriate procedures for consent and assent are key, particularly for children.",
          "The guidance recommends putting patient, participant and community engagement at the heart of organizing clinical trials, to ensure that research planning, delivery and dissemination meets public needs and maintains trust.",
          "The new guidance also seeks to strengthen national R&D ecosystems through sustainable financing, to support better decision-making, accelerate access to health innovation and build more robust and effective national and global health research environments.",
          "The guidance was developed in response to World Health Assembly resolution WHA 75.8 in an extensive and inclusive process, involving nearly 3000 stakeholders from various sectors across 48 countries. The guidance covers trials for any health intervention, including, but not limited to pharmaceutical medicines; vaccines; diagnostics; nutritional measures; cognitive, behavioural and psychological interventions; preventive care; digital and public health approaches; and traditional or herbal measures."

          "An investment today of an additional US$0.24 per patient per year in digital health interventions, such as telemedicine, mobile messaging and chatbots, can help save more than 2 million lives from noncommunicable diseases over the next decade, says a new report released jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO) and ITU (International Telecommunication Union). This investment could also avert approximately 7 million acute events and hospitalizations, significantly reducing the strain on healthcare systems around the world.",
          "The publication titled \" Going digital for noncommunicable diseases: the case for action \" has been launched at an event hosted by the Government of The Gambia during the 79 th United Nations General Assembly, in collaboration with the ITU and WHO.",
          "“The future of health is digital. But to make this vision a reality, we need both resources and collaboration,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. No single organization can do it alone. We call on governments, partners, and donors to come together, invest strategically, and ensure that these life-saving innovations reach those who need them most.”",
          "“The digital revolution has the potential to unleash a health revolution,” said ITU Secretary-General Doreen Bogdan-Martin. “At ITU, universal meaningful connectivity is a priority because digital is a catalyst for delivering targets in key sectors such as health and education. We call for greater collaboration between the health and tech sectors, including the development of strong digital public infrastructure, essential for the delivery of digital health services that can benefit people everywhere without leaving anyone behind.”",
          "Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases, are responsible for over 74% of global deaths annually, many of which are preventable. While significant progress has been made in combating NCDs, the integration of digital health technologies into mainstream health systems remains a challenge. The report shows that there is an urgent need to harness these technologies to scale up effective interventions and mitigate the growing burden on healthcare systems worldwide.",
          "Four major risk factors linked to our everyday environment – tobacco use, unhealthy diet, the harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity – drive responses in our bodies that also increase NCD risk: raised blood pressure, obesity, raised blood glucose and raised cholesterol. Digital tools, including mobile messaging and chatbots, can support individuals to understand their modifiable risk factors and encourage them to develop healthier habits.",
          "People living with NCDs require regular monitoring and continuous management, and many need long term and specialized care. Digital tools such as telemedicine can help them to overcome barriers to accessing healthcare. Real-time data and tools for health care professionals can also help them make informed decisions about their patients.",
          "While over 60% of countries have developed a digital health strategy, there is often a lack of integration of new technologies into the existing health infrastructure. The report calls for countries to invest in digital public infrastructure, and promote standards and interoperability which can overcome critical barriers to realizing the full potential of digital health.",
          "The report serves as a blueprint for action, complementing the WHO Global Initiative on Digital Health and Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025. The United Nations Inter-Agency Task Force for the prevention and control of NCDs (UNIATF) Secretariat, in collaboration with WHO and ITU, including through the Be He@lthy, Be Mobile programme are committed to providing tailored strategic planning and advocacy support to governments."

The country has focused on creating a unified health information system, establishing the national e-Health Centre and promoting ICT-based solutions. This effort has led to the pilot-testing of electronic health record platforms, capacity-building for medical personnel, and the introduction of e-clinical information forms in primary healthcare. The strategic benefits of this transformation were evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kyrgyzstan rapidly developed a digital register for vaccination certificates, eliminating the need for paper forms and saving approximately 850 000 hours of work by health workers and public employees."

          "Increased investment is urgently needed to address evolving health risks and meet the mental and sexual and reproductive health needs for the nearly 1.3 billion adolescents (aged 10-19 years) globally, according to a new scientific publication released by the World Health Organization (WHO).  Adolescence is a unique and critical stage of human development, involving major physical, emotional, and social transitions, and is a pivotal window for laying long-term foundations for good health.",
          "“Promoting and protecting the health and rights of young people is essential to building a better future for our world,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. “Conversely, failing to address the health threats that adolescents face – some longstanding, some emerging – will not only have serious and life-threatening consequences for young people themselves, but will create spiraling economic costs for societies. That makes investing in services and programmes for adolescent health both a moral imperative and an economic no-brainer.”",
          "The publication was launched at an event on the margins of the United Nations’ Summit of the Future . It highlights a number of troubling trends in adolescent health observed over the last decade, pointing to the urgent need for action.",
          "At least 1 in 7 adolescents globally now suffer from a mental disorder, for instance, with particularly high rates of depression and anxiety.  Anaemia among adolescent girls remains prevalent, at levels similar to those in 2010, while close to 1 in 10 adolescents are obese.  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including syphilis, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes that commonly occur among youth are rising, and if left untreated, can have lifelong implications for health.",
          "Meanwhile violence, including bullying, affects millions of young people worldwide each year, with devastating impacts on their physical and mental health.",
          "Concerningly, attempts to roll-back adolescents’ access to sexual and reproductive health care and comprehensive sexuality education have escalated amidst a growing backlash against gender equality and human rights. Restrictive age of consent policies are limiting their access to STI and HIV services. Such measures can marginalize young people, reduce health-seeking behaviour, and lead to lasting negative health impacts.",
          "The study emphasizes other broader fundamental challenges to the future of adolescents including climate change, conflict, and inequality.",
          "The authors also highlight that gains are possible with the right investment and support.  For example, adolescent HIV infections have declined, due to coordinated and persistent efforts in this area. Adolescent pregnancy and harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage have reduced. In addition, many positive trends in health outcomes are linked to more time in school, especially for girls; since 2000, the number of secondary-school-age children out of school decreased by nearly 30%.",
          "Against this backdrop, the findings make a strong case for investing in adolescent health and well-being, with attention to foundational elements including education, healthcare, and nutrition.  The authors call for enacting and implementing laws and policies that protect adolescent health and rights, for health systems and services to be more responsive to adolescents’ unique needs, and for the prioritization of youth engagement and empowerment across research, programming, and policymaking.",
          "“Adolescents are powerful and incredibly creative forces for good when they are able to shape the agenda for their well-being and their future,” said Rajat Khosla, Executive Director of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH), which co-hosted the event where the publication as launched. “Leaders must listen to what young people want and ensure they are active partners and decision-makers. They are critical for the world’s future social, economic, and political stability, and if given the platform they need, they can help make a better and healthier world possible for everyone.”",
          "Earlier this year, world leaders committed to accelerate efforts to improve maternal and child health , including adolescent health, at the World Health Assembly.  Implementing these commitments, as well as those reflected in the UN’s Pact for the Future, will be critical to protecting and promoting the health and well-being of current and future generations.",
          "Notes for editors",
          "The publication, which was published in the Journal of Adolescent Health , was released at a high-level event convened on the margins of the UN General Assembly. It was hosted by the Governments of Chile, Colombia, and Ireland along with the UN’s Human Reproduction Programme, PMNCH and WHO in collaboration with: FP2030, Guttmacher, International Association for Adolescent Health (IAAH), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHUSPH), Plan International, UNESCO, UNFPA, Women Deliver, and YieldHub.",
          "The Summit of the Future takes place on September 22 and 23, 2024, seeking new consensus around how the international system can evolve to better meet the needs of current and future generations."

          "As world leaders gather in New York for the 79th United Nations General Assembly, and as the threat of a wider regional escalation looms, we renew our demand for an end to the appalling human suffering and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. We mourn the loss of innocent life everywhere, including those killed on 7 October and during the 11 months of conflict since then. We urgently call for a sustained, immediate and unconditional ceasefire. This is the only way to end the suffering of civilians and save lives. All hostages and all those arbitrarily detained must be released immediately and unconditionally. Humanitarians must have safe and unimpeded access to those in need. We cannot do our jobs in the face of overwhelming need and ongoing violence. More than 41 000 Palestinians in Gaza – the majority of them civilians, including women, children, older persons and at times entire families – have reportedly been killed, and more than 95 500 have been injured, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. It is estimated that a quarter of the injured in Gaza, or around 22 500 people, will require lifelong specialized rehabilitation and assistive care including individuals with severe limb injuries, amputations, spinal cord damage, traumatic brain injuries, and major burns. More than 2 million Palestinians are without protection, food, water, sanitation, shelter, health care, education, electricity and fuel – the basic necessities to survive. Families have been forcibly displaced, time and time again, from one unsafe place to the next, with no way out. Women and girls’ dignity, safety, health and rights have been severely compromised. The risk of famine persists with all 2.1 million residents still in urgent need of food and livelihood assistance as humanitarian access remains restricted. Healthcare has been decimated. More than 500 attacks on health care have been recorded in Gaza. Aid hubs have been forced to relocate and re-build many times over; convoys carrying life-saving aid have been shot at, delayed and denied access; and relief workers have been killed in unprecedented numbers. The number of aid workers killed in Gaza in the past year is the highest ever in a single crisis. Unnecessary and disproportionate force unleashed in the West Bank, combined with escalating settler violence, house demolitions, forced displacement and discriminatory movement restrictions, have caused increased fatalities and casualties. The war is also jeopardizing the future for all Palestinians and rendering eventual recovery far from reach. Meanwhile, close to 100 hostages remain in Gaza, while freed hostages have reported ill treatment, including sexual violence. The parties’ conduct over the last year makes a mockery of their claim to adhere to international humanitarian law and the minimum standards of humanity that it demands. Civilians must be protected and their essential needs must be met. There must be accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. Humanitarian and aid organizations have been doing their utmost to provide relief in Gaza and the West Bank, often at great personal risk, and with many aid workers paying the ultimate price. Our capacity to deliver is indisputable if we are granted the access we need. The first round of the polio vaccination campaign, reaching more than 560,000 children under the age of 10, is but one example. The second round of vaccinations must be carried out safely and reach all children in Gaza. We urge world leaders, once again, to wield their influence to ensure respect for international humanitarian law, international human rights law and the rulings of the International Court of Justice – through diplomatic pressure and cooperation in ending impunity. Let us be clear: The protection of civilians is a bedrock principle for the global community and in all countries’ interest. Allowing the abhorrent, downward spiral caused by this war in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to continue will have unimaginable, global consequences. These atrocities must end.

          "Government-led negotiations on the world’s first agreement to protect people from future pandemics made significant progress during the latest round of discussions that ended today at the World Health Organization (WHO).",
          "Substantive progress on the draft agreement, increased involvement of civil society and non-State actors, and a commitment by all parties to sustain momentum towards a pandemic agreement were hallmarks of the eleventh meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB), which comprises the 194 member governments of WHO, and ran from 9–20 September in Geneva. Negotiators will resume discussions, at a twelfth round, from 4–15 November.",
          "Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, praised the “collective commitment” shown by governments and other stakeholders to conclude the pandemic agreement, and an urgent need to do so in light of the persistent threat shown by viruses with pandemic potential.",
          "“The next pandemic will not wait for us, whether from a flu virus like H5N1, another coronavirus, or another family of viruses we don’t yet know about,” Dr Tedros told the meeting. “But all the ingredients are in place to meet the objective of countries to negotiate a generational pandemic agreement. The world needs hope that it is still possible for countries to find common solutions to common problems. You can provide that hope.”",
          "Ambassador Anne-Claire Amprou, INB Bureau Co-chair of France, said the latest round of negotiations demonstrated the commitment by governments towards a pandemic accord to make the world safer and healthier. It also showed the critical role being played by civil society and other non-governmental stakeholders to ensure that equity, innovation and collaboration are at the heart of the agreement.",
          "“During extensive discussions, visible commitment was shown by Member States of WHO towards a pandemic agreement,” Ambassador Amprou said. “There was clear recognition from all countries that we must agree on a way forward to work better, together, to protect their citizens from future pandemics.” Ambassador Amprou added: “The constructive contributions by INB relevant stakeholders were incredibly valuable. Together, we must sustain this progress during the coming months to realize our shared goal to forge a pandemic agreement that guides future global responses to pandemics.”",
          "Each day during the past two weeks of discussions, INB relevant stakeholders joined negotiators for updates on progress and next steps, the latest version of the draft agreement reflecting the latest government proposals, and to offer suggestions. Detailed interactive dialogues were held during the week prior on critical subjects and publicly broadcast.",
          "“There is growing urgency for an effective Pandemic Agreement that does not only prepares us for the next pandemic but helps prevent it, including via a One Health approach,” said Nina Jamal, Head of Pandemics at the global animal welfare organisation FOUR PAWS. “We thank the Bureau for transparency towards relevant stakeholders, increased openness and constructive proposals by Member States, promoting successful negotiations. We are looking forward to further progress on the substance of the pandemic agreement and improved dialogue among member states to arrive at a meaningful, effective result.\"",
          "Michelle Childs, Policy Advocacy Director for the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), added: “DNDi welcomes the sharing of the draft texts and daily briefings. These help to improve the ability of stakeholders to follow and input and counter misinformation about what is actually being discussed. We encourage further steps to enhance transparency, including making stakeholder interventions publicly available.”",
          "Ms Precious Matsoso, INB Co-Chair from South Africa, said there was progress on fundamental areas of the draft agreement, including on research and development, regulatory systems strengthening, One Health, pandemic prevention and technology, supply chain networks and a new system for increased access to pathogens of pandemic potential and sharing of benefits, such as vaccines, diagnostics and treatments.",
          "“Following nearly three years of negotiations, countries are now focused on the remaining and most critical elements of the draft agreement to protect the world from future pandemics,” Ms Matsoso said.",
          "Ms Matsoso added: “At the heart of the negotiations is recognition that collaboration among countries will ensure the world will not be left vulnerable in the face of future pandemics, while each and every country will maintain their sovereignty and control over national health decision-making.”",
          "In December 2021 , a special session of the World Health Assembly established the INB to draft and negotiate a convention, agreement or other international instrument under the Constitution of the World Health Organization, to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. At the World Health Assembly in June 2024 , governments made concrete commitments to complete negotiations on a global pandemic agreement within a year, at the latest, and possibly in 2024."

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) and partners will call on world leaders to address critical global health challenges, and invest in global public health, at meetings throughout the high-level week of the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA79) , to be held in New York from 20 to 30 September 2024.",
          "The second High-Level Meeting on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) on 26 September 2024 will be the principal official, health-focused event during the UNGA high-level week. Without decisive action, such as that outlined in the final text of the draft political declaration for the  meeting, AMR will cause even more global suffering, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to medicines, making people sicker and increasing the spread of infections that are difficult to treat, leading to illness and deaths. The intergovernmental negotiations for the declaration were co-facilitated by Malta and Barbados. The first UN High-level Meeting on AMR took place in 2016.",
          "“Antimicrobial resistance threatens a century of medical progress and could return us to the pre-antibiotic era, where infections that are treatable today could become a death sentence,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, who will address the high-level meeting on AMR. “This is a threat for all countries at all income levels, which is why a strong, accelerated and well-coordinated global response is needed urgently.”",
          "UNGA79 takes place at a crucial moment as the world continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerates efforts to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Despite significant strides, progress towards health targets remains off track, exacerbated by ongoing humanitarian, social, and climate crises. Millions of people still lack access to life-saving health services, highlighting the link between health and sustainable development.",
          "The Summit of the Future, which will take place on 22 and 23 September, will bring together world leaders to forge a new international consensus on how to deliver better in the present, including ensuring global decision making is guided by science, achieving the SDGs and safeguarding the future. During the Summit, Heads of State and high-ranking government officials are expected to endorse the Pact for the Future, which will include a Global Digital Compact and a Declaration on Future Generations. Health priorities are well-reflected in the outcomes, including the importance of access to health services and achieving universal health coverage.",
          "During the week, WHO officials will participate in official and informal health-focused events ranging from digital health, maternal, child and adolescent health, communicable and noncommunicable diseases, and mental health, to action on climate change, advancing progress toward Universal Health Coverage, and pandemic preparedness and response.",
          "“Strong health systems, equitable access to health services, and robust pandemic preparedness are vital for a safer and healthier world,” Dr Tedros said. “We must harness the power of digital technologies to bridge gaps in access to health services and build resilient systems that can meet the multiple overlapping health challenges of our world, from outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics to climate change and the burden of noncommunicable diseases.”",
          "The UN General Assembly takes place during WHO’s first Investment Round, a series of engagements and ongoing efforts to secure sustainable financing for WHO’s core work for the period of 2025-2028. Dr Tedros and WHO representatives will be conveying the importance of investing in global health and of a robust and fully funded WHO to work with countries in advancing health for all. On 23 September, Dr Tedros and European Investment Bank President Nadia Calviño will hold a live-streamed fireside chat moderated by Suzanne Lynch of Politico on why investing in primary healthcare is critical at a time of increased shocks caused by disease outbreaks like mpox.",
          "This will be followed later in the day by the European Investment Bank and WHO co-hosting a high-level roundtable under the new Health Impact Investment Platform, which will spotlight country level action to boost vaccination and community-based health. Both meetings will be streamed via WHO and Dr Tedros’ social media channels.",
          "On 24 September, WHO will host the Third Annual Gathering of the Heads of State and Government for the prevention and control of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs), to catalyze commitment at the highest levels of Government, and bolster engagement by partners ahead of the UNGA high-level meeting on NCDs and Mental Health in 2025.",
          "From 22-29 September, 2024, WHO will participate in key events, panels and initiatives during Climate Week NYC. Bringing together world leaders, businesses, policymakers and activists, the events will consider solutions to urgent climate challenges ahead of critical international summits.",
          "WHO experts will make it a priority to ensure that the health argument for climate action takes centre stage in global discussions. They will underscore how climate change is not only an environmental issue but also a pressing health crisis, directly affecting millions of people worldwide.",
          "Rising temperatures, poor air quality, and disrupted ecosystems are contributing to the spread of infectious diseases, respiratory illnesses, and malnutrition.",
          "During UNGA, WHO will engage in a number of events and discussions focusing on pandemic preparedness and response, even as Member States continue their negotiations for a new convention, agreement or international instrument or accord."

          "Around 560 000 children under ten years old were vaccinated against polio during the first round of an emergency vaccination campaign conducted in three phases from 1-12 September 2024 in the Gaza Strip.",
          "The 12-day campaign provided novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) to 558 963 children, following meticulous planning and coordination. This involved the use of an extensive network of teams, vaccinating at selected fixed sites at health facilities and outreach posts. Mobile and transit teams actively reached out to families living in shelter homes, tents, and camps for the displaced, alongside community workers engaging families to raise awareness ahead of and during the campaign. For each phase, an area-specific humanitarian pause of nine hours daily was agreed to ensure the safety of communities and health workers, and enable vaccination efforts.",
          "“Health and community workers have shown incredible resilience, carrying out this campaign at unprecedented scale and speed under the toughest conditions in Gaza. Swift action by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative—from the moment the virus was detected to the launch of the vaccination campaign—speaks to the effectiveness of the polio programme. In areas where humanitarian pauses took place, the campaign brought not just vaccines, but moments of calm. As we prepare for the next round in four weeks, we’re hopeful these pauses will hold, because this campaign has clearly shown the world what’s possible when peace is given a chance,” said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Representative for the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt).",
          "“It was critical this ambitious campaign was carried out quickly, safely and effectively to protect children in the Gaza Strip and neighbouring countries from the life-altering poliovirus,” said Jean Gough, UNICEF Special Representative in the State of Palestine. “The progress made in this first round is encouraging, but the job is far from done. We are poised to finish the task and call on all involved to ensure we can do so in the next round in four weeks' time, for the sake of children everywhere.”",
          "Partners at all levels recognize common operational challenges faced during these efforts, including devastated infrastructure, from health facilities to roads, limited trained healthcare workers, access issues due to insecurity, limited fuel for generators used to safely store vaccines and freeze ice packs, and constant population movements. However, these issues were addressed in a timely manner, with the key support of the Palestinian Ministry of Health and UNRWA, to enable planned vaccination activities.",
          "Despite these challenges and the conditions that families in the Gaza Strip have endured over the past 11 months, families flocked to health facilities to get their children vaccinated. This can be attributed to traditionally positive health seeking behaviour among the Palestinian people and an impactful campaign to raise awareness and mobilize the public.",
          "The original target for the campaign was 640 000 children, estimated in the absence of an accurate survey, which may have been an over-estimate, as the population continues to move from place to place, and people are fleeing and being killed due to the ongoing hostilities. During the campaign, trained monitoring teams were deployed to oversee vaccination efforts. As next steps, an additional 65 independent monitors are being deployed to cross-check the proportion of children vaccinated across the Gaza Strip to independently assess the level of coverage achieved in the first round. They need safe, unimpeded access so they can visit households, markets, transit points, and health facilities to check children for the prominent purple dye marked on their little finger when they are vaccinated. These efforts will provide an independent measure of the percentage of vaccination coverage achieved and reasons for any unvaccinated children.",
          "A second round of the campaign will follow, ideally within four weeks, to provide a second dose of nOPV2 to children in Gaza to stop the outbreak and prevent its international spread.",
          "To repeat this ambitious intervention, reach enough children, and successfully stop further transmission of the poliovirus, WHO, UNICEF and UNRWA are calling on all parties to the conflict to commit to  another round of humanitarian pauses, with unimpeded access to children in areas that need special coordination.",
          "Ultimately, we need a long-lasting ceasefire as all families in the Gaza Strip need peace so they can begin to heal and rebuild their lives."

          "The campaign was implemented as part of an urgent and robust response to the confirmation of circulating variant poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Gaza, which was found in the environment in July 2024, and in a 10-month-old child in August 2024. It was conducted by the Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and partners. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) members, donors, WHO Member States and partners in oPt, including as part of the Health Cluster, played a key role in facilitating the campaign.",
          "The campaign kicked off using 473 teams, including 230 mobile teams, and 143 vaccination sites, in central Gaza, followed by 91 fixed sites, complemented by 384 mobile teams in southern Gaza. It concluded in northern Gaza, reaching children through 127 teams at fixed sites and 104 mobile teams. Fixed sites comprised hospitals, medical points, primary health centres, temporary learning spaces, schools, and food and water distribution points. Additionally, 749 social mobilizers were trained and deployed to engage communities, before and during the campaign to nudge families to vaccinate their children and address concerns.",
          "Novel oral polio vaccine (nOPV2) is a polio vaccine being used to stop transmission of variant poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), currently the most prevalent form of the variant poliovirus. nOPV2 is safe and effective and offers protection against paralysis and community transmission. It is the vaccine globally recommended for variant type 2 poliovirus outbreaks – the type that has been found in Gaza."

          "Influenza is a viral disease. Seasonal influenza is common in all parts of the world. It is estimated that there are around a billion cases of seasonal influenza annually, including 3–5 million cases of severe respiratory illness. An estimated 290 000-650 000 deaths each year are due to seasonal influenza related respiratory disease, in addition to the deaths related to other influenza-related complications.",
          "Along with seasonal influenza viruses, animal influenza viruses – most commonly avian and swine influenza viruses – can occasionally infect humans. They can cause disease ranging from mild conjunctivitis to severe pneumonia and even death. Current animal influenza viruses have not shown the capacity to transmit from person to person, but do pose a pandemic threat for the future.",
          "These guidelines provide recommendations on the use of antiviral medications, and other treatments such as steroids for immune system regulation. This update applies to patients with seasonal influenza viruses, potential pandemic influenza viruses, and new influenza type A viruses that are known to cause severe illness in infected humans.",

          "In coordination with Member States, the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners have established an access and allocation mechanism for mpox medical countermeasures including vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests. The Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM) will increase access to these tools for people at highest risk and ensure that the limited supplies are used effectively and equitably.",
          "This is part of the response to the public health emergency of international concern declared by WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on 14 August 2024, following an upsurge of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries. Fifteen countries in Africa have reported mpox this year. Recommendations issued on the advice of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee asked States Parties to ensure \"equitable access to safe, eﬀective and quality-assured countermeasures for mpox.”",
          "“Alongside other public health interventions, vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics are powerful tools for bringing the mpox outbreaks in Africa under control,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated the need for international coordination to promote equitable access to these tools so they can be used most effectively where they are most needed. We urge countries with supplies of vaccines and other products to come forward with donations, to prevent infections, stop transmission and save lives.”",
          "The AAM was established as a part of the interim Medical Countermeasures Network (i-MCM-Net). The i-MCM-Net brings together partners from around the world, including UN and other international agencies, health organizations, civil society organizations, industry and private sector to build an effective ecosystem for the development, manufacturing, allocation and delivery of medical countermeasures. The network was endorsed by WHO Member States as a mechanism to operate in the interim, as negotiations continue towards a pandemic agreement.",
          "Along with WHO, the AAM for mpox includes members of the i-MCM-Net: the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, the EU’s Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority, FIND, Gavi, the PAHO Revolving Fund, UNICEF, Unitaid and others.",
          "Over 3.6 million doses of vaccines have been pledged for the mpox response.  This includes 620 000 doses of the MVA-BN vaccine pledged to affected countries by the European Commission, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Spain, and the United States of America, as well as vaccine manufacturer Bavarian Nordic. Japan has pledged 3 million doses of the LC16 vaccine, the largest number of doses pledged so far.",
          "The recent surge in mpox cases, coupled with the limited availability of vaccines and other medical countermeasures, underscores the need for a collaborative and transparent process to distribute these critical resources fairly. The AAM is working to allocate the currently scarce supplies of vaccines and diagnostics for those at the highest risk of infection, including for vaccinating contacts of confirmed cases, and providing access to point of care diagnostics to countries with ongoing mpox outbreaks so that people who might be suspected cases can systematically be tested and cared for.",

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the MVA-BN vaccine as the first vaccine against mpox to be added to its prequalification list.",
          "The prequalification approval is expected to facilitate timely and increased access to this vital product in communities with urgent need, to reduce transmission and help contain the outbreak. WHO’s assessment for prequalification is based on information submitted by the manufacturer, Bavarian Nordic A/S, and review by the European Medicines Agency, the regulatory agency of record for this vaccine.",
          "“This first prequalification of a vaccine against mpox is an important step in our fight against the disease, both in the context of the current outbreaks in Africa, and in future,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We now need urgent scale up in procurement, donations and rollout to ensure equitable access to vaccines where they are needed most, alongside other public health tools, to prevent infections, stop transmission and save lives.”",
          "The MVA-BN vaccine can be administered in people over 18-years of age as a 2-dose injection given 4 weeks apart. After prior cold storage, the vaccine can be kept at 2–8°C for up to 8 weeks.",
          "“The WHO prequalification of the MVA-BN vaccine will help accelerate ongoing procurement of the mpox vaccines by governments and international agencies such as Gavi and Unicef to help communities on the frontlines of the ongoing emergency in Africa and beyond,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. “The decision can also help national regulatory authorities to fast-track approvals, ultimately increasing access to quality-assured mpox vaccine products.”",
          "The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization reviewed all available evidence and recommended the use of MVA-BN vaccine in the context of an mpox outbreak for persons at high risk of exposure. While MVA-BN is currently not licensed for persons under 18 years of age, this vaccine may be used “off-label” in infants, children and adolescents, and in pregnant and immunocompromised people. This means vaccine use is recommended in outbreak settings where the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks.",
          "WHO also recommends single-dose use in supply-constrained outbreak situations. WHO emphasizes the need to collect further data on vaccine safety and effectiveness in these circumstances.",
          "Available data shows that a single-dose MVA-BN vaccine given before exposure has an estimated 76% effectiveness in protecting people against mpox, with the 2-dose schedule achieving an estimated 82% effectiveness. Vaccination after exposure is less effective than pre-exposure vaccination.",
          "Good safety profile and vaccine performance has been consistently demonstrated in clinical studies, as well as in real-world use during the ongoing global outbreak since 2022. In light of the changing epidemiology and emergence of new virus strains, it remains important to collect as much data as possible on vaccine safety and effectiveness in different contexts.",
          "Since the triggering of the emergency use listing for mpox vaccines by WHO Director-General on 7 August 2024, WHO has conducted product and programmatic suitability assessments of MVA-BN vaccine.",
          "“The findings of the assessments are particularly relevant in the context of the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) related to the upsurge of mpox in Africa,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, WHO Director for Regulation and Prequalification. “We are progressing with prequalification and emergency use listing procedures with manufacturers of two other mpox vaccines: LC-16 and ACAM2000. We have also received 6 expressions of interest for mpox diagnostic products for emergency use listing so far.”",
          "The escalating mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries was declared a PHEIC by the WHO Director-General on 14 August 2024.",
          "Over 120 countries have confirmed more than 103 000 cases of mpox since the onset of the global outbreak in 2022. In 2024 alone, there were 25 237 suspected and confirmed cases and 723 deaths from different outbreaks in 14 countries of the African Region (based on data from 8 September 2024)."

          "At least one quarter or 22 500 of those injured in Gaza by 23 July are estimated to have life-changing injuries that require rehabilitation services  now and for years to come, according to a  World Health Organization (WHO) analysis of the types of injuries resulting from the ongoing conflict in Gaza: Estimating Trauma Rehabilitation Needs in Gaza using Injury Data from Emergency Medical Teams .",
          "The analysis found that severe limb injuries, estimated to be between 13 455 to 17 550, are the main driver of the need for rehabilitation. Many of those injured have more than one injury. According to the report, between 3105 and 4050 limb amputations have also occurred. Large surges in spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury and major burn injuries all contribute to the overall number of life-changing injuries, which includes many thousands of women and children.",
          "“The huge surge in rehabilitation needs occurs in parallel with the ongoing decimation of the health system,” said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Representative in the occupied Palestinian territory. “Patients can’t get the care they need. Acute rehabilitation services are severely disrupted and specialized care for complex injuries is not available, placing patients' lives at risk. Immediate and long-term support is urgently needed to address the enormous rehabilitation needs.”",
          "Currently, only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional in Gaza, while primary health care and community-level services are frequently suspended or rendered inaccessible due to insecurity, attacks, and repeated evacuation orders. Gaza’s only limb reconstruction and rehabilitation center, located in Nasser Medical Complex and supported by WHO, became non-functional in December 2023 due to lack of supplies and specialized health workers being forced to leave in search of safety, and was later left damaged following a raid in February 2024. Tragically, much of the rehabilitation workforce in Gaza is now displaced. Reports indicate 39 physiotherapists have been killed as of 10 May. In-patient rehabilitation and prosthetic services are no longer available and the number of people with injuries requiring assistive products far exceeds the equipment available within Gaza. Partners report that stocks of essential assistive products such as wheelchairs and crutches have run out and it is difficult to replenish supplies due to the restricted flow of aid into Gaza.",
          "The analysis focuses solely on new injuries sustained since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023. However, tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza were already living with pre-existing chronic conditions and impairments before this, putting them at significant risk due to the lack of appropriate services.",
          "The estimates in the analysis will be used by WHO and partners to plan for a surge in rehabilitation-related services and contribute to long-term health planning and policymaking.",
          "Amidst the ongoing hostilities, it is critical to ensure access to all essential health services, including rehabilitation to prevent illness and death. WHO reiterates its call for a ceasefire, which is critical for rebuilding the health system to cope with escalating needs."

          "WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Regional Director Dr Hanan Balkhy yesterday concluded a two-day mission to Port Sudan, where they reaffirmed WHO's commitment to reaching all Sudanese in need and called on the international community to urgently act to end the extreme health and humanitarian crisis. During their visit, Dr Tedros and Dr Balkhy met with Sudanese leaders, including Lt. Gen. Abdul Fatah Al-Burhan, Chairman of Sudan’s Transitional Sovereignty Council; Deputy Chairman of Sudan’s Sovereignty Council Dr Malik Agar; and Federal Minister of Health Dr Haitham Mohamed Ibrahim Awadallah. The discussions centered on the devastating impact of the ongoing conflict and the critical need for unhindered humanitarian access to ensure that life-saving aid reaches all those in need, regardless of their location. “The international community has seemingly forgotten about Sudan and is paying little heed to the conflict tearing it apart, with serious repercussions for the region,” Dr Tedros said during a press conference held today in Port Sudan. “That is why I have come to Sudan. I am here, with my sister Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Director, to meet with the wide range of partners involved in the response, and to call for urgent and scaled up action to provide more resources, more access to humanitarian aid, and more security to health workers and the patients they serve.” He added: “We are calling on the world to wake up and help Sudan out of the nightmare it is living through. ... We must not fail the people of Sudan.” Much of Sudan’s health system has been devastated by the conflict, with more than 100 attacks on healthcare facilities in the over 500 days of conflict leading to significant casualties among health workers and patients. The insecurity has forced many health workers to flee with their families, worsening the shortage of medical staff. This exodus has further weakened the health system's ability to provide essential services, leaving many Sudanese without access to critical care. The high-level WHO mission included a visit to a nutrition stabilization center supported by WHO, where Dr Tedros and Dr Balkhy saw firsthand the impact of the malnutrition crisis gripping Sudan. Currently, 3.6 million children are acutely malnourished, with 730 000 suffering from severe acute malnutrition. The ongoing conflict has exacerbated food insecurity, making it increasingly difficult to deliver essential nutrition and health services to vulnerable populations. At an internally displaced persons camp, Dr Tedros and Dr Balkhy saw the difficult living conditions the people face. The camp's residents are struggling with a lack of food, medicine, and clean water, exposing them to heightened risk of disease outbreaks and other health threats. The daily risks include threat of gender-based violence, particularly against the estimated four million women and girls at risk due to the ongoing conflict. Dr Balkhy emphasized the critical need to respect the sanctity of healthcare, in line with international humanitarian law. \"Sudan’s health infrastructure is in ruins, with many facilities destroyed, looted, or abandoned. To rebuild and stabilize the health system, there must be significant investment not only in restoring facilities but also in strengthening the health workforce,\" Dr Balkhy said. She linked this to the broader economic aspect, noting that without a functioning health system, the economic recovery and future stability of Sudan are at risk. Following the mission, Dr Tedros and Dr Balkhy underscored the need for concerted international action – both to advance peace and provide the necessary short- and long-term aid. \"Our priority is to ensure that every Sudanese in need receives the assistance they require, wherever they are in the country. This will only be possible through sustained peace, substantial investment in health infrastructure, and full, unimpeded access for humanitarian efforts across Sudan by whatever means needed, including both cross-line and cross-border from neighbouring countries. “The only way forward is peace, for which the warring parties themselves have the greatest responsibility, with support from the international community. The world must not look away—this crisis demands our immediate and collective response.\" The conflict has left some 25 million people — more than half of the country’s population — in dire need of humanitarian aid. Of these, 14.7 million require urgent assistance for a range of life-saving support, for which the humanitarian sector has requested US$ 2.7 billion, which is less than half of the funding required. WHO’s current funding gap for the Sudan health crisis is concerning, with only 24% received out of the total WHO ask, severely limiting the ability to address the crisis. The high-level visit also included the inauguration of the new premises of WHO’s office in Port Sudan, expanding WHO’s ability to reach people affected by the crisis."

Vaccination coverage in this phase exceeded the initial estimated target of 157 000 children due to population movement towards central Gaza, and expanded coverage in areas outside the humanitarian pause zone.",
          "To ensure no child is missed in this area, polio vaccination will continue at four large health facilities in central Gaza over the next few days. Vaccine doses have been supplied to these sites to meet any additional needs.",
          "“It has been extremely encouraging to see thousands of children being able to access polio vaccines, with the support of their resilient families and courageous health workers, despite the deplorable conditions they have braved over the last 11 months. All parties respected the humanitarian pause and we hope to see this positive momentum continue,” said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Representative for the occupied Palestinian territory.",
          "The first phase of the campaign was conducted by 513 teams, consisting of over 2180 health and community outreach workers. Vaccination was provided at 143 fixed sites, including hospitals, medical points, primary care centres, camps where displaced people are living, key public gathering spaces such as temporary learning spaces, food and water distribution points, and transit routes leading from central towards northern and southern Gaza. Additionally, mobile teams visited tents and hard to-reach areas to ensure they reached families who were unable to visit fixed sites. The presence of a substantial number of children eligible for vaccination who were unable to reach vaccination sites due to insecurity, necessitated special missions to Al-Maghazi, Al-Bureij and Al-Mussader – areas just outside of the agreed zone for the humanitarian pause.",
          "Preparations are underway to roll out the next phase of the campaign, which will be conducted in southern Gaza from 5–8 September 2024, targeting an estimated 340 000 children below ten years of age. Some 517 teams, including 384 mobile teams, will be deployed. Nearly 300 community outreach workers have already begun outreach to families in southern Gaza to raise awareness about the campaign, while 490 vaccine carriers, 90 cold storage boxes, and other supplies have been transferred to Khan Younis for distribution to vaccination sites.",
          "The third and last phase of the polio vaccination campaign will be implemented in northern Gaza from 9–11 September 2024, targeting around 150 000 children.",
          "At least 90% vaccination coverage during each round of the campaign is needed to stop the outbreak, prevent the international spread of polio and reduce the risk of its re-emergence, given the severely disrupted health, water and sanitation systems in the Gaza Strip. Vaccination coverage will be monitored throughout the campaign, and, when necessary, vaccinations will be extended to meet coverage targets as part of flexible strategies to ensure every eligible child receives their vaccine dose.",
          "The two-round campaign, being conducted by the Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and many partners, aims to provide two drops of nOPV2 to around 640 000 children during each round.",
          "\"The successful delivery of the first phase of the campaign in central Gaza is a culmination of immense coordination among various partners, including the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and donors, and underscores the importance of peace for the health and well-being of people in Gaza.

          "With the support of the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), the World Health Organization (WHO) has published a global framework to help Member States comprehensively investigate the origins of new and re-emerging pathogens. While there are a number of tools available for investigating infectious disease outbreaks, this is the first unified, structured approach to investigating the origins of a novel pathogen. This framework aims to fill that gap by providing a comprehensive set of scientific investigations and studies. It is the first version of a “how-to” guide that will be updated as and when needed, based on feedback from users.",
          "As each outbreak and pandemic demonstrates, human and animal health is threatened by the increasing risk of the emergence of known (such as Ebola, Nipah, avian influenza, Lassa and Monkeypox viruses) and novel pathogens with epidemic and pandemic potential (novel influenza, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2), the ability to prevent, and when we cannot prevent, to swiftly contain outbreaks and identify their origins is scientifically, morally, and financially more critical than ever.",

            "text": "The WHO global framework outlines scientific investigations and studies for six technical elements:",
            "bullets": [
              "Early investigations of the first identified cases/ clusters / outbreaks to identify potential sources of exposure, collection of samples at the source, define the characteristics of the novel pathogen involved for establishment of diagnostic assays.",
              "Human studies : to understand the epidemiology including clinical presentation, modes of transmission, pathology and earliest presence in syndromic surveillance samples.",
              "Human/Animal interface studies to identify potential animal reservoirs, intermediate hosts and reverse zoonoses.",
              "studies to identify insect vectors or other sources of infection as well as earliest presence in the environment.  …",
              "Genomics and Phylogenetics studies to identify precursor strains, genomic characteristics, evolution in intermediate hosts and humans and spatial distribution over time.",
              "Biosafety/Biosecurity studies to determine if a breach in laboratory or research activities may have been associated with the first cases."
            ]
          },
          "The WHO Global framework has been designed as a resource for scientists, researchers, public health authorities, and investigators in Member States. It provides guidance when and how to initiate such multi-disciplinary investigations and offers recommendations to countries on the capacities and tools needed to successfully implement them.  This includes the capacities needed such as human resources, human, animal, and environmental surveillance systems; biosafety and biosecurity regulations; and laboratories with testing and sequencing expertise – and the importance of sharing the findings of such investigations as soon as possible to guide next steps. These recommendations were developed to align with the International Health Regulations (IHR) and using a One Health approach.",
          "Timely and comprehensive investigations into pathogens’ origins are critical for preventing and containing global health crises. The findings from such investigations provide the basis for stopping outbreaks before they begin, halting transmission chains and reducing the risk of pathogen spillover from animals to humans.  They also can confirm or exclude the possibility of an unintentional breach in laboratory biosafety and biosecurity.",
          "To achieve this, is it critical for countries to conduct these are sharing initial findings in a rapid, complete and transparent manner as soon as results are available to ensure the implementation of measures to mitigate further transmission and prevent new spillover events and, eventually, future pandemics.",
          "“Understanding when, where, how and why epidemics and pandemics begin is both a scientific imperative, to prevent future outbreaks, and a moral imperative for the sake of those who lose their lives to them,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This framework provides for the first time comprehensive guidance on the studies that are needed to investigate the origins of emerging and reemerging pathogens. If it had been in place when COVID-19 struck, the quest to understand its origins may have been less contentious and more successful. WHO continues to call on China to share all information it has on the origins of COVID-19, so that all hypotheses can be investigated.”",
          "Established in November 2021 and made up of independent experts from around the world, the SAGO was tasked with identifying the best technical and scientific approaches to understanding the origins of emerging and re-emerging pathogens and developing this global framework. The SAGO forms part of a strengthened health emergency preparedness and prevention system developed by WHO, its Member States and many health and scientific partners."

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) has published global cholera statistics for 2023 , showing an increase in cases and deaths.",
          "The number of reported cholera cases increased by 13% and deaths by 71% in 2023 compared to 2022. Over 4000 people died last year from a disease that is preventable and easily treatable.",
          "Forty-five countries reported cases, an increase from 44 the previous year and 35 in 2021. Thirty-eight per cent of the reported cases were among children under five years of age.",
          "Cholera is an acute intestinal infection spread through contaminated food and water. Communities with limited access to sanitation are most affected.",
          "Conflict, climate change, inadequate safe water and sanitation, poverty, underdevelopment, and population displacement due to emerging and re-emerging conflicts and disasters from natural hazards all contributed to the rise in cholera outbreaks last year.",
          "The geographical distribution of cholera changed significantly from 2022 to 2023, with a 32% decrease in cases reported from the Middle East and Asia, and a 125% increase in Africa. Many countries in Africa reported a high proportion of community deaths, indicating gaps in access to treatment.",
          "This is the first year that multiple countries have reported deaths from cholera which occurred outside of health facilities, known as ‘community deaths’. In five out of 13 reporting countries, over a third of cholera deaths occurred in the community, highlighting serious gaps in access to treatment and the need to strengthen this area of response.",
          "Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi and Somalia continued to report large outbreaks of over 10 000 suspected or confirmed cases, with Ethiopia, Haiti, Mozambique and Zimbabwe adding to the tally in 2023.",
          "Preliminary data show that the global cholera crisis continues into 2024, with 22 countries currently reporting active outbreaks. Although the number of cases reported so far in 2024 is lower compared to the same period last year, 342 800 cases and 2400 deaths have already been reported to WHO across all continents as of 22 August.",
          "The increased demand for cholera materials such as oral cholera vaccines (OCV), diagnostic tests and essential medications like oral rehydration salts and intravenous fluids for rehydration persists into 2023, posing a challenge for disease control efforts globally. Since October 2022, the International Coordinating Group (ICG), which manages emergency vaccine supplies, has suspended the standard two-dose vaccination regimen in cholera outbreak response campaigns, adopting a single-dose approach instead in order to reach and protect more people given limited supplies.",
          "Despite the low stockpile of OCV, a record 35 million doses were shipped last year, with the one-dose strategy in effect. While vaccination is an important tool, safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene remain the only long-term and sustainable solutions to ending cholera outbreaks and preventing future ones.",
          "WHO considers the current global risk from cholera as very high and is responding with urgency to reduce deaths and contain outbreaks in countries around the world. WHO continues to support countries through strengthened public health surveillance, case management, and prevention measures; provision of essential medical supplies; coordination of field deployments with partners; and support for risk communication and community engagement.",
          "US$ 18 million has been released from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies for cholera response since 2022. WHO has appealed for US$ 50 million to respond to cholera outbreaks in 2024, but this need remains unmet."

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) has published its first-ever guidance on antibiotic pollution from manufacturing . The new guidance on wastewater and solid waste management for antibiotic manufacturing sheds light on this important but neglected challenge ahead of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) High-Level Meeting on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) taking place on 26 September 2024.",
          "The emergence and spread of AMR caused by antibiotic pollution could undermine the effectiveness of antibiotics globally, including the medicines produced at the manufacturing sites responsible for the pollution.",
          "Despite high antibiotic pollution levels being widely documented, the issue is largely unregulated and quality assurance criteria typically do not address environmental emissions. In addition, once distributed, there is a lack of information provided to consumers on how to dispose of antibiotics when they are not used, for example, when they expire or when a course is finished but there is still antibiotic left over.",
          "“Pharmaceutical waste from antibiotic manufacturing can facilitate the emergence of new drug-resistant bacteria, which can spread globally and threaten our health. Controlling pollution from antibiotic production contributes to keeping these life-saving medicines effective for everyone,\" said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for AMR ad interim .",
          "Globally, there is a lack of accessible information on the environmental damage caused by manufacturing of medicines. “The guidance provides an independent and impartial scientific basis for regulators, procurers, inspectors, and industry themselves to include robust antibiotic pollution control in their standards,” said Dr Maria Neira, Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health, WHO. “Critically, the strong focus on transparency will equip buyers, investors and the general public to make decisions that account for manufacturers’ efforts to control antibiotic pollution.”",
          "A range of international bodies have called for this guidance, including the WHO Executive Board , the G7 health ministers and UNEP . “The role of the environment in the development, transmission and spread of antimicrobial resistance needs careful consideration since evidence is mounting. There is a widespread agreement that action on the environment must become more prominent as a solution. This includes pollution prevention and control from municipal systems, manufacturing sites, healthcare facilities and agri-food systems,” said Jacqueline Alvarez, Chief of Branch for the Industry and Economy Division at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).",
          "The guidance was developed in close collaboration with a diverse group of international experts representing academia, regulators, inspectors, international organizations such as UNEP, and other sectors. The draft also underwent public consultation, receiving valuable input from industry and other stakeholders. Industry has also taken up this challenge, though a voluntary industry-led initiative which can be updated in some areas to align with the new guidance.",
          "The guidance provides human health-based targets to reduce the risk of emergence and spread of AMR, as well as targets to address risks for aquatic life caused by all antibiotics intended for human, animal or plant use. It covers all steps from the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and formulation into finished products, including primary packaging.",
          "AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites no longer respond to medicines, making people sicker and increasing the risk of spread of infections that are difficult to treat, illness and deaths. AMR is driven largely by the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials, yet, at the same time, many people around the world do not have access to essential antimicrobial medicines."

          "WHO has asked manufacturers of mpox in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) to submit an expression of interest for Emergency Use Listing (EUL) . WHO has been in ongoing discussions with manufacturers about the need for effective diagnostics, particularly in low-income settings. The request for EUL expressions of interest by manufacturers is the latest development in these discussions.",
          "Testing is key for people to get treatment and care as early as possible and prevent further spread. Since 2022, WHO has delivered around 150 000 diagnostic tests for mpox globally, of which over a quarter have gone to countries in the African Region. In the coming weeks, WHO will deliver another 30 000 tests to African countries.",
          "With as many as 1000 suspected cases reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo alone this week, the demand for diagnostic tests is on the rise. In this heavily affected country, WHO has worked with partners to scale up diagnostic capacity to respond to the upsurge of cases. Since May 2024, six additional labs have been equipped to diagnose mpox, enabling a decentralization of testing capacity from major cities to affected provinces. Two of these labs are in South Kivu, selected to respond to the outbreak of the new viral strain, called Ib. Thanks to these efforts, testing rates have dramatically improved in the country, with four times as many samples tested in 2024 so far as compared to 2023.",
          "WHO has also updated its diagnostic testing guidance to detect the new virus strain and is working with countries to roll it out. Earlier, WHO issued target product profiles to guide manufacturers in the development of new diagnostic tests.",
          "WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared on 14 August 2024 that the upsurge of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and in a growing number of countries in Africa constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations (2005).",
          "Manufacturers of IVDs are now asked to submit available quality, safety and performance data to WHO as soon as they can. IVDs are tests done in laboratories to detect a pathogen. Detection of viral DNA by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) testing is the gold standard for mpox diagnosis. It detects the virus's DNA in samples taken from skin lesions, such as fluid or crusts from vesicles or pustules. Testing of blood is not recommended for routine diagnosis and antibody detection methods may be used for retrospective case classification but not for diagnosis.",
          "Through the EUL procedure, WHO can approve medical products such as vaccines, tests and treatments for use, evaluating the acceptability of using specific products for time-limited procurement in emergency situations. The process aims to assist countries, which have not approved the medical products through national approval processes, to procure the critically needed products such as tests through UN agencies and other partners.",
          "Mpox is an illness caused by the monkeypox virus, a species of the genus Orthopoxvirus , that can be transmitted to humans through contacts with someone who is infectious, with contaminated materials, or with infected animals.",
          "Expanding access to diagnostic services is urgently needed as tests are essential to critical measures such as strengthened laboratory capacity, improved case investigation, contact tracing, surveillance data collection, and timely reporting. As a package, these help countries identify chains of transmission, detect cases early, prevent further spread, and monitor the virus in real-time. The establishment of Emergency Use Listing procedures for mpox diagnostic tests will help advance towards this goal."

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) and International Paralympic Committee (IPC) are joining forces to highlight the transformative impact of assistive technology on sports during the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games. The \"Equipped for equity\" campaign emphasizes the crucial role of assistive technology for Paralympic athletes to advocate for concerted global action to improve access to these essential health products.",
          "Throughout the Games, WHO and IPC will leverage the Paralympics platform to share messages and information focused on the importance of assistive technology, how athletes use it, and why universal access is essential. Examples of assistive technology used by Paralympians include: running blades, wheelchairs, and release braces in archery.",
          "The “Equipped for equity” campaign will also feature personal stories from athletes who rely on assistive technology for sport and in daily life and highlight national successes in advancing access to these critical health products.",
          "“The Paralympics show us what is possible, and the important role that assistive technology plays for these extraordinary athletes,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “But around the world, many people still do not have access to crucial assistive technology, due to its high cost and low availability. We call on governments, donors, and civil society to prioritise these neglected but critical products, by integrating them in primary care programmes as part of their journey towards universal health coverage.”",
          "Andrew Parsons, President, IPC noted, “The Paralympic Games are one of the only global events that put persons with disabilities front and centre, and in many events highlight how assistive technology can support athletes to compete at the highest level. These technologies allow them to redefine what is possible in sports and inspire millions around the world.”",
          "“While we get ready to celebrate incredible athletic success, it is critical to remember that access to assistive technology remains a significant concern. We must advocate for more affordable and accessible solutions globally, ensuring that everyone, regardless of where they live, has the opportunity to lead a full life and contribute to society.”",
          "WHO estimates that access to assistive technology remains severely limited in many parts of the world, with more than 2.5 billion people in need of assistive technology across the world. For instance, only 5-35% of the 80 million people who need a wheelchair have access to one, depending on where they live, and only 10% of the global demand for hearing aids is currently met. Without access to assistive technology, persons with disabilities are denied the right to participate in all aspects of life, and are also more at risk of exclusion, isolation and poverty.",
          "The \"Equipped for equity\" campaign will showcase examples like Zimbabwe’s recent tax exemption on assistive technology and the pre-Paralympic tax reductions on assistive technology for sports in France and Japan. By highlighting these initiatives, the campaign calls on countries to implement similar initiatives and integrate assistive technology into primary health care and universal health coverage.",
          "Measures to make assistive technology more accessible and affordable are essential not only for empowering individuals to participate fully in life but also for driving broader societal and economic development. Expanding access to quality-assured, safe, and affordable assistive technology reduces health and welfare costs such as recurrent hospital admissions, and promotes a more productive labour force, indirectly stimulating economic growth.",
          "WHO is also supporting the IPC and the Government of France to ensure a healthy and safe environment for all athletes and spectators at the Paris 2024 Paralympics. Joint public health advice, developed with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, has been provided to support travellers attending the Games."

          "In an unprecedented show of unity in support of the World Health Organization, 14 African countries and many partners pledged over US$ 45 million to the WHO Investment Round, a three-month-old initiative aimed at generating sustainable financing for the organization at the center of the global health architecture. The commitments were made during the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Committee for Africa, with heads of state and government from across the continent underscoring the importance of investing in global health and ensuring a strong WHO.",
          "“I thank our African Region Member States for actively supporting WHO’s first Investment Round to mobilize predictable and flexible resources needed for our core work over the next four years,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Full, sustainable funding will enable WHO to support countries better in their work to build healthier, more resilient, and more prosperous populations.”",
          "The countries and partners came together for the historic event aimed at sustainably funding WHO and thus enabling it to more effectively fulfil its mandate and advance key objectives to promote, provide and protect health and well-being for all. The countries included Botswana, Cabo Verde, Chad, Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Mauritius, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, South Africa, and the United Republic of Tanzania.",
          "Many partners joined Members States in making commitments of support to WHO and committing to providing pledges later in the year, including Helmsley Charitable Trust, World Diabetes Foundation, Roche, Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, African Development Bank and the WHO Foundation.",
          "“A strong, predictable and sustainably financed WHO is essential for our region and the world to meet the multiple health threats we face; and support the prevention of disease based on the vast evidence at our disposal,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Every pledge and every partnership counts. Together, we can achieve a future where health and well-being are accessible to all.”",
          "The WHO Investment Round will continue in the coming months and feature key pledging moments around the world. Learn more about the WHO Investment Round .",
          "Launched at the World Health Assembly in May 2024, the Investment Round aims to generate contributions that are flexible and thereby aligned with WHO’s strategy as approved by its Member States; predictably provided at the start of the four-year budget cycle to enable strategic decision-making; and resilient in that they will derive from a larger, more diverse set of donors."

This includes engagement with the ACT-Accelerator Principals group; the Standing Committee on Health Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response; the R&D Blueprint for Epidemics; and the interim Medical Counter Measures Network (i-MCM Net).",
          "The WHO R&D Blueprint, along with Africa CDC, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will host a virtual scientific conference on 29-30 August 2024 to align mpox research with outbreak control goals.",
          "“The mpox outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries can be controlled, and can be stopped,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Doing so requires a comprehensive and coordinated plan of action between international agencies and national and local partners, civil society, researchers and manufacturers, and our Member States. This SPRP provides that plan, based on the principles of equity, global solidarity, community empowerment, human rights, and coordination across sectors.”",
          "WHO headquarters and regional offices have established incident management support teams to lead preparedness, readiness and response activities, and are significantly scaling up staff in affected countries.",
          "Within the Africa Region, where need is greatest, the WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) in collaboration with Africa CDC, will jointly spearhead the coordination of mpox response efforts. WHO AFRO and Africa CDC have agreed on a one-plan, one-budget approach as part of the Africa Continental Mpox Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, currently under preparation.",

          "The WHO Secretariat presented an overview of the global epidemiological situation of mpox, highlighting that, during the first six months of 2024, the 1854 confirmed cases of mpox reported by States Parties in the WHO African Region account for 36% (1854/5199) of the cases observed worldwide. Of these confirmed cases in the WHO African region in 2024, 95% (1754/1854) were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), that is experiencing an upsurge of cases of mpox, with more than 15,000 clinically compatible cases and over 500 deaths reported, already exceeding the number of cases observed in the DRC in 2023.",
          "The upsurge of mpox cases in the DRC is being driven by outbreaks associated with two sub-clades of clade I monkeypox virus (MPXV) – clade Ia and clade Ib. Clade I mpox was classically described in studies conducted by WHO in the 1980’s to have a mortality rate of approximately 10%, with most deaths occurring in children.",
          "MPXV clade Ia is endemic in the DRC, the disease primarily affects children, data available for 2024 show an aggregated case fatality rate of 3.6%, and the spread is likely sustained through multiple modes of transmission including person-to-person transmission following zoonotic introduction in a community.",
          "MPXV clade Ib is a new strain of MPXV that emerged in the DRC  is transmitting between people, presumed via sexual contact, which has been spreading in the eastern part of the country. Although first characterized in 2024, estimates suggest it emerged around September 2023. The outbreak associated with clade Ib in the DRC primarily affects adults and is spreading rapidly, sustained largely, but not exclusively, through transmission linked to sexual contact and amplified in networks associated with commercial sex and sex workers.",
          "Since July 2024, cases of mpox due to MPXV clade Ib, epidemiologically and phylogenetically linked to the outbreak in the eastern provinces of DRC, have been detected in four countries, neighbouring the DRC, which had not reported cases of mpox before: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.",
          "Additionally, in 2024, cases of mpox linked to MPXV clade Ia have been reported in the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo, and cases linked to MPXV clade II have been reported in Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria and South Africa.",
          "The clinical presentation of mpox associated with MPXV clade Ia has historically been characterized by more severe disease than that associated with MPXV clade II. Clade IIb viruses circulated during the multi-country outbreak that constituted a PHEIC from July 2022 to May 2023. There is, as yet, insufficient information available to fully characterize mpox severity due to clade Ib as data are emerging and, so far, few deaths were recorded, precluding age-stratified analyses.",
          "The secretariat outlined challenges in understanding the true extent of infection, epidemiologic trends and morbidity and mortality, thus cautioning overinterpretation of available data to calculate crude CFRs by different clades/outbreaks.",
          "The assessed risk presented by the WHO Secretariat – grouping geographical areas as a result of the assessment of population groups affected, predominant modes of transmission, and MPXV clades involved –, was: “high” for eastern DRC and neighbouring countries; “high” for areas of the DRC where mpox is known to be endemic; “moderate” for Nigeria and countries of West, Central and East Africa where mpox is endemic; and “moderate” for other countries in Africa and around the world.",
          "The WHO Secretariat additionally provided an overview of the actions already taken to support readiness and response interventions in States Parties experiencing the upsurge of cases of mpox and facing such risk. These include, inter alia: the release of USD 1.45 million from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies; initiating the process for including Emergency Use Listing two mpox vaccines; coordinating with partners and stakeholders, including to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; the development of a regional response plan, costed at an initial USD 15 million, and more.",
          "Representatives of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda updated the Committee on the mpox epidemiological situation in their countries and the current response efforts, needs and challenges. Although most reported few cases of MPXV clade Ib related mpox, Burundi reported one hundred confirmed cases of mpox associated with clade Ib since July 2024, identified in multiple districts and 28% of cases were amongst children less than five years of age.",

          "Following the session open to invited States Parties, the Committee reconvened in a closed session to examine the questions in relation to whether the event constitutes a PHEIC or not, and if so, to consider the temporary recommendations drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.",
          "The Chair reminded the Committee Members of their mandate and recalled that a PHEIC is defined in the IHR as an “extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated international response” .",
          "The Committee was unanimous in expressing the views that the ongoing upsurge of mpox meets the criteria of a PHEIC and that the Director-General be advised accordingly.",
          "The considerations underpinning the unanimous views of the Committee further elaborated upon issues and challenges addressed during the question and answers session.",
          "The Committee considered the event as “extraordinary” because of (a) the increase in mpox clade I disease occurrence in the DRC and the emergence of the new MPXV clade Ib, the human-to-human transmission context in which it is occurring, its rapid spread in some settings, and available evidence suggesting that MPXV clade I is associated with a more severe clinical presentation with respect to MPXV clade II; (b) the diverse, complex, dynamic, and rapidly evolving epidemiology observed across States Parties in the WHO African Region in terms of: overall rapid increase of the number of cases reported in some settings, differences in population age-groups affected, routes and modes sustaining transmissions in different contexts; and (c) the severity of the clinical presentation in children and immunocompromised individuals, including people living with uncontrolled HIV infection or advanced HIV disease, as well as the long-term consequences of MPXV infection.",
          "Additionally, the Committee strongly underscored that its level of concern is further heightened by (a) uncertainties and gaps in knowledge and evidence related to (i) multiple epidemiological aspects, including drivers of transmission, morbidity and mortality associated with infections with different MPXV sub-clades; (ii) the incompleteness and uncertainties of available epidemiological data and considered by the Committee, due to the limitations of current surveillance (e.g., sub-optimal levels of case detection and case reporting), the availability and performance of laboratory diagnostics, and ongoing conflicts and humanitarian challenges in certain areas of the DRC experiencing the upsurge of mpox, that, ultimately, hamper the implementation of control measures; (iii) the impact of control measures, including the targeted use of vaccines and their overall effectiveness; and (b) the risk of occurrence of additional mutations of MPXV clade I and clade II, and their subsequent emergence and spread in the context of limited capacity to implement control measures.",
          "The Committee considered that the event “ constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” because of (a) the documented recent spread of MPXV clade Ib from eastern DRC to Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda; (b) the limited capacity to control transmission in endemic situations and in areas of upsurge through enhanced surveillance enabling the implementation of targeted response interventions that are ultimately subordinated to (i) the unavailability of sustainable funding, and (ii) the limited ability to access vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; and (c) the challenges in implementing concerted surveillance and response interventions in contiguous areas of bordering States Parties, in particular where borders are porous.",
          "The Committee considered that the event “requires a coordinated international response” . The Committee noted that (a) mpox is endemic in parts of Africa, with surges increasingly reported, and also resulting in a multi-country outbreak determined to constitute a PHEIC in 2022-2023; and (b) the event is occurring in the context of standing recommendations issued by the Director-General in August 2023 under IHR provisions and following the termination of the afore mentioned PHEIC; the presence of the “WHO Strategic framework for enhancing prevention and control of mpox- 2024-2027”; and the activation for mpox of the i-MCM-Net. In that light and noting the declaration of the event as a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security by the Africa CDC on 13 August 2024, the Committee considered that international cooperation requires enhanced and coordination, in particular with respect to (a) the facilitation of equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; and (b) the mobilization of financial resources.",
          "The Committee subsequently considered the draft of the temporary recommendations proposed by the WHO Secretariat , briefly presented during the meeting. The Committee indicated that it would be giving further consideration to the proposed temporary recommendations while finalizing the report of the meeting.",
          "The Committee noted that, in his opening remarks, the Director-General communicated the 12-month extension of the current standing recommendations for mpox , which were set to expire on 20 August 2024. The Committee also noted that, should the Director-General determine that the upsurge of mpox constitutes a PHEIC, it would be the first time, since the entry into force of the Regulations, that temporary and standing recommendations to States Parties related to the same public health risk would coexist.",
          "Therefore, the Committee underscored that any temporary recommendation that may be issued by the Director-General should be very specific and targeted, and hence, not duplicate the standing recommendations.",
          "Notwithstanding that both, temporary and standing recommendations constitute non-binding advice to States Parties, the Committee advised that mechanisms to monitor the uptake, implementation and impact of such recommendations should be embedded in the set of temporary recommendations to States Parties that the Director-General may issue in relation to the event considered."

          "The Committee recognized the critical role of coordinated international cooperation in supporting States Parties’ efforts to control the spread of mpox in the WHO African Region – including in facilitating access to and use of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; mobilizing financial resources for States Parties experiencing the upsurge of disease; and synergic initiatives by WHO and partners, including Africa CDC.",
          "Nevertheless, the Committee indicated that the development of strategic approaches for States Parties to become more self-reliant in controlling the spread of mpox are warranted. To that effect, the Committee considers that the determination by the Director-General that the upsurge of mpox constitutes a PHEIC would stimulate States Parties facing the outbreaks to more effectively commit and employ domestic resources."

          "WHO and UNICEF request all parties to the conflict to implement humanitarian pauses in the Gaza Strip for seven days to allow for two rounds of vaccination campaigns to take place. These pauses in fighting would allow children and families to safely reach health facilities and community outreach workers to get to children who cannot access health facilities for polio vaccination. Without the humanitarian pauses, the delivery of the campaign will not be possible.",
          "During each round of the campaign, the Palestinian Ministry of Health (MoH), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and partners, will provide two drops of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) to more than 640 000 children under ten years of age.",
          "The poliovirus was detected in July 2024 in environmental samples from Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. Worryingly, three children presenting with suspected acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), a common symptom of polio, have since been reported in the Gaza Strip. Their stool samples have been sent for testing to the Jordan National Polio Laboratory.",
          "Over 1.6 million doses of nOPV2, which is used to stop cVDPV2 transmission, will be delivered to the Gaza Strip. The deliveries of the vaccines and the cold chain equipment are expected to transit through Ben Gurion Airport before arriving in the Gaza Strip by the end of August. It is essential that the transport of the vaccines and cold chain is facilitated at every step of the journey to ensure their timely reception, clearance and ultimately delivery in time for the campaign.",
          "Detailed plans to support vaccinators and social mobilizers to reach eligible children across the Gaza Strip have been finalized. Vaccination will be administered by 708 teams, including at hospitals, field hospitals, and primary health care centres in each municipality of the Gaza Strip. Around 2700 health workers, including mobile teams and community outreach workers, will support the delivery of both rounds of the campaign. This will be supported by awareness-raising efforts to mitigate the risks of polio infection.",
          "At least 95 per cent vaccination coverage during each round of the campaign is needed to prevent the spread of polio and reduce the risk of its re-emergence, given the severely disrupted health, water and sanitation systems in the Gaza Strip.",
          "Other requirements for successful campaign delivery include sufficient cash, fuel and functional telecommunication networks to reach communities with information about the campaign.",
          "Further efforts are underway to strengthen and expand poliovirus surveillance and routine immunization.",
          "The Gaza Strip has been polio-free for the last 25 years. Its reemergence, which the humanitarian community has warned about for the last ten months, represents yet another threat to the children in the Gaza Strip and neighboring countries.  A ceasefire is the only way to ensure public health security in the Gaza Strip and the region."

          "WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has determined that the upsurge of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and a growing number of countries in Africa constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR).",
          "Dr Tedros’s declaration came on the advice of an IHR Emergency Committee of independent experts who met earlier in the day to review data presented by experts from WHO and affected countries. The Committee informed the Director-General that it considers the upsurge of mpox to be a PHEIC, with potential to spread further across countries in Africa and possibly outside the continent.",
          "The Director-General will share the report of the Committee’s meeting and, based on the advice of the Committee, issue temporary recommendations to countries.",
          "In declaring the PHEIC, Dr Tedros said, \"The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighbouring countries are very worrying. On top of outbreaks of other mpox clades in DRC and other countries in Africa, it’s clear that a coordinated international response is needed to stop these outbreaks and save lives.”",
          "WHO Regional Director for Africa Dr Matshidiso Moeti said, “Significant efforts are already underway in close collaboration with communities and governments, with our country teams working on the frontlines to help reinforce measures to curb mpox. With the growing spread of the virus, we’re scaling up further through coordinated international action to support countries bring the outbreaks to an end.”",
          "Committee Chair Professor Dimie Ogoina said, “The current upsurge of mpox in parts of Africa, along with the spread of a new sexually transmissible strain of the monkeypox virus, is an emergency, not only for Africa, but for the entire globe. Mpox, originating in Africa, was neglected there, and later caused a global outbreak in 2022. It is time to act decisively to prevent history from repeating itself.\"",
          "This PHEIC determination is the second in two years relating to mpox. Caused by an Orthopoxvirus, mpox was first detected in humans in 1970, in the DRC. The disease is considered endemic to countries in central and west Africa.",
          "In July 2022, the multi-country outbreak of mpox was declared a PHEIC as it spread rapidly via sexual contact across a range of countries where the virus had not been seen before. That PHEIC was declared over in May 2023 after there had been a sustained decline in global cases.",
          "Mpox has been reported in the DRC for more than a decade, and the number of cases reported each year has increased steadily over that period. Last year, reported cases increased significantly, and already the number of cases reported so far this year has exceeded last year’s total, with more than 15 600 cases and 537 deaths.",
          "The emergence last year and rapid spread of a new virus strain in DRC, clade 1b, which appears to be spreading mainly through sexual networks, and its detection in countries neighbouring the DRC is especially concerning, and one of the main reasons for the declaration of the PHEIC.",
          "In the past month, over 100 laboratory-confirmed cases of clade 1b have been reported in four countries neighbouring the DRC that have not reported mpox before: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Experts believe the true number of cases to be higher as a large proportion of clinically compatible cases have not been tested.",
          "Several outbreaks of different clades of mpox have occurred in different countries, with different modes of transmission and different levels of risk.",
          "The two vaccines currently in use for mpox are recommended by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, and are also approved by WHO-listed national regulatory authorities, as well as by individual countries including Nigeria and the DRC.",
          "Last week, the Director-General triggered the process for Emergency Use Listing for mpox vaccines, which will accelerate vaccine access for lower-income countries which have not yet issued their own national regulatory approval. Emergency Use Listing also enables partners including Gavi and UNICEF to procure vaccines for distribution.",
          "WHO is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers on potential vaccine donations, and coordinating with partners through the interim Medical Countermeasures Network to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools.",
          "WHO anticipates an immediate funding requirement of an initial US$ 15 million to support surveillance, preparedness and response activities. A needs assessment is being undertaken across the three levels of the Organization.",
          "To allow for an immediate scale up, WHO has released US$ 1.45 million from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies and may need to release more in the coming days. The Organization appeals to donors to fund the full extent of needs of the mpox response."

          "The thirty-ninth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO Director-General on 08 July 2024 with committee members and advisers meeting via video conference with affected countries, supported by the WHO Secretariat. The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in the context of the global target of interruption and certification of WPV1 eradication by 2026 and interruption and certification of cVDPV2 elimination by 2028. Technical updates were received about the situation in the following countries: Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Pakistan, Senegal, and Somalia."

          "Since the last Emergency Committee meeting, twelve new WPV1 cases were reported, five from Afghanistan and seven from Pakistan bringing the total to 14 in 2024. The number of WPV1 positive environmental samples in Pakistan in 2024 is 186 compared to 126 during all of 2023. The number of WPV1 positive environmental samples in Afghanistan in 2024 is 44 compared to 62 in all of 2023.",
          "There has been an upward trend of WPV1 detection in Pakistan since mid-2023, mainly in the environmental samples from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan provinces. In Afghanistan, there is increased WPV1 detection in the environmental samples in the South Region since late 2023, in addition to reporting of two WPV1 cases. The committee noted the conclusion of recently held meeting of the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on polio eradication in Afghanistan and Pakistan that despite overall progress, endemic transmission has been re-established in the historic reservoirs of Kandahar (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan) and there is risk of its re-establishment in Karachi and Quetta Block of Pakistan. Review of the molecular epidemiology indicates that there has been progressive elimination of the genetic cluster ‘YB3C’ in 2022 and 2023, with its last detection in November 2023 in Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan. However, there has been persistent transmission of YB3A genetic cluster since May 2022, resulting into its split into two: YB3A4A and YB3A4B. The YB3A4A is a shared cluster in the northern and southern cross-border corridors across Afghanistan and Pakistan, while the YB3A4B is mainly active in Pakistan.",
          "Both Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to implement an intensive and synchronized campaign schedule focusing on improved vaccination coverage in the endemic zones and effective and timely response to WPV1 detections elsewhere in each country. Both countries implemented two nationwide and two sub-national vaccination campaigns during the first half of 2024. During the June 2024 nation-wide vaccination campaign, Afghanistan for the first time after more than five years, utilized house-to-house vaccination strategy in the South Region with exception of the Kandahar province, which is a very encouraging development. The campaign quality in the endemic East Region of Afghanistan has reportedly been high in 2024. Nationally, 95% of the target children (aged < 5 years) in Afghanistan were reached by house-to-house vaccination strategy during the June 2024 campaign and 5% through other modalities. The campaign quality in the areas with house-to-house to vaccination is significantly better than the areas using other modalities. During April 2024 nationwide campaign in Afghanistan, 17% of the vaccination volunteers were women, representing about 3% improvement since December 2023.  In Pakistan, the campaign quality in the endemic zone of South KP and historic WPV1 reservoirs continues to face challenges relating to operational implementation and increasing insecurity particularly in the KP and Balochistan provinces. Despite recent progress in the endemic South KP in Pakistan, there are concerning numbers of missed children during the recent campaigns (ranging from 5000 to 700,000) due to insecurity, boycotts and programme quality issues. Key AFP surveillance performance indicators are not meeting the targets in some of the districts of South KP of Pakistan. In addition to seasonal movement patterns within and between the two endemic countries, the continued return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan compounds the challenges faced. The scale of the displacement increases the risk of cross-border poliovirus spread as well as spread within both the countries.  This risk is being managed and mitigated in both countries through vaccination at border crossing points and the updating of micro-plans in the districts of origin and return. The programme continues to closely coordinate with IOM and UNHCR.",
          "There has been no transmission of WPV1 in the African Region in 2024. Following an independent Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) in Malawi and Mozambique, the WPV1 outbreak in the African Region has been declared closed as of May 2024.",
          "In summary, the available data indicate that globally transmission of WPV1 is geographically limited to the two WPV1 endemic countries; however, there has been geographical spread within the two countries in 2023 and 2024."

Algeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia, Mozambique, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Uganda, and Zimbabwe have detected cVDPV in the environment but have not detected any cases.",
          "A total of 527 cases have been confirmed with cVDPV in all of 2023, of which 393 are cVDPV2 and 134 are cVDPV1. Of the 527 cVDPV cases reported in 2023, 224 (43%) have occurred in the DR Congo.",
          "There are two newly infected countries reporting cVDPV2 since the last meeting: Ethiopia and Equatorial Guinea. Both Ethiopia and Equatorial Guinea experienced importations, from South Sudan and Chad respectively.  In 2024, the number of circulating cVDPV2 emergence groups detected to date is 13, compared to 27 in 2023, 22 in 2022, 29 in 2021, 36 in 2020, and 44 in 2019. Of the 13 emergence groups circulating in 2024, two are a newly detected this year, both derived from the novel OPV2 vaccine. There have now been 17 nOPV2 derived cVDPV2 emergences since 2021.",
          "All the four cVDPV1 cases in 2024 have been reported from DR Congo. In 2023, a total of 134 cVDPV1 cases were reported including 106 from DR Congo, 24 from Madagascar, and four from Mozambique. Last cVDPV1 detection from Madagascar was in September 2023 and from Mozambique in November 2023.",
          "The committee noted that in the African Region, which now, exclusively uses novel OPV2 for outbreak response, there has been a total of 16 new cVDPV2 emergences detected that have emerged from novel OPV2 use, while there has been one such emergence identified in Egypt in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The committee noted that much of the risk for cVDPV outbreaks can be linked to a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, a high concentration of zero dose and under-immunized children and population displacement. These factors are most evident in northern Yemen, northern Nigeria, south-central Somalia and eastern DR Congo."

The committees notes that the overall women’s inclusion in vaccination campaigns remains around 20% in Afghanistan, leading to inadequate access to all children in some areas. The committee is encouraged by the appointment of the Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication in Pakistan. The Committee encourages Afghanistan and Pakistan polio programmes to maintain coordination, aiming to rapidly improve the access and quality of vaccination campaigns to be able to reach the Goal-1 of the GPEI strategy.",

It is important to maintain high population immunity through routine immunization to avert the risk of future WPV1 outbreaks in the African Region.",

The committee also noted that other health emergencies and disease outbreaks (cholera, measles, dengue, malaria, etc.) in several countries of the African Region are making it very challenging to implement timely and high-quality polio vaccination campaigns. The committee noted the deteriorating cVDPV epidemiology in the Horn of Africa, with concurrent humanitarian and other health related challenges. The committee noted ongoing substantial role of mobile populations in sustaining the cVDPV transmission across several countries. The committee also noted that context-specific tailored interventions will be critical to implement high-quality campaigns and ultimately stop the cVDPV outbreaks in the current complex scenario, with varying challenges in different countries and sub-national geographies. Synchronized sub-regional approaches and strong cross-border coordination will also be critical to jointly address the challenges relating to permeable borders and common operational challenges across countries. The committee encourages the countries to document and share the best practices and suggests that GPEI facilitates that.",

          "The committee noted the ongoing supply related challenges regarding novel OPV2 and is encouraged by the prospects for improvement during the second half of 2024, including possible arrival of a second supplier in the market. The committee considered that securing of vaccine supply was a critical issue and that there should be planning to ensure a more robust vaccine supply beyond admission of a new supplier. While encouraging countries to declare public health emergencies following detection of a new outbreak, such crucial actions need to be supported by the GPEI in ensuring vaccine availability.",
          "The committee noted that 20 countries in the African Region are yet to introduce a second dose of IPV in their Routine Immunization schedules. Moreover, a number cVDPV outbreak affected countries continue to have low IPV1 coverage. It is important to take urgent steps to introduce IPV2 in the Routine Immunization of the remaining countries and improve IPV1 coverage, especially in the outbreak affected countries. The committee is encouraged by the prequalification of the Hexavalent Vaccine and availability of GAVI support for its introduction., starting in 2025. The committee appreciates the GPEI plan on integration and encourages to take all steps to implement that and utilize all possible opportunities to boost population immunity against polio, including the Big Catch up.",
          "The committee noted the ongoing GPEI efforts to maintain sensitive surveillance for polioviruses, and that epidemiological and genetic data indicates need for further quality improvement in the WPV1 endemic countries as well as the cVDPV affected countries. The Committee suggested to fast-track the efforts to improve speed of detection to inform rapid response, with special focus on high-risk geographies and populations",
          "The committee noted the review of the International Health Regulations and that amendments to the Regulations were possible in 2024 but that these have not yet come into effect. The Committee felt it was still too early to discontinue the PHEIC as the risk of exportation of both WPV and cVDPVs remains significant, noting also that there has been geographical spread of WPV1 in the Pakistan and Afghanistan epidemiological block in 2023 and 2024.",

There is a serious and growing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that has now expanded outside the country. A new viral strain, which first emerged in September 2023, has for the first time been detected outside DRC.",

          "In the last 12 years, the number of infants under six months of age globally who are exclusively breastfed has increased by more than 10%. This means 48% of infants worldwide now benefit from this healthy start in life. It translates to hundreds of thousands of babies whose lives have been saved by breastfeeding.",
          "While this significant leap brings us closer to the World Health Organization target of increasing exclusive breastfeeding to at least 50% by 2025, there are persistent challenges that must be addressed.",
          "When mothers receive the support they need to breastfeed their babies, everyone benefits. Improving breastfeeding rates could save over 820 000 children’s lives each year, according to the latest available data.",
          "During this critical period of early growth and development, the antibodies in breastmilk protect babies against illness and death. This is especially important during emergencies, when breastfeeding guarantees a safe, nutritious, and accessible food source for infants and young children. Breastfeeding reduces the burden of childhood illness, and the risk of certain types of cancers and noncommunicable diseases for mothers.",
          "This World Breastfeeding Week, under the theme “Closing the gap: Breastfeeding support for all”, UNICEF and WHO are emphasizing the need to improve breastfeeding support as a critical action for reducing health inequity and protecting the rights of mothers and babies to survive and thrive.",
          "An estimated 4.5 billion people – that’s more than half of the world’s population – do not have full coverage of essential health services, so many women do not receive the support they need to optimally breastfeed their babies. This includes access to trained, empathetic and respectful health advice and counselling throughout a woman’s breastfeeding journey.",
          "Reliable data collection is key to tackling healthcare inequalities and ensuring mothers and families are provided with timely, effective breastfeeding support. Currently, only half of all countries collect data on breastfeeding rates. To support progress, data also needs to be available on policy actions that make breastfeeding possible such as family friendly employment policies, regulation of the marketing of breastmilk substitutes, and investment in breastfeeding. Improving monitoring systems will help boost the effectiveness of breastfeeding policies and programmes, inform better decision-making, and ensure support systems can be adequately financed.",

          "Today, 85 sick and severely injured patients from Gaza were evacuated to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), for specialized care. This extremely complex joint evacuation was supported by the the World Health Organization (WHO) in partnership with the Government of the UAE and other partners. This is the largest medical evacuation outside Gaza since October 2023. “I am immensely grateful to the United Arab Emirates for evacuating sick and severely injured patients from Gaza and providing them with lifesaving medical care,” said Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean. “This initiative is a clear demonstration of the intra-regional solidarity that is urgently needed. Support to people in the Region must start from the Region. Thousands more inside Gaza remain at risk without access to advanced medical care. I urge Member States who are able to receive and care for more patients to do so.” The patients include 35 children and 50 adults, who were transferred from Gaza via Kerem Shalom to Ramon Airport in Israel, with support from WHO. Fifty-three patients have cancer, including 4 children, 20 have trauma injuries, 3 have blood diseases, including thalassemia, 3 have congenital conditions, 2 have fanconi anaemia, 1 has a neurological condition, 1 has cardiac disease, 1 has liver disease, and 1 has renal failure. Sixty-three family members and care givers accompanied the patients. “We are thankful to the UAE for supporting the evacuation of these patients to receive the urgent care they need,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"We hope this paves the way for the establishment of evacuation corridors via all possible routes, including the Kerem Shalom and Rafah crossings to Egypt and Jordan, and from there to other countries. We also call for evacuations to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, to be restored. Thousands of sick people are suffering needlessly. Above all, and as always, we call for a ceasefire.” The evacuation, originally scheduled for 29 July, was postponed, adding significant challenges to the operation and diverting scarce resources. Despite damaged roads, insecurity, and risks to their own safety, the WHO team organized and managed the transfer of patients from various areas in Gaza to the Kerem Shalom crossing under extremely challenging conditions. Prior to the evacuation, 9 patients were transferred by WHO and partners on July 27 from northern Gaza to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) field hospital in Deir al-Balah for stabilization and further movement. Other patients were picked up from five locations in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. Some critically injured patients, who had already been relocated to the final departure point in the south, were accommodated and cared for at the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) field hospital in Deir al-Balah, in coordination with WHO, following the postponement of the mission. WHO and the International Medical Corps team provided medical supplies, electricity, safe water and sanitation facilities at the hospital as it is still being set up. During the evacuation, patients underwent back-to-back transfer at Kerem Shalom, where they boarded buses, organized by WHO, heading to the airport after security checks. WHO provided wheelchairs to ensure patients could safely switch buses at the crossing, arranged access to food, water and medical professionals during the entire journey within Gaza and en route to the airport, and supported patient documentation. Other partners supporting the evacuation included the emergency medical teams Cadus and International Medical Corps, MSF Belgium and PRCS. Since October 2023, around 5000 people have been evacuated for treatment outside Gaza, with over 80% receiving care in Egypt, Qatar and the UAE. Over 10 000 more people in Gaza still need medical evacuation. Today’s evacuation follows previous ones to Spain and Belgium from Cairo, coordinated by WHO. Twenty patients have been evacuated to these countries in the past few days. WHO continues to call on the international community to intensify efforts to ensure safe, sustained, timely, and organized medical evacuations."

          "Among adolescent girls who have been in a relationship, nearly a quarter (24%) – close to 19 million – will have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence by the time they turn 20 years old, as highlighted by a new analysis from the World Health Organization (WHO) published today in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health . Almost 1 in 6 (16%) experienced such violence in the past year.",
          "“Intimate partner violence is starting alarmingly early for millions of young women around the world,” said Dr Pascale Allotey, Director of WHO’s Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research Department. “Given that violence during these critical formative years can cause profound and lasting harms, it needs to be taken more seriously as a public health issue – with a focus on prevention and targeted support.”",
          "Partner violence can have devastating impacts on young people’s health, educational achievement, future relationships, and lifelong prospects. From a health perspective, it heightens the likelihood of injuries, depression, anxiety disorders, unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, and many other physical and psychological conditions."

          "This study draws on existing data to provide, for the first time, a detailed analysis of the prevalence of physical and/or sexual partner violence experienced by 15–19-year-old girls who have been in intimate relationships. It also identifies broader social, economic and cultural factors that increase their risks.",
          "While violence against adolescent girls occurs everywhere, the authors highlight significant differences in prevalence. Based on WHO’s estimates, the worst affected regions are Oceania (47%) and central sub-Saharan Africa (40%), for instance, while the lowest rates are in central Europe (10%) and central Asia (11%). Between countries, there is also a substantive range: from an estimated 6% adolescent girls subjected to such violence in the least affected countries, to 49% in those with the highest rates.",
          "The new analysis found that intimate partner violence against adolescent girls is most common in lower-income countries and regions, in places where there are fewer girls in secondary school, and where girls have weaker legal property ownership and inheritance rights compared to men. Child marriage (before the age of 18 years) significantly escalates risks, since spousal age differences create power imbalances, economic dependency, and social isolation – all of which increase the likelihood of enduring abuse."

Since many adolescents lack their own financial resources, they can face particular challenges in leaving abusive relationships.",
          "“The study shows that to end gender-based violence, countries need to have policies and programmes in place that increase equality for women and girls,” said study author Dr Lynnmarie Sardinha, Technical Officer for Violence Against Women Data and Measurement at WHO. “This means ensuring secondary education for all girls, securing gender-equal property rights and ending harmful practices such as child marriage, which are often underpinned by the same inequitable gender norms that perpetuate violence against women and girls.”",
          "Currently, no country is on track to eliminate violence against women and girls by the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal target date. Ending child marriage – which affects 1 in 5 girls globally – and expanding girls’ access to secondary education will be critical factors for reducing partner violence against adolescent girls.",
          "WHO supports countries to measure and address violence against women, including efforts to strengthen prevention and response within the health care sector. New WHO guidelines on prevention of child marriage are planned for release by the end of 2024.",

          "The study, Intimate partner violence against adolescent girls: regional and national prevalence estimates and associated country-level factors , analyzes both lifetime prevalence and prevalence over the past 12 months of physical and/or sexual partner violence against 15-19 year old girls. Other types of violence, including psychological violence, are not included due to lack of an agreed internationally comparable measure.",
          "It uses data from WHO’s Global database on prevalence of violence against women , published in 2018, which draws on data collected between 2000 and 2018 from 161 countries. Bayesian hierarchical modelling methods were used to generate internationally comparable estimates between countries.",

Fifteen of them are children, ranging in age from 3 to 17 years old. The mother of one of the children will also be treated in Spain. The patients had been in hospital in Egypt for the past several months, after evacuating from Gaza. They are a small portion of the thousands of other children and adults who need access to specialized medical care outside of Gaza.",
          "“These very sick children will be getting the care they need thanks to cooperation between several partners and countries,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “We are immensely grateful for the support and facilitation provided by Egypt and Spain. We encourage other countries who have the capacity and medical facilities to welcome people who, through no fault of their own, are caught in the grips of this war.”",
          "Thirteen of the children have complex injuries, one has a chronic heart condition, and one is living with cancer. The children, who are accompanied by 25 family members and other caregivers, have been in Egypt since before 6 May, after which evacuations became almost impossible with the closure of the Rafah crossing. Only 23 people have been evacuated since then, via the Kerem Shalom crossing.",
          "Since October 2023, around 5000 people have been evacuated for treatment outside Gaza, with over 80% receiving care in Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Another 10 000 still need to be evacuated.",
          "“These children are just the tip of the iceberg. Thousands of people of all ages still remain in Gaza who need to be medically evacuated and are at risk of dying if they are unable to quickly access the advanced medical care they need,” said Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean. “Patients who need evacuation outside of the Gaza Strip must be able to exit, preferably to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, but also to Egypt or Jordan and then onwards.”",
          "Today’s evacuation to Spain was supported through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism in partnership with WHO. The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund facilitated the patients’ documentation and evacuation approvals. The Government of Egypt supported their care while they were there, and Spain is providing similar support. The children will be treated at various hospitals across Spain.",
          "WHO is encouraging other countries to follow this example.",
          "“We are truly thankful to Spain, a WHO/Europe Member State, for having responded so willingly to our request to accept several children from Gaza for critical treatment, a template for other countries to follow,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “Gracias, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Health Minister Monica Garcia, and all who have made this possible. Indeed, ‘to save one child, one life, is to save humankind’ is a concept recognizing the interconnectedness of all humanity.”",
          "WHO appeals for the establishment of multiple medical evacuation corridors to ensure sustained, organized, safe and timely passage of patients via all possible routes, including Rafah and Kerem Shalom. Of utmost urgency is the restoration of medical evacuations from Gaza to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, where hospitals are ready to receive patients. Patients must also be facilitated to be transferred to Egypt and Jordan, and from there to other countries when needed.",
          "“The solidarity of the host countries is a bright spot in a war that has had so many moments of tragedy,” said Dr Tedros. “The fact that severely ill people are receiving needed medical care should not be headline news, but routine global cooperation.”",
          "WHO once again calls for the end of the war, as peace is ultimately the best path to health."

          "“Following the vote today by the National Assembly of The Gambia, we commend the country’s decision to uphold the ban on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), reaffirming its commitments to human rights, gender equality, and protecting the health and well-being of girls and women.",
          "“FGM involves cutting or removing some or all of the external female genitalia. Mostly carried out on infants and young girls, it can inflict severe immediate and long-term physical and psychological damage, including infection, later childbearing complications, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
          "“The Women’s (Amendment) Act, 2015 – a pivotal milestone in advancing gender equality – is the culmination of years of advocacy, community engagement, and education aimed at eradicating this harmful practice and meeting the Sustainable Development Goal targets (5.3). It is, therefore, crucial that these legal protections remain in place.",
          "“The decision to maintain the FGM ban aligns with The Gambia's international and regional commitments to prevent harmful practices against girls and women, consistent with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the Maputo Protocol protecting African women’s rights.",
          "“In addition to recognizing this critical decision by the national parliament, we commend the tireless efforts of survivors, activists, civil society organizations, and faith-based groups working to end FGM. Upholding the ban supports these grassroots initiatives, which are pivotal in ending all forms of violence, including harmful practices, against girls and women and delivering a safer and healthier future for girls and women in The Gambia and elsewhere.",
          "“The fragility of progress to end FGM cannot be overstated. Assaults on women’s and girls’ rights in countries around the globe have meant that hard-won gains are in danger of being lost. In some countries, advancements have stalled or reversed due pushback against girls’ and women's rights, instability, and conflict, disrupting services and prevention programmes.",
          "“That is why legislative bans on FGM, while a crucial foundation for interventions, cannot alone end FGM. Today, more than 73 per cent of girls and women aged 15 to 49 in the country have already undergone this harmful practice, with many subjected to it before their fifth birthday.",
          "“Recent months have emphasized the need for continued advocacy to advance gender equality, end violence against girls and women, and secure the gains made to accelerate progress to end FGM. It also underscores the importance of engaging with communities and grassroots organizations, working with traditional, political, and religious leaders, training health workers, and raising awareness effectively on the harms caused by the practice.",
          "“Supporting survivors of FGM remains as urgent as ever. Many suffer from long-term physical and psychological harm that can result from the procedure, and need comprehensive medical and psychological care to heal from the scars inflicted by this harmful practice.",
          "“We remain steadfast in our commitment to support the government, civil society, and communities in The Gambia in the fight against FGM. Together, we must not rest until we ensure that all girls and women can live free from violence and harmful practices and that their rights, bodily integrity, and dignity are upheld.\"",

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) has prequalified the first hepatitis C virus (HCV) self-test which can provide a critical support in expanding access to testing and diagnosis, accelerating global efforts to eliminate hepatitis C.",
          "The product, called OraQuick HCV self-test, manufactured by OraSure Technologies, is an extension of the pre-qualified, OraQuick® HCV Rapid Antibody Test which was initially prequalified by WHO in 2017 for professional use . The self-test version, specifically designed for use by lay users, provides individuals with a single kit containing the components that are needed to perform the self-test.",
          "WHO recommended HCV self-testing (HCVST) in 2021 , to complement existing HCV testing services in countries.  The recommendation was based on evidence demonstrating its ability to increase access to and uptake of services, particularly among people who may not otherwise test.",
          "National-level HCVST implementation projects, largely supported by Unitaid, have shown high levels of acceptability and feasibility, as well as empowering people through personal choice, autonomy and access to stigma-free self-care services.",
          "“Every day 3500 lives are lost to viral hepatitis. Of the 50 million people living with hepatitis C, only 36% had been diagnosed, and 20% have received curative treatment by the end of 2022,” says Dr Meg Doherty, WHO Director for the Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes. “The addition of this product to the WHO prequalification list provides a safe and effective way to expand HCV testing and treatment services, ensuring more people receive the diagnoses and treatment they need, and ultimately contributing to the global goal of HCV elimination.”",
          "WHO’s prequalification (PQ) programme for in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) evaluates a range of tests, including those used for the detection of antibodies to HCV. The programme assesses IVDs against quality, safety and performance standards. It is a cornerstone in supporting countries in achieving high-quality diagnosis and treatment monitoring.",
          "“The availability of a WHO prequalified HCV self-test enables low- and middle-income countries have access to safe and affordable self-testing options which is essential to achieving the goal of 90% of all people with HCV to be diagnosed,” says Dr Rogério Gaspar, WHO Director for the Department of Regulation and Prequalification. “This achievement contributes to improving access to quality-assured health products for more people living in low-income countries.”",
          "WHO will continue to assess additional HCV self-tests, support evidence-based implementation, and work with communities to expand available options to all countries."

          "World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced an online platform called MeDevIS (Medical Devices Information System), the first global open access clearing house for information on medical devices. It is designed to support governments, regulators and users in their decision-making on selection, procurement and use of medical devices for diagnostics, testing and treatment of diseases and health conditions.",
          "The MeDevIS platform includes 2301 types of medical devices used for a broad-ranging health issues, including reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, noncommunicable diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes as well as infectious diseases such as COVID-19.",
          "“The number of medical technologies used in health care is growing, as is their complexity, which can make it challenging for health care practitioners and patients to navigate,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. “We aim to provide a one stop shop of international information, which can be invaluable for those making decisions on life-saving medical technologies, especially in resource-limited settings, and to improve access”.",
          "There are over 10 000 different medical devices that are being used for protection, prevention, diagnostics, treatment or rehabilitation of health issues globally. These include multiple simple and complex medical technologies ranging from pulse oximeters, digital thermometers, single-use syringes and medical masks to various diagnostic laboratory tests and other medical equipment including electrocardiograms, endoscopes, all imaging radiology technologies, and technologies used for treatments such as hemodialysis units and defibrillators, implantable prothesis, cardiac stents and complex radiotherapy equipment.",
          "However, currently there are multiple, separate sources of information produced by major international organizations, regulatory bodies, and donor agencies, making it difficult for users to discern and utilize the most reliable data. In MeDevIS, users can check devices they require, including type, level of health care systems to support the device (such as community or specialized hospitals), scope of the device, and infrastructure required, among other categories.",
          "MeDevIS replaces paper-based literature search across multiple publications with non-standard device names which can add to the complexity. Along with providing a single platform, MedevIS also aims to help make the naming of the medical devices simpler.",
          "MeDevIS references two international naming systems for medical devices - the European Medical Device Nomenclature ( EMDN ), mostly used in European countries for registration in the European database, and the Global Medical Device Nomenclature ( GMDN ) used in regulatory agencies in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the USA and other Member States. The naming systems include coding and definitions and can be used in every country to facilitate registration for regulatory approval, procurement and supply, inventories in health facilities, tracking and pricing.",
          "“The MeDevIS platform can be useful for national policy-makers to develop or update their own national lists for procurement of health technologies and devices and can contribute to the progress towards universal health coverage,” said Dr Deus Mubangizi, WHO Director for Health Products Policy and Standards in the Access to Medicines and Health Products Division. “It can also help agencies in health insurance and reimbursement policies for patients.”",
          "This is the first time WHO has developed such a global repository on medical devices, based on its experience with the WHO Priority Medical Devices List (MDL), which itself was based on the experience of creating the WHO Essential Medicines List (EML). Approaching its 50 th anniversary in 2025, EML is regarded as a pillar of public health in countries across the world, supporting health progress and touching billions of lives.",
          "WHO will be continually improving the MeDevIS platform, engaging multiple stakeholders and partners and expanding it with additional technologies and devices used in various health areas, including in pandemic and emergency settings.",
          "Note to Editors:",
          "The MeDevIS platform became operational in March 2024 for the purpose of consultation with WHO Member States. Following the consultation, it is being publicly released via an online webinar “Nomenclature of medical devices: EMDN & GMDN” on 8 July 2024 at 14:00-15:00 CEST ."

The recommendations are relevant for all adults seeking to quit various tobacco products, including cigarettes, waterpipes, smokeless tobacco products, cigars, roll-your-own tobacco, and heated tobacco products (HTPs).",
          "“This guideline marks a crucial milestone in our global battle against these dangerous products,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"It empowers countries with the essential tools to effectively support individuals in quitting tobacco and alleviate the global burden of tobacco-related diseases.”",
          "Over 60% of the world's 1.25 billion tobacco users – more than 750 million people – wish to quit, yet 70% lack access to effective cessation services. This gap exists due to challenges faced by health systems, including resource limitations.",

          "New data show that nearly one third (31%) of adults worldwide, approximately 1.8 billion people, did not meet the recommended levels of physical activity in 2022. The findings point to a worrying trend of physical inactivity among adults, which has increased by about 5 percentage points between 2010 and 2022.",
          "If the trend continues, levels of inactivity are projected to further rise to 35% by 2030, and the world is currently off track from meeting the global target to reduce physical inactivity by 2030. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults have 150 minutes of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or equivalent, per week. Physical inactivity puts adults at greater risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes, type 2 diabetes, dementia and cancers such as breast and colon.",
          "The study was undertaken by researchers from WHO together with academic colleagues and published in The Lancet Global Health journal.",
          "\"These new findings highlight a lost opportunity to reduce cancer and heart disease, and improve mental health and well-being through increased physical activity,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"We must renew our commitment to increasing levels of physical activity and prioritizing bold action, including strengthened policies and increased funding, to reverse this worrying trend.”",
          "The highest rates of physical inactivity were observed in the high-income Asia Pacific region (48%) and South Asia (45%), with levels of inactivity in other regions ranging from 28% in high-income Western countries to 14% in Oceania.",
          "Of concern, disparities remain between gender and age. Physical inactivity is still more common among women globally compared with men, with inactivity rates of 34% compared to 29%. In some countries, this difference is as much as 20 percentage points. Additionally, people over 60 are less active than other adults, underscoring the importance of promoting physical activity for older adults.",
          "“Physical inactivity is a silent threat to global health, contributing significantly to the burden of chronic diseases,” said Dr Rüdiger Krech, Director of Health Promotion at WHO. “We need to find innovative ways to motivate people to be more active, considering factors like age, environment, and cultural background. By making physical activity accessible, affordable, and enjoyable for all, we can significantly reduce the risk of noncommunicable diseases and create a population that is healthier and more productive.”",
          "Despite the worrying results, there are some signs of improvement in some countries. The study showed that almost half of the world’s countries have made some improvements over the past decade, and 22 countries were identified as likely to reach the global target of reducing inactivity by 15% by 2030, if their trend continues at the same pace.",
          "In light of these findings, WHO is calling on countries to strengthen their policy implementation to promote and enable physical activity through grassroots and community sport and active recreation and transport (walking, cycling and use of public transport), among other measures.",
          "\"These new findings highlight a lost opportunity to reduce cancer and heart disease, and improve mental health and well-being through increased physical activity,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"We must renew our commitment to increasing levels of physical activity and prioritizing bold action, including strengthened policies and increased funding, to reverse this worrying trend.”",
          "\"Promoting physical activity goes beyond promoting individual lifestyle choice - it will require a whole-of-society approach and creating environments that make it easier and safer for everyone to be more active in ways they enjoy  to reap the many health benefits of regular physical activity,” said Dr Fiona Bull, Head of the WHO Unit for Physical Activity.",
          "Collective efforts based on partnerships between government and nongovernmental stakeholders and increased investments in innovative approaches will be needed to reach the least active people and to reduce inequalities in access to measures promoting and improving physical activity."

In addition, over 5200 people, 800 of them children, have been injured, adding to the growing burden of trauma and emergency care at already strained health facilities.",

The attacks affected 54 health facilities, 20 mobile clinics and 319 ambulances. Fifty-nine percent of the attacks occurred in the cities of Tulkarem, Jenin and Nablus. They include attacks on health infrastructure and ambulances, detention of health workers and patients, obstruction of their access to health facilities, use of force on health workers and militarized searches of ambulances and staff.",

The impact of the financial situation on health service delivery is significant – with health workers receiving only half of their salary for nearly a year and 45% of essential medications being out of stock.  In most areas of the West Bank, primary care clinics and outpatient specialty clinics are now operating two days per week, and hospitals are operating at approximately 70% capacity.",

In the same period, 48% of the 26 562 companion permit applications have been denied or remain pending.",

Prior to October 2023, over 300 patients required permits daily to cross from the West Bank to east Jerusalem and Israeli health facilities.",

Additionally, WHO has pre-positioned supplies at key hospitals across the West Bank, including in East Jerusalem, and conducted community trauma management training for first aid responders in the affected communities to boost emergency preparedness, but worsening insecurity and accessibility for emergency health workers and field volunteers to reach the injured, combined with the ongoing strict curfews, pose significant risks to the health system and make it very difficult for responders to reach those in need of urgent care.",

Although the number of antibacterial agents in the clinical pipeline increased from 80 in 2021 to 97 in 2023, there is a pressing need for new, innovative agents for serious infections and to replace those becoming ineffective due to widespread use.",
          "First released in 2017, this annual report evaluates whether the current research and development (R&D) pipeline properly addresses infections caused by the drug-resistant bacteria most threatening to human health, as detailed in the 2024 WHO bacterial priority pathogen list (BPPL) . Both documents aim to steer antibacterial R&D to better counter the ever-growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).",
          "AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites no longer respond to medicines, making people sicker and increasing the risk of spread of infections that are difficult to treat, illness and deaths. AMR is driven largely by the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials, yet, at the same time, many people around the world do not have access to essential antimicrobial medicines.",
          "“Antimicrobial resistance is only getting worse yet we’re not developing new trailblazing products fast enough to combat the most dangerous and deadly bacteria,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Antimicrobial Resistance ad interim . “Innovation is badly lacking yet, even when new products are authorized, access is a serious challenge. Antibacterial agents are simply not reaching the patients who desperately need them, in countries of all income levels.\"",
          "Not only are there too few antibacterials in the pipeline, given how long is needed for R&D and the likelihood of failure, there is also not enough innovation. Of the 32 antibiotics under development to address BPPL infections, only 12 can be considered innovative. Furthermore, just 4 of these 12 are active against at least 1 WHO ‘critical’ pathogen – critical being the BPPL’s top risk category, over ‘high’ and ‘medium’ priority. There are gaps across the entire pipeline, including in products for children, oral formulations more convenient for outpatients, and agents to tackle rising drug resistance.",
          "Encouragingly, non-traditional biological agents, such as bacteriophages, antibodies, anti-virulence agents, immune-modulating agents and microbiome-modulating agents, are increasingly being explored as complements and alternatives to antibiotics. However, studying and regulating non-traditional agents is not straightforward. Further efforts are needed to facilitate clinical studies and assessments of these products, to help determine when and how to use these agents clinically.",
          "Looking at newly approved antibacterials, since 1 July 2017, 13 new antibiotics have obtained marketing authorization but only 2 represent a new chemical class and can be termed innovative, underscoring the scientific and technical challenge in discovering novel antibacterials that are both effective against bacteria and safe for humans.",
          "In addition, 3 non-traditional agents have been authorized, all are faecal-based products for restoring the gut microbiota, to prevent recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) following antibiotic treatment in adults.",
          "The preclinical pipeline is active and innovative, with many non-traditional approaches, as part of a stable number of preclinical candidates over the last 4 years. Its focus remains Gram-negative pathogens, which are resistant to last-resort antibiotics. Gram-negative bacteria have built-in abilities to find new ways to resist treatment and can pass along genetic material that allows other bacteria to become drug resistant as well.",
          "The shift towards antibacterial agents targeting a single pathogen appears to have plateaued. Agents targeting a single pathogen increase the need for widely available and affordably priced rapid diagnostics, to ensure the relevant bacteria are present in the infections to be treated.",
          "Greater transparency in the pipeline would: facilitate collaboration around potentially innovative but challenging projects, help scientists and drug developers, and generate more interest and funding for drug development for novel antibacterial agents.",
          "Efforts to develop new antibacterial agents need to be accompanied by parallel efforts to ensure they can be equitably accessed, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Universal access to quality and affordable tools for preventing, diagnosing and treating infections is key to mitigating AMR’s impact on public health and the economy, as per WHO’s Strategic and Operational Priorities for Addressing AMR in the Human Health Sector, the AMR resolution adopted by the 77th World Health Assembly and the People-centred approach to addressing AMR and core package of AMR interventions."

These critical actions have been taken in order to ensure comprehensive, robust systems are in place in all countries to protect the health and safety of all people everywhere from the risk of future outbreaks and pandemics.",
          "These decisions represent two important steps by countries, taken in tandem with one another on the final day of the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly, to build on lessons learned from several global health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The package of amendments to the Regulations will strengthen global preparedness, surveillance and responses to public health emergencies, including pandemics.",
          "The historic decisions taken today demonstrate a common desire by Member States to protect their own people, and the world’s, from the shared risk of public health emergencies and future pandemics,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “The amendments to the International Health Regulations will bolster countries' ability to detect and respond to future outbreaks and pandemics by strengthening their own national capacities, and coordination between fellow States, on disease surveillance, information sharing and response. This is built on commitment to equity, an understanding that health threats do not recognize national borders, and that preparedness is a collective endeavor.\"",
          "Dr Tedros added: The decision to conclude the Pandemic Agreement within the next year demonstrates how strongly and urgently countries want it, because the next pandemic is a matter of when, not if. Today’s strengthening of the IHR provides powerful momentum to complete the Pandemic Agreement, which, once finalized, can help to prevent a repeat of the devastation to health, societies and economies caused by COVID-19.",

The Society conducts a broad range of programmes and activities that are central to healthy ageing through a comprehensive approach that includes geriatric assessment, clinical treatment, nutritional support, rehabilitation and palliative care. It carries out innovative research on multimorbidity in older age and related biomarkers, and develops guidance and care models to support person-centred and integrated health services, dealing with issues such as access to palliative care. Results of this work include the development of local care standards on how to manage polypharmacy and hypertension among older persons with multimorbidity. These standards are applied nationwide, with training programmes reaching a range of personnel, including 4000 caregivers of older persons and over 140 000 geriatric physicians, enabling them to upgrade their skills. The Society has also pioneered the creation of standards for age-friendly hospitals. After piloting this work in 53 institutions, 90% of health care institutions in Beijing are now meeting these standards. The Society also works to strengthen the collaboration between those involved in academia, research and industry.",

Most recently, he has been leading the Elderly Care Section in the Primary Health Care Department of the Ministry of Health. He has contributed to the development of a national programme for older persons that provides screening, assessment and early interventions as part of primary health care for people aged 60 years and older. The programme aims to prevent diseases, provide continuity of care from health care settings to patients’ homes, maximize independence and enable older persons to have access to community resources. Building on this work, Dr Al Wahaibi has helped to develop an electronic health record system, used by a multidisciplinary team, which includes the assessment findings regarding the health status of older persons, and links these findings with the support services available within primary health care. He works to strengthen the capacity of nurses to carry out these assessments and to engage local communities in the planning, management and evaluation of the primary health care services available for older people."

          "The National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore, India delivers state-of-the-art clinical care, carrying out training and research as well as involving the communities it serves. It collaborates with central and state governments in framing, informing and implementing national policies and strategies such as the National Mental Health Policy (2014), the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, and the National Suicide Prevention Strategy (2022). NIMHANS involves young people as change agents within district youth-empowerment centres in order to bridge the gap between young people, their families and an ever-changing society (reaching about 6 million young people). In addition, it is engaged in a national initiative for child protection, mental health and psychosocial care (reaching more than 3 million people). Other major programmes led by the Institute include urban mental health and integrating mental health issues arising out of climate change into primary mental health care delivery, as well as training and accrediting community volunteers to deliver mental health first aid: 18 000 gatekeepers have been trained to facilitate the early identification of suicide risk and to intervene. NIMHANS has initiated numerous digital technology initiatives, including: the Digital Academy, whose courses have been followed by 2500 health care providers. A national helpline for psychosocial support and mental health services was launched during the first wave of COVID-19. In 2022, the Institute established the National Tele Mental Health Programme to provide equitable, affordable and high-quality mental health care across all Indian States.",
          "Professor Bontle Mbongwe from Botswana is a renowned public health advocate and a passionate tobacco control activist. Through country-level consultations that she initiated during the negotiation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, Botswana’s Control of Smoking Act, 1992, was amended in 2004 to restrict smoking in public places to protect children, pregnant women and workers, raise the minimum-age restrictions for selling tobacco products, prohibiting their sale to persons under 18 years and ban tobacco advertising and promotion. In 2008, Professor Mbongwe’s research contributed to influencing government policies away from the use of mercury-containing devices in health care facilities towards mercury-free alternatives. In 2014, she boldly challenged the tobacco industry by successfully advocating for the introduction of a 30% tobacco levy in Botswana. She then contributed to the country’s Tobacco Control Act, 2021. Her relentless work helped raising of the minimum-age restriction for selling tobacco products, prohibiting their sale to persons under 21 years, banning the sale of single sticks of cigarettes as well as requiring tobacco products to be sold by licensed persons only. She established the first civil society Anti-Tobacco Network in Botswana and plays an important role in building a network of media and nongovernmental organizations committed to tobacco control in her home country as well as in the rest of Africa and beyond."

          "With the conflict now in its second year, 18 million people are acutely hungry, including 3.6 million children who are acutely malnourished, and famine is quickly closing in on millions of people in Darfur, Kordofan, Aj Jazirah and Khartoum.",
          "Sudan is home to the largest number of internally displaced people in the world at nearly 10 million. A further 2 million people have escaped to neighbouring countries.",
          "Horrific attacks against civilians – including sexual violence – as well as hospitals and schools are multiplying.",
          "In Al Fasher, more than 800,000 civilians are bracing for an imminent large-scale attack, which would unleash catastrophic humanitarian consequences both in the city and across Darfur.",
          "Despite the tremendous needs, aid workers continue to face systematic obstructions and deliberate denials of access by parties to the conflict. Movements across conflict lines to parts of Khartoum, Darfur, Aj Jazirah and Kordofan have been all but cut off since mid-December. The closure of the Adre border crossing in February – our main route into western Sudan from Chad – means that limited assistance is trickling into Darfur. Aid workers are being killed, injured and harassed, and humanitarian supplies are being looted.",
          "In March and April of this year, nearly 860,000 people were denied humanitarian aid in Kordofan, Darfur and Khartoum states. Deliberate hindrances to humanitarian assistance that leave the civilian population without the essentials to survive violate international humanitarian law.",
          "Extreme hunger is unfolding, and the outlook for food production in 2024 is bleak. We have a rapidly shrinking window to get seeds to farmers before the main planting season ends and the rainy season begins. If we act in time, people – especially those in inaccessible areas – will be able to produce food locally and avert food shortages in the next six months. Without immediate action, people will go hungry and be forced to move in search of food, shelter and protection.",
          "Let us be clear: If we are prevented from providing aid rapidly and at scale, more people will die.",
          "Without an immediate and major step change, we will face a nightmare scenario: A famine will take hold in large parts of the country. More people will flee to neighbouring countries in search of sustenance and safety. More children will succumb to disease and malnutrition. Women and girls, already bearing the brunt of the conflict, will face even greater suffering and dangers.",

          "Transplantation is a life-saving treatment. The latest data of 2022 from the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation indicate that more than 150 000 solid organ transplants (≤ 10% of global needs) are performed worldwide annually, which is an increase of 52% compared with 2010.",
          "However, there is still an apparent insufficient growth in and asymmetrical development of transplantation worldwide with many countries not having established the appropriate systems, including legislation, governance, specialized workforce, infrastructure and financing.",
          "Lack of availability and equitable access to transplantation may lead to death or unethical or illegal practices such as transplant tourism and organ trafficking. The resolution aims to improve the availability of transplantation, especially in countries with limited resources.",
          "The resolution aims to introduce measures to prevent and combat trafficking in people for the purpose of organ removal and trafficking in human organs, and to protect victims and survivors of these crimes by strengthening legislative frameworks.",
          "Member States committed to take a set of actions including integrating donation and transplantation activities into health-care systems, so that deceased donation is routinely considered as an option at the end of life, and living donors are protected from exploitation and provided with proper follow-up care.",
          "WHO is tasked to develop a global strategy on donation and transplantation, to be presented to the Assembly for adoption in 2026. WHO should also examine establishing a World Donor Day to raise public awareness and enhance understanding on the need for altruistic donation of human cells, tissues and organs."

The plan provides clear actions, indicators, and targets to support Member States in improving national- and facility-level IPC actions.",
          "Recent history has demonstrated how outbreaks such as Ebola and COVID-19 spreading in communities can be dramatically amplified in health-care settings when there are gaps in IPC measures. Infections acquired in health-care settings, including those that exhibit antimicrobial resistance (AMR), cause avoidable suffering to patients, and increase the burden on health systems.",
          "IPC interventions such as hand hygiene, and ensuring access to high-quality water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services can reduce the risk of health care-associated infections (HAIs) by up to 70% and have a high economic return on investment.",
          "Delegates reiterated their commitment to strengthen IPC programmes, noting that the action plan will require firm political commitment, dedicated financing and sustained implementation.",
          "The plan will be supported by a detailed implementation guide and other resources, including costing tools. Full implementation of the global action plan can enable the attainment of the goal that everyone has access to health care that is safe from HAIs by 2030.",

Progress in reducing maternal deaths has stalled since 2016, while survival gains for newborns and young children have lost pace.",
          "This new resolution commits to tackling the leading causes of maternal and child deaths, especially in the worst affected countries, while improving access to maternal, sexual and reproductive and comprehensive child health services through stronger primary health care. It further highlights the need to expand access to emergency services including urgent obstetric care and small and sick newborn units, which are critical to manage complications associated with prematurity and other leading causes of newborn deaths.",
          "The resolution emphasized that health systems must be enabled to deliver quality, safe and effective care, through well-stocked facilities, well-trained and motivated health workers, and safe water and sanitation. The resolution also stresses the need for comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care services, including family planning, that underpin women’s health.",

Current rates of decline in maternal mortality would need to be accelerated nine times, and newborn and under-five mortality four times to achieve these targets. Member States have committed to report back on this resolution every two years."

          "Under the broad concept of a people-centred approach, the resolution welcomes the WHO strategic and operational priorities to address drug-resistant bacterial infections in the human health sector (2025–2035), with the four strategic priorities of: prevention of infections; universal access to affordable, quality diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections; strategic information, science and innovation; and effective governance and financing of the human health sector response to AMR.",
          "The resolution urges Member States to apply these priorities and implement the core package of country-level interventions through their AMR national action plans. Areas of focus include the governance, funding, implementation and monitoring of national action plans, and the development of a concise and action-oriented, consensus-based political declaration for adoption at the HLM.",

          "The discussion highlighted the importance of putting people and the public interest front and centre when using AI for health. Concerns about reinforcing existing inequities were raised but there was also hope that AI could help overcome current limitations, by helping to reach marginalized communities and people in remote areas and augment the capabilities of time-constrained health workers.",

This progress results from partnerships, leaders, scientists, civil society, communities and families who have worked together to deliver on the dream of immunization for all.”",

Budi Gunadi Sadikin, Minister of Health, Indonesia; Dr Tore Godal, Former Advisor to the Prime Minister, Norway and founding CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; Dr Umit Kartoglu, President & CEO, Extensio et Progressio; Dr Sania Nishtar, CEO, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance; and Ted Chaiban, Deputy Executive Director, UNICEF, among many others.",

          "The event also looked forward, with speakers emphasizing their vision and ambition for the next 50 years of immunization and innovation. Speakers paid tribute to John Lloyd, who was the architect of the vaccine cold chain and an unsung hero in global health, and thanked community and front-line health workers for their dedication to immunization for all.",

          "The launch, on the eve of the Seventy-Seventh World Health Assembly, marks the start of a year-long series of engagements and events, co-hosted by countries, where Member States and other donors will be invited to contribute funds to WHO’s strategy for 2025 through 2028 and show high-level political commitment to WHO and global health.",
          "The Investment Round will culminate in November with a major pledging event to be hosted by Brazil around the G20 Leaders’ Summit.",
          "“It’s about ensuring WHO is fully funded and improving the quality of the funding we receive. Much of the funding we receive is unpredictable, reactive, and tightly defined,” Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, opening the high-level event on the eve of the Health Assembly. “The Investment Round aims to change that, by generating funding that is more flexible, predictable, and resilient.”",
          "WHO’s third investment case, to be launched at the Health Assembly on Tuesday 28 May, estimates that full funding of the strategy, the Fourteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 14) , will contribute to saving 40 million lives from 2025-2028."

Member States have also approved an increase in their assessed contributions, on the pathway to providing 50% of WHO’s base budget by 2030. With the Investment Round, WHO is seeking to expand its donor base by mobilizing new contributions from the WHO Member States that have not yet provided voluntary contributions and by tapping into new private sector donors through the WHO Foundation."

Films can create awareness, challenge prejudices, ask uncomfortable questions and tell stories that need to be told. Health is personally and collectively, our right and responsibility. So to celebrate films that focus on these issues is important. I am glad that l have the opportunity to announce the winners of the 5th edition of this annual event.”",

          "Delegations to the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly, running from 27 May–1 June, will consider the outcomes of both processes, and the next steps for the two.",
          "“Over the past two years, WHO Member States have dedicated enormous effort to rise to this challenge posted by COVID-19 and respond to the losses it caused, including at least 7 million lives lost,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “COVID-19 affected everybody, in many ways, and that is why Member States started a process to develop a pandemic agreement to make the world better prepared for the next pandemic. While great progress was made during these negotiations, there are challenges still to overcome. We need to use the World Health Assembly to re-energize us and finish the job at hand, which is to present the world with a generational pandemic agreement.”",
          "Countries today ended their resumed 9 th meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) comprising WHO’s 194 Member States. Initial agreement was reached by the INB on multiple elements of the draft agreement, and convergence on others. There were also areas of non-convergence and divergent views.",

Options for next steps to conclude the agreement process will also be put to the WHA for consideration.",
          "Bureau co-Chair Mr Roland Driece, of the Netherlands, said WHO Member States remain committed to completing the pandemic agreement process and looked forward to the World Health Assembly to consider the progress made on this landmark initiative.",

This will require continuous commitment and action from all parties to build the world’s collective defenses.”",
          "The Working Group on the IHR (WGIHR) amendments will also be presenting its outcome to the WHA for consideration, including some provisions for which agreement in principle was reached and others that the WGIHR Bureau updated its proposed text for consideration by Member States.",
          "The IHR, which were first adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1969 and last revised in 2005, were conceived to maximize collective efforts to manage public health events while at the same time minimizing their disruption to travel and trade. They have 196 State Parties, comprising all 194 WHO Member States plus Liechtenstein and the Holy See. These Parties have led the process to amend the IHR through the Working Group on Amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) (WGIHR). Today marked the end of the resumed session of the eighth meeting of the WGIHR."

The virus transmits from person to person through close, including sexual, contact. It also has animal reservoirs in east, central and west Africa, where spillovers from animals to humans can occasionally occur, sparking further outbreaks.",

Between July 2022 and May 2023, the outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. While that outbreak has largely subsided, cases and deaths continue to be reported today, illustrating that low-level transmission continues around the world.",

Between 2019 and 2021, global life expectancy dropped by 1.8 years to 71.4 years (back to the level of 2012). Similarly, global healthy life expectancy dropped by 1.5 years to 61.9 years in 2021 (back to the level of 2012).",

The WHO regions for the Americas and South-East Asia were hit hardest, with life expectancy dropping by approximately 3 years and healthy life expectancy by 2.5 years between 2019 and 2021. In contrast, the Western Pacific Region was minimally affected during the first two years of the pandemic, with losses of less than 0.1 years in life expectancy and 0.2 years in healthy life expectancy.",

In just two years, the COVID-19 pandemic erased a decade of gains in life expectancy. That's why the new Pandemic Agreement is so important: not only to strengthen global health security, but to protect long-term investments in health and promote equity within and between countries.”"

Malnutrition in children was also striking, with 148 million children under five years old affected by stunting (too short for age), 45 million suffering from wasting (too thin for height), and 37 million overweight.",
          "The report further highlights the significant health challenges faced by persons with disabilities, refugees and migrants. In 2021, about 1.3 billion people, or 16% of the global population, had disability. This group is disproportionately affected by health inequities resulting from avoidable, unjust and unfair conditions.",
          "Access to healthcare for refugees and migrants remains limited, with only half of the 84 countries surveyed between 2018 and 2021 providing government-funded health services to these groups at levels comparable to their citizens. This highlights the urgent need for health systems to adapt and address the persisting inequities and changing demographic needs of global populations."

Additionally, only 777 million more people are likely to be adequately protected during health emergencies by 2025, falling short of the one billion target set in WHO’s 13 th General Programme of Work. This protection is increasingly important as the effects of climate change and other global crises increasingly threaten health security.",

          "This comes just ahead of World No Tobacco Day marked on 31 May, where WHO is amplifying the voices of young people who are calling on governments to protect them from being targets of the tobacco and nicotine industry.",
          "The report shows that globally an estimated 37 million children aged 13–15 years use tobacco, and in many countries, the rate of e-cigarette use among adolescents exceeds that of adults. In the WHO European Region, 20% of 15-year-olds surveyed reported using e-cigarettes in the past 30 days.",
          "Despite significant progress in reducing tobacco use, the emergence of e-cigarettes and other new tobacco and nicotine products present a grave threat to youth and tobacco control. Studies demonstrate that e-cigarette use increases conventional cigarette use, particularly among non-smoking youth, by nearly three times.",
          "\"History is repeating, as the tobacco industry tries to sell the same nicotine to our children in different packaging,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “These industries are actively targeting schools, children and young people with new products that are essentially a candy-flavoured trap. How can they talk about harm reduction when they are marketing these dangerous, highly-addictive products to children?”",
          "These industries continue to market their products to young people with enticing flavours like candy and fruit. Research in the United States of America found that more than 70% of youth e-cigarette users would quit if the products were only available in tobacco flavour.",
          "\"These industries are intentionally designing products and utilizing marketing strategies that appeal directly to children,\" said Dr Ruediger Krech, Director, WHO Director of Health Promotion. \"The use of child-friendly flavours like cotton candy and bubblegum, combined with sleek and colourful designs that resemble toys, is a blatant attempt to addict young people to these harmful products.\"",
          "These deceptive tactics highlight the urgent need for strong regulations to protect young people from a lifetime of harmful dependence.",
          "WHO urges governments to protect young people from the uptake of tobacco, e-cigarettes and other nicotine products by banning or tightly regulating these products. WHO recommendations include creating 100% smoke-free indoor public places, banning flavoured e-cigarettes, bans on marketing, advertising and promotion, higher taxes, increasing public awareness of the deceptive tactics used by the industry and supporting youth-led education and awareness initiatives.",
          "“Addicted youth represent a lifetime of profits to the industry,” said Jorge Alday, Director, STOP at Vital Strategies. “That’s why the industry aggressively lobbies to create an environment that makes it cheap, attractive and easy for youth to get hooked. If policy makers don’t act, current and future generations may be facing a new wave of harms, characterized by addiction to and use of many tobacco and nicotine products, including cigarettes.”",
          "Youth advocates around the world are taking a stand against the tobacco and nicotine industry’s destructive influence and manipulative marketing. They are exposing these deceptive practices and advocating for their own tobacco-free future. Youth organizations from around the world participated in the latest session of the Conference of the Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (COP10) to deliver a powerful message to policy makers: “Future generations will remember you as the ones who protected them or the ones who failed them and put them in danger.”",

          "The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Task Team on Climate Change, Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) and Malaria, in partnership with Reaching the Last Mile (RLM), has released a major scoping review published in Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene . The review of 42 693 articles reveals that there is not yet sufficient understanding of the actual and potential impacts of human-induced changes to climate patterns on malaria and NTDs.",
          "Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns are altering the spread of vector-borne diseases,  with significant implications for human health and placing additional strain on systems. As the geographic range of disease vectors like mosquitoes expands, so does the risk of introducing – or reintroducing – these diseases to new, unprepared areas. The findings of this review highlight that these shifts in prevalence, incidence, range and intensity of malaria and a number of NTDs may be felt hardest in those communities already disproportionately impacted by them.",
          "“The findings presented in this major review highlight the need for more comprehensive, collaborative, and standardized modelling, so that we can better understand and predict the effects of climate change on malaria and NTDs, both directly and indirectly,” said Dr Ibrahima Socé Fall, Director of WHO’s Global NTD Programme, who led the study. “This important and timely review reveals alarming trends and is a call to urgent action. Malaria transmission is likely to shift both polewards and to higher altitude, while the mosquito vector responsible for transmission of dengue and chikungunya is predicted to continue to expand its range. If we are to protect and build upon the hard-won victories of the past two decades, the time to mobilize is now.”",
          "Despite this, the paper highlights that published research has too often focused on low-disease burden countries with High Access to Quality Healthcare (using HAQI measurement). Given that the effects of climate change on malaria and NTDs will vary significantly by disease and location, exhibiting non-linear patterns and evolving over time, this focus presents what the Task Team calls a growing emergency for the communities that have been historically underserved in relation to these long-overlooked diseases.",
          "“The climate crisis has the potential to reverse decades of progress in global health and development, said Tala Al-Ramahi, Chief Strategy Officer of Reaching the Last Mile. “Greater investment in research is urgently needed to support the development of timely and evidence-based interventions, and to allow us to anticipate and mitigate the worst consequences of climate change on human health.”",
          "With just 34% of studies reviewed (174 studies) addressing mitigation strategies and 5% (24 studies) looking at adaptation methods, this review further highlights the lack of evidence required to protect the gains made against malaria and NTDs in recent decades. Our collective progress could unravel at the hands of a climate in crisis.",
          "“We have recently seen the consequences of extreme weather events on malaria, and they are only predicted to become more commonplace. The paper provides a clarion call for mitigation and evidence responsive adaptation to climate change,” said Dr Daniel Ngamije Madandi, Director of the WHO’s Global Malaria Programme. “As the impact of climate change is likely to be disproportionately borne by the poorest people, who are also disproportionately affected by malaria and NTDs, a more equitable, comprehensive and sustainable response is needed.”",
          "In order to assess the impact of climate change on malaria and NTDs, this state-of-the-art scoping review analysed peer-reviewed papers and grey literature published between January 2010 and October 2023, with investigators summarizing the identified data and analysing the distribution of studies by country.",
          "In total, 42 693 records were retrieved, from which 1543 full-text papers were examined. Researchers correlated the number of publications with national disease burdens, the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQI), and climate vulnerability scores. Of the 511 papers that met the inclusion criteria, 185 papers addressed malaria, 181 focused on dengue and chikungunya, and 53 reported outcomes on leishmaniasis. Other NTDs, however, were significantly under-represented, having not been sufficiently studied.",

          "New data show that STIs are increasing in many regions. In 2022, WHO Member States set out an ambitious target of reducing the annual number of adult syphilis infections by ten-fold by 2030, from 7.1 million to 0.71 million. Yet, new syphilis cases among adults aged 15-49 years increased by over 1 million in 2022 reaching 8 million. The highest increases occurred in the Region for the Americas and the African Region.",
          "Combined with insufficient decline seen in the reduction of new HIV and viral hepatitis infections, the report flags threats to the attainment of the related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.",
          "“The rising incidence of syphilis raises major concerns”, said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Fortunately, there has been important progress on a number of other fronts including in accelerating access to critical health commodities including diagnostics and treatment. We have the tools required to end these epidemics as public health threats by 2030, but we now need to ensure that, in the context of an increasingly complex world, countries do all they can to achieve the ambitious targets they set themselves”."

          "In an historic milestone for global public health, State Parties today agreed in principle on a large, ground-breaking package of amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005). These amendments build on over 300 proposals made by countries in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. They set out to improve the ability of countries to prepare for, detect and respond to Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEICs), and will be part of a package to be put forward to the World Health Assembly (WHA). The WHA takes place from 27 May–1 June 2024 . Negotiators will meet again next week to wrap up their work on the few remaining issues that need to be finalised.",
          "The IHR, which were first adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1969 and last revised in 2005, were conceived to maximize collective efforts to manage public health events while at the same time minimizing their disruption to travel and trade. They have 196 State Parties, comprising all 194 WHO Member States plus Liechtenstein and the Holy See. These Parties have led the process to amend the IHR through the Working Group on Amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) (WGIHR). Today marked the end of the resumed session of the eighth meeting of the WGIHR .",
          "This process has been running in parallel to an intergovernmental process to develop an international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response . The draft pandemic agreement, with its own Member State-led negotiating process which resumes on 20 May, is also due to go to the World Health Assembly.",
          "“The International Health Regulations have served the world well for nearly 20 years but our collective experience in using this vital tool for the management of multiple public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic, has demonstrated important areas in which they could be strengthened for the benefit of all 196 State Parties,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This is historic. Countries have come together around improved international mechanisms to protect every person in the world and future generations from the impact of epidemics and pandemics, with a commitment to equity and solidarity. I thank all the Member States for their unswerving dedication.”",
          "WGIHR Co-Chair Dr Ashley Bloomfield, of New Zealand, said: “It has been a long but very productive and gratifying process to achieve consensus on the majority of the proposed amendments. This shows the importance the world places on being able to prepare effectively for and respond better to epidemic and pandemic threats, and that there is strong international consensus on how to go about international public health protection.”",
          "Fellow WGIHR Co-Chair, Dr Abdullah Assiri, of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, said: “Amending the International Health Regulations reflects the critical need to bolster our collective defences against current and future public health risks, all whilst firmly adhering to the principle of national sovereignty and respecting equity. Today, we have coalesced around a robust set of amendments which will make international cooperation more effective and easier to implement.”",
          "A potential new pandemic agreement and the amended IHRs would be complementary international instruments designed and negotiated by Member States to help countries protect their peoples better from future pandemic threats. The IHRs focus on building countries’ capacities to detect and respond to public health events which could take on international dimensions, whilst the draft pandemic accord focuses on a coordinated international response to pandemics, with equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics at the centre."

The list provides guidance on the development of new and necessary treatments to stop the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).",

AMR is driven in large part by the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials. The updated BPPL incorporates new evidence and expert insights to guide research and development (R&D) for new antibiotics and promote international coordination to foster innovation.",

          "The critical priority pathogens, such as gram-negative bacteria resistant to last-resort antibiotics, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to the antibiotic rifampicin, present major global threats due to their high burden, and ability to resist treatment and spread resistance to other bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria have built-in abilities to find new ways to resist treatment and can pass along genetic material that allows other bacteria to become drug-resistant as well.",
          "High priority pathogens, such as Salmonella and Shigella , are of particularly high burden in low- and middle-income countries, along with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus , which pose significant challenges in healthcare settings.",
          "Other high priority pathogens, such as antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Enterococcus faecium , present unique public health challenges, including persistent infections and resistance to multiple antibiotics, necessitating targeted research and public health interventions.",
          "Medium priority pathogens include Group A and B Streptococci (both new to the 2024 list), Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Haemophilus influenzae , which present a high disease burden. These pathogens require increased attention, especially in vulnerable populations including paediatric and elderly populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.",

This is crucial for mitigating AMR’s impact on public health and the economy.",

          "WHO recommends the use of TAK-003 in children aged 6–16 years in settings with high dengue burden and transmission intensity. The vaccine should be administered in a 2-dose schedule with a 3-month interval between doses.",
          "“The prequalification of TAK-003 is an important step in the expansion of global access to dengue vaccines, as it is now eligible for procurement by UN agencies including UNICEF and PAHO,” said Dr Rogerio Gaspar, WHO Director for Regulation and Prequalification.  “With only two dengue vaccines to date prequalified, we look forward to more vaccine developers coming forward for assessment, so that we can ensure vaccines reach all communities who need it.”",
          "The WHO prequalification list also includes CYD-TDV vaccine against dengue developed by Sanofi Pasteur.",
          "Dengue is a vector-borne disease transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Severe dengue is a potentially lethal complication which can develop from dengue infections.",
          "It is estimated that there are over 100-400 million cases of dengue worldwide each year and 3.8 billion people living in dengue endemic countries, most of which are in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The largest number of dengue cases reported was in 2023 with the WHO Region of the Americas reporting 4.5 million cases and 2300 deaths. Dengue cases are likely to increase and expand geographically due to climate change and urbanization."

          "Governments of the world today agreed to continue working on a proposed pandemic agreement, and to further refine the draft, ahead of the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly that starts 27 May 2024.",
          "Governments meeting at the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva agreed to resume hybrid and in-person discussions over coming weeks to advance work on critical issues, including around a proposed new global system for pathogen access and benefits sharing (i.e. life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostics); pandemic prevention and One Health; and the financial coordination needed to scale up countries’ capacities to prepare for and respond to pandemics.",
          "\"During more than two years of intensive negotiations, WHO’s Member States have shown unwavering commitment to forging a generational agreement to protect the world from a repeat of the horrors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “I welcome the determination that all countries have shown to continue their work and fulfill the mission on which they embarked.”",
          "The Member State-led Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) was established over two years ago to take this effort forward. The Bureau of the INB, which is guiding the process, will submit its outcome for consideration at the World Health Assembly.",
          "INB Bureau Co-Chair Dr Precious Matsoso, from South Africa, said progress had been made during this latest round of discussions on a wide range of issues contained in the draft agreement.",
          "“We are witnessing history play out before our eyes during this process, with the coming together of all countries to decide a binding pact to protect all citizens of the world,” said Ms Matsoso. “This is not a simple exercise. This is the first ever process to develop a proposed agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. Getting this done means getting it right, and the INB Bureau is committed to help finalize a meaningful, lasting agreement.” Fellow INB Bureau Co-Chair, Mr Roland Driece, from the Netherlands, said when countries launched the process two years ago to develop a pandemic agreement, they did so knowing they had set an ambitious timeline to reach an ambitious goal.",
          "“This unprecedented effort by all WHO Member States was launched in response to an unprecedented global emergency – the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Mr Driece. “These sovereign states did so recognizing that great collaboration and coordination were needed in the face of pandemics. While negotiations have been challenging at times, all countries agree that the world must be better prepared for the next pandemic. It is not a matter of if a pandemic will happen again; it is a matter of when. We cannot afford to miss this historic opportunity to make the world safer from the next pandemic threat.”",
          "In March 2021, heads of state and government from two dozen countries issued a statement of commitment calling for global collaboration to prepare for, prevent and respond to pandemics. In December 2021, WHO Member States decided to launch a global process to draft and negotiate a legally binding convention, agreement or other international instrument to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response."

Negotiations resume on the pandemic agreement on 29 April and continue until 10 May.",
          "During the eighth meeting of the WGIHR, substantial progress on finalizing the package of amendments was made as State Parties reached agreement in critical areas.",
          "WGIHR Co-Chair Dr Ashley Bloomfield said: “The work to bolster our global defenses against public health emergencies and risks, through agreeing a stronger set of International Health Regulations, reflects both the risks our highly interconnected world faces today, and the recognition and readiness of countries to ensure their citizens are better protected.”",
          "Fellow WGIHR Co-Chair, Dr Abdullah Assiri, said the proposed amendments to the IHR are readily implementable and recognize the importance of equity in ensuring effective global response.",
          "“The COVID-19 pandemic showed the world that viruses of pandemic potential do not respect national borders,” Dr Assiri said. “Amending the International Health Regulations reflects the critical need to bolster our collective defenses against current and future public health risks so people’s health, societies and economies can be better protected, all whilst firmly respecting and adhering to the principle of national sovereignty.”",
          "The eighth meeting of the WGHIR will resume in a two-day final session 16-17 May to continue and conclude the work of the Working Group according to its mandate from the Health Assembly",
          "The IHR have 196 State Parties, comprising all 194 WHO Member States plus Liechtenstein and the Holy See. These Parties have led the process to amend the IHR. The Regulations have been negotiated under Article 21 of the WHO Constitution. Any amendment will come into force for all States Parties, after a set period, except for those that notify the WHO Director-General of a rejection or reservation."

In December 2023, the TAG-CO-VAC advised retaining the use of a monovalent XBB.1 descendent lineage, such as XBB.1.5 , as the vaccine antigen. Several manufacturers (using mRNA, protein-based and viral vector vaccine platforms) have developed COVID-19 vaccines with a monovalent XBB.1.5 formulation which have been approved for use by regulatory authorities and introduced into COVID-19 vaccination programmes in some countries.

              "As of April 2024, nearly all (>94%) SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences in publicly available databases are derived from JN.1, and these variants continue to displace existing XBB lineage variants (e.g. EG.5). This displacement indicates greater fitness of JN.1 derived variants as compared to other circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in the human population.",
              "Several JN.1 derived variants (e.g. JN.1.13.1, JN.1.11.1, KP.2) have independently evolved changes in the spike protein at epitopes involving amino acid residues 346 and/or 456. Substitutions at these amino acid residues have been identified in previous SARS-CoV-2 variants (e.g. R346T in BQ.1 and XBB; F456L in EG.5 and HK.3) and are within epitopes known to be targeted by neutralizing antibodies.",
              "Given the displacement of XBB lineage variants by JN.1 derived variants, it is likely that, in the near-term, circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants will be derived from JN.1.",
              "In immunologically naïve animal and human sera, XBB.1.5 and JN.1 are antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants. In non-naïve animals and humans, post-monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination sera, with or without recent prior infection, neutralize XBB.1.5 and its derivatives including EG.5, HK.3, HV.1, as well as BA.2.86 and JN.1. However, neutralization titres against JN.1 in published and unpublished studies were typically lower (2-5-fold) than those against the homologous XBB.1.5 immunizing antigen. There are further reductions in cross neutralization of JN.1 variants with F456L and/or R346T substitutions.",
              "Secondary analysis of published immunogenicity data demonstrates that an additional vaccine dose with an updated vaccine antigen results in an average 40% increase in neutralizing antibodies to that variant as compared to vaccines with a previous vaccine antigen. Using statistical modeling, the predicted additional effectiveness of a vaccine dose with an updated vaccine antigen may be approximately 23-33% against severe disease as compared to a previous vaccine antigen and 11-25% against symptomatic disease.",
              "In a context of high infection- and vaccine-derived immunity in the population, contemporary vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates are mostly relative (rVE), rather than absolute (comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals), and demonstrate the added protection of recent vaccination over and above pre-existing infection- and vaccine-derived immunity: Bivalent (index virus and BA.1- or BA.4/5) mRNA vaccines and a Beta-based protein vaccine continue to offer protection against severe disease during periods of XBB descendent lineage circulation. Protection against symptomatic disease and infection is lower and wanes more rapidly over several months. Monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccines were introduced into some vaccination programmes in the last quarter of 2023. Protection against severe disease during periods of XBB descendent lineage circulation is high during the first three months after vaccination, but protection against symptomatic disease is lower. There are fewer studies estimating rVE for the monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccines during periods of JN.1 descendent lineage circulation. These initial studies show some additional protection offered during the first three months after vaccination, but point towards a slight reduction in VE against JN.1, as compared to XBB.1 lineage variants, for protection against severe and symptomatic disease. These observations are consistent with reductions in neutralizing antibody titres observed in preclinical and clinical immunogenicity studies of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee sera against JN.1 derived variants.",

              "Preclinical data shared confidentially with the TAG-CO-VAC by vaccine manufacturers show that immunization of naïve mice, as well as mice previously immunized with SARS-CoV-2 variants, with monovalent JN.1-containing vaccine candidates elicits higher neutralizing antibody responses to JN.1 and its emerging descendent variants, as compared to responses elicited by currently approved vaccines. A single immunogenicity study in humans of a monovalent JN.1-containing vaccine candidate suggests that a JN.1 vaccine antigen is likely to produce higher neutralising antibodies to co-circulating JN.1 variants (e.g., KP.2) than an XBB.1.5 or related vaccine antigen."

Antibiotic use ranged from 33% for patients in the Western Pacific Region, to 83% in the Eastern Mediterranean and the African Regions. Between 2020 and 2022, prescriptions decreased over time in Europe and the Americas, while they increased in Africa.",

          "“When a patient requires antibiotics, the benefits often outweigh the risks associated with side effects or antibiotic resistance. However, when they are unnecessary, they offer no benefit while posing risks, and their use contributes to the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance,” said Dr Silvia Bertagnolio, WHO Unit Head for Surveillance, Evidence and Laboratory Strengthening, Division for AMR.",
          "“These data call for improvements in the rational use of antibiotics to minimize unnecessary negative consequences for patients and populations.”",
          "Overall, antibiotic use did not improve clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19. But rather, it might create harm for people without bacterial infection, compared to those not receiving antibiotics. This underscores the urgent need to improve the rational use of antibiotics to minimize unnecessary negative consequences for both patients and populations.",

Data was collected from some 450 000 patients admitted to hospitals for COVID-19 in 65 countries over a 3-year period between January 2020 to March 2023. The findings are being presented in a WHO scientific poster shared at the ESCMID Global Congress, taking place in Barcelona, Spain on 27-30 April.",

          "The extensive consultation resulted in the introduction of the following common descriptors to characterize the transmission of pathogens through the air (under typical circumstances):",
          "Individuals infected with a respiratory pathogen can generate and expel infectious particles containing the pathogen, through their mouth or nose by breathing, talking, singing, spitting, coughing or sneezing. These particles should be described with the term ‘infectious respiratory particles’ or IRPs.",
          "IRPs exist on a continuous spectrum of sizes, and no single cut off points should be applied to distinguish smaller from larger particles. This facilitates moving away from the dichotomy of previously used terms: ‘aerosols’ (generally smaller particles) and ‘droplets’ (generally larger particles).",
          "The descriptor ‘through the air’ can be used in a general way to characterize an infectious disease where the main mode of transmission involves the pathogen travelling through the air or being suspended in the air. Under the umbrella of ‘through the air transmission’, two descriptors can be used:",
          "1. Airborne transmission or inhalation, for cases when IRPs are expelled into the air and inhaled by another person. Airborne transmission or inhalation can occur at a short or long distance from the infectious person and distance depends on various factors (airflow, humidity, temperature, ventilation etc). IRPs can theoretically enter the body at any point along the human respiratory tract, but preferred sites of entry may be pathogen-specific.",
          "2. Direct deposition, for cases when IRPs are expelled into the air from an infectious person, and are then directly deposited on the exposed mouth, nose or eyes of another person nearby, then entering the human respiratory system and potentially causing infection.",
          "“This global technical consultation process was a concerted effort of many influential and experienced experts,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India who is a Co-Chair of the WHO Technical Working Group. “Reaching consensus on these terminologies bringing stakeholders in an unprecedented way was no small feat. Completing this consultation gives us a new opportunity and starting point to move forward with a better understanding and agreed principles for diseases that transmit through the air,” added Dr Yuguo Li from the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR (China), who also co-chaired the Technical Working Group.",
          "This consultation was the first phase of global scientific discussions led by WHO. Next steps include further technical and multidisciplinary research and exploration of the wider implementation implications of the updated descriptors."

          "In a historic move, Nigeria has become the first country in the world to roll out a new vaccine (called Men5CV) recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), which protects people against five strains of the meningococcus bacteria. The vaccine and emergency vaccination activities are funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which funds the global meningitis vaccine stockpile, and supports lower-income countries with routine vaccination against meningitis.",
          "Nigeria is one of the 26 meningitis hyper-endemic countries of Africa, situated in the area known as the African Meningitis Belt. Last year, there was a 50% jump in annual meningitis cases reported across Africa.",
          "In Nigeria, an outbreak of Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) serogroup C outbreak led to 1742 suspected meningitis cases, including 101 confirmed cases and 153 deaths in seven of 36 Nigerian states (Adamawa, Bauchi, Gombe, Jigawa, Katsina, Yobe, Zamfara) between 1 October 2023 and 11 March 2024. To quell the deadly outbreak, a vaccination campaign has been undertaken on 25--28 March 2024 to initially reach more than one million people aged 1-29 years.",
          "Meningitis is a serious infection that leads to the inflammation of the membranes (meninges) that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord. There are multiple causes of meningitis, including viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic pathogens. Symptoms often include headache, fever and stiff neck. Bacterial meningitis is the most serious, can also result in septicaemia (blood poisoning), and can seriously disable or kill within 24 hours those that contract it.",
          "“Meningitis is an old and deadly foe, but this new vaccine holds the potential to change the trajectory of the disease, preventing future outbreaks and saving many lives,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General . “Nigeria’s rollout brings us one step closer to our goal to eliminate meningitis by 2030.”",
          "The revolutionary new vaccine offers a powerful shield against the five major strains of the meningococcal bacteria (A, C, W, Y and X) in a single shot. All five strains cause meningitis and blood poisoning. This provides broader protection than the current vaccine used in much of Africa, which is only effective against the A strain.",
          "The new vaccine has the potential to significantly reduce meningitis cases and advance progress in defeating meningitis. This is especially important for countries like Nigeria where multiple serogroups are prevalent. The new vaccine uses the same technology as the meningitis A conjugate vaccine (MenAfriVac®), which wiped out meningococcal A epidemics in Nigeria.",
          "“Northern Nigeria, particularly the states of Jigawa, Bauchi and Yobe were badly hit by the deadly outbreak of meningitis, and this vaccine provides health workers with a new tool to both stop this outbreak but also put the country on a path to elimination,” said Prof. Muhammad Ali Pate of the Nigerian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare . “We’ve done a lot of work preparing health workers and the health system for the rollout of this new vaccine. We got an invaluable support from our populations despite this fasting period and from our community leaders especially the Emir of Gumel in Jigawa state who personally launched the vaccination campaign in the state. We’ll be monitoring progress closely and hopefully expanding the immunization in the coming months and years to accelerate progress.”",
          "This new multivalent conjugate vaccine was 13 years in the making and was based on a partnership between PATH and the Serum Institute of India. Financing from the UK government’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office was critical to its development.",
          "In July 2023, WHO prequalified the new Men5CV vaccine (which has brand name MenFive®) and in October 2023 issued an official recommendation to countries to introduce the new vaccine. Gavi allocated resources for the Men5CV rollout in December 2023, which is currently available for outbreak response through the emergency stockpile managed by the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision, while roll-out through mass preventive campaigns is expected to start in 2025 across countries of the Meningitis Belt.",
          "“The rollout of one million vaccines in northern Nigeria will help save lives, prevent long-term illness and boost our goal of defeating meningitis globally by 2030,” said Andrew Mitchell, UK Minister for Development and Africa. “This is exactly the kind of scientific innovation, supported by the UK, which I hope is replicated in years to come to help us drive further breakthroughs, including wiping out other diseases.”",
          "WHO has been supporting the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) in responding to the meningitis outbreak in the country. This includes disease surveillance, active case finding, sample testing, and case management. WHO and partners have also played a vital role in supporting Nigeria to prepare for the rollout of the new vaccine and training health workers.",
          "“Year after year, meningococcal meningitis has tormented countries across Africa,” said Dr Nanthalile Mugala, PATH's Chief of Africa Region . “The introduction of MenFive® in Nigeria heralds a transformative era in the fight against meningococcal meningitis in Africa. Building on the legacy of previous vaccination efforts, this milestone reflects over a decade of unwavering, innovative partnerships. The promise of MenFive® lies not just in its immediate impact but in the countless lives it stands to protect in the years to come, moving us closer to a future free from the threat of this disease.”",
          "In 2019, WHO and partners launched the global roadmap to defeating meningitis by 2030 .  The roadmap sets a comprehensive vision towards a world free of meningitis, and has three goals:",
          "- elimination of bacterial meningitis epidemics;",
          "- reduction of cases of vaccine-preventable bacterial meningitis by 50% and deaths by 70%; and - reduction of disability and improvement of quality of life after meningitis due to any cause.",
          "“With outbreaks of infectious diseases on the rise worldwide, new innovations such as MenFive® are critical in helping us fight back,\" said Aurélia Nguyen, Chief Programme Officer at Gavi , the Vaccine Alliance, which funds the global stockpile as well as vaccine rollout in lower-income countries. \"This first shipment signals the start of Gavi support for a multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MMCV) program, which, with the required donor funding for our next five years of work, will see pentavalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines rolled out in high-risk countries. Thanks to vaccines, we have eliminated large and disruptive outbreaks of meningitis A in Africa: now we have a tool to respond to other serogroups that still cause large outbreaks resulting in long-term disability and deaths.\"",
          "Following Nigeria’s meningitis vaccine campaign, a major milestone on the road to defeat meningitis is the international summit on meningitis taking place in Paris in April 2024 where leaders will come together to celebrate progress, identify challenges and assess next steps. It is also an opportunity for country leaders and key partners to commit politically and financially to accelerate progress towards eliminating meningitis as a public health problem by 2030."

          "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2024 Global Hepatitis Report , the number of lives lost due to viral hepatitis is increasing. The disease is the second leading infectious cause of death globally -- with 1.3 million deaths per year, the same as tuberculosis, a top infectious killer.",
          "The report, released at the World Hepatitis Summit, highlights that despite better tools for diagnosis and treatment, and decreasing product prices, testing and treatment coverage rates have stalled. But, reaching the WHO elimination goal by 2030 should still be achievable, if swift actions are taken now.",
          "New data from 187 countries show that the estimated number of deaths from viral hepatitis increased from 1.1 million in 2019 to 1.3 million in 2022. Of these, 83% were caused by hepatitis B, and 17% by hepatitis C. Every day, there are 3500 people dying globally due to hepatitis B and C infections.",
          "“This report paints a troubling picture: despite progress globally in preventing hepatitis infections, deaths are rising because far too few people with hepatitis are being diagnosed and treated,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “WHO is committed to supporting countries to use all the tools at their disposal - at access prices - to save lives and turn this trend around.”",
          "Updated WHO estimates indicate that 254 million people live with hepatitis B and 50 million with hepatitis C in 2022. Half the burden of chronic hepatitis B and C infections is among people 30–54 years old, with 12% among children under 18 years of age. Men account for 58% of all cases.",
          "New incidence estimates indicate a slight decrease compared to 2019, but the overall incidence of viral hepatitis remains high. In 2022, there were 2.2 million new infections, down from 2.5 million in 2019.",
          "These include 1.2 million new hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million new hepatitis C infections. More than 6000 people are getting newly infected with viral hepatitis each day.",
          "The revised estimates are derived from enhanced data from national prevalence surveys. They also indicate that prevention measures such as immunization and safe injections, along with the expansion of hepatitis C treatment, have contributed to reducing the incidence."

          "These results fall well below the global targets to treat 80% of people living with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C by 2030. However, they do indicate slight but consistent improvement in diagnosis and treatment coverage since the last reported estimates in 2019. Specifically, hepatitis B diagnosis increased from 10% to 13% and treatment from 2% to 3%, and hepatitis C diagnosis from 21% to 36% and treatment from 13% to 20%.",
          "The burden of viral hepatitis varies regionally. The WHO African Region bears 63% of new hepatitis B infections, yet despite this burden, only 18% of newborns in the region receive the hepatitis B birth-dose vaccination. In the Western Pacific Region, which accounts for 47% of hepatitis B deaths, treatment coverage stands at 23% among people diagnosed, which is far too low to reduce mortality.",
          "Bangladesh, China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Russian Federation and Viet Nam, collectively shoulder nearly two-thirds of the global burden of hepatitis B and C. Achieving universal access to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in these ten countries by 2025, alongside intensified efforts in the African Region, is essential to get the global response back on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goals."

The letter outlined the following key youth asks to parliamentarians to protect the fundamental right to health:",
          "1. Champion political leadership for UHC : Ensure that everyone, everywhere has access to the health services they need, without facing financial hardship. This is a moral imperative and a smart investment that will pay dividends in the form of a healthier, more productive population. 2. Adopt enabling laws and regulations : Recognize the critical link between health and climate change and ensure that health considerations are central to climate change strategies. This includes building climate-resilient health systems and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the health care sector. 3. Invest in UHC : Prioritize primary health care – with a focus on at risk communities – as it can deliver 90% of essential health services. With primary health care, our health systems can be better prepared to prevent and respond to health emergencies thanks to sufficient health workers, lab and data capacity, and basic services that can more rapidly detect and respond to outbreaks while continuing to deliver essential services. 4. Strengthen the health and care workforce : Invest in the education, employment, and retention of health workers, including by addressing existing shortages, and ensure decent pay and working conditions to ensure they are equipped to deliver high-quality health care. 5. Institutionalize social participation in decision-making : Ensure the inclusion of young people in the drafting, implementation, and evaluation of laws and policies that affect their health and wellbeing. This is the best way to ensure inclusive participation leading to policies that address our needs and concerns and trust in public action. 6. Increase transparency and accountability : Make data on UHC and the health impacts of climate change publicly available. This will allow us to track progress, improve accountability, and strengthen trustworthy data sharing. The WHO Youth Council serves as the voice for more than 50 million youth from 22 youth organizations, providing advice on global health and other development issues from a youth perspective."

          "The thirty-eighth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO Director-General on 20 March 2024 with committee members and advisers meeting via video conference with affected countries, supported by the WHO Secretariat. The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in the context of the global target of interruption and certification of WPV1 eradication by 2026 and interruption and certification of cVDPV2 elimination by 2028. Technical updates were received about the situation in the following countries: Afghanistan, Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Indonesia, Liberia, Mozambique, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Sudan."

          "There have been two new cases of WPV1 in Pakistan reported in 2024, both cases were detected in Balochistan province (Chaman and Dera Bugti districts). The significant increase in environmental detections have been sustained with 125 positive samples in 2023 and 34 positive samples to date in 2024. These detections indicate the spread of WPV1 from the endemic zone of Afghanistan (East Region) to other regions in Afghanistan (Balkh, Kabul and Southern provinces centered on Kandahar) to the traditional reservoirs of Pakistan (Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta Block) and neighboring or transit districts.",
          "Both countries have made progress towards interrupting transmission of the two surviving genetic clusters of WPV1 (the YB3C cluster is endemic in Pakistan and the YB3A cluster is endemic in Afghanistan). In 2023, Afghanistan reported six cases of WPV1 belonging to the YB3A cluster from the East Region of the country. The 62 environmental samples that were positive for WPV1 all belong to the YB3A cluster. In 2023, Pakistan reported six cases of WPV1, three WPV1 cases belong to its endemic YB3C cluster whilst the other three WPV1 cases belong to the YB3A cluster closely related to strains circulating in East Region of Afghanistan. Pakistan also detected 125 WPV1 isolates from environmental samples collected during 2023 of which 119 belong to the YB3A cluster and are closely related to the strains circulating in Afghanistan. There is evidence to suggest that some of the YB3A strains detected in Afghanistan in late 2023 were reintroduced into Afghanistan by returnees from Pakistan. The most recent YB3C detection was reported in October 2023. The number of environmental samples in Pakistan tested rose from 1199 in 2022 to 2182 in 2023. In Afghanistan, the number of samples decreased from 698 in 2022 to 521 in 2023 but maintained quality.",
          "The WPV1 epidemiology reported by Afghanistan is incomplete. In late January, shipments, testing and related reporting of WPV1 samples in Afghanistan were suspended due to concern about the testing and notification of a positive WPV1 sample by the Regional Reference Laboratory (RRL) in Islamabad. Following outreach and collaboration, this sample has been referred to the Global Specialized Laboratory (GSL) in Atlanta USA for retesting and has now been confirmed as positive. On 18 March Afghanistan also reported 10 positive environmental samples collected in January. The shipment of samples to the RRL in Islamabad resumed on 15 March. It is estimated that the testing backlog of more than 1400 stool and wastewater samples will be cleared by mid-April 2024.",
          "Both Afghanistan and Pakistan are implementing an intensive and synchronized campaign schedule focusing on improved vaccination coverage in the endemic zones and effective and timely response to WPV1 detections elsewhere in each country. At least 175 million vaccinations are planned for implementation in both countries between January and June 2024. Coverage in the East Region (Nangarhar, Kunar, Nuristan and Laghman) has been strengthened through increased supervision, oversight and monitoring as well as expanded to include children under 10 due to the age profile of the infected children and related historical accessibility challenges in the East Region. Vaccination coverage has also improved in the South Region (Hilmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan, Zabul and Nimrod) through intensified collaboration with humanitarian partners and other modalities but remains suboptimal with an estimated 200 000 children who remain unreached. Across south KP, efforts have focused on access improvement, higher quality surveillance and integrated vaccine delivery in selected Union Councils around North Waziristan and Bannu in particular, whilst enhancing operational coordination and community engagement. Outbreak response elsewhere in Pakistan has focused on the traditional reservoirs and the vaccination of mobile populations including those impacted directly or indirectly by the repatriation of undocumented migrants to Afghanistan.",
          "In addition to seasonal movement patterns within and between both countries, this return of undocumented migrants from Pakistan to Afghanistan has compounded the challenges faced. More than 600 000 returnees have been recorded to date by IOM and UNHCR with estimates of up to 1 700 000 affected. The scale of the displacement increases the risk of cross-border poliovirus spread as well as spread within both countries. This risk is being managed and mitigated in both countries through vaccination at border crossing points and the updating of micro-plans in the districts of origin and return. The programme will continue to closely coordinate with IOM and UNHCR.",
          "Twenty months have now elapsed since the last recorded WPV1 case in Mozambique with onset of paralysis on 10 August 2022. More than two years have now elapsed since the single WPV1 case reported in Malawi. Outbreak response assessments (OBRA) were conducted in Mozambique and Malawi in November 2023. In Mozambique, there are encouraging signs that imported WPV1 transmission has stopped but 12 months of complete surveillance data is not yet available. In Malawi, the OBRA team concluded that imported WPV1 transmission has most likely stopped. Geographic proximity means that the outbreak will be closed together rather than separately. Closure of the outbreak will be by the WHO African Regional office following review by the Regional Commission for Certification."

          "There are five newly reinfected countries reporting cVDPV2 since the last meeting: Angola, Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone and South Sudan. In South Sudan, there has been a new emergence; in the other four countries, reinfection has been due to importation events with Angola importing two different cVDPV2 emergence groups. Furthermore, a new cVDPV2 has been detected in Mozambique. In Côte d’Ivoire, there has been a rapid increase in environmental samples that have tested positive for cVDPV2.",
          "There have been new emergences of cVDPV2 detected in Sudan and Mozambique. In Indonesia there has been a recurrence of cVDPV2, after an interval of 10 months with no detections, with three new cases and an environmental sample testing positive, all with links to Madura Island in East Java. Additionally, there has been a VDPV1 detected in Central Papua which is under further investigation.",
          "There has been no new country reporting cVDPV1.",
          "In 2023, there have been 522 cases confirmed with cVDPV, of which 388 are cVDPV2 and 133 are cVDPV1. The trend is downwards with 882 cVDPV cases in 2022 of which 689 were cVDPV2 and 193 were cVDPV1. Of these 522 cases, 223 (43%) have occurred in the DR Congo. Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Rep. Congo, Egypt, Malawi, Senegal and Sudan have detected cVDPV in the environment but have not detected any cases. In 2024, only Nigeria has detected cases, while Algeria, Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Sudan have detected cVDPV in the environment. Most countries have been infected by imported viruses, while three countries, Zimbabwe, Indonesia and Israel have been infected despite not having used any type of OPV2 prior to detection of cVDPV2.",
          "In 2023, the number of separate cVDPV2 emergence groups detected was 25, of which eight were new emergences, of which six originated from nOPV2. This compares to 19 emergence groups detected in 2022, 28 in 2021, 35 in 2020, and 44 in 2019. There have now been 14 nOPV2 derived emergence groups since 2021.",
          "The committee noted that in the African Region, which now uses novel OPV2 exclusively, there has been a total of 10 new cVDPV2 emergences detected that have emerged from novel OPV2 use, while there has been one such emergence identified in Egypt in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The detection of nOPV2-derived VDPV2 strains, including cVDPV2, is an expected finding with increased nOPV2 use. The vaccine nOPV2 continues to demonstrate significantly higher genetic stability and substantially lower likelihood of reversion to neurovirulence relative to Sabin OPV2. Since first use in March 2021, approximately 821 million doses of nOPV2 have been administered in the African Region. It is estimated that the 10 emergences from AFR represent an 82% lower risk of emergence by nOPV2 than Sabin OPV2 in the African Region.",
          "The committee noted that much of the risk for cVDPV outbreaks can be linked to a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, a high concentration of zero dose and under-immunized children and population displacement. These factors are most evident in northern Yemen, northern Nigeria, south central Somalia and eastern DR Congo, but also in northern Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Mali, South Sudan and Sudan."

The committee noted the current review of the International Health Regulations taking place and that amendments to the Regulations were possible in 2024. The Committee felt it was still too early to discontinue the PHEIC as the risk of exportation of both WPV and cVDPVs remains significant and the removal of the PHEIC may send the wrong message at this critical juncture in polio eradication.",

The committee was concerned by the pause in testing and reporting of polio test results during January and February 2024 that has led to a large backlog of specimens and heightened the risk of undetected transmission and late detections of outbreaks. Given the historically very high standards achieved for surveillance sensitivity and timeliness of detection, avoiding any further recurrence is essential to ensure the timely identification and assessment of risk to inform continued effective vaccination response in Afghanistan. The committee urges all countries to ensure that polio detection and outbreak response is as timely as possible.",

The committee considered that the securing of vaccine supply was a critical issue, and that there should be planning to ensure a more robust vaccine supply beyond admission of a new supplier. While encouraging countries to declare public health emergencies following detection of a new outbreak, such crucial actions need to be supported by the GPEI in ensuring vaccine availability.",
          "Many of the cVDPV infected countries remain conflict affected, disrupting routine immunization. Nevertheless, steps should be taken to increase coverage of the second dose of IPV, to prevent children from being crippled. Front line workers need to be protected from harm during the course of their duties, as the interplay between insecurity, poor polio vaccine coverage, and risk of cVDPV is clear.",

          "A WHO-led multi-agency mission accessed Al-Shifa Hospital in north Gaza on 5 April to conduct a preliminary assessment of the extent of destruction and identify needs to guide future efforts to restore the facility. The highly complex mission was conducted in close partnership with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), United Nations Department for Safety and Security (UNDSS), and in collaboration with the acting Hospital Director.",
          "Prior to the mission, WHO’s efforts to reach the hospital to medically evacuate patients and staff and conduct an assessment were denied, delayed or impeded 6 times between 25 March and 1 April.",
          "Like the majority of the north, Al-Shifa Hospital ­– once the largest and most important referral hospital in Gaza – is now an empty shell after the latest siege. No patients remain at the facility. Most of the buildings are extensively damaged or destroyed and the majority of equipment is unusable or reduced to ashes. The WHO team said that the scale of devastation has left the facility completely non-functional, further reducing access to life-saving health care in Gaza. Restoring even minimal functionality in the short term seems implausible and will require substantial efforts to assess and clear the grounds for unexploded ordnance to ensure safety and accessibility for partners to bring in equipment and supplies.",
          "The hospital’s emergency department, surgical, and maternity ward buildings are extensively damaged due to explosives and fire. The western wall of the emergency department and northern wall of the neonatal intensive care department (NICU) have been torn down. At least 115 beds in what once was the emergency department have been burnt and 14 incubators in the NICU destroyed, among other assets. An in-depth assessment by a team of engineers is needed to determine if these buildings are safe for future use.",
          "The hospital's oxygen plant has been destroyed, leaving Kamal Adwan Hospital as the only source of medical oxygen production in the north. Further comprehensive assessment is essential to evaluate the functionality of vital equipment such as CT scanners, ventilators, sterilization devices, and surgical equipment, including surgical tools and anaesthesia devices. The current situation has left north Gaza without CT scanning capabilities and significantly diminished laboratory capacity, severely compromising effective diagnosis, which will increase avoidable deaths.",
          "Numerous shallow graves have been dug just outside the emergency department, and the administrative and surgical buildings. In the same area, many dead bodies were partially buried with their limbs visible. During the visit, WHO staff witnessed at least 5 bodies lying partially covered on the ground, exposed to the heat. The team reported a pungent smell of decomposing bodies engulfing the hospital compound. Safeguarding dignity, even in death, is an indispensable act of humanity.",
          "According to the acting Hospital Director, patients were held in abysmal conditions during the siege. They endured severe lack of food, water, health care, hygiene and sanitation, and were forced to relocate between buildings at gun point. At least 20 patients have reportedly died due to the lack of access to care and limited movement authorized for health personnel.",
          "Despite deconfliction, yesterday’s mission faced significant delays at the military checkpoint en route to Al-Shifa Hospital. On the same day, another WHO-led mission bound for Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals in northern Gaza – to deliver medical supplies, fuel, deploy emergency medical teams, and support referral of critical patients – encountered unnecessary delays, including the detention of a supply truck driver who was part of the convoy. He was detained for over an hour at a separate location, out of view of the mission team. Eventually this mission was aborted due to safety concerns as the delays left insufficient time for safe completion and return before nightfall.",
          "Between mid-October and end March, over half of all WHO missions have been denied, delayed, impeded or postponed. As health needs soar, the lack of a functional deconfliction system is a major obstacle in delivering humanitarian aid – including medical supplies, fuel, food and water to hospitals – anywhere close to the scale needed.",
          "Six months – half a year – into the war, the destruction of Al-Shifa Hospital and Nasser Medical Complex has broken the backbone of the already ailing health system. Prior to the latest siege, WHO and partners had supported the revival of basic services at Al-Shifa Hospital, and Nasser Medical Complex was regularly supplied to continue serving as the main hospital in south Gaza. These efforts are now lost.",
          "As WHO marks World Health Day tomorrow, under the theme “My health, my right”, this basic right is utterly out of reach for the civilians of Gaza. Access to health care in Gaza has become totally inadequate, and the ability of WHO and partners to help is constantly disrupted and impeded.",
          "Of the 36 main hospitals that used to serve over 2 million Gazans, only 10 remain somewhat functional, with severe limitations on the types of services they can deliver. The proposed military incursion into Rafah can only result in further diminution of access to health care and would have unimaginable health consequences.  The systematic dismantling of health care must end.",
          "WHO repeats its calls for the protection of patients, health and humanitarian workers, health infrastructure, and civilians. Hospitals must not be militarized, misused, or attacked. WHO demands an effective, transparent and workable deconfliction mechanism, and safety guarantees, ensuring that the movement of aid within Gaza, including through checkpoints, is safe, predictable and expedited. WHO calls for additional land crossings to allow access into and across Gaza more safely and directly.",
          "As famine looms, disease outbreaks spread, and traumatic injuries increase, WHO calls for unimpeded access of humanitarian aid into and across the Gaza Strip, and a lasting ceasefire."

          "To mark World Health Day (7 April), the World Health Organization (WHO) is running the “My health, my right” campaign to champion the right to health of everyone, everywhere.",
          "The campaign advocates for ensuring universal access to quality health services, education, and information, as well as safe drinking water, clean air, good nutrition, quality housing, decent working and environmental conditions, and freedom from discrimination.",
          "All around the world, the core challenges consistently compromising the right to health are political inaction coupled with a lack of accountability and funding, compounded by intolerance, discrimination and stigma. Populations facing marginalization or vulnerability suffer the most, such as people who live in poverty, are displaced, are older or live with disabilities.",
          "While inaction and injustice are the major drivers of the global failure to deliver on the right to health, current crises are leading to especially egregious violations of this right. Conflicts are leaving trails of devastation, mental and physical distress, and death.",
          "The burning of fossil fuels is simultaneously driving the climate crisis and violating our right to breathe clean air. The climate crisis is in turn causing extreme weather events that threaten health and well-being across the planet and strain access to services to meet basic needs.",
          "Everyone deserves access to quality, timely and appropriate health services, without being subjected to discrimination or financial hardship. Yet, in 2021, 4.5 billion people, more than half of the world’s population, were not covered by essential health services, leaving them vulnerable to diseases and disasters. Even those who do access care often suffer economically for it, with about 2 billion people facing financial hardship due to health costs, a situation that has been worsening for two decades.",
          "To expand coverage, an additional US$ 200–328 billion a year is needed globally to scale up primary health care in low- and middle-income countries (i.e. 3.3% of national forecast GDP). Progress has shown to be possible where there is political will. Since 2000, 42 countries, representing all regions and income levels, succeeded in improving both health service coverage and protection against catastrophic health spending.",
          "“Realizing the right to health requires governments to pass and implement laws, invest, address discrimination and be held accountable by their populations,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “WHO is working with governments, partners and communities to ensure the highest attainable standard of health, as a fundamental right for all people, everywhere.”",
          "The right to health is enshrined within the WHO Constitution, and at least 140 countries recognize the right to health in their national constitutions. But recognition alone is not enough, which is why WHO supports countries to legislate the right to health across sectors and integrate human rights into health policies and programmes. The aim of this support is to make health services available, accessible and responsive to the needs of the populations they serve and to increase community participation in health decision-making.",
          "On this World Health Day and beyond, WHO is calling for governments to make meaningful investments to scale up primary health care; to ensure transparency and accountability; and to meaningfully involve individuals and communities in decision-making around health. Recognizing the interdependence between the right to health and other fundamental rights, the campaign includes calls to action on finance, agriculture, environment, justice, transport, labour and social affairs.",
          "Individuals, communities and civil society have long defended their right to health, improving access to health care services by breaking down barriers and advocating for equity. WHO urges the public to know, protect and promote their health rights, including those related to safe and quality care, zero discrimination, privacy and confidentiality, information, bodily autonomy, and decision-making."

              "The global cholera rapid diagnostic test procurement programme is a collaboration between Gavi, WHO, UNICEF, FIND, and other partners."

          "The arrival of rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits for cholera in Malawi today signals the start of a global programme that will see more than 1.2 million tests distributed to 14 countries at high risk for cholera over the next several months. Countries that will receive kits in the coming weeks in this largest-ever global deployment include those currently severely impacted by cholera outbreaks, such as Ethiopia, Somalia, Syria, and Zambia. This programme will improve the timeliness and accuracy of outbreak detection and response by boosting routine surveillance and testing capacity and helping rapidly identify probable cholera cases. Critically, it will also help countries monitor trends and build an evidence base for future preventive programmes, supporting the achievement of national cholera control and elimination targets.",
          "The global cholera diagnostics programme is funded and coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), with procurement and delivery to countries led by UNICEF , and undertaken in collaboration with the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC), and WHO . It was developed in partnership with FIND , who led development of a target product profile describing the required characteristics of cholera RDTs, and other organizations. These initial shipments signal the start of the programme, which aims to see partners deploy RDTs to additional countries that have expressed interest in the future. Long-term sustainability of the programme depends on successful fundraising for Gavi’s next strategic period, from 2026 to 2030.",
          "Through this effort, rapid diagnostic tests from two manufacturers – that have to-date been supplied via WHO and UNICEF for use in outbreak response – will now be used routinely for cholera surveillance. Pilot studies across the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Niger and Nepal, funded by Gavi and led by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and Epicentre/ Médecins Sans Frontières have helped increase understanding of effective rapid testing strategies. Preliminary insights from these studies, which are still ongoing, have helped inform programme design – making the rollout of these tests at scale more effective.",
          "Cholera has been surging globally since 2021, with high case fatality rates despite availability of simple, effective and affordable treatment. The large number of outbreaks has led to unprecedented demand for vaccines from impacted countries. While global oral cholera vaccine supply has increased eighteen-fold between 2013 and 2023, the large and sustained spike in demand compared to the current availability has put a strain on the global stockpile. Preventive vaccination campaigns have had to be delayed to preserve doses for emergency outbreak response efforts. Recurring outbreaks in countries where emergency vaccination campaigns have already been implemented further highlight the need for improved speed and accuracy in identifying areas with new or persistent transmission – enabling these areas to be targeted during initial outbreak response efforts.",
          "In 2021, the Gavi Board approved US$ 55 million in funding to support a diagnostics programme between 2022 and- 2025 across cholera, yellow fever, measles, rubella, meningococcal meningitis and typhoid  – with the aim to improve disease surveillance, outbreak detection and response and the design of preventive programmes. Gavi then opened a cholera diagnostics application window in June 2023 – which is still open – and so far 14 countries have submitted applications and been approved by an Independent Review Committee of experts. In 2023, Gavi also launched a preventive cholera vaccination programme, to support countries with long-term cholera control – a strategy that has successfully led to a decrease in outbreaks of diseases such as yellow fever and meningitis.",
          "Cholera is an acute intestinal infection that spreads through food and water contaminated with faeces containing the bacterium Vibrio cholerae .  The rise in cholera is driven by continued gaps in access to safe water and sanitation, and failure to quickly detect outbreaks and limit their spread. The communities impacted often do not have access to basic health services, a situation made worse by climate-related factors, conflict and population displacement. In the face of the ongoing surge, partners working on cholera control have urgently called on countries, manufacturers and other partners to invest in the timely outbreak response and case management, rapid access to treatment, increased production of affordable vaccines, and urgent improvements in access to basic water and sanitation services in impacted communities.",
          "To be effective, these multisectoral strategies for the control of cholera must be guided by timely and reliable cholera surveillance data. Surveillance not only supports the early detection of and quick response to an outbreak, but also plays a central role in providing stakeholders in other cholera prevention and control pillars with the data they need to target, design, implement, and evaluate interventions. In 2023, the GTFCC updated recommendations in favor of strategic, routine and systematic testing of suspected cholera cases and the expanded use of RDTs to strengthen cholera surveillance. The global cholera RDT procurement program provides the additional support required for eligible countries to implement these recommendations.",
          "“We are experiencing an unprecedented multi-year upsurge in cholera cases worldwide, and today’s announcement provides a critical boost in the fight against the disease. The rise in infections is being driven by continued gaps in access to safe water and sanitation, and our inability to reach vulnerable communities that are being put further at risk by climate change, conflict and displacement,” said Aurélia Nguyen , Chief Programme Officer at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “Routine use of diagnostics will bolster cholera surveillance in impacted countries, and must be leveraged to better target vaccination efforts, which play a critical role in multisectoral cholera prevention and control programmes.”",
          "“Despite cholera being preventable and easily treatable, children continue to suffer from this potentially fatal disease. This is why we are working with partners on all fronts and in novel ways to stem outbreaks,” said Leila Pakkala, Director of UNICEF Supply Division . “Surveillance diagnostics help pinpoint hotspots with great precision. This allows partners to target cholera vaccines to exactly the time and place where the limited supply will save the most lives.”",
          "“It’s a tragedy that cholera—a preventable and treatable disease—continues to afflict and kill today. We need urgent action on all fronts, including commitment by countries to clean water, sanitation and hygiene,” said Dr Michael Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme . “WHO welcomes the deployment of these rapid cholera tests. They will equip health workers with the critical and timely data needed to stop outbreaks early and direct efforts to better prevent and treat cholera.”",
          "“Cholera is now spreading to areas that have been free from the disease for many years, demanding a swift, multifaceted strategy to direct limited resources to critical areas and save lives. Accurate and high-quality testing and surveillance measures are vital to spot the disease where it is emerging, confirm cholera cases amidst other diarrheal illnesses, and evaluate the success of preventative measures such as vaccines,” said Dr Sergio Carmona, Acting CEO and Chief Medical Officer at FIND ."

          "S.A.R.A.H. is a Smart AI Resource Assistant for Health that represents an evolution of AI-powered health information avatars, using new language models and cutting-edge technology. It can engage users 24 hours a day in 8 languages on multiple health topics, on any device.",
          "WHO’s digital health promoter is trained to provide information across major health topics, including healthy habits and mental health, to help people optimize their health and well-being journey. It aims to provide an additional tool for people to realize their rights to health, wherever they are.",
          "S.A.R.A.H., also known as Sarah, has the ability to support people in developing better understanding of risk factors for some of the leading causes of death in the world, including cancer, heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes. She can help people access up-to-date information on quitting tobacco, being active, eating a healthy diet, and de-stressing among other things.",
          "“The future of health is digital, and supporting countries to harness the power of digital technologies for health is a priority for WHO,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “S.A.R.A.H. gives us a glimpse of how artificial intelligence could be used in future to improve access to health information in a more interactive way. I call on the research community to help us continue to explore how this technology could narrow inequities and help people access up-to-date, reliable health information.”",
          "S.A.R.A.H. is now powered by generative AI rather than a pre-set algorithm or script helping her to provide more accurate responses in real-time; engage in dynamic personalized conversations at scale that more accurately mirror human interactions and provide nuanced, empathetic responses to users in a judgment-free environment. ​​The technology is supported by Soul Machines Biological AI.",

We are at the finishing line and we are committed to maximizing the remaining negotiations to reach the result the entire world needs.”",
          "In December 2021 , the World Health Assembly met in a Special Session, the second-ever since WHO’s founding in 1948, and decided to establish the INB to draft and negotiate a WHO convention, agreement, or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. The process has involved participation of other United Nations system bodies, non-state actors, other relevant stakeholders, and the public."

Older women and women with disabilities are still subjected to these types of violence, but also face specific risks and additional forms of abuse, sometimes at the hands of caregivers or health care professionals. These include coercive and controlling behaviours such as withholding of medicines, assistive devices or other aspects of care, and financial abuse.",
          "Among women aged 60 years and older, a review conducted by WHO found that physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence remained the most frequently experienced forms of abuse. However, as partners aged, some women reported a shift from predominantly physical and/or sexual violence to psychological violence, including threats of abandonment and other controlling behaviours.",
          "Older women and women with disabilities can be extremely isolated when violence occurs, making it more difficult for them to escape and report the abuse. Stigma and discrimination can further reduce access to services or information, or result in their accounts of violence being dismissed by responders.",
          "“Gender-based violence is rooted in unequal power and control over women,” said Dr Avni Amin, Head of the Rights and Equality across the Life Course Unit at WHO and HRP. “For older women and women with disabilities, their dependency and isolation are further exploited by perpetrators, increasing their risk of abuse. Services must be responsive to their needs and identify appropriate contacts through the health and care systems, so that all women experiencing violence can access empathetic, survivor-centered care.”",
          "WHO recommends several measures to address evidence gaps. Noting that older women are currently represented in only about 10% of data on violence against women, this includes extending the age limit for survey participation. They also suggest incorporating questions relating to different types of violence, encompassing a broad spectrum of disabilities.",
          "The two briefs, Measuring violence against older women and Measuring violence against women with disability , stress that older women and women with disabilities and their representative organizations should be engaged in all phases and aspects of survey design and implementation, to ensure they are appropriate and user-friendly. Formats like Braille or EasyRead can expand accessibility.",
          "The briefs are the first in a series on neglected forms of violence and were developed as part of the UN Women-WHO Joint Programme on Violence against Women Data, through HRP. They are intended for use by researchers, national statistics offices, social care and welfare services and others involved in data collection on violence against women. Funding has been provided from the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.",
          "Alongside the briefs, WHO has developed a survey module to support data collection on violence against older women, to be used alongside existing surveys. Resources to support inclusion of measures of disability in such surveys will be released later in the year."

          "The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and WHO today signed a new Memorandum of Understanding, reaffirming the critical role that parliamentarians play in enabling good health to foster stable and equitable societies.",
          "The new five-year memorandum was signed by Mr Martin Chungong, IPU Secretary General, and Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, at the 148th IPU Assembly , which is taking place in Geneva from 23 to 27 March 2024. Both organizations commit to continue working together to promote, provide and protect the health and well-being of all people, everywhere. It renews a historic commitment made in 2018 to leverage their respective scientific and political mandates to address persistent and emerging challenges facing populations worldwide.",
          "The memorandum reinforces critical areas of cooperation that align with global health priorities, namely universal health coverage, global health security, health promotion and reducing health inequities, especially in relation to sexual and reproductive health and rights.",
          "It also adds new cross-cutting areas of work, including responding to climate change, support to the government-led negotiations on a new pandemic agreement, and sustainable financing for health. This includes collaboration on this year’s first WHO Investment Round to overcome the historic imbalance between assessed and voluntary contributions, the distortions this creates, and the issues WHO faces with insufficiently predictable and flexible financing.",
          "WHO Member States are staging their latest round of negotiations on an international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response before scheduled consideration of a proposal for adoption at the 77 th World Health Assembly in May 2024. The proposed agreement aims to provide a basis for international cooperation that was lacking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parliaments are instrumental in supporting the process towards adoption, as well as in guiding the follow-up considerations at a national level.",
          "Dr Tedros said: “Parliamentarians play an essential role in setting policies, prioritizing investments and ensuring accountability to advance public health. Political leadership in service of the public saves lives and protects health by ensuring communities and countries are better prepared and designed to be healthier and safer. WHO looks forward to working even closer with the IPU and parliamentarians worldwide to advance efforts to protect and promote people’s well-being, from negotiating a pandemic agreement to prevent a repeat of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, to investing in universal health coverage.”",
          "Mr Martin Chungong, IPU Secretary General, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic was not an isolated occurrence. Another pandemic will happen. It is not a question of if, but when. Parliaments have a key role, which is why we will continue working with WHO at all levels to raise awareness among parliamentarians on the pandemic agreement and other global health processes; to give parliamentarians access to technical expertise and information; and to support them to pursue their national health priorities and back them with the necessary legislation and resources.”",
          "Milestones of the IPU and WHO’s previous collaboration include a landmark IPU resolution in 2019 on achieving universal health coverage, a number of practical resources for parliamentarians such as a recent handbook on universal health coverage , and numerous events which have brought together health experts and parliamentarians.",
          "__________",
          "The IPU is the global organization of national parliaments. It was founded in 1889 as the first multilateral political organization in the world, encouraging cooperation and dialogue between all nations. Today, the IPU comprises 180 national Member Parliaments and 15 regional parliamentary bodies. It promotes peace, democracy and sustainable development. It helps parliaments become stronger, younger, gender-balanced and more innovative. It also defends the human rights of parliamentarians through a dedicated committee made up of MPs from around the world.",

          "A high-powered intervention by 23 former national Presidents, 22 former Prime Ministers, a former UN General Secretary and 3 Nobel Laureates is being made today to press for an urgent agreement from international negotiators on a Pandemic Accord, under the Constitution of the World Health Organizaion, to bolster the world’s collective preparedness and response to future pandemics.",
          "Former UN General Secretary Ban-ki Moon, New Zealand’s former Prime Minister Helen Cark, former UK Prime Ministers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, former Malawi President Joyce Banda, former Peru President Franciso Sagasti, and 3 former Presidents of the UN General Assembly are amongst 100+ global leaders, from all continents and fields of politics, economics and health management who today issued a joint open letter urging accelerated progress in current negotiations to reach the world’s first ever multi-lateral agreement on pandemic preparedness and prevention.",
          "“A pandemic accord is critical to safeguard our collective future. Only a strong global pact on pandemics can protect future generations from a repeat of the COVID-19 crisis, which led to millions of deaths and caused widespread social and economic devastation, owing not least to insufficient international collaboration,” the leaders write in their joint letter.",
          "In the throes of the COVID-19 disaster which, officially, claimed 7 million lives and wiped $2 trillion from the world economy, inter-governmental negotiations to reach international agreement on future pandemic non-proliferation were begun in December 2021 between 194 of the world’s 196 nations. Nations set themselves the deadline of May 2024 by which they should reach agreement on what would be the world’s first ever Pandemic Accord.",
          "The Ninth round of Pandemic Accord negotiations are underway this week and next. Signatories of today’s open letter hope their combined influence willencourage all 194 nations to maintain the courage of their Covid-years conviction and make their own collective ambition of an international pandemic protocol a reality by the intended May deadline  to enable ratification by the World Health Assembly at its May 2024 Annual General Assembly.",
          "And they urge negotiators “to redouble their efforts” to meet the imminent deadline and not let their efforts be blown off course by malicious misinformation campaigning against the WHO, the international organisation which would be tasked with implementing the new health accord.",
          "Taking a swipe at those who wrongly believe national sovereignty may be undermined by this major international step forward for public health the signatories say “there is no time to waste” and they call on the leaders of the 194 nations taking part in the current negotiations to “redouble their efforts to complete the accord by the May deadline.”",
          "The letter, hosted on the website of The Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown states, “Countries are doing this not because of some dictum from the WHO – like the negotiations, participation in any instrument would be entirely voluntary – but because they need what the accord can and must offer. In fact, a pandemic accord would deliver vast and universally shared benefits, including greater capacity to detect new and dangerous pathogens, access to information about pathogens detected elsewhere in the world, and timely and equitable delivery of tests, treatments, vaccines, and other lifesaving tools.",
          "“As countries enter what should be the final stages of the negotiations, governments must work to refute and debunk false claims about the accord. At the same time, negotiators must ensure that the agreement lives up to its promise to prevent and mitigate pandemic-related risks. This requires, for example, provisions aimed at ensuring that when another pandemic threat does arise, all relevant responses – from reporting the identification of risky pathogens to delivering tools like tests and vaccines on an equitable basis – are implemented quickly and effectively. As the COVID-19 pandemic showed, collaboration between the public and private sectors focused on advancing the public good is also essential.”",
          "“A new pandemic threat will emerge; there is no excuse not to be ready for it. It is thus imperative to build an effective, multisectoral, and multilateral approach to pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response. Given the unpredictable nature of public-health risks, a global strategy must embody a spirit of openness and inclusiveness. There is no time to waste, which is why we are calling on all national leaders to redouble their efforts to complete the accord by the May deadline.”",
          "“Beyond protecting countless lives and livelihoods, the timely delivery of a global pandemic accord would send a powerful message: even in our fractured and fragmented world, international cooperation can still deliver global solutions to global problems.”"

Actions include investing in access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene, testing and detecting outbreaks quickly, improving quality of and access to healthcare, and fast-tracking additional production of affordable oral cholera vaccine (OCV) doses to better prevent cases.",
          "The ICG manages the global cholera vaccine stockpile. The group includes the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Médecins Sans Frontières, UNICEF and WHO. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, finances the vaccine stockpile and the delivery of OCV. ICG members are calling for governments, donors, vaccine manufacturers, partners and communities to join in an urgent effort to halt and reverse the rise in cholera.",
          "Cholera has been surging globally since 2021, with the 473 000 cases reported to WHO in 2022, more than double those reported in 2021. Preliminary data for 2023 reveal further increases, with over 700 000 cases reported. Several of the outbreaks have high case fatality rates, exceeding the 1% threshold used as an indicator for early and adequate treatment of cholera patients. These trends are tragic given that cholera is a preventable and treatable disease and that cases had been declining in previous years.",
          "Cholera is an acute intestinal infection that spreads through food and water contaminated with faeces containing the bacterium Vibrio cholerae . The rise in cholera is being driven by persistent gaps in access to safe water and sanitation. Although efforts are being made to close these gaps in places, in many others the gaps are growing, driven by climate-related factors, economic insecurity, conflict, and population displacement. Safely managed water and sanitation are prerequisites for stopping the transmission of cholera.",
          "Currently, the most severely impacted countries include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.",
          "Now more than ever, countries must adopt a multisectoral response to fight cholera. Members of the ICG call on currently and potentially affected countries to take urgent steps to ensure their populations have access to clean water, hygiene and sanitation services, and the information critical to prevent cholera’s spread. The establishment of these services requires political will and investment at the country level. This includes creating capacity for early detection and response, enhanced disease detection, rapid access to treatment and care, and working closely with communities, including on risk communication and community engagement.",
          "The severe gap in the number of available vaccine doses, compared with the level of current need, puts unprecedented pressure on the global stockpile of vaccines. Between 2021 and 2023, more doses were requested for outbreak response than the entire previous decade.",
          "In October 2022, the ongoing vaccine shortage necessitated the ICG to recommend a single vaccine dose, down from a previous, long-standing two-dose regimen. Approximately 36 million doses were produced last year, while 14 affected countries registered a need for 72 million doses for a one-dose reactive strategy. These requests understate the true need. Preventive vaccination campaigns have had to be delayed to preserve doses for emergency outbreak control efforts, creating a vicious cycle. The change in strategy enabled available vaccines to protect more people and respond to more cholera outbreaks amid the ongoing supply shortfall, but a return to a two-dose regimen and a resumption of preventive vaccination would provide longer protection.",
          "Global production capacity in 2024 is forecast to be 37-50 million doses but will likely continue to be inadequate to serve the needs of millions of people directly affected by cholera. Only one manufacturer, EuBiologics, currently produces the vaccine; while the company is doing its utmost to maximize output, more doses are needed. Currently, new manufacturers are not expected to join the market before 2025; they must be fast-tracked. The same urgency and innovation that we saw for COVID-19 must be applied to cholera.",
          "Additional manufacturers planning to enter the market need to accelerate their efforts and make doses available at affordable prices.",
          "We appeal to vaccine manufacturers, governments, donors and partners to prioritize an urgent scale-up of vaccine production, and to invest in all the efforts needed to prevent and control cholera."

          "Ahead of World Tuberculosis (TB) Day, which is marked on 24 March, WHO has released an investment case for TB screening and preventive treatment . A modelling study developed with Governments of four countries - Brazil, Georgia, Kenya and South Africa - highlights the impact to be achieved from expanding TB screening and preventive treatment.",
          "The analysis shows that modest investments could lead to significant health and economic benefits in all four countries, with a return on investment up to US$ 39 gained for every dollar invested. The investment case has been released to support countries in advocating for and allocating increased resources to scale-up TB screening and preventive treatment towards reaching new targets committed by Heads of State at the 2023 UN High-Level Meeting on TB.",
          "While global efforts to combat TB have saved an estimated 75 million lives since the year 2000, TB causes 1.3 million deaths each year and affects millions more, with enormous impacts on families and communities.",
          "“The investment case outlines the health and economic rationale for investing in evidence-based, WHO-recommended interventions on TB screening and prevention that can contribute to advancing universal health coverage,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Today, we have the knowledge, tools and political commitment that can end this millennia-old disease that remains one of the world’s top infectious killers”.",
          "According to the investment report, implementing TB screening plus preventive treatment can substantially reduce TB incidence and mortality. It argues that these crucial public health investments are essential for addressing the needs of vulnerable populations and achieving the End TB targets.",
          "In 2022, WHO reported a significant worldwide recovery in the scale-up of access to TB diagnosis and treatment services, with the highest figure recorded since WHO began global TB monitoring in 1995.",
          "However, the scale-up of access to TB preventive treatment has been slow. Preventing TB infection and stopping progression from infection to disease are critical for reducing TB incidence to the levels envisaged by the WHO’s End TB Strategy . To do this, it is vital to offer TB preventive treatment to those with HIV, household contacts of TB patients, and other high-risk groups.",
          "The global number of people living with HIV and household contacts of people with TB who were provided with TB preventive treatment increased to 3.8 million in 2022 or about 60% of those targeted that year in line with the commitments made at the UN High-Level Meeting of 2018.",
          "Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a public health crisis. While an estimated 410 000 people developed multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB) in 2022, only about 2 in 5 people accessed treatment. Progress in the development of new TB diagnostics, drugs and vaccines remains constrained by the overall level of investment in these areas. It is clear much more efforts are needed to combat TB, which remains one of the world’s leading infectious killers.",
          "2024 World Tuberculosis Day is being commemorated under the theme 'Yes! We can end TB!' conveying a message of hope that getting back-on-track to turn the tide against the TB epidemic is possible through high level leadership, increased investments and faster uptake of new WHO recommendations.",
          "Following the commitments made by Heads of State at the UN High-Level Meeting in 2023 to accelerate progress to end TB, this year's focus shifts to turning these commitments into tangible actions. This includes implementing the WHO Director-General’s flagship initiative on TB for 2023-2027.",
          "“The next five years will be critical for ensuring that the political momentum we have now is translated into concrete actions towards reaching global TB targets,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Global Tuberculosis Programme. “WHO will continue to provide global leadership for the TB response, working with all stakeholders until we reach and save every person, family and community impacted by this deadly disease”.",
          "The global targets approved at the 2023 UN High-Level Meeting on TB include: reaching 90% of people in need with TB prevention and care services; using a WHO-recommended rapid test as the first method of diagnosing TB; providing a health and social benefit package to all people with TB; ensuring the availability of at least one new TB vaccine that is safe and effective; and closing funding gaps for TB implementation and research by 2027."

The World Health Organization (WHO) contributed to the analysis of the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor Study (GBD) 2021 data.",
          "Neurological conditions are now the leading cause of ill health and disability worldwide. The overall amount of disability, illness and premature death (known as disability-adjusted life years, DALYs) caused by neurological conditions has increased by 18% since 1990.",
          "Over 80% of neurological deaths and health loss occur in low- and middle-income countries, and access to treatment varies widely: high-income countries have up to 70 times more neurological professionals per 100 000 people than low- and middle-income countries.",
          "“Neurological conditions cause great suffering to the individuals and families they affect, and rob communities and economies of human capital,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This study should serve as an urgent call to action to scale up targeted interventions to allow the growing number of people living with neurological conditions to access the quality care, treatment and rehabilitation they need. It is more important than ever to ensure brain health is better understood, valued and protected, from early childhood to later life.”",
          "The top ten neurological conditions contributing to loss of health in 2021 were stroke, neonatal encephalopathy (brain injury), migraine, dementia, diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage), meningitis, epilepsy, neurological complications from preterm birth, autism spectrum disorder, and nervous system cancers.",
          "Overall, neurological conditions cause more disability and health loss in men compared to women, but there are some conditions like migraine or dementia where women are disproportionately affected.",
          "Since 1990, the absolute number of individuals living with, or dying from, neurological conditions has increased, while age-standardized DALY rates have dropped. This means that increases in absolute numbers are mainly driven by demographic change and people living longer.",
          "Diabetic neuropathy was the fastest growing neurological condition. The number of people with diabetic neuropathy has more than tripled globally since 1990, rising to 206 million cases in 2021. This increase is in line with the worldwide increase in diabetes. Other conditions such as neurological complications from COVID-19 (for example, cognitive impairment and Guillain-Barré syndrome) did previously not exist and now account for over 23 million cases.",
          "At the same time, neurological burden and health loss due to other conditions decreased by 25% or more since 1990 as a result of improved prevention (including vaccines), care and research: tetanus, rabies, meningitis, neural tube defects, stroke, neurocysticercosis (parasitic infection that affects the central nervous system), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and neonatal encephalopathy (brain injury).",
          "The study also examined 20 modifiable risk factors for potentially preventable neurological conditions such as stroke, dementia and idiopathic intellectual disability.",
          "Eliminating key risk factors – most importantly, high systolic blood pressure and ambient and household air pollution – could prevent up to 84% of stroke DALYs. Similarly, preventing exposure to lead could reduce the burden of idiopathic intellectual disability by 63.1%, and reducing high fasting plasma glucose levels could reduce the burden of dementia by 14.6%. Smoking significantly contributed to stroke, dementia and multiple sclerosis risk."

With stagnation in progress towards universal health coverage (UHC), resulting in 4.5 billion people lacking full coverage of essential health services, women may take on even more unpaid care work. The deleterious impact of weak health systems combined with increasing unpaid health and care work are further straining the health of caregivers and the quality of services.",

They pledged to sustainably and equitably address the threat of malaria in the African region, which accounts for 95% of malaria deaths globally.",
          "The Ministers, gathering in Yaoundé, Cameroon, signed a declaration committing to provide stronger leadership and increased domestic funding for malaria control programmes; to ensure further investment in data technology; to apply the latest technical guidance in malaria control and elimination; and to enhance malaria control efforts at the national and sub-national levels.",
          "The Ministers further pledged to increase health sector investments to bolster infrastructure, personnel and programme implementation; to enhance multi-sectoral collaboration; and to build partnerships for funding, research and innovation. In signing the declaration, they expressed their “unwavering commitment to the accelerated reduction of malaria mortality” and “to hold each other and our countries accountable for the commitments outlined in this declaration.”",
          "The Yaoundé conference, co-hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Government of Cameroon, gathered Ministers of Health, global malaria partners, funding agencies, scientists, civil society organizations and other principal malaria stakeholders.",
          "The ministerial conference has four key aims: review progress and challenges in achieving the targets of the WHO global malaria strategy; discuss mitigation strategies and funding for malaria; agree on effective strategies and responses for accelerated malaria mortality reduction in Africa; and establish a roadmap for increased political commitment and societal engagement in malaria control, with a clear accountability mechanism.",
          "“This declaration reflects our shared commitment as nations and partners to protect our people from the devastating consequences of malaria. We will work together to ensure that this commitment is translated into action and impact,” said Hon Manaouda Malachie, Minister for Health of Cameroon.",
          "The African region is home to 11 countries that carry approximately 70% of the global burden of malaria: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania. Progress against malaria has stalled in these high-burden African countries since 2017 due to factors including humanitarian crises, low access to and insufficient quality of health services, climate change, gender-related barriers, biological threats such as insecticide and drug resistance and global economic crises. Fragile health systems and critical gaps in data and surveillance have compounded the challenge.",
          "Funding for malaria control globally is also inadequate. In 2022, US$ 4.1 billion – just over half of the needed budget – was available for malaria response.",
          "Globally the number of cases in 2022 was significantly higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic, rising to 249 million from 233 million in 2019. In the same period, the African region saw an increase in cases from 218 million to 233 million. The region continues to shoulder the heaviest malaria burden, representing 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of global deaths, an estimated 580 000 deaths in 2022.",
          "“Globally, the world has made significant progress against malaria in recent decades and yet, since 2017, that progress has stalled,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “The COVID-19 pandemic and long-standing threats like drug and insecticide resistance pushed us further off-track, with critical gaps in funding and access to tools to prevent, diagnose and treat malaria. With political leadership, country ownership and the commitment of a broad coalition of partners, we can change this story for families and communities across Africa.”",
          "To help accelerate efforts to reduce the malaria burden, WHO and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria launched the “High burden to high impact” approach in 2018, a targeted effort to accelerate progress in countries hardest hit by malaria.",
          "The declaration signed at today’s conference is aligned with the “High burden to high impact” approach, which is founded on four pillars: political will to reduce malaria deaths; strategic information to drive impact; better guidance, policies and strategies; and a coordinated national malaria response.",
          "“Malaria continues to cause preventable deaths in children and great devastation to families across our region. We welcome today’s ministerial declaration, which demonstrates a strong political will to reduce the burden of this deadly disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “With renewed urgency and commitment, we can accelerate progress towards a future free of malaria.”",
          "To put malaria progress back on track, WHO recommends robust commitment to malaria responses at all levels, particularly in high-burden countries; greater domestic and international funding; science and data-driven malaria responses; urgent action on the health impacts of climate change; harnessing research and innovation; as well as strong partnerships for coordinated responses. WHO is also calling attention to the need to address delays in malaria programme implementation."

And while there are cost-effective and evidence-based tools for screening and treatment, fewer than 5% of women in many LMICs are ever screened for cervical cancer. Health system constraints, costs, logistical issues, and lack of political will have created obstacles to implementing comprehensive programs for cervical cancer prevention and treatment.",

          "The World Health Organization’s (WHO) latest HIV Drug Resistance (HIVDR) Report tells us where drug resistance is growing and offers recommendations for countries to monitor and respond to the potential challenges.",
          "The report shares some good news and some concerning news. It highlights high levels of HIV viral load suppression (>90%) in populations receiving dolutegravir (DTG)-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, observational and country-generated survey data indicate that levels of HIVDR to DTG are exceeding levels observed in clinical trials.",
          "Since 2018, WHO has recommended use of dolutegravir as the preferred first- and second-line HIV treatment for all population groups. It is more effective, easier to take, and has fewer side effects than other drugs currently in use. It also has a high genetic barrier to developing drug resistance.",
          "However, among the four surveys reported, levels of resistance to dolutegravir ranged from 3.9% to 8.6%, and reached 19.6% among people experienced with treatment and transitioned to a DTG-containing ART while having high HIV viral loads. To date, only a few countries have reported survey data to WHO.",
          "“The worrying evidence of resistance in individuals with unsuppressed viral load despite dolutegravir treatment underscores the necessity for increased vigilance and intensified efforts to optimize the quality of HIV care delivery,” said Dr Meg Doherty, Director, WHO Department of the Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes. “Standardized surveillance of HIV drug resistance is essential for effectively preventing, monitoring, and responding to these challenges”.",
          "Haiti was the only country to report data from a survey of HIVDR among ART naïve infants or infants starting ART for the first time. One infant, whose mother had received DTG-based ART, was found to have DTG resistance.  Effective management of high viral loads among pregnant and breastfeeding women is critical to prevent transmitting HIV to infants. Increasing routine surveillance for HIVDR among infants newly diagnosed with HIV not yet taking HIV treatment will be important to guide appropriate ART options for the future."

Countries have implemented the WHO recommendations with 116 of 127 having adopted WHO preferred first-line DTG-based treatment for adults and adolescents, and 74% of reporting low- and middle-income countries adopted viral load monitoring for adults and adolescents.",
          "But progress towards the SDG targets has stalled as there were still an estimated 1.3 million new HIV infections and 630 000 deaths from HIV-related causes. Between 2017 and 2022, for most countries reporting through the Global AIDS Monitoring (GAM) system, programmatic quality indicators for HIV treatment did not achieve established global targets, which further highlights the need to proactively improve the quality of HIV treatment and care services.",
          "In 2022, only 12 of 45 WHO focus countries reported conducting surveys or had integrated the monitoring of HIVDR early warning indicators into routine monitoring and evaluation systems. Many countries continue to miss the mark when it comes to optimizing retention in care, population-level viral load suppression, and switching people with virological failure to different regimens. Additionally, antiretroviral drug stock-outs continue to happen which may negatively impact patient treatment adherence.",
          "WHO recommends that countries routinely implement standardized surveillance of HIVDR to follow the prevalence and patterns of resistance among people not achieving suppressed viral load. This is critical, as information and data from surveys influence the development of treatment guidelines and inform the quality of treatment programmes."

Delayed detection and confirmation of HIV infection can increase the risk of developing resistance to INSTIs. Since 2022, WHO has recommended the use of long-acting injectable CAB-LA as an additional HIV prevention option for people at substantial risk of HIV infection.",
          "Despite the possible risk, WHO recommends the roll-out of CAB-LA for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and calls for the scale-up of PrEP to be accompanied by standardized surveillance of drug resistance among people testing positive for HIV while receiving PrEP.",
          "Routine monitoring of quality-of-care indicators at both clinic and national levels, followed by addressing any suboptimal performance, remains a cornerstone for the success of ART programmes. Key quality-of-care indicators include on-time ART pick-up, retention on ART, viral load testing coverage, timely second-viral load test, ARV drug stock-outs and timely switch to second-line ART.",
          "The new HIVDR report emphasizes the importance of strengthening data reporting systems so that countries can effectively monitor and report quality-of-care indicators. It underscores the active engagement by ART clinics and programmes in use of indicator data to develop locally appropriate and sustainable solutions. These efforts are crucial for optimizing service delivery quality, thereby reducing the emergence of drug-resistant HIV.",

          "Adopting a One Health approach that recognizes the health of people is closely connected to the health of animals and our shared environment offers promising solutions for addressing unprecedented challenges. Speaking at the Second Quadripartite Executive Annual Meeting in Nairobi, Kenya today, WHO’s Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “We need sustained political will to ensure One Health principles are embedded in national and international policies. Implementation in countries; resource mobilization; science and evidence; and political will. These are the four priorities that we must pursue together in the year ahead.” Leaders of the four organizations of the Quadripartite collaboration on One Health -- the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the UN Environment Programme, the World Health Organization, and the World Organisation for Animal Health have worked together to advance the One Health approach worldwide. In the meeting today, the organizations reaffirmed their commitment to further enhance the plan’s policy impact and mobilize sustainable resources to support One Health implementation at all levels. The One Health Joint Plan of Action launched in 2022 is designed to integrate systems and capacity so that we can collectively better prevent, predict, detect, and respond to health threats. Ultimately, this initiative seeks to improve the health of humans, animals, plants, and the environment, while contributing to sustainable development. The newly launched One Health Joint Plan of Action Implementation Guide is a cornerstone of the global efforts, providing practical guidance for translating One Health theory into action. The One Health High Level Expert Panel collated existing resources and tools developed the One Health inventory list for the Guide. “The ultimate goal and value of our One Health collaboration lie in effecting positive changes at the country level,” said Dr Amina Benyahia, Head a.i. WHO One Health Initiative.  “By empowering countries, strengthening health systems, and fostering cross-sectoral collaboration, we have the opportunity to drive transformative change from the ground up to achieve improved health and well-being globally.”"

          "“People living with NCDs in humanitarian crises are more likely to see their condition worsen due to trauma, stress, or the inability to access medicines or services. The needs are enormous, but the resources are not,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We must find ways to better integrate NCD care in emergency response, to protect more lives from these avoidable tragedies and improve health security.”",
          "Refugees often face limited access to health care, which can be compounded by poor living conditions, financial difficulties, and precarious legal status. NCDs accounted for a significant proportion of all deaths in the top countries of origin of refugees under UNHCR's mandate: 75% in the Syrian Arab Republic, 92% in Ukraine, 50% in Afghanistan and 28% in South Sudan.",
          "“As forced displacement grows, we must work to ensure the right to health of refugees, other forcibly displaced people and host communities. It is imperative that the policies, and resources are in place to support the inclusion of refugees in national health systems, including for access to care for noncommunicable diseases,” said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. “We must be innovative, and work with governments and partners to respond to such challenges.”"

          "There are many solutions countries and partners are putting in place to save more lives from NCDs among people affected by humanitarian crises. Since 2017, more than 142 000 WHO NCD kits containing various essential treatments for diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and other medicines have been disseminated. Each kit provides affordable, safe and dependable access to lifesaving NCD medicines and supplies for 10 000 people for over three months. These have been distributed to 28 countries affected by conflicts and or natural disasters and placed in humanitarian hubs including Gaza, South Sudan and Ukraine.",
          "Many countries have included policies and services for the prevention and control of NCDs as part of their efforts to strengthen health systems to better prepare for, respond to, and recover from health emergencies. These efforts are aimed at achieving strong and resilient health systems with primary health care (PHC) and universal health coverage (UHC) as a foundation.",
          "However, much more needs to be done. Some specialized services such as dialysis or cancer care require specific planning and adaptations during emergencies, and more insights are needed to better integrate NCDs into emergency preparedness and response. NCDs remain a neglected aspect of humanitarian responses, with significant gaps in technical and operational guidance, lack of capacity and resources.",
          "Today’s global high-level technical consultation provides a critical platform to share best practices for effectively supporting Member States in delivering NCD prevention and control services within humanitarian responses. The outputs of this meeting will contribute to the 2024 progress report to the UN Secretary-General, informing plans for the Fourth UN High-level Meeting on NCDs scheduled for 2025."

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced US$ 4 million in funding from donors to create a catalytic grant fund for organizations working in pathogen genomic surveillance. The fund will support projects across the world, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, to pilot projects and in doing so, create an evidence base for how to quickly scale-up pathogen genomic surveillance. The results of this kind of surveillance help countries and the world to respond more quickly and effectively to prevent outbreaks and to respond to them.",
          "The initial grants for the catalytic fund have been provided by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation and Wellcome, to support the International Pathogen Surveillance Network (IPSN). IPSN is a new global network of pathogen surveillance actors convened by WHO through a Secretariat at the WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence in Berlin. The fund is hosted by the UN Foundation on behalf of the IPSN.",
          "Pathogen genomics analyses the genetic code of viruses, bacteria and other disease-causing organisms to understand, in conjunction with other data, how infectious they are, how deadly they are, and how they spread. With this information, scientists and public health officials can identify and track pathogens to prevent and respond to outbreaks as part of a broader disease surveillance system, and to develop treatments and vaccines.",
          "“Genomic surveillance is a critical tool for countries to respond to public health threats. However, access to genomics has been highly uneven, and there is a risk that the incredible capabilities built up during the COVID-19 pandemic will be lost as the world’s focus shifts,” said Sara Hersey, WHO Director for Collaborative Intelligence. “The new fund will support the sustainable implementation of genomic surveillance in countries at all income levels, outside of pandemics, so that we can maintain these critical capabilities within national health systems.”",
          "“Pathogen genomics and surveillance can tell us which pathogens exist in a population and how they are transmitting and evolving. These are key tools for researchers, policy-makers and health-care workers to rapidly identify and respond to outbreaks or the emergence of drug-resistant strains,” said Wellcome’s Director of Infectious Disease, Alex Pym. “This can have a huge impact on protecting lives – especially in regions with fewer resources. This fund can generate the knowledge on how to move from tracking a pandemic to detecting new threats to public health and ensure that genomic surveillance gets sustainably embedded in healthcare systems.”",
          "“We are proud to stand alongside other donors and partners from the International Pathogen Surveillance Network to seed this important fund,” said Manisha Bhinge, The Rockefeller Foundation’s Vice President for Health. “Pathogen genomics must become accessible to all countries and communities to ensure that we are prepared for rising pandemic and epidemic risks in the era of climate change. I am happy to be chairing the IPSN Funders Forum in support of this critical mission.”",
          "The amount of US$ 4 million will be available for IPSN members to apply for grant funding in February 2024. The fund’s purpose is to empower lower-resource members of the IPSN to create knowledge that can benefit the global genomics surveillance community. This can be done through research to develop pathogen genomics surveillance tools as global goods, or by piloting innovative approaches that generate insights to share across the network. The fund is intended to support equity of engagement across IPSN members and provide catalytic funding for LMICs to scale-up competencies in pathogen genomic surveillance.",

          "WHO led two life-saving missions to transfer 32 critical patients, including two children, from Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza on 18 and 19 February, amid ongoing hostilities and access restrictions. The high-risk missions were conducted in close partnership with the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The team also provided limited supplies of essential medicines and food for the remaining patients and staff who are otherwise cut off from aid.",
          "Four PRCS ambulances ensured the safe transportation of the patients, who underwent medical assessment and triage under the coordination of the hospital director. Patients were moved to the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Younis, Al-Aqsa hospital in Gaza’s middle area, and the International Medical Corps, UAE and Indonesia field hospitals in Rafah.",
          "The transfer of patients was requested by the hospital staff after the facility became non-functional following a military raid on 14 February, after a week-long siege. Weak and frail patients were transferred amidst active conflict near the aid convoy. Road conditions hindered the swift movement of ambulances, placing the health of patients at further risk. Patients transferred during the missions included three suffering from paralysis - two of them with tracheostomy - and several others with external fixators for severe orthopedic injuries. Two of the paralyzed patients required continuous manual ventilation throughout the journey, due to the lack of portable ventilators. A patient with a spinal fracture, previously referred to Nasser by WHO during a mission to Al-Ahli Hospital in northern Gaza, had to be transferred again despite his condition.",
          "Nasser Hospital has no electricity or running water, and medical waste and garbage are creating a breeding ground for disease. WHO staff said the destruction around the hospital was ‘indescribable.’ The area was surrounded by burnt and destroyed buildings, heavy layers of debris, with no stretch of intact road.",
          "An estimated 130 sick and injured patients and at least 15 doctors and nurses remain inside the hospital. As the ICU was no longer functioning, WHO staff transferred the only remaining ICU patient to a different part of the complex where other patients are receiving basic care.",
          "WHO fears for the safety and well-being of the patients and health workers remaining in the hospital and warns that further disruption to lifesaving care for the sick and injured would lead to more deaths. Efforts to facilitate further patient referrals amidst the ongoing hostilities are in process.",
          "Prior to the missions, WHO received two consecutive denials to access the hospital for medical assessment, causing delays in urgently needed patient referral. Reportedly, at least five patients died in the Intensive Care Unit before any missions or transfers were possible.",
          "On 17 February, an UNRWA-led mission, which included WHO staff, delivered 24 000 liters of fuel and limited food and water supplies to the hospital, after not being able to reach it on 16 February due to unforgiving road conditions, including a deep, muddy, impassable ditch 50 meters from the hospital. That day, despite the risks, WHO staff, accompanied by an engineer, managed to reach Nasser Medical Complex on foot. However, they were only permitted to examine the generator, which had ceased functioning after running out of fuel. During both missions, senior WHO staff clearly identified themselves upon entering the hospital compound and requested approval to assess patients and evaluate hospital functionality. These requests were denied.",
          "As the raid continues, any further damage to Nasser Medical Complex will mean even more delays in restoring functionality. The hospital’s large medical warehouse, along with supplies provided by WHO and partners, has burnt down, and the warehouse for day-to-day medical supplies is partly damaged. The WHO-supported limb reconstruction center, housed within the hospital, is no longer operational. These are tragic developments that will further limit access to health care in a context where needs continue to soar.",
          "The dismantling and degradation of the Nasser Medical Complex is a massive blow to Gaza’s health system. Facilities in the south are already operating well beyond maximum capacity and are barely able to receive more patients.",
          "WHO repeats its calls for the protection of patients, health workers, health infrastructure, and civilians. Hospitals must not be militarized, misused, or attacked.",
          "WHO reiterates its calls for all parties to uphold international humanitarian law and the principles of precaution, distinction, and proportionality, and to ensure sustained access so hospitals can continue providing lifesaving care.",

          "Today, on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, we reaffirm our dedication to the girls and women who have been subjected to this grave violation of human rights. Every survivor's voice is a call to action, and every choice they make in reclaiming their lives contributes to the global movement to end this harmful practice.",
          "More than 200 million girls and women alive today have undergone female genital mutilation. This year, nearly 4.4 million girls will be at risk of it. This equates to more than 12 000 cases every day.",
          "In keeping with the commitments outlined in the Beijing Declaration and platform for action, those agreed during the 25 th Anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD25), Generation Equality, and other normative frameworks including The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and their general recommendations, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals (target 5.3), we reiterate our commitment to prevent and respond to female genital mutilation.",
          "Female genital mutilation is a violation of women’s and girls’ rights, one that endangers their physical and mental health and limits their potential to lead healthy and fulfilling lives. It increases their risk of serious pain, bleeding and infections and the likelihood of other health complications later in life, including risks during childbirth, which can imperil the lives of their newborns.",
          "That is why, in our pursuit of a world free of discrimination and practices that harm girls and women, it is imperative that we turn our attention to the voices that matter most – the voices of survivors.",
          "We must amplify the voices of survivors to raise awareness and inspire collective action, and promote their power and autonomy by ensuring they have an active role in prevention and response interventions.",
          "Survivors have first-hand knowledge of the challenges and the tools needed to eliminate the practice. It is crucial that we invest in survivor-led movements, especially at the grassroots level, by dedicating resources that will advance their efforts.",
          "We also must ensure that comprehensive and culturally sensitive services are available and accessible. This includes strengthening the provision of health care and social and legal services to support survivors.",
          "UNFPA and UNICEF , as the lead agencies of the Global Joint Progamme on Eliminating FGM , OHCHR , UN Women , WHO , and other United Nations entities remain steadfast in partnering with survivors as community champions and leaders, while ensuring their voices and perspectives inform programmes to prevent and respond to FGM. Indeed, investing in movement-building and promoting girls’ and women’s agency is at the core of the UN Joint Programme on Eliminating FGM.",
          "We celebrate progress that has been achieved: The practice of FGM has been declining over the last three decades, and in the 31 countries with nationally representative prevalence data, around 1 in 3 girls aged 15 to 19 today have undergone the practice versus 1 in 2 in the 1990s.",
          "As of last year, the Joint Programme supported more than 11 000 organizations, of which 83 per cent were grassroots organizations partnering with coalitions and survivor-led movements, advocating for changes in policies and laws, and championing changes to social and gender norms.",
          "Yet there is an urgent need for even more targeted, coordinated and sustained efforts if we are to achieve our common goal of ending female genital mutilation by 2030. Together, led by survivors, we can consign this harmful practice to history, once and for all."

WHO also published survey results from 115 countries, showing a majority of countries do not adequately finance priority cancer and palliative care services, as part of universal health coverage (UHC).",
          "The IARC estimates, based on the best sources of data available in countries in 2022, highlight the growing burden of cancer, the disproportionate impact on underserved populations, and the urgent need to address cancer inequities worldwide.",

The estimated number of people who were alive within 5 years following a cancer diagnosis was 53.5 million. About 1 in 5 people develop cancer in their lifetime, approximately 1 in 9 men and 1 in 12 women die from the disease.",
          "The global WHO survey on UHC and cancer shows that only 39% of participating countries covered the basics of cancer management as part of their financed core health services for all citizens, ‘health benefit packages’ (HBP). Only 28% of participating countries additionally covered care for people who require palliative care, including pain relief in general, and not just linked to cancer."

          "Lung cancer was the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide with 2.5 million new cases accounting for 12.4% of the total new cases. Female breast cancer ranked second (2.3 million cases, 11.6%), followed by colorectal cancer (1.9 million cases, 9.6%), prostate cancer (1.5 million cases, 7.3%), and stomach cancer (970 000 cases, 4.9%).",

Lung cancer’s re-emergence as the most common cancer is likely related to persistent tobacco use in Asia.",
          "There were some differences by sex in incidence and mortality from the global total for both sexes. For women, the most commonly diagnosed cancer and leading cause of cancer death was breast cancer, whereas it was lung cancer for men. Breast cancer was the most common cancer in women in the vast majority of countries (157 of 185).",

For women, lung and colorectal cancer were second and third for both the number of new cases and of deaths.",

In countries with a very high HDI, 1 in 12 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and 1 in 71 women die of it. By contrast, in countries with a low HDI; while only one in 27 women is diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, one in 48 women will die from it.",
          "“Women in lower HDI countries are 50% less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women in high HDI countries, yet they are at a much higher risk of dying of the disease due to late diagnosis and inadequate access to quality treatment,” explains Dr Isabelle Soerjomataram, Deputy Head of the Cancer Surveillance Branch at IARC.",
          "WHO’s global survey of HBPs also revealed significant global inequities in cancer services. Lung cancer-related services were reportedly 4–7 times more likely to be included in a HBP in a high-income than a lower-income country. On average, there was a four-fold greater likelihood of radiation services being covered in a HBP of a high-income than a lower-income country. The widest disparity for any service was stem-cell transplantation, which was 12 times more likely to be included in a HBP of a high-income than a lower-income country.",
          "“ WHO’s new global survey sheds light on major inequalities and lack of financial protection for cancer around the world, with populations, especially in lower income countries, unable to access the basics of cancer care ,” said Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Director of the Department of Noncommunicable Diseases at WHO. “WHO, including through its cancer initiatives, is working intensively with more than 75 governments to develop, finance and implement policies to promote cancer care for all. To expand on this work, major investments are urgently needed to address global inequities in cancer outcomes.”"

          "Over 35 million new cancer cases are predicted in 2050, a 77% increase from the estimated 20 million cases in 2022. The rapidly growing global cancer burden reflects both population ageing and growth, as well as changes to people’s exposure to risk factors, several of which are associated with socioeconomic development. Tobacco, alcohol and obesity are key factors behind the increasing incidence of cancer, with air pollution still a key driver of environmental risk factors.",
          "In terms of the absolute burden, high HDI countries are expected to experience the greatest absolute increase in incidence, with an additional 4.8 million new cases predicted in 2050 compared with 2022 estimates. Yet the proportional increase in incidence is most striking in low HDI countries (142% increase) and in medium HDI countries (99%). Likewise, cancer mortality in these countries is projected to almost double in 2050.",
          "“The impact of this increase will not be felt evenly across countries of different HDI levels. Those who have the fewest resources to manage their cancer burdens will bear the brunt of the global cancer burden,” says Dr Freddie Bray, Head of the Cancer Surveillance Branch at IARC.",
          "“Despite the progress that has been made in the early detection of cancers and the treatment and care of cancer patients–significant disparities in cancer treatment outcomes exist not only between high and low-income regions of the world, but also within countries. Where someone lives should not determine whether they live. Tools exist to enable governments to prioritise cancer care, and to ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality services. This is not just a resource issue but a matter of political will,” says Dr Cary Adams, head of UICC - Union for International Cancer Control.",

The platform provided a much-needed forum for technology partners to voluntarily share intellectual property, knowledge, and data in order to accelerate technological innovation and expand access to COVID-19 tools.",
          "Despite the challenges faced in establishing a novel mechanism during a pandemic with limited resources, C-TAP secured 6 transparent, non-exclusive global licenses involving 15 technologies that span R&D tools, diagnostics, and vaccines –  including the first from a private manufacturer. HTAP builds on the foundation laid by C-TAP while incorporating structural, process and other changes that will enable it to attract and support a diverse range of priority technologies more effectively.",
          "“Equitable access to essential health products is an essential part of universal health coverage, and of global health security,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Building on what we have learned from C-TAP, the Health Technology Access Pool is an important step towards more equitable access to a broad range of health products through the sharing of intellectual property, knowledge and scientific innovation.”",
          "HTAP will promote access to health products that respond to public health priorities including pandemic preparedness and with relevance during and outside health emergencies. This approach will amplify the public health value of HTAP investments as well as the attractiveness of licensed technologies to recipient manufacturers by realizing greater market opportunities and financial sustainability. The announcement on the licensing of a rapid diagnostic test platform technology serves as an example of such an approach.",

          "The allegations of involvement of several UNRWA staff in the heinous attacks on Israel on 7 October are horrifying. As the Secretary-General has said, any UN employee involved in acts of terror will be held accountable. However, we must not prevent an entire organization from delivering on its mandate to serve people in desperate need. The harrowing events that have been snowballing in Gaza since 7 October have left hundreds of thousands of people homeless and on the brink of famine. UNRWA, as the largest humanitarian organization in Gaza, has been providing food, shelter and protection, even as its own staff members were being displaced and killed. Decisions by various Member States to pause funds from UNRWA will have catastrophic consequences for the people of Gaza. No other entity has the capacity to deliver the scale and breadth of assistance that 2.2 million people in Gaza urgently need. We appeal for these decisions to be reconsidered. UNRWA has announced a full, independent review of the organization, and the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight Services has been activated. Withdrawing funds from UNRWA is perilous and would result in the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza, with far-reaching humanitarian and human rights consequences in the occupied Palestinian territory and across the region. The world cannot abandon the people of Gaza."

          "WHO has awarded its first-ever certificates validating progress in eliminating industrially produced trans fatty-acids to five countries. Denmark, Lithuania, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand have each demonstrated they have a best practice policy for industrially produced trans-fatty acids (iTFA) elimination in effect, supported by adequate monitoring and enforcement systems. WHO also released results from the first five years of its REPLACE initiative to eliminate iTFA.",
          "While the ambitious target set by WHO in 2018—to fully eliminate iTFA from the global food supply by the end of 2023—was not met, there has been remarkable progress made towards this goal in every region of the world. In 2023 alone, new best-practice policies became effective in 7 countries (Egypt, Mexico, Moldova, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Philippines, and Ukraine).",
          "Trans-fatty acids (TFA) are semisolid to solid fats that occur in two forms: industrially produced and naturally occurring. Intake of TFA is associated with increased risk of heart attacks and death from heart disease. TFA have no known health benefits, and foods high in iTFA (e.g. fried foods, cakes and ready meals) are often high in sugar, fat and salt.",
          "A total of 53 countries have now best practice policies in effect for tackling iTFA in food, vastly improving the food environment for 3.7 billion people, or 46% of the world’s population, as compared to 6% just 5 years ago. These policies are expected to save approximately 183 000 lives a year.",
          "“Trans fat has no known health benefit, but huge health risks,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “We are very pleased that so many countries have introduced policies banning or limiting trans fat in food. But introducing a policy is one thing; implementing it is another. I congratulate Denmark, Lithuania, Poland, Saudi Arabia and Thailand, who are leading the world in monitoring and enforcing their trans fat policies. We urge other countries to follow their lead.”",
          "Accelerating efforts to achieving best-practice policies in just 8 countries with the highest needs would eliminate 90% of the global iTFA burden, representing a unique opportunity to see in our lifetime a world free from deaths attributable to iTFA.",
          "The WHO validation programme for iTFA elimination recognizes those countries which went beyond introducing best practice policies by ensuring rigorous monitoring and enforcement systems in place. Monitoring and enforcing compliance with policies is critical to maximizing and sustaining the health benefits of iTFA elimination.",
          "Best practices in iTFA elimination policies follow WHO criteria and limit iTFA use in all settings. There are two best-practice policy options: 1) mandatory national limit of 2 grams of iTFA per 100 grams of total fat in all foods; and 2) mandatory national ban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated oils (a major source of trans fat) as an ingredient in all foods. For some countries, an optimal programme would implement both policies, due to the sources of trans fat.",
          "“Trans fat elimination is economically, politically, and technically feasible and saves lives at virtually no cost to governments or consumers. This harmful compound is unnecessary, and no one misses it when it’s gone,” said Dr Tom Frieden, President and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives. \"We are winning the battle against trans fat, but countries without regulations are at risk of becoming dumping grounds for TFA products. Governments and the food industry have a responsibility to ensure that doesn’t happen.\"",
          "WHO also encourages food manufacturers—the producers of raw materials and final food products—to eliminate iTFA from their products. The food industry has made good progress so far, as presented in a November 2023 WHO repor t.",
          "Despite recent successes in eliminating iTFA from food globally, over half of the world's population remain unprotected from its harmful impacts, thus putting them at a potential risk of increasing heart disease.",

          "Together, we must do more to eliminate the stigma associated with leprosy and promote the dignity of those affected by the disease.",
          "Stigma contributes to hesitancy to seek treatment, putting people at risk of disabilities and contributing to ongoing transmission. Eliminating leprosy therefore requires not only renewed political commitment and access to services to treat it, but also awareness raising to mitigate stigma and increase social participation for those affected by leprosy.",

Across the Gaza Strip, the few remaining hospitals find themselves in ever more dire circumstances, with hostilities often preventing access for patients and supplies, and health workers managing on little rest and scarce supplies.",

          "Yesterday‘s mission, which delivered 19 000 liters of fuel to Al-Shifa Hospital, faced delays at the checkpoint. The roads leading to the hospital were severely damaged, and the desperation in northern Gaza was apparent, as thousands of civilians surrounded the UN vehicles and fuel truck in the hopes of finding food and water, also delaying the mission.",
          "In Al-Shifa Hospital, the mission saw that the functionality has improved since the last visit ten days ago. A significant decrease in the number of displaced people, from 40 000 to 10 000 was observed. There are 120 health and care workers, and 300 patients. The hospital conducts 5-10 surgeries daily, mainly trauma cases that require immediate care.",
          "Essential services such as basic laboratory and radiological facilities remain operational, along with emergency care, a surgical unit with three operation theaters, post-operative care, and a dialysis unit. There are plans to reopen a 9-bed ICU over the coming days.",
          "There are no maternity or pediatric services, and shortages of specialized doctors, medicines, and medical supplies such as orthopedic equipment. These units could become operational again, but will require a consistent supply of fuel, oxygen, medical supplies, and other aid.",
          "The hospital’s primary oxygen plant has been destroyed. They are relying on a smaller plant.",
          "Seven out of 24 hospitals remain open in northern Gaza. These are only partially functioning, without enough specialized medical staff to manage the volume and range of injuries, nor sufficient medicines and medical supplies, fuel, clean water, or food for patients or staff. Additionally, two Ministry of Health primary healthcare centers in northern Gaza are partially functional but lack essential supplies, including syringes and vaccines needed for routine immunization.",
          "Intensified military presence and hostilities in southern Gaza are also placing patients and health workers at risk, and compromising access to health care. They are severely obstructing the movement of health workers, ambulances, and health partners' ability to resupply hospitals, eroding their functionality. WHO staff say the situation for hospitals in Khan Yunis is “catastrophic and indescribable.”",
          "In southern Gaza, which used to have 12 hospitals, only 7 remain partially functional. A further two, Al-Kheir Hospital and Nasser Medical Complex, are only minimally functional and now inaccessible.",
          "WHO is extremely concerned about reports of Al-Kheir Hospital, a small NGO-run hospital with around 30 beds, facing military incursions and several health workers being detained. Communication with the hospital is no longer possible.",
          "Due to evacuation orders in neighborhoods surrounding Nasser Medical Complex--the largest hospital in the south--and continuous hostilities in the vicinity of the hospital, the Ministry of Health reports that large numbers of wounded people are on the hospital grounds.",
          "An international emergency medical team deployed at Nasser says that no one can enter or exit the facility due to ongoing bombardment close by.",
          "Health staff are reported to be digging graves on hospital grounds due to the large numbers of deaths anticipated and the need to manage dead bodies. This horrifying situation should never take place in any hospital.",

          "The report shows that 150 countries are successfully reducing tobacco use. Brazil and the Netherlands are seeing success after they implemented MPOWER tobacco control measures, with Brazil making a relative reduction of 35% since 2010 and the Netherlands on the verge of reaching the 30% target.",
          "“Good progress has been made in tobacco control in recent years, but there is no time for complacency. I’m astounded at the depths the tobacco industry will go to pursue profits at the expense of countless lives. We see that the minute a government thinks they have won the fight against tobacco the tobacco industry seizes the opportunity to manipulate health policies and sell their deadly products,\" says Dr Ruediger Krech, Director of WHO Department of Health Promotion.",
          "WHO urges countries to continue putting in place tobacco control policies and continue to fight against tobacco industry interference.",
          "Currently the WHO South-East Asian Region has the highest percentage of population using tobacco at 26.5% with the European Region not far behind at 25.3%. The report shows that by 2030 the WHO European Region is projected to have the highest rates globally with a prevalence of just over 23%. Tobacco use rates among women in WHO’s European region are more than double the global average and are reducing much slower than in all other regions.",
          "While the numbers have steadily decreased over the years the world will make it to a 25% relative reduction in tobacco use by 2025, missing the voluntary global goal of 30% reduction from the 2010 baseline. Only 56 countries globally will reach this goal, down four countries since the last report in 2021 .",
          "The prevalence of tobacco use has changed little since 2010 in some countries, while six countries are still seeing tobacco use rising: Congo, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Oman, and Republic of Moldova.",
          "WHO urges countries to accelerate efforts for tobacco control as there is still much work to be done. “The Global Tobacco Industry Interference Index 2023” , published by STOP and the Global Center for Good Governance in Tobacco Control, show that efforts to protect health policy from increased tobacco industry interference have deteriorated around the world.",
          "Country surveys consistently show that children aged 13–15 years in most countries are using tobacco and nicotine products. To protect the future generations and ensure that tobacco use continues to decline, WHO will dedicate this year’s World No Tobacco Day to Protecting children from tobacco industry interference.",
          "Next month countries are set to meet in Panama for the 10th Session of WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Conference of Parties where the tobacco industry will try to influence global health policies by offering financial and in-kind incentives , interfering with countries rights to protect the health of their populations. Strengthening the WHO FCTC is a global health priority outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals. WHO stands ready to support countries in defending evidenced based tobacco control measures in the face of industry interference."

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) today launched an appeal for US$ 1.5 billion to protect the health of the most vulnerable populations in 41 emergencies around the globe in 2024.",
          "The appeal covers the emergencies that demand the highest level of response from WHO, with the aim to reach over 87 million people. It is being issued in a context of complex emergencies cutting across crises of conflict, climate change and economic instability, which continue to fuel displacement, hunger, and inequality.",
          "“For those facing emergencies, disruptions to essential health services often mean the difference between life and death. From mothers giving birth during conflict, to aid to young children in drought-affected regions, to those receiving cancer treatment or dialysis, health care saves lives. Health-care services are also critical for breaking the cycle that too often leaves communities in a perilous state and reliant on yet more emergency assistance,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.",
          "Support in 2024 will enable life-saving health care, distribution of critical health supplies and equipment, along with maintenance of essential health services to ensure continuous care. The funding supports direct access to health care for communities in hard-to-reach areas, in partnerships with local organizations, and effective response to monitor, share information and document outbreaks and attacks on health workers. Other important actions are maintenance of existing health-care systems and building resilience against future threats.",
          "The appeal notes the positive value of funding to supporting people with humanitarian needs. Every US$ 1 invested in WHO delivers a return on investment of at least US$ 35.",
          "The funding would go to the African Region, with US$ 334 million; the Eastern Mediterranean Region, with US$ 705 million; the European region, with US$ 183 million; the Western Pacific Region, with US$ 15.2 million; the South-East Asia Region, with US$ 49 million; and the Americas Region, with US$ 131 million.",
          "“With the support of donors, we will save lives, meet critical health needs for the most vulnerable, and help communities emerge from crises with a greater ability to tackle future health threats. WHO appreciates all support received in 2023, which allowed us to assist millions of people. As we enter 2024, the solidarity and support of the international community is needed more than ever,” said Dr Tedros."

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) has certified Cabo Verde as a malaria-free country, marking a significant achievement in global health. With this announcement, Cabo Verde joins the ranks of 43 countries and 1 territory that WHO has awarded this certification.",
          "Cabo Verde is the third country to be certified in the WHO African region, joining Mauritius and Algeria which were certified in 1973 and 2019 respectively. Malaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounted for approximately 95% of global malaria cases and 96% of related deaths in 2021.",
          "Certification of malaria elimination will drive positive development on many fronts for Cabo Verde.  Systems and structures built for malaria elimination have strengthened the health system and will be used to fight other mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever. Travellers from non-malaria endemic regions can now travel to the islands of Cabo Verde without fear of local malaria infections and the potential inconvenience of preventive treatment measures. This has the potential to attract more visitors and boost socio-economic activities in a country where tourism accounts for approximately 25 per cent of GDP.",
          "“I salute the government and people of Cabo Verde for their unwavering commitment and resilience in their journey to eliminating malaria,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “WHO’s certification of Cabo Verde being malaria-free is testament to the power of strategic public health planning, collaboration, and sustained effort to protect and promote health. Cabo Verde's success is the latest in the global fight against malaria, and gives us hope that with existing tools, as well as new ones including vaccines, we can dare to dream of a malaria-free world.”",
          "Certification of malaria elimination is the official recognition by WHO of a country’s malaria-free status. The certification is granted when a country has shown – with rigorous, credible evidence – that the chain of indigenous malaria transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes has been interrupted nationwide for at least the past three consecutive years.  A country must also demonstrate the capacity to prevent the re-establishment of transmission.",
          "“The certification as a malaria-free country has a huge impact, and it's taken a long time to get to this point. In terms of the country's external image, this is very good, both for tourism and for everyone else. The challenge that Cabo Verde has overcome in the health system is being recognised”, said the Cabo Verde´s Prime Minister, Ulisses Correia e Silva.",
          "Cabo Verde, an archipelago of 10 islands in the Central Atlantic Ocean, has faced significant malaria challenges. Before the 1950s, all islands were affected by malaria. Severe epidemics were regular occurrences in the most densely populated areas until targeted interventions were implemented. Through the targeted use of insecticide spraying, the country eliminated malaria twice: in 1967 and 1983. However, subsequent lapses in vector control led to a return of the disease. Since the last peak of malaria cases in the late 1980s, malaria in Cabo Verde has been confined to two islands: Santiago and Boa Vista, which have now both been malaria-free since 2017.",
          "“Cabo Verde’s achievement is a beacon of hope for the African Region and beyond. It demonstrates that with strong political will, effective policies, community engagement and multisectoral collaboration, malaria elimination is an achievable goal,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “The attainment of this milestone by Cabo Verde is an inspiring example for other nations to follow.”",
          "Cabo Verde's journey to malaria elimination has been long and received a boost with the inclusion of this objective in its national health policy in 2007. A strategic malaria plan from 2009 to 2013 laid the groundwork for success, focusing on expanded diagnosis, early and effective treatment, and the reporting and investigating all cases. To stem the tide of imported cases from mainland Africa, diagnosis and treatment were provided free of charge to international travellers and migrants.",
          "In 2017 the country turned an outbreak into an opportunity. Cabo Verde identified problems and made improvements, leading to zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years.",
          "During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the country safeguarded progress; efforts focused on improving the quality and sustainability of vector control and malaria diagnosis, strengthening malaria surveillance - especially at ports, airports, in the capital city and areas with a risk of malaria re-establishment.",
          "Collaboration between the Ministry of Health and various government departments focused on the environment, agriculture, transportation, tourism, and more, played a pivotal role in Cabo Verde's success. The inter-ministerial commission for vector control, chaired by the Prime Minister was key to elimination. The collaborative effort and the commitment of community-based organizations and NGOs demonstrate the importance of a holistic approach to public health.",
          "As Cabo Verde celebrates this monumental achievement, the global community commends its leaders, healthcare professionals, and citizens for their dedication to eliminating malaria and creating a healthier future for all."

As the malaria\r\ncommunity celebrates this victory, let it also serve as a call to action for\r\nurgent, sustained efforts and collaboration in the pursuit of malaria\r\neradication and a world where no one suffers from this disease again.”",

This milestone is not only a victory for Cabo Verde, but also for the global community as we strive to eliminate malaria worldwide. Yet, with global cases now 16 million higher than before the pandemic, we must not waiver in our commitment to invest in, implement, and innovate new strategies and tools.”",

Our heartfelt congratulations to our friends in this archipelago of the Central Atlantic for this momentous achievement; we look forward to countries in Asia Pacific joining them in malaria free status in the near future.”",
