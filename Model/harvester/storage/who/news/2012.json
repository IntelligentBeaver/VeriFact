    "content_html": "<p>A revolutionary meningitis vaccine will reach the 100 millionth person this week in a region of Africa that has been plagued by deadly epidemics for more than a century. The milestone will take place in northern Nigeria, part of Africa’s ‘meningitis belt’, where the country is conducting its second seasonal immunization campaign against the disease.</p>\n<p>The historic achievement comes two years after the MenAfriVac® vaccine was first launched in Burkina Faso. Since then, nine other countries have held vaccination campaigns to protect people from ages 1 to 29 against meningitis A.</p>\n<p>Nigeria will vaccinate 16 million people over the next two weeks and Cameroon and Chad are also conducting immunization campaigns this week targeting 5.5 million and 2.3 million people respectively. By the end of this year, the vaccine will have reached more than 112 million people, providing widespread and long-awaited protection.</p>\n<h4>GAVI Alliance Partners’ Forum</h4>\n<p>The achievement will be recognized at the GAVI Alliance Partners’ Forum, which is bringing together developing countries, donors, civil society, technical and research institutes, health agencies and the vaccine industry this week in Dar es Salaam, the capital of the United Republic of Tanzania.</p>\n<p>“When we began developing this vaccine, we knew how desperately it was needed, and we hoped it would quickly provide relief for the many people who dread sub-Saharan Africa’s meningitis season,” said Steve Davis, president and CEO of PATH, which partnered with WHO to create MenAfriVac®. “We are so proud to see African countries quickly embrace this vaccine and to see that deadly and debilitating meningitis cases have virtually disappeared in the regions that have been vaccinated.”</p>\n<p>“This milestone has been achieved thanks to the commitment of national governments and support from WHO and other partners,” said Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General for Family, Women and Children’s Health. “We must continue our efforts to implement vaccination campaigns in the remaining meningitis belt countries and ensure widespread uptake of the MenAfriVac vaccine.”</p>\n<p>“Meningitis is a terrible disease which kills young people, creates severe neurological damage in many survivors, and devastates communities,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI Alliance, which is providing funding for the vaccines being used in the campaigns. “It is nothing short of remarkable that exactly two years after the first GAVI-funded meningitis vaccination campaign in the meningitis belt, the 100 millionth will have their life protected.”</p>\n<p>“The development of MenAfriVac as a low-cost vaccine was critically important for the global health community,” said Chris Elias, president of Global Development at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. “Vaccines work to save and improve lives and the speed with which the governments in meningitis-affected countries have introduced this new vaccine to protect young people is exemplary.”</p>\n<p>“Meningitis A epidemics have affected the poorest families in countries of the Sahel, in the worst cases killing one third of the affected community,” said Geeta Rao Gupta, Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF. “But now campaigns are bringing hope to the poor families of previously unreached communities, which are mobilizing their members around this safe, effective and affordable vaccine.”</p>\n<h4>Seasonal meningitis A epidemics in ‘meningitis belt’</h4>\n<p>Seasonal meningitis A epidemics threaten the lives of 450 million people living in the ‘meningitis belt’, which stretches through 26 countries from Gambia in the west to Eritrea in the east. The disease causes a painful inflammation of the lining around the brain and the spine that can kill people within 24 to 48 hours. Those who survive often face severe learning difficulties, deafness, or amputated limbs. Children and young adults are most at risk.</p>\n<p>In the largest-ever seasonal epidemic in Africa’s history, in 1996-1997, meningitis A infected 250 000 people and killed 25 000. In 1997, African ministers of health appealed to WHO and other partners to find a lasting solution to the dreadful disease.</p>\n<h4>Meningitis Vaccine Project formed</h4>\n<p>In 2001, PATH and WHO formed the Meningitis Vaccine Project to develop a vaccine that would tackle the meningococcus strain that causes meningitis A at a price that African countries could afford. Historically, new vaccines have either not been designed to cover variants of diseases found in developing countries or have been too expensive for developing countries to include in their immunization schedules. The partners worked with the Serum Institute of India Ltd. to develop and manufacture the vaccine at a cost of less than US$0.50 per dose.</p>\n<h4>MenAfriVac® has reduced cases of meningitis A</h4>\n<p>The vaccine has already significantly reduced the burden of meningitis in the regions where it has been introduced. In Burkina Faso, which launched the inaugural MenAfriVac® campaign in December 2010, there were no cases of meningitis A among those who were vaccinated.</p>\n<p>“This vaccine is having a tremendous impact on the lives of people in some of the world’s most vulnerable towns and villages,” Berkley said. “The partners involved in developing this vaccine deserve tremendous credit for ensuring the right vaccine is available at the right price.”</p>\n<p>On October 31, 2012, MenAfriVac® received approval to be kept outside the cold chain for up to four days at up to 40°C, in a controlled temperature chain (CTC). MenAfriVac® is the first vaccine intended for use in Africa approved for this type of use, potentially setting a regulatory path that other heat-stable vaccines can follow.</p>\n<p>Cold chain limitations have posed logistical challenges for MenAfriVac® and other vaccine programmes, increasing programme costs, delaying roll-outs, limiting access to “last mile” communities and allowing outbreaks to continue. Benin launched the pilot project using the new CTC approach during its roll-out of the vaccine from 15–25 November 2012.</p>\n<p>Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sudan, have all conducted campaigns with the MenAfriVac® vaccine since its introduction in 2010.</p>\n<h4>About GAVI</h4>\n<p>The GAVI Alliance is a public-private partnership committed to saving children’s lives and protecting people’s health by increasing access to immunisation in developing countries. The Alliance brings together developing country and donor governments, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, the vaccine industry, technical agencies, civil society, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other private philanthropists. GAVI uses innovative finance mechanisms, including co-financing by recipient countries, to secure sustainable funding and adequate supply of quality vaccines. Since 2000, GAVI has financed the immunisation of an additional 370 million children and prevented more than 5.5 million premature deaths.</p>\n<p>GAVI is funded by governments (Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Korea, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States), the European Commission, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as private and corporate partners (Absolute Return for Kids, Anglo American plc, The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, Comic Relief, His Highness Sheikh Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, JP Morgan, “la Caixa” Foundation, LDS Charities).</p>\n<h4>About the World Health Organization</h4>\n<p>WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system. It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, improving global health security, providing technical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health trends.</p>\n<h4>About PATH</h4>\n<p>PATH is an international nonprofit organization that transforms global health through innovation. PATH takes an entrepreneurial approach to developing and delivering high-impact, low-cost solutions, from lifesaving vaccines, drugs, and devices to collaborative programs with communities. Through its work in more than 70 countries, PATH and its partners empower people to achieve their full potential.</p>\n<h4>About UNICEF</h4>\n<p>UNICEF works in 190 countries and territories to help children survive and thrive, from early childhood through adolescence. The world’s largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments</p>",

      "description": "A revolutionary meningitis vaccine will reach the 100 millionth person this week in a region of Africa that has been plagued by deadly epidemics for more than a century. The milestone will take place in northern Nigeria, part of Africa’s ‘meningitis belt’, where the country is conducting its second seasonal immunization campaign against the disease.The historic achievement comes two years after the MenAfriVac® vaccine was first launched in Burkina Faso. Since then, nine other countries have held vaccination campaigns to protect people from ages 1 to 29 against meningitis A.Nigeria will vaccinate 16 million people over the next two weeks and Cameroon and Chad are also conducting immunization campaigns this week targeting 5.5 million and 2.3 million people respectively. By the end of this year, the vaccine will have reached more than 112 million people, providing widespread and long-awaited protection.GAVI Alliance Partners’ ForumThe achievement will be recognized at the GAVI Alliance Partners’ Forum, which is bringing together developing countries, donors, civil society, technical and research institutes, health agencies and the vaccine industry this week in Dar es Salaam, the capital of the United Republic of Tanzania.“When we began developing this vaccine, we knew how desperately it was needed, and we hoped it would quickly provide relief for the many people who dread sub-Saharan Africa’s meningitis season,” said Steve Davis, president and CEO of PATH, which partnered with WHO to create MenAfriVac®. “We are so proud to see African countries quickly embrace this vaccine and to see that deadly and debilitating meningitis cases have virtually disappeared in the regions that have been vaccinated.”“This milestone has been achieved thanks to the commitment of national governments and support from WHO and other partners,” said Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General for Family, Women and Children’s Health. “We must continue our efforts to implement vaccination campaigns in the remaining meningitis belt countries and ensure widespread uptake of the MenAfriVac vaccine.”“Meningitis is a terrible disease which kills young people, creates severe neurological damage in many survivors, and devastates communities,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI Alliance, which is providing funding for the vaccines being used in the campaigns. “It is nothing short of remarkable that exactly two years after the first GAVI-funded meningitis vaccination campaign in the meningitis belt, the 100 millionth will have their life protected.”“The development of MenAfriVac as a low-cost vaccine was critically important for the global health community,” said Chris Elias, president of Global Development at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “Vaccines work to save and improve lives and the speed with which the governments in meningitis-affected countries have introduced this new vaccine to protect young people is exemplary.”“Meningitis A epidemics have affected the poorest families in countries of the Sahel, in the worst cases killing one third of the affected community,” said Geeta Rao Gupta, Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF. “But now campaigns are bringing hope to the poor families of previously unreached communities, which are mobilizing their members around this safe, effective and affordable vaccine.”Seasonal meningitis A epidemics in ‘meningitis belt’Seasonal meningitis A epidemics threaten the lives of 450 million people living in the ‘meningitis belt’, which stretches through 26 countries from Gambia in the west to Eritrea in the east. The disease causes a painful inflammation of the lining around the brain and the spine that can kill people within 24 to 48 hours. Those who survive often face severe learning difficulties, deafness, or amputated limbs. Children and young adults are most at risk.In the largest-ever seasonal epidemic in Africa’s history, in 1996-1997, meningitis A infected 250 000 people and killed 25 000. In 1997, African ministers of health appealed to WHO and other partners to find a lasting solution to the dreadful disease.Meningitis Vaccine Project formedIn 2001, PATH and WHO formed the Meningitis Vaccine Project to develop a vaccine that would tackle the meningococcus strain that causes meningitis A at a price that African countries could afford. Historically, new vaccines have either not been designed to cover variants of diseases found in developing countries or have been too expensive for developing countries to include in their immunization schedules. The partners worked with the Serum Institute of India Ltd. to develop and manufacture the vaccine at a cost of less than US$0.50 per dose.MenAfriVac® has reduced cases of meningitis AThe vaccine has already significantly reduced the burden of meningitis in the regions where it has been introduced. In Burkina Faso, which launched the inaugural MenAfriVac® campaign in December 2010, there were no cases of meningitis A among those who were vaccinated.“This vaccine is having a tremendous impact on the lives of people in some of the world’s most vulnerable towns and villages,” Berkley said. “The partners involved in developing this vaccine deserve tremendous credit for ensuring the right vaccine is available at the right price.”On October 31, 2012, MenAfriVac® received approval to be kept outside the cold chain for up to four days at up to 40°C, in a controlled temperature chain (CTC). MenAfriVac® is the first vaccine intended for use in Africa approved for this type of use, potentially setting a regulatory path that other heat-stable vaccines can follow.Cold chain limitations have posed logistical challenges for MenAfriVac® and other vaccine programmes, increasing programme costs, delaying roll-outs, limiting access to “last mile” communities and allowing outbreaks to continue. Benin launched the pilot project using the new CTC approach during its roll-out of the vaccine from 15–25 November 2012.Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sudan, have all conducted campaigns with the MenAfriVac® vaccine since its introduction in 2010.About GAVIThe GAVI Alliance is a public-private partnership committed to saving children’s lives and protecting people’s health by increasing access to immunisation in developing countries.

More investment into health care for women and children in the last decade when the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were set, contributed to more rapid progress for the survival of mothers (2.3% per year) and children under the age of five (2.1% per year) than for newborns (1.7% per year).</p><p>According to the new figures, newborn deaths, that is deaths in the first four weeks of life (neonatal period), today account for 41% of all child deaths before the age of five.

The new study found that in part because of their large populations, more than half of these deaths now happen in just five large countries – India, Nigeria, Pakistan, China and Democratic Republic of the Congo. India alone has more than 900,000 newborn deaths per year, nearly 28% of the global total. Nigeria, the world’s seventh most populous country, now ranks second in newborn deaths up from fifth in 1990. This is due to an increase in the total number of births while the risk of newborn death has decreased only slightly.

This experience of running population-scale mobile projects will be vital to the initiative,” said Dr Oleg Chestnov, WHO Assistant Director-General for Noncommunicable Diseases and Mental HealthWHO and ITU Member States are also testing mobile solutions for NCDs – ranging from providing assistance to help people quit tobacco, helping people increase their activity levels, eating more healthily and helping patients with noncommunicable diseases better manage their conditions. All of these experiences will feed into the new initiative.The ITU-WHO mHealth Initiative, which will initially run for a 4-year period and focus on prevention, treatment and enforcement to control noncommunicable diseases, will work with partnerships at all levels. At the global level, partners will share knowledge and technical expertise to help develop the standard operating procedure for each mHealth intervention as well as build support for the Initiative. At the national level, governments work closely with the Initiative to accelerate the roll out of operational projects.The joint ITU-WHO work plan is a direct follow up to the high level meeting on the prevention and control of NCDs convened by the United Nations General Assembly in New York in 2011 where world leaders and the UN community agreed to pay greater attention to finding ways to deal with the growing global spread of NCD’s and UN agencies agreed to work together to prevent and control NCDs and their risk factors.",

    "content_html": "<p>More strategic use of antiretroviral HIV medications can significantly reduce the transmission of the virus according to WHO proposals that will be presented at the XIX International AIDS Conference in Washington, DC on Sunday.</p><p>“Every year, more than a million more people in low- and middle-income countries start taking antiretroviral drugs,” said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General, WHO. “But for every person who starts treatment, another two are newly infected. Further scale-up and strategic use of the medicines could radically change this. We now have evidence that the same medicines we use to save lives and keep people healthy can also stop people from transmitting the virus and reduce the chance they will pass it to another person.”</p><h3>Antiretrovirals reduce transmission of HIV</h3><p>In 2011, a large multi-country study by the HIV Prevention Trials Network showed that antiretrovirals (ARVs) cut transmission of HIV by 96% within couples where one partner is HIV-positive and the other is not infected. A later study in South Africa reinforced these findings.</p><p>“When people take antiretrovirals, the amount of HIV in their body is decreased, making them much less likely to pass the virus to others,” says Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of the HIV Department at WHO. “If we can get, and keep, more people on treatment, and reduce their virus levels, we can reduce the number of new people who are infected.”</p><h3>Strategic use of antiretrovirals</h3><p>On the basis of this evidence, WHO advice for more strategic use of antiretrovirals includes:</p><ul><li>new guidelines for treating people with HIV who have uninfected partners (‘serodiscordant’ couples), recommending that antiretroviral therapy be offered to the HIV-positive partner, regardless of the strength of his or her immune system, to reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission to the uninfected partner. Up to 50% of HIV-positive people in on-going relationships are estimated to have HIV-negative partners. Rwanda and Zambia are already implementing this new policy. More than a dozen other countries say they plan to join them.</li><li>a recommendation to consider modifying current practices to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). Malawi, for example, now offers ARVs to all HIV positive pregnant women, regardless of the strength of their immune system, and has them continue taking the medicines for life. This not only treats HIV infected women and prevents transmission to their infants, it can also protect their partners.</li><li>WHO currently recommends that people diagnosed with HIV start taking ARVs when the strength of their immune system drops to a CD4+ count of 350 cells/mm3 or lower. There is increasing evidence that HIV infection causes chronic inflammation, increasing the risk of other health problems, including certain types of cancers, heart disease and diabetes.

In addition, she said that the biggest challenge over the next five years will be to lead WHO in ways that will help maintain the unprecedented momentum for better health that marked the start of this century.</p><p><b>WHO reform:</b> Member States discussed reform proposals in three areas: programmes and priority setting, governance and management. Delegates reaffirmed support for the Director-General's reform agenda, reiterating the need for comprehensive reform, for WHO to become more effective in its normative and technical assistance role and to improve accountability and transparency. They encouraged greater focus on results and enhanced governance. Proposals around improving monitoring of WHO’s work were welcomed.</p><p>Delegates expressed broad acceptance of the proposed five categories: communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases, health through the life-course, health systems, and preparedness, surveillance and response. Member States emphasized that WHO should increase the focus on the social, economic and environmental determinants of health. The delegates requested the Secretariat to show how health determinants will be given priority in the next draft of the Organization’s General Programme of Work, which will be reviewed at the year’s Regional Committee meetings.</p><h3>The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Member States include:</h3><p><b>Early marriages and young pregnancies:</b> More than 30% of girls in developing countries are married before the age of 18, and 14% before the age of 15. Many delegates requested that WHO continues raising awareness of the problem of early marriage and adolescent pregnancy and its consequences for young women and their infants.</p><p>Several Member States noted the importance of implementing laws and policies and strengthening sexuality education. Some countries said that “one size does not fit all” and that family and community social norms must be considered. The Secretariat confirmed that it will work with Regional Offices to adapt the guidelines to public health realities country-by-country.</p><p><b>Humanitarian emergencies:</b> The World Health Assembly adopted a resolution reaffirming the central role of health in humanitarian response and strongly endorsing WHO’s role as Health Cluster Lead Agency. It calls on Member States and donors to allocate sufficient resources for health sector activities during humanitarian emergencies and for strengthening WHO’s capacity to exercise its role as Lead Agency both at global and country levels. The resolution also calls on WHO to provide Member States and humanitarian partners with predictable support during emergencies, by coordinating rapid assessments, the development of strategies and action plans, and monitoring the health situation.   </p><p><b>International Health Regulations: </b>The Health Assembly reviewed the annual report on the implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005). State Parties were making fair progress in 2011 for a number of core capacities, notably surveillance, response, laboratory and zoonotic events. Most regions reported relatively low capacities in human resources and preparedness for chemical and radiological events. Many State Parties have requested or will request a two-year extension to the mid-2012 deadline for establishing core capacities under IHR. The delegates referred to difficulties in implementing measures related to points of entry and in engaging stakeholders outside the health sector.</p><p><b>Mass gatherings: </b>The Health Assembly received the report by the Secretariat on “Global mass gatherings: implications and opportunities for global health security”. The discussions were led by delegates from areas which have hosted mass gatherings recently or on a regular basis. Delegates expressed the need to exchange lessons learned on preparedness and management and Member States also stressed the need for efficient preventive measures and interventions.</p><p><b>Millennium Development Goals:</b> Member States endorsed the report on the progress and achievements of the health-related Millennium Development Goals and health goals after 2015. While the pace of progress has accelerated in many Member States, it was also acknowledged that more still needs to be done in the remaining three years to achieve the goals.</p><p>A second report on The Commission on Information and Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health, established at the request of the United Nations Secretary-General’s in the context of the Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health, presented 10 recommendations to improve accountability in countries and globally. The focus is on the 75 countries which together account for more than 95% of all maternal and child deaths in the world. Many countries and global partners have made specific commitments to accelerate action towards the achievement of MDG 4 (reduce child mortality) and 5 (improve maternal health). </p><p><b>Noncommunicable diseases:</b> The Health Assembly adopted several resolutions and decisions on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs):</p><ul><li>Delegates approved the development of a global monitoring framework for the prevention and control of NCDs, including indicators and a set of global targets. Member States agreed to adopt a global target of a 25% reduction in premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases by 2025.</li><li>Another resolution focuses on strengthening NCD policies to promote active ageing. The resolution urges Member States to encourage the active participation of older people in society, increase healthy ageing and promote the highest standard of health and well-being for older persons by addressing their needs.</li><li>The building of partnerships at national and global levels are essential components of multisectoral action against NCDs. Member States discussed ways to prevent NCDs through action involving other sectors than health to prevent premature deaths and to reduce exposure to risk factors for NCDs, mainly tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity.</li><li>Delegates also received a report on the progress of the implementation of the global action plan for the prevention of avoidable blindness and visual impairment.</li><li>Member States acknowledged the need for a comprehensive, coordinated response to addressing mental disorders from health and social sectors at the country level. The delegates recognized this includes approaches such as programmes to reduce stigma and discrimination, reintegration of patients into workplace and society, support for care providers and families, and investment in mental health from the health budget.</li></ul><p><b>Occupied Palestinian territory: </b>The World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on the health conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory including east Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan. The need for full coverage of health services was reaffirmed while recognizing that the acute shortage of financial and medical resources is jeopardizing access of the population to curative and preventive services.</p><p><b>Pandemic influenza preparedness:</b> Member States acknowledged that the pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP) framework is a crucial development for global health security, based on the lessons from the 2009 influenza pandemic. Delegates recognized that industry and other partners play important roles in the development of vaccines to counter outbreaks.</p><p>Delegates agreed on a 70% and 30% share of resources between preparedness and response respectively, but that this would be regularly reviewed. They welcomed the role of the framework’s advisory group, but stressed the need for extra resources – both human and financial – to support WHO capacity and leadership.</p><p><b>Intensification of the global polio eradication initiative:</b> The delegates acknowledged that polio eradication is at a tipping point between success and failure and necessary funding is essential to ensure success. In this regard, Member States declared the completion of polio eradication a programmatic emergency for global health.</p><p><b>Research and development:</b> The Health Assembly welcomed the report of the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development: Financing and Coordination containing recommendations for securing new funds for health research and development on diseases that affect people in developing countries. It adopted a resolution to hold Member States’ consultations at national, regional and global levels to analyze the report and the feasibility of the recommendations.</p><p><b>Schistosomiasis:</b> Delegates adopted a resolution to support countries in evaluating interruption of transmission and preventing its re-emergence during the post-elimination phase. They also discussed the need for a health-systems approach, involving public-private partnerships, to ensure availability of drugs and their development.</p><p><b>Social determinants of health: </b>The Health Assembly endorsed the Rio Political Declaration and its recommendations. It approved measures to support the five priority actions recommended in the declaration to address social determinants of health. The measures will lead to, among other things, greater collaboration between UN and partner agencies and more support for Member States to adopt an inclusive ‘health-for-all’ approach.</p><p><b>Substandard/spurious/falsely-labelled/falsified/counterfeit medical products:</b>Delegates approved a draft resolution on a new Member State mechanism proposing international cooperation on substandard, spurious, falsely-labelled, falsified or counterfeit (SSFFC) medical products. Many countries stressed the need for strengthening regulatory authorities and the critically important role that WHO plays in enhancing regional and international networking among the regulators. Emerging channels of distribution such as Internet sales pose a significant threat and require specific solutions. Representatives of NGOs and the pharmaceutical sector expressed their support for the mechanism.</p><p><b>Progress reports:</b> The delegates also received progress reports in six areas: strengthening of health systems; disease eradication, prevention and control; reproductive health; food safety initiatives; climate change and health; partnerships and multilingualism.</p><p>The World Health Assembly is held annually in Geneva, Switzerland and is the decision-making body of the WHO. It is attended by delegations from all WHO Member States and focuses on a specific health agenda prepared by the Executive Board.

      "description": "The Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly concluded Saturday after adopting 21 resolutions and three decisions on a broad range of health issues. The six days of discussions involved nearly 3000 delegates, including health ministers and senior health officials from amongst the 194 WHO Member States, as well as representatives from civil society and other stakeholders.The agenda covered some of the biggest challenges and opportunities facing public health today.“As challenges, let me mention noncommunicable diseases and ageing, maternal and child health, under- and over- nutrition, the eradication of polio and health demands during humanitarian emergencies,” said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. “As opportunities, let me mention immunization, and the decade of vaccines, and the new multisectoral strategies made possible when we take a social determinants approach.”The Health Assembly opened with delegates noting the tremendous achievements in health in recent decades and the emergence of global solidarity around health. Multiple Member States supported the concept of universal health coverage. “Universal health coverage is the single most powerful concept that public health has to offer,” added Dr Chan.“Public health should be one of the top priorities in our development projects, because without health, no development is possible,” says Professor Thérèse N’Dri-Yoman, Minister of Health of Côte d’Ivoire and the elected President of the Health Assembly. “It was clear from all the presentations that the best and safest way to reduce inequalities in health-care delivery in our countries, either poor or rich, is by implementing universal health coverage.”Reappointment of Dr Margaret Chan: At the World Health Assembly, Dr Margaret Chan was appointed for a second five-year term as Director-General of WHO with 98% of the Member States’ votes.

The report explains what is known about preterm birth, its causes, and the kinds of care that are needed.</p><p>The lead authors of the report from The March of Dimes Foundation, The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health, Save the Children and The World Health Organization, offer a detailed plan for the actions needed to reduce both the death toll and the numbers of preterm births.</p><h4>First-ever country figures for a large, but neglected problem</h4><p>Preterm births have been an overlooked and neglected problem, world health leaders say.</p><p>“All newborns are vulnerable, but preterm babies are acutely so,” says UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who wrote the foreword to the report and considers the effort to reduce preterm births and deaths an integral part of his <em>Global strategy for women’s and children’s health</em>.</p><p>“Being born too soon is an unrecognized killer,” says Joy Lawn, M.D., PhD, co-editor of the report and Director, Global Evidence and Policy for Save the Children. “Preterm births account for almost half of all newborn deaths worldwide and are now the second leading cause of death in children under 5, after pneumonia.”</p><p>New figures in the report show both the magnitude of the problem and the disparities between countries. Of the 11 countries with preterm birth rates over 15%, all but 2 are in sub-Saharan Africa. Preterm births account for 11.1% of the world's live births, 60% of them in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In the poorest countries, on average, 12% of babies are born too soon, compared to 9% in higher-income countries.</p><p>The problem of preterm births is not confined to low-income countries. The United States and Brazil both rank among the top 10 countries with the highest number of preterm births. In the United States, for example, about 12%, or more than one in nine of all births, are preterm.</p><p>The countries with the greatest numbers of preterm births are:</p><ul><li>India – 3 519 100</li><li>China – 1 172 300</li><li>Nigeria – 773 600</li><li>Pakistan – 748 100</li><li>Indonesia – 675 700</li><li>United States – 517 400</li><li>Bangladesh – 424 100</li><li>Philippines – 348 900</li><li>Democratic Republic of the Congo – 341 400</li><li>Brazil – 279 300</li></ul><p>The 10 countries with the highest rates of preterm births for every 100 births are:</p><ul><li>Malawi – 18.1 per 100</li><li>Comoros – 16.7</li><li>Congo – 16.7</li><li>Zimbabwe – 16.6</li><li>Equatorial Guinea – 16.5</li><li>Mozambique – 16.4</li><li>Gabon – 16.3</li><li>Pakistan – 15.8</li><li>Indonesia – 15.5</li><li>Mauritania – 15.4</li></ul><p>Those contrast with the 11 countries with the lowest rates of preterm births:</p><ul><li>Belarus – 4.1</li><li>Ecuador – 5.1</li><li>Latvia – 5.3</li><li>Finland – 5.5</li><li>Croatia – 5.5</li><li>Samoa – 5.5</li><li>Lithuania – 5.7</li><li>Estonia – 5.7</li><li>Antigua/Barbuda – 5.8</li><li>Japan – 5.9</li><li>Sweden – 5.9</li></ul><p>“The numbers of preterm births are increasing. In all but 3 countries, preterm birth rates increased in the last 20 years,” says Dr. Lawn.</p><p>“Worldwide, 50 million births still happen at home and many babies die without birth or death certificates,” says Dr. Lawn.</p><p>In high-income countries, the increases in the number of preterm births are linked to the number of older women having babies, increased use of fertility drugs and resulting multiple pregnancies. In some developed countries, medically unnecessary inductions and Cesarean deliveries before full-term have also increased preterm births. In many low-income countries, the main causes of preterm births include infections, malaria, HIV, and high adolescent pregnancy rates. In rich and poor countries, many preterm births remain unexplained.</p><p>“The report also focuses on the dramatic survival gap between low-income and high-income countries for babies born before 28 weeks,” says Christopher Howson, PhD., co-editor of the report, an epidemiologist and head of Global Programs for the March of Dimes. “In low-income countries, more than 90% of extremely preterm babies die within the first few days of life, while less than 10% die in high-income countries.”</p><p>“However, this is a solvable problem,” says Dr. Howson. “A number of countries, for example, Ecuador, Botswana, Turkey, Oman and Sri Lanka have halved their neonatal deaths from preterm birth through improving care of serious complications like infections and respiratory distress. These interventions are particularly effective in preventing death in moderately preterm babies, which account for more than 80% of all preterm births.”</p><p>Wide differences within countries were found. For example, in the United States the preterm birth rate in 2009 for black Americans was as high as 17.5%, compared with 10.9% for white Americans. The age of the mother made a significant difference. In the U.S., the preterm birth rate for women aged 20 to 35 was between 11-12%; it was more than 15% for women under 17 and over 40.</p><p>Spotlighting preterm births may help many low-income countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, achieve UN Millennium Development Goal 4, a two-thirds reduction in young child deaths, and Goal 5, improved maternal health, by 2015. These goals were set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2000. Nearly all high-income developed countries have already met these goals.</p><h4>All preterm births are not the same</h4><p>For the report, preterm was defined as 37 weeks of completed gestation or less, which is the standard WHO definition. Preterm babies are defined in 3 categories:</p><ul><li>late preterm - those born between 32 and 37 weeks - account for 84% of total preterm births, or 12.5 million. Most survive with supportive care;</li><li>very preterm - those born between 28 and 32 weeks. These babies require extra supportive care. Most will survive; and</li><li>extremely preterm - those born before 28 weeks. These babies require the most intensive, expensive care to survive. In developed countries, these babies have a 90% chance of survival, though they may suffer lifelong physical, neurological, and learning disabilities. In low-income countries, only 10% survive.</li></ul><p>A recent March of Dimes analysis shows that, even though numbers are low, the risk of death of babies born between 37 and 39 weeks of gestation is twice as high as full term babies, or 39 weeks.</p><p>“It is important to ensure that babies get at least 39 weeks of gestation when medically possible, and to deliver this message to both providers and mothers,\" says Dr. Howson. “A healthy baby is worth the wait.\"</p><h4>Inexpensive and simple techniques save lives</h4><p>\"People tend to associate preterm with high-cost intensive care services which would be challenging to poor countries, but a whole menu of effective, inexpensive services are available and work to save most of these lives,\" says Carole Presern, PhD, a midwife who has delivered babies in remote areas of Asia and is the Director of The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health.</p><p>Experts at the UN, medical institutions and field organizations say that inexpensive, proven forms of care for premature babies could save at least three quarters of these babies in the developing world. These include:</p><ul><li>antenatal steroid injections for mothers in premature labor, which cost US$ 1 an injection. This helps develop immature fetal lungs and prevent respiratory problems; yet, in low-income countries, they are only available and provided for 10% of those in need. This alone could save almost 400 000 lives of babies a year;</li><li>\"Kangaroo care\" where the infant is held skin-to-skin on the mother's chest to keep warm. The warmth is very important for premature infants. Kangaroo care makes frequent breastfeeding easy and provides constant maternal supervision for the infant. This could save 450 000 lives a year;</li><li>antiseptic cream to prevent birth cord infection; and</li><li>antibiotics to prevent and fight infection, an important cause of neonatal death.</li></ul><p>All health care providers, including physicians, nurses, and midwives, need training in basic preterm care, notes Dr. Presern who says she has seen too many situations where even the doctor doesn't seem to know what to do with a tiny infant.</p><h4>Two types of preterm birth</h4><p>Preterm births are divided into two categories: Those that are spontaneous from early onset of labor or premature rupture of the membranes and those that are provider-induced.</p><p>Provider-induced early deliveries may occur when the health of the mother or fetus is in jeopardy, such as in pre-eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure in pregnancy), for convenience of the doctor, midwife or mother, or by an error in due dates. Even babies born a few weeks too soon are more likely to be re-hospitalized or to have breathing problems or other illnesses.</p><h4>Prevention key to reducing premature births</h4><p>A key way to reduce preterm numbers is to find ways to help all pregnancies go to full term, or 39 weeks. \"Prevention will be the key, says Elizabeth Mason, M.D., Director of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health at the World Health Organization and a major contributor to the report. “We are now looking closely at what can be done before a woman gets pregnant to help her have an optimal outcome,\" says Dr. Mason. “We know that poverty, women’s education, malaria and HIV all have an impact on the pregnancy and the health of the baby.”</p><p>A number of risk factors for preterm birth have been identified, including a prior history of preterm birth, underweight, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, infection, maternal age (either under 17 or over 40), genetics, multi-fetal pregnancy (twins, triplets, and higher), and pregnancies spaced too closely together.</p><p>However, little is known about the interplay of these and other environmental and social factors.</p><p>The report calls for a strong research program to identify risk factors clearly and understand how their interactions may lead to preterm birth so that more definitive ways can be found to screen and treat women at risk to prevent the problem from occurring.</p><p>Until research provides better answers, though, the report advises taking effective measures now, such as screening women for known medical conditions that could put them at risk during pregnancy, assuring good nutrition before and during pregnancy, and making sure that all women have access to good preconception and prenatal health care and receive the recommended number of visits during pregnancy.</p><h4>An agenda for action</h4><p>In addition to detailed recommendations about needed research, the report offers an agenda and action plan for all groups concerned with preterm birth and child health, ranging from the United Nations and governments at all levels to donor countries to global philanthropic institutions and civil society.</p><p>Some 30 groups have already committed to take part in the overall effort to reduce both the absolute numbers of preterm births and the mortality rate and to support the research agenda. These commitments are posted on the Every Woman, Every Child web site, supporting the Every Woman, Every Child effort to advance the Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health.</p><p>The extensive list of recommendations in the report includes specific actions such as addressing the missing essential medicines and equipment, training existing health staff in how to look after women in preterm labor and these vulnerable babies, increased funding for research to find new prevention solutions, and better data for accurate future counts. Efforts to increase awareness of the preterm birth issue are essential.</p><p>\"This report is not the last word, but an important next step,\" says Dr. Howson. \"Both the report and the broad international constituency behind it offer a framework and set of clear actions to help accelerate global progress on preterm birth.”</p><div><h3>Parliaments scale up efforts on maternal and child health</h3><p>In the first week in April, leaders of nearly 120 national parliaments attending a major meeting in Kampala, Uganda resolved to prioritize action and resources for improving the health of women and children.</p><p>Delegates to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) passed a resolution calling for all member-parliaments to take all possible measures to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5 by 2015. MDG 4 aims to reduce child deaths around the world by two-thirds by 2015; MDG 5 aims to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters by the same year.</p><p>This is the first time that the world’s parliaments, acting through the IPU, have passed a resolution on this issue.

      "description": "Each year, some 15 million babies in the world, more than one in 10 births, are born too early, according to the just released report Born too soon: the global action report on preterm birth.More than one million of those babies die shortly after birth; countless others suffer some type of lifelong physical, neurological, or educational disability, often at great cost to families and society.An estimated three-quarters of those preterm babies who die could survive without expensive care if a few proven and inexpensive treatments and preventions were available worldwide, according to more than 100 experts who contributed to the report, representing almost 40 UN agencies, universities, and organizations. The report explains what is known about preterm birth, its causes, and the kinds of care that are needed.The lead authors of the report from The March of Dimes Foundation, The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health, Save the Children and The World Health Organization, offer a detailed plan for the actions needed to reduce both the death toll and the numbers of preterm births.First-ever country figures for a large, but neglected problemPreterm births have been an overlooked and neglected problem, world health leaders say.“All newborns are vulnerable, but preterm babies are acutely so,” says UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who wrote the foreword to the report and considers the effort to reduce preterm births and deaths an integral part of his Global strategy for women’s and children’s health.“Being born too soon is an unrecognized killer,” says Joy Lawn, M.D., PhD, co-editor of the report and Director, Global Evidence and Policy for Save the Children. “Preterm births account for almost half of all newborn deaths worldwide and are now the second leading cause of death in children under 5, after pneumonia.”New figures in the report show both the magnitude of the problem and the disparities between countries. Of the 11 countries with preterm birth rates over 15%, all but 2 are in sub-Saharan Africa. Preterm births account for 11.1% of the world's live births, 60% of them in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In the poorest countries, on average, 12% of babies are born too soon, compared to 9% in higher-income countries.The problem of preterm births is not confined to low-income countries. The United States and Brazil both rank among the top 10 countries with the highest number of preterm births. In the United States, for example, about 12%, or more than one in nine of all births, are preterm.The countries with the greatest numbers of preterm births are:India – 3 519 100China – 1 172 300Nigeria – 773 600Pakistan – 748 100Indonesia – 675 700United States – 517 400Bangladesh – 424 100Philippines – 348 900Democratic Republic of the Congo – 341 400Brazil – 279 300The 10 countries with the highest rates of preterm births for every 100 births are:Malawi – 18.1 per 100Comoros – 16.7Congo – 16.7Zimbabwe – 16.6Equatorial Guinea – 16.5Mozambique – 16.4Gabon – 16.3Pakistan – 15.8Indonesia – 15.5Mauritania – 15.4Those contrast with the 11 countries with the lowest rates of preterm births:Belarus – 4.1Ecuador – 5.1Latvia – 5.3Finland – 5.5Croatia – 5.5Samoa – 5.5Lithuania – 5.7Estonia – 5.7Antigua/Barbuda – 5.8Japan – 5.9Sweden – 5.9“The numbers of preterm births are increasing. In all but 3 countries, preterm birth rates increased in the last 20 years,” says Dr. Lawn.“Worldwide, 50 million births still happen at home and many babies die without birth or death certificates,” says Dr. Lawn.In high-income countries, the increases in the number of preterm births are linked to the number of older women having babies, increased use of fertility drugs and resulting multiple pregnancies. In some developed countries, medically unnecessary inductions and Cesarean deliveries before full-term have also increased preterm births. In many low-income countries, the main causes of preterm births include infections, malaria, HIV, and high adolescent pregnancy rates. In rich and poor countries, many preterm births remain unexplained.“The report also focuses on the dramatic survival gap between low-income and high-income countries for babies born before 28 weeks,” says Christopher Howson, PhD., co-editor of the report, an epidemiologist and head of Global Programs for the March of Dimes. “In low-income countries, more than 90% of extremely preterm babies die within the first few days of life, while less than 10% die in high-income countries.”“However, this is a solvable problem,” says Dr. Howson. “A number of countries, for example, Ecuador, Botswana, Turkey, Oman and Sri Lanka have halved their neonatal deaths from preterm birth through improving care of serious complications like infections and respiratory distress. These interventions are particularly effective in preventing death in moderately preterm babies, which account for more than 80% of all preterm births.”Wide differences within countries were found. For example, in the United States the preterm birth rate in 2009 for black Americans was as high as 17.5%, compared with 10.9% for white Americans. The age of the mother made a significant difference. In the U.S., the preterm birth rate for women aged 20 to 35 was between 11-12%; it was more than 15% for women under 17 and over 40.Spotlighting preterm births may help many low-income countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, achieve UN Millennium Development Goal 4, a two-thirds reduction in young child deaths, and Goal 5, improved maternal health, by 2015. These goals were set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2000. Nearly all high-income developed countries have already met these goals.All preterm births are not the sameFor the report, preterm was defined as 37 weeks of completed gestation or less, which is the standard WHO definition. Preterm babies are defined in 3 categories:late preterm - those born between 32 and 37 weeks - account for 84% of total preterm births, or 12.5 million. Most survive with supportive care;very preterm - those born between 28 and 32 weeks. These babies require extra supportive care. Most will survive; andextremely preterm - those born before 28 weeks. These babies require the most intensive, expensive care to survive. In developed countries, these babies have a 90% chance of survival, though they may suffer lifelong physical, neurological, and learning disabilities. In low-income countries, only 10% survive.A recent March of Dimes analysis shows that, even though numbers are low, the risk of death of babies born between 37 and 39 weeks of gestation is twice as high as full term babies, or 39 weeks.“It is important to ensure that babies get at least 39 weeks of gestation when medically possible, and to deliver this message to both providers and mothers,\" says Dr. Howson. “A healthy baby is worth the wait.\"Inexpensive and simple techniques save lives\"People tend to associate preterm with high-cost intensive care services which would be challenging to poor countries, but a whole menu of effective, inexpensive services are available and work to save most of these lives,\" says Carole Presern, PhD, a midwife who has delivered babies in remote areas of Asia and is the Director of The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health.Experts at the UN, medical institutions and field organizations say that inexpensive, proven forms of care for premature babies could save at least three quarters of these babies in the developing world. These include:antenatal steroid injections for mothers in premature labor, which cost US$ 1 an injection. This helps develop immature fetal lungs and prevent respiratory problems; yet, in low-income countries, they are only available and provided for 10% of those in need. This alone could save almost 400 000 lives of babies a year;\"Kangaroo care\" where the infant is held skin-to-skin on the mother's chest to keep warm. The warmth is very important for premature infants. Kangaroo care makes frequent breastfeeding easy and provides constant maternal supervision for the infant. This could save 450 000 lives a year;antiseptic cream to prevent birth cord infection; andantibiotics to prevent and fight infection, an important cause of neonatal death.All health care providers, including physicians, nurses, and midwives, need training in basic preterm care, notes Dr. Presern who says she has seen too many situations where even the doctor doesn't seem to know what to do with a tiny infant.Two types of preterm birthPreterm births are divided into two categories: Those that are spontaneous from early onset of labor or premature rupture of the membranes and those that are provider-induced.Provider-induced early deliveries may occur when the health of the mother or fetus is in jeopardy, such as in pre-eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure in pregnancy), for convenience of the doctor, midwife or mother, or by an error in due dates. Even babies born a few weeks too soon are more likely to be re-hospitalized or to have breathing problems or other illnesses.Prevention key to reducing premature birthsA key way to reduce preterm numbers is to find ways to help all pregnancies go to full term, or 39 weeks. \"Prevention will be the key, says Elizabeth Mason, M.D., Director of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health at the World Health Organization and a major contributor to the report. “We are now looking closely at what can be done before a woman gets pregnant to help her have an optimal outcome,\" says Dr. Mason. “We know that poverty, women’s education, malaria and HIV all have an impact on the pregnancy and the health of the baby.”A number of risk factors for preterm birth have been identified, including a prior history of preterm birth, underweight, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, infection, maternal age (either under 17 or over 40), genetics, multi-fetal pregnancy (twins, triplets, and higher), and pregnancies spaced too closely together.However, little is known about the interplay of these and other environmental and social factors.The report calls for a strong research program to identify risk factors clearly and understand how their interactions may lead to preterm birth so that more definitive ways can be found to screen and treat women at risk to prevent the problem from occurring.Until research provides better answers, though, the report advises taking effective measures now, such as screening women for known medical conditions that could put them at risk during pregnancy, assuring good nutrition before and during pregnancy, and making sure that all women have access to good preconception and prenatal health care and receive the recommended number of visits during pregnancy.An agenda for actionIn addition to detailed recommendations about needed research, the report offers an agenda and action plan for all groups concerned with preterm birth and child health, ranging from the United Nations and governments at all levels to donor countries to global philanthropic institutions and civil society.Some 30 groups have already committed to take part in the overall effort to reduce both the absolute numbers of preterm births and the mortality rate and to support the research agenda. These commitments are posted on the Every Woman, Every Child web site, supporting the Every Woman, Every Child effort to advance the Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health.The extensive list of recommendations in the report includes specific actions such as addressing the missing essential medicines and equipment, training existing health staff in how to look after women in preterm labor and these vulnerable babies, increased funding for research to find new prevention solutions, and better data for accurate future counts. Efforts to increase awareness of the preterm birth issue are essential.\"This report is not the last word, but an important next step,\" says Dr. Howson. \"Both the report and the broad international constituency behind it offer a framework and set of clear actions to help accelerate global progress on preterm birth.”Parliaments scale up efforts on maternal and child healthIn the first week in April, leaders of nearly 120 national parliaments attending a major meeting in Kampala, Uganda resolved to prioritize action and resources for improving the health of women and children.Delegates to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) passed a resolution calling for all member-parliaments to take all possible measures to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5 by 2015. MDG 4 aims to reduce child deaths around the world by two-thirds by 2015; MDG 5 aims to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters by the same year.This is the first time that the world’s parliaments, acting through the IPU, have passed a resolution on this issue. The debate on the resolution featured interventions from more than 50 member-delegations, associate members and observers, including Nigeria, Brazil, the UK, Sweden and Indonesia.Preterm birth rate per 100 live births",

But simply maintaining current rates of progress will not be enough to meet global targets for malaria control.T3: Test, Treat, TrackWHO therefore urges the global health community to further scale up investments in diagnostic testing, treatment, and surveillance for malaria in order to save more lives and to make a major push towards achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals in 2015.Endemic countries should be able to ensure that every suspected malaria case is tested, that every confirmed case is treated with a quality-assured antimalarial medicine, and that the disease is tracked through timely and accurate surveillance systems.WHO has published technical guidance for all three pillars of T3: Test, Treat, Track – releasing the final two documents of the package, Disease Surveillance for Malaria Control, and Disease Surveillance for Malaria Elimination, today.“Until countries are able to test, treat, and report every malaria case, we will never defeat this disease,” says Dr Margaret Chan, who is in Namibia for World Malaria Day this year. \"We need strong and sustained political commitment from all countries where malaria is endemic, and from the global health community, to see this fight through to the end.”In half of all malaria-endemic countries in Africa, over 80% of cases are still being treated without diagnostic testing. Universal diagnostic testing will ensure that patients with fever receive the most appropriate treatment, and that antimalarial medicines are used rationally and correctly. Countries that have already scaled up diagnostic testing (such as Senegal) are saving hundreds of thousands of treatment courses every year.Many countries have made significant progress in improving access to antimalarials. In 2010, 60 governments were providing artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) free of charge to all age groups. But millions of people still lack ready access to appropriate treatment. The effort must be scaled up to ensure that every confirmed malaria case gets treated.Improved surveillance for malaria cases and deaths will help countries determine which areas or population groups are most affected. It will also help ministries of health to identify resurgences and map new trends - thus maximizing the efficiency of prevention and control programmes. Better surveillance will also allow for a more effective delivery of international aid programmes.“T3: Test, Treat, Track aims to galvanize endemic countries and their partners to build on the success of malaria prevention efforts over the past decade,” says Dr Robert Newman, Director of WHO’s Global Malaria Programme. “In recent years, there has been major progress in the development of new diagnostic tools and highly effective antimalarial medicines. The challenge now is to ensure these tools get used, and that countries accurately measure their public health impact.”Malaria progress, 2000-2010During the past decade, global malaria prevention and control efforts have been scaled up, with notable progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where the vast majority of malaria cases occur. The number of long-lasting insecticidal nets delivered to malaria-endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa increased from 5.6 million in 2004 to 145 million in 2010. Programmes to spray the interiors of buildings with insecticides were also expanded, with the number of people protected in sub-Saharan Africa rising from 10 million in 2005 to 81 million in 2010.The availability of rapid diagnostic tests has made it possible to improve and expand diagnostic testing for malaria. The rate of testing - in the public sector in Africa - rose from less than 5% in 2000 to 45% in 2010. Meanwhile, the number of ACTs procured worldwide by government health departments also increased exponentially: from 11 million in 2005 to 181 million in 2010.However, malaria transmission still occurs in 99 countries around the world, and the malaria burden continues to cripple health systems in many African countries. In 2010, this entirely preventable and treatable disease caused an estimated 655 000 deaths worldwide. About 560 000 of the victims were children under five years of age, which means malaria killed one child every minute.“Sustaining recent gains in Africa will require continued political commitment and funding,” said Dr Thomas Teuscher, Executive Director a.i., Roll Back Malaria Partnership. \"An estimated 3 million lives can be saved between now and 2015, if we continue to work in partnership and if governments in endemic countries redouble their efforts to provide people with essential health services.”World Malaria Day was instituted by the World Health Assembly at its 60th session in May 2007 to recognize the global effort to provide effective control of malaria. It is celebrated on 25 April ever year.Note to EditorsWHO’s statistical uncertainty range for global malaria mortality is 537 000–907 000 – an indication of the urgent need for better surveillance and improved reporting",

Older people make important contributions as family members, volunteers and as active participants in the workforce and are a significant social and economic resource.“When a 100-year-old man finishes a marathon, as happened last year, we have to rethink conventional definitions of what it means to be ‘old’,” says Dr Chan. “Past stereotypes developed in past centuries no longer hold.”World Health Day is celebrated on 7 April to mark the anniversary of the founding of the WHO in 1948.",

      "description": "Malaria mortality rates have fallen by more than 25% globally since 2000, and by 33% in the WHO African Region, according to the World malaria report 2011, issued today by WHO. This is the result of a significant scaling-up of malaria prevention and control measures in the last decade, including the widespread use of bed nets, better diagnostics and a wider availability of effective medicines to treat malaria.However, WHO warns that a projected shortfall in funding threatens the fragile gains and that the double challenge of emerging drug and insecticide resistance needs to be proactively addressed.Malaria incidence and mortality rates fall\"We are making significant progress in battling a major public health problem. Coverage of at-risk populations with malaria prevention and control measures increased again in 2010, and resulted in a further decline in estimated malaria cases and deaths,\" says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \"But there are worrisome signs that suggest progress might slow.\"During the past decade, malaria incidence and mortality rates have been cut in all regions of the world, according to the report.

The latest report by the WHO, UNICEF and UNAIDS <em>Report on the global HIV/AIDS response</em> indicates that increased access to HIV services resulted in a 15% reduction of new infections over the past decade and a 22% decline in AIDS-related deaths in the last five years.</p><p>\"It has taken the world ten years to achieve this level of momentum,\" says Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of WHO's HIV Department. \"There is now a very real possibility of getting ahead of the epidemic. But this can only be achieved by both sustaining and accelerating this momentum over the next decade and beyond.\"</p><h4>Hope for future progress</h4><p>Advances in HIV science and programme innovations over the past year add hope for future progress. In times of economic austerity it will be essential to rapidly apply new science, technologies and approaches to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HIV programmes in countries.</p><h4>What is already working</h4><p>The report highlights what is already working.</p><ul><li>Improved access to HIV testing services enabled 61% of pregnant women in eastern and southern Africa to receive testing and counseling for HIV - up from 14% in 2005.</li><li>Close to half (48%) of pregnant women in need receive effective medicines to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) in 2010.</li><li>Antiretroviral therapy (ART), which not only improves the health and well-being of the infected people but also stops further HIV transmission, is available now for 6.65 million people in low- and middle-income countries, accounting for 47% of the 14.2 million people eligible to receive it.</li></ul><h4>Investment in HIV services could lead to billions in increased economic activity</h4><p>When people are healthier, they are better able to cope financially. The report acknowledges that investment in HIV services could lead to total gains of up to US$ 34 billion by 2020 in increased economic activity and productivity, more than offsetting the costs of ART programmes.</p><h4>2011 a game changing year</h4><p>“2011 has been a game changing year. With new science, unprecedented political leadership and continued progress in the AIDS response, countries have a window of opportunity to seize this momentum and take their responses to the next level,” said Paul De Lay, Deputy Executive Director, Programme, UNAIDS. “By investing wisely, countries can increase efficiencies, reduce costs and improve on results. However, gains made to date are being threatened by a decline in resources for AIDS.”</p><h4>What still needs to be done</h4><p>The report also points to what still needs to be done.</p><ul><li>More than half of the people who need antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries are still unable to access it. Many of them do not even know that they have HIV.</li><li>Despite the growing body of evidence as to what countries need to focus on to make a real impact on their epidemics, some are still not tailoring their programmes for those who are most at risk and in need. In many cases, groups including adolescent girls, people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, transgender people, sex workers, prisoners and migrants remain unable to access HIV prevention and treatment services.</li></ul><p>Worldwide, the vast majority (64%) of people aged 15-24 living with HIV today are female. The rate is even higher in sub-Saharan Africa where girls and young women make up 71% of all young people living with HIV - essentially because prevention strategies are not reaching them.</p><h4>Populations still marginalized</h4><p>Key populations are continually marginalized. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, more than 60% of those living with HIV are people who inject drugs. But injecting drug users account for only 22% of those receiving ART.</p><p>Although better services to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV have averted some 350 000 new infections among children, some 3.4 million children are living with HIV - many of whom lack HIV treatment. Only about one in four children in need of HIV treatment in low- and middle-income countries received it in 2010, as compared to 1 in 2 adults.</p><h4>Progress for children is slower</h4><p>\"While there have been gains in treatment, care and support available to adults, we note that progress for children is slower,\" says Leila Pakkala, Director of the UNICEF Office in Geneva. “The coverage of HIV interventions for children remains alarmingly low. Through concerted action and equity-focused strategies, we must make sure that global efforts are working for children as well as adults”.</p><h4>HIV in regions and countries</h4><p>In 2010, HIV epidemics and responses in different parts of the world vary with shifting trends, progress rates and outcomes.</p><p><strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong> recorded the biggest overall annual increase - 30% - in the number of people accessing ART. Three countries (Botswana, Namibia and Rwanda) have achieved universal coverage (80%) for HIV prevention, treatment and care services. The regional ART coverage rate stood at 49% at the end of 2010. Approximately 50% of pregnant women living with HIV receive treatment to prevent mother-to child transmission of HIV. And 21% of children in need are able to get paediatric HIV treatments. There were 1.9 million new infections in the region, where 22.9 million people are living with HIV. There are some major disparities in progress between different parts of the region. Countries in Eastern and Southern Africa have reached much higher coverage rates for ART (56%) and PMTCT (64%) than countries in Western and Central Africa (30% and 18% respectively).</p><p><strong>Asia</strong> shows a stabilizing epidemic overall, but new infections are very high in some communities. Of the 4.8 million people living with HIV in Asia, nearly half (49%) are in India. Antiretroviral treatment coverage is increasing with 39% of adults and children in need of HIV treatment having access. Coverage of PMTCT services is relatively low - (16%).</p><p><strong>Eastern Europe and Central Asia</strong> presents a dramatic growth in HIV, with new infections increasing by 250% in the past decade. Over 90% of these infections occur in just two countries: Russia and Ukraine. The region demonstrates high coverage rates for PMTCT and paediatric HIV treatment (with 78% and 65% coverage rates respectively). However, ART coverage is very low at 23%, particularly among the most affected people - the ones who inject drugs.</p><p><strong>Middle East and North Africa</strong> records the highest number of HIV infections ever in the region (59 000) in 2010, which represents a 36% increase over the past year. Coverage of HIV services are very low in the region: 10% for ART, 5% for paediatric treatment and 4% for PMTCT.</p><p><strong>Latin America and the Caribbean</strong> have a stabilizing epidemic with 1.5 million living with HIV in Latin America and 200 000 in the Caribbean. HIV is predominantly among networks of men who have sex with men in Latin America. In the Caribbean though, women are the more affected group accounting for 53% of people living with HIV. The region has ART coverage of 63% for adults and 39% for children. Coverage for effective PMTCT regimen is relatively high at 74%.</p><p>Sustaining the HIV response through the next 10 years.</p><ul><li>Countries are already showing marked efficiency gains in HIV programmes: South Africa reduced HIV drug costs by more than 50% over a two-year period by implementing a new tendering strategy for procurement. Uganda saved US$ 2 million by shifting to simpler paediatric regimens. Such efficiencies are promoted through Treatment 2.0 - an initiative launched by WHO and UNAIDS in 2010 to promote simpler, cheaper and easier-to-deliver HIV treatment and diagnostic tools, combined with decentralized services that are supported by communities.</li><li>A WHO, UNAIDS, UNICEF \"Elimination Initiative\" aims to eliminate new HIV infections among children by 2015 and keep their mothers alive.</li><li>WHO is developing new guidance on the strategic use of antiretroviral drugs for both prevention and treatment.</li><li>WHO's \"Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV/AIDS, 2011-2015\", endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2011 highlights the importance of continuing efforts to optimize HIV treatment and \"combination\" prevention - the use of a range of different approaches to reduce people's risk of infection.</li></ul><p>The 2011 <em>Report on the global HIV/AIDS response</em> is the comprehensive report on both the epidemiology and progress rates in access to HIV services globally and in regions and countries. It has been jointly developed by WHO, UNICEF, UNAIDS, in collaboration with national and international partners.</p>",

    "content_html": "<p>India appears to have interrupted wild poliovirus transmission, completing one year without polio since its last case, in a 2-year-old girl in the state of West Bengal, on 13 January 2011.</p><p>India was once recognized as the world’s epicentre of polio. If all pending laboratory investigations return negative, in the coming weeks India will officially be deemed to have stopped indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus. The number of polio-endemic countries, those which have never stopped indigenous wild poliovirus transmission, will then be reduced to a historical low of three: Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan.</p><p>However, there remains no room for complacency. India must maintain sensitive surveillance and high childhood immunity against wild poliovirus to guard against any importation of polio until eradication is achieved globally. In 2011, Afghanistan and Pakistan have both seen alarming increases in polio cases, and poliovirus from Pakistan re-infected China (which had been polio-free since 1999). In Africa, active polio transmission continues in Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria, with outbreaks in West and Central Africa in the past 12 months reminding the world that as long as polio exists anywhere, it remains a threat everywhere.</p><p>Global health leaders today paid tribute to the Government of India for its leadership and financial commitment to the polio eradication effort, and to the millions of vaccinators, community mobilizers, Rotarians, parents and caregivers who have supported polio eradication for more than a decade. The scale of the eradication effort in India is mind-boggling: each year, more than 170 million children under the age of 5 are vaccinated in two national immunization campaigns, with up to 70 million children in the highest-risk areas vaccinated multiple times in additional special campaigns; the whole effort requires nearly a billion doses of oral polio vaccine annually.</p><h4>Hundreds of thousands of children will be saved</h4><p>India’s achievement in stopping polio will save hundreds of thousands of children from lifelong paralysis or death each year. Poliovirus can travel easily to polio-free areas. Stopping polio in India will prevent a recurrence of the polio outbreaks – due to virus of Indian origin – seen in recent years in countries as diverse as Angola, Bangladesh, Nepal, Russia and Tajikistan.</p><h4>An opportunity to end polio</h4><p>\"India’s success is arguably its greatest public health achievement and has provided a global opportunity to push for the end of polio,\" said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan. “The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is in full emergency mode and focused on using this momentum to close this crippling disease down. Stopping polio in India required creativity, perseverance and professionalism – many of the innovations in polio eradication were sparked by the challenges in India. The lessons from India must now be adapted and implemented through emergency actions to finish polio everywhere.”</p><p>The key to India’s remarkable progress in the fight against polio according to UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake, has been the strong leadership of the Government of India and state governments, which launched a comprehensive polio eradication programme that has enabled sustained high immunization coverage in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar with high rates of poverty, high population density and poor sanitation and infrastructure, conditions in which disease like polio can thrive.</p><h4>Polio can be eradicated in challenging environments</h4><p>“India’s achievement is proof positive that we can eradicate polio even in the most challenging environments – in fact, it is only by targeting these areas that we can defeat this evil disease,” Mr Lake said. “We have the ability to protect every last person, especially children, from this entirely preventable disease – and because we can, we must finish the job of eradicating polio globally, once and for all.\"</p><p>Rotary International first launched the global polio eradication effort in 1985, and President Kalyan Banerjee said that with the intensity of transmission in India, many experts had predicted it would be the last country in the world to achieve eradication. “India is undoubtedly the biggest domino to fall in the polio eradication effort,” Mr Banerjee said. “India’s success is a great credit to the Indian government and to Indian Rotary members – as well as those from around the world – who have worked with local leaders to conduct these immunization efforts to reach every child with the polio vaccine.\"</p><h4>India must continue to protect its children from polio</h4><p>Like all countries that have stopped indigenous wild poliovirus transmission, India must continue to protect its children through supplementary immunization activities and improved routine immunization coverage rates or risk a potentially horrific re-importation event, said the Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Thomas Frieden. “Polio’s history contains many cautionary tales,” Dr. Frieden added. “Polio anywhere in the world is a risk everywhere in the world, and to protect itself from a setback, India is appropriately planning to continue meticulous monitoring and intensive childhood vaccination against polio.”</p><h4>Ensuring no child suffers polio</h4><p>“Polio can be stopped when countries combine the right elements – political will, quality immunization campaigns, and an entire nation’s determination” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. “World leaders must continue to raise the funds needed to run the global campaign and help to ensure that no child suffers from this crippling disease ever again.”</p><p>With India’s achievement, the global polio eradication effort now focuses on improving the implementation of emergency operations plans in Chad, Nigeria and Pakistan. Success depends on local ownership and accountability at all levels of government and international partners.</p><h4>Notes to editors</h4><p>India is one of the largest donors to polio eradication, being largely self-financed. By 2013, India will have contributed US$ 2 billion.</p><p>When all pending specimens are processed (stools from children with acute flaccid paralysis and samples from sewage sampling), if no wild poliovirus is detected, India will no longer be considered polio-endemic. The laboratory system is expected to clear all samples within 4–6 weeks of collection.</p><p>The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is spearheaded by national governments, WHO, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF.</p>",
