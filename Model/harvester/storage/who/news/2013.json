Increased political commitment and expanded funding have helped to reduce incidence of malaria by 29% globally, and by 31% in Africa. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The large majority of the 3.3 million lives saved between 2000 and 2012 were in the 10 countries with the highest malaria burden, and among children aged less than 5 years – the group most affected by the disease. Over the same period, malaria mortality rates in children in Africa were reduced by an estimated 54%. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>But more needs to be done.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“This remarkable progress is no cause for complacency: absolute numbers of malaria cases and deaths are not going down as fast as they could,” says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. “The fact that so many people are infected and dying from mosquito bites is one of the greatest tragedies of the 21st century.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In 2012, there were an estimated 207 million cases of malaria (uncertainty interval: 135 – 287 million), which caused approximately 627 000 malaria deaths (uncertainty interval 473 000 – 789 000). An estimated 3.4 billion people continue to be at risk of malaria, mostly in Africa and south-east Asia. Around 80% of malaria cases occur in Africa.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Long way from universal access to prevention and treatment</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Malaria prevention suffered a setback after its strong build-up between 2005 and 2010. The new WHO report notes a slowdown in the expansion of interventions to control mosquitoes for the second successive year, particularly in providing access to insecticide-treated bed nets. This has been primarily due to lack of funds to procure bed nets in countries that have ongoing malaria transmission. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In sub-Saharan Africa, the proportion of the population with access to an insecticide-treated bed net remained well under 50% in 2013. Only 70 million new bed nets were delivered to malaria-endemic countries in 2012, below the 150 million minimum needed every year to ensure everyone at risk is protected. However, in 2013, about 136 million nets were delivered, and the pipeline for 2014 looks even stronger (approximately 200 million), suggesting that there is real chance for a turnaround.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>There was no such setback for malaria diagnostic testing, which has continued to expand in recent years. Between 2010 and 2012, the proportion of people with suspected malaria who received a diagnostic test in the public sector increased from 44% to 64% globally. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Access to WHO-recommended artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) has also increased, with the number of treatment courses delivered to countries rising from 76 million in 2006 to 331 million in 2012. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Despite this progress, millions of people continue to lack access to diagnosis and quality-assured treatment, particularly in countries with weak health systems. The roll-out of preventive therapies – recommended for infants, children under 5 and pregnant women – has also been slow in recent years. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“To win the fight against malaria we must get the means to prevent and treat the disease to every family who needs it,” says Raymond G Chambers, the United Nations Secretary General’s Special Envoy for Financing the Health MDGs and for Malaria. \"Our collective efforts are not only ending the needless suffering of millions, but are helping families thrive and adding billions of dollars to economies that nations can use in other ways.”</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Global funding gap</h3>\n<p>\n<span>International funding for malaria control increased from less than US$ 100 million in 2000 to almost US$ 2 billion in 2012. Domestic funding stood at around US$ 0.5 billion in the same year, bringing the total international and domestic funding committed to malaria control to US$ 2.5 billion in 2012 – less than half the US$ 5.1 billion needed each year to achieve universal access to interventions.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Without adequate and predictable funding, the progress against malaria is also threatened by emerging parasite resistance to artemisinin, the core component of ACTs, and mosquito resistance to insecticides. Artemisinin resistance has been detected in four countries in south-east Asia, and insecticide resistance has been found in at least 64 countries.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“The remarkable gains against malaria are still fragile,” says Dr Robert Newman, Director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme. “In the next 10-15 years, the world will need innovative tools and technologies, as well as new strategic approaches to sustain and accelerate progress.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO is currently developing a global technical strategy for malaria control and elimination for the 2016-2025 period, as well as a global plan to control and eliminate <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria.

It also contains key international documents and information. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Launched on Human Rights Day, the platform is part of WHO’s QualityRights initiative, aiming to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“People with mental disabilities still face discrimination, violence and abuse in all countries,” says Dr Michelle Funk, from WHO’s Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. “The easy-to-use platform was established as a tool to facilitate debate, dialogue, advocacy and research on mental health, to improve care and to promote human rights across the globe.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The care available in mental health facilities may often not only be of poor quality but can also hinder recovery. It can still be common in some countries for people to be locked away in small, prison-like cells with no human contact or to be chained to their beds, unable to move. The MiNDbank will help decision makers to address these issues, support reform efforts and ultimately improve the lives of people with mental health conditions in line with the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2013.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The database, established with support from a broad range of partners, allows visitors to tap into the health information of WHO Member States and other partners. Users can review policies, laws and strategies and search for best practices and success stories in the field of mental health. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“If a government, for example, wishes to develop a new mental health policy in line with international human rights standards it can - on the new platform - quickly get an overview about the policies of other countries and benefit from their experiences and an array of international guidance tools and resources,“ explains Nathalie Drew, WHO Technical Officer working on mental health and human rights. So far, already more than 160 countries are sharing key mental health information through the MiNDbank and updates will be provided on a regular basis.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The WHO QualityRights initiative was launched in 2012, as part of the drive to raise human rights and quality standards in mental health and social care. The goal is to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions and promote high-quality mental health services in the community.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information please contact:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib<br/>\nCommunications Officer/Spokesperson<br/>\nWHO<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 3228<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 475 5556<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:chaibf@who.int\">chaibf@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

Over 60% of public hospitals have been damaged or are out of service, while a similar proportion of ambulances have been stolen or badly damaged. At a time when hospitals are overwhelmed with patients, it is vital that these facilities be protected and medical staff be allowed to provide urgent medical, surgical and obstetric care to patients without any risk. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Health facilities must be respected and protected in all circumstances - they should not be used for military purposes. Attacks against health facilities can be considered a war crime under international law. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>All parties must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians, health facilities and health professionals during conflict and to permit the supply of vital humanitarian aid, such as medicines, vaccines and medical equipment to reach the most needy communities. It is of the interest of both parties in the conflict and of all Syrian people to preserve the neutrality and the functionality of health infrastructure.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Despite the insecurity and serious access challenges the United Nations and partners have helped vaccinate more than 3.3 million children against measles and polio in recent weeks. Over 8000 women have received reproductive and maternal health services, while medical supplies and training have been provided to ensure that hundreds of thousands of people with chronic health problems are treated. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>We and our humanitarian partners continue to call for a halt to the violence and for all those with influence over the parties to urge immediate compliance with international law. And we ask that all our partners increase our common efforts to draw attention to these inhumane acts and to protect innocent women, men and children.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For further information, please contact:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>WHO Geneva<br/>\nGregory Hartl<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 4458<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:hartlg@who.int\">hartlg@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>OCHA New York<br/>\nAmanda Pitt<br/>\nTelephone: +1 917 442 1810, <br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:pitta@un.org\">pitta@un.org</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>OCHA New York<br/>\nClare Doyle<br/>\nTelephone: +1 646 288 6331<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:doylecm@un.org\">doylecm@un.org</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>UNICEF New York<br/>\nRita Ann Wallace<br/>\nTelephone: +1 212 326 7586<br/>\nMobile: +1 917 213 4034<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:rwallace@unicef.org\">rwallace@unicef.org</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>UNICEF New York<br/>\nKent Page<br/>\nTelephone: +1 212 326 7605<br/>\nMobile: +1 917 302 1735<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:kpage@unicef.org\">kpage@unicef.org</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

A number of affected States Parties reporting recent cases of MERS-CoV – Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Spain – were also on the teleconference. </span>\n</p><p><span>During the informational session of the meeting, the WHO Secretariat provided an update on and assessment of epidemiological and scientific developments, including a description of cases over time, notable recent clusters, detection by polymerase chain reaction testing of MERS-CoV in camels, and the public health preparation and experience of the Hajj pilgrimage. </span>\n</p><p><span>The above affected States Parties presented on recent developments in their countries. </span>\n</p><p><span>After discussion and deliberation on the information provided, the Committee concluded that it saw no reason to change its previous advice to the Director-General. Based on a risk assessment of current information, it was the unanimous decision of the Committee that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met. </span>\n</p><p><span>The situation continues to be of concern, in view of ongoing cases and of new information about the presence of the virus in camels. Although it still does not consider the events to constitute a PHEIC, the Committee reinforced its previous advice for consideration by WHO and Member States, as follows:</span>\n</p><ul><li>strengthening surveillance, including in countries with pilgrims; </li><li>continuing to increase awareness and effective risk communication concerning MERS-CoV;</li><li>supporting countries that are particularly vulnerable, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, taking into account the regional challenges;</li><li>increasing relevant diagnostic testing capacities;</li><li>continuing with investigative work, including identifying the source of the virus and relevant exposures through case-control studies and other research;</li><li>timely sharing of information in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005) and ongoing active coordination with WHO.</li></ul><p><span>Based on events since its last meeting, the Committee emphasized the need for:</span>\n</p><ul><li>investigative studies, including international case-control, serological, environmental, and animal-human interface studies, to better understand risk factors and the epidemiology;</li><li>further review and strengthening of such tools as standardized case definitions and surveillance and further emphasis on infection control and prevention. </li></ul><p><span>The Committee commended the extensive public health preparation for, surveillance and management of the Hajj pilgrimage by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</span>\n</p><p><span>As it has since the initial meeting, the WHO Secretariat continues to provide regular updates to the Committee Members and Advisors. With regard to reconvening the Committee, it was suggested that March 2014 might be an appropriate time (i.e. after the Northern Hemisphere winter). It was noted that any serious developments may require re-convening the Committee before then. </span>\n</p><p><span>Based on this advice and the currently available information, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment.

Around one third of babies in the area born before the disaster who are less than 6 months old are already exclusively breastfed, and 9 out of 10 were at least partially breastfed before the emergency. The mothers who were doing at least some breastfeeding need to be supported to transition to exclusive breastfeeding.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“The uncontrolled distribution and use of infant formula in emergency situations like this – where there are serious water and sanitation challenges and other disease risks – is extremely dangerous. Supporting breastfeeding is one of the most important things we can do to protect babies in areas of the Philippines hit by the typhoon,” said Dr Julie Hall, WHO Representative in the Philippines.</span></p>\n<div class=\"blockquote-container\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Supporting breastfeeding is one of the most important things we can do to protect babies in areas of the Philippines hit by the typhoon.\"</p>\n<p class=\"source\">\nDr Julie Hall, WHO Representative in the Philippines\n</p>\n</blockquote> </div>\n<p>\n<span>UNICEF and WHO prioritise the protection, promotion and support of breastfeeding as a life-saving measure for babies everywhere, and especially in emergencies.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“With the right support – from a health worker, a counsellor or another mother – a woman who is already doing some breastfeeding can increase her milk production within days just by feeding her baby more frequently,” said Tomoo Hozumi, UNICEF Representative in the Philippines.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Babies under 6 months the most vulnerable in emergency situations</h3>\n<p>\n<span>During emergency situations, disease and death rates among babies and children are higher than for any other age group; and the younger the child, the higher the risk, leaving babies under 6 months most vulnerable.

The mothers who were doing at least some breastfeeding need to be supported to transition to exclusive breastfeeding.",

It occurs when infants and children do not have adequate energy, protein and micronutrients in their diet, combined with other health problems such as recurrent infections. It is diagnosed when the circumference of the upper arm is less than 115 mm or when the weight for height of a child is severely reduced.</span></p><p><span>Children with severe acute malnutrition are among the most vulnerable people in the world. They are very thin: most of their fat and muscle has been used by their bodies to stay alive. </span></p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Main recommendations</h3><p><span>The updated WHO guidelines recommend that children with severe acute malnutrition who do not have health complications that require hospitalization, receive special, high-energy food and antibiotics to treat infection. This allows them to recover at home with their families. They also give guidance on how to treat them for HIV and, if necessary make recommendations on how to treat severely malnourished infants under six months.</span></p><div class=\"blockquote-container\"><blockquote><p>“The guidelines are critical because many national health plans currently overlook children with severe acute malnutrition...

The guidelines have been updated to reflect new opportunities and technologies that allow severely malnourished children who have an appetite and no evident medical complications to be effectively treated at home with specially-formulated foods that provide energy and nutrients and antibiotic medicines.</span></p><p><span>“It’s generally better for children and better for their families if they’re treated as outpatients,” says Dr Elizabeth Mason, Director of WHO’s Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health. “It can be easier for families who need to continue providing and caring for other children, and it allows vulnerable, malnourished children to stay home and avoid the risk of getting hospital infections.”</span></p><p><span>The proactive use of antibiotics is important because the immune system of a child who is severely malnourished can virtually shut down. This lack of immune response means both that the body cannot fight off infection and that tests may not detect infection, even when one is present.

The 1999 guidelines did not recommend HIV testing of children with severe acute malnutrition. At that time, there was poor availability and little experience of treating children with antiretroviral drugs. Circumstances today are very different. We now know that antiretrovirals significantly increase survival of children with HIV, and access to these drugs is improving. The new guidelines recommend that children with severe acute malnutrition in countries where HIV is common be routinely tested for the virus, and those who are positive should start on antiretroviral drugs as well as special foods and antibiotics to treat their severe malnutrition.</span></p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Infants under 6 months with severe acute malnutrition</h3><p><span>The other group whose needs are addressed for the first time in these guidelines are infants under 6 months with severe acute malnutrition. WHO recommends that all babies under 6 months are exclusively breastfed for optimal nutrition and protection against infections. This is particularly important for babies who are severely malnourished. Health services should give special support to mothers of these infants to breastfeed as well as treating the child with antibiotics. If there is no realistic prospect of a severely malnourished baby being breastfed, the family may need breast milk from another woman, e.g. a family member, a neighbour, a wet nurse or a milk bank. If this is not possible, they will need infant formula and support to prepare and use it safely.</span></p><div></div>",

          "\"WHO and UNICEF staff hand-carried supplies from Manila to Tacloban, coordinated teams to give the vaccines and trained them on how to do it under these difficult circumstances. It is virtually unprecedented that within two-and-a-half weeks of a disaster of this scale, with this level of devastation and these logistical challenges, that a mass vaccination campaign is already rolling out,\" says Dr Julie Hall, WHO Representative in the Philippines.",
          "During the campaign children being immunized are also screened for malnutrition by measuring their mid-upper arm circumference which will indicate if they are undernourished and require referral for treatment."

For example, people with diabetes or tuberculosis need access to their medications, and pregnant women need a safe place to give birth.\"</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>There are currently 22 international medical teams operating in the Philippines in 3 regions, each with a Philippine medical liaison.

The full extent of the disaster is becoming increasingly clear, with dozens of separate sites needing assistance.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>At least seven provinces have been hit by the disaster (Samar, Leyte, Cebu, Iloilo, Capiz, Aklan and Palawan) and a humanitarian hub is being established in each. But the scope of the disaster could be larger still. There are concerns that some 20 smaller islands with remote communities may have been impacted by the typhoon as well. This makes delivering relief exceedingly complicated.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Because of the geography of the Philippines – an archipelago of many islands – and the fact that so many have been hit by the typhoon, it is essentially like mounting at least seven separate, simultaneous relief efforts. This multiplies the logistical challenges associated with the response,” says Dr Julie Hall, WHO Representative in the Philippines.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Health infrastructure – including the “cold chain” which is vital for safe storage and transportation of vaccines – has been severely damaged by the typhoon. Initial assessments have found that 18 of the 38 health facilities in affected regions are not functional.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Aid is beginning to reach those in need. A total of 22 Filipino medical teams have been deployed to typhoon-affected areas. For example, the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center – the only local health facility remaining operational in Tacloban – is being manned by teams from Metro Manila Hospitals.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In addition, 11 foreign medical teams are operational in areas including Tacloban, Ormoc City, Panay, Guiuan and Palo, and another 14 foreign teams are on their way. WHO has teams on location in Tacloban and Cebu, coordinating the actions of foreign medical teams. Around 50 WHO experts have come to the Philippines to support government efforts, in excess of the staff who were already in the country prior to the typhoon.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>There are estimated to be more than 200 000 pregnant women and 130 000 breastfeeding women in affected areas in need of specialized prenatal, postnatal, child health, health promotion and family planning services.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Guiuan is one of the hardest-hit areas, with every health facility destroyed, including the only facility in Eastern Samar province with capacity to help women with complications of child birth. However, reproductive health kits have been sent to Guiuan to treat patients with obstetric complications. A generator, a refrigerator to store medicines, a delivery bed, midwifery kits and hygiene kits have also been sent.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Some 1350 hygiene and dignity kits (containing items such as soap, sanitary napkins, toilet paper and underpants) have arrived in Tacloban City for distribution to pregnant and breastfeeding women.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">For more information or interview requests, please contact:</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Nyka Alexander (Manila)<br/>\nCommunications Officer<br/>\nTelephone: +63 906 493 5097<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:alexandern@wpro.who.int\">alexandern@wpro.who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Christy Feig<br/>\nDirector of Communications<br/>\nTelephone: +41 79 251 7055<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:feigc@who.int\">feigc@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Gregory Härtl<br/>\nCoordinator, News and Social Media<br/>\nTelephone: +41 79 203 6715<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:hartlg@who.int\">hartlg@who.int</a> </span></p>\n<div></div>",

In support of the Government of the Philippines, WHO is coordinating all health-related aspects of the emergency response to ensure the supplies are moved quickly to where health facilities and supplies are most damaged, such as Tacloban, Cebu and the west coast of Leyte.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO and its staff are working around the clock to support the Government in coordinating the incoming relief supplies from more than 30 international humanitarian health organizations to ensure there is minimum duplication of materials and medicines arriving at any one location, and that hospitals, personnel and supplies get as quickly as possible to those places where they are needed most.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Within 3 days of Typhoon Haiyan hitting the Philippines, field hospitals with medical teams from Belgium, Israel, Norway and Japan are currently on the ground. More teams from Australia and Germany are expected today and tomorrow. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Other country governments and nongovernmental organizations that have pledged their support include: Canada, Finland, Hungary, Indonesia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Viet Nam. The field hospitals will be set up at locations where local hospitals have been destroyed. They are fully self-sufficient – bringing all of their own food, water, electricity, medical supplies and personnel. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The health needs in this disaster are significant. In addition to responding to injuries and trauma, “regular” health needs will also need to be met in very challenging circumstances. For instance, it is expected that 12 000 babies will be born this month in the affected areas. People with noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes or heart disease will need to continue receiving their regular medication. WHO is working with the Government and partners to provide necessary assistance.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO has already deployed medicines and supplies to perform 400 surgeries and cover the basic health needs of 120 000 people for one month. Special diarrhoeal disease kits with medicines and supplies to treat 3000 cases of acute diarrhoea are also en route, since contaminated water is a frequent cause of diarrhoea. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>With another tropical storm expected to hit the Philippines later this week, the need for safe water and sanitation facilities is critical. WHO is working with other humanitarian organizations to secure urgently needed water purification tablets.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Crowded living conditions and contaminated drinking water can lead to the spread of infectious diseases which can exacerbate health problems. The key is catching these diseases early before they can spread. WHO is also helping the Government to strengthen its early warning alert and response network (EWARN) to rapidly detect disease outbreaks and other public health threats.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">For more information, or for an interview with Dr Julie Hall, WHO Representative, please contact:</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Nyka Alexander (Manila)<br/>\nCommunications Officer<br/>\nTelephone: +63 906 493 5097<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:alexandern@wpro.who.int\">alexandern@wpro.who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Rachel Parry<br/>\nCommunications<br/>\nTelephone: +63 949 766 5478<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:manilakings@gmail.com\">manilakings@gmail.com</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Christy Feig<br/>\nDirector of Communications<br/>\nTelephone: +41 79 251 7055<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:feigc@who.int\">feigc@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Gregory Härtl<br/>\nCoordinator, News and Social Media<br/>\nTelephone: +41 79 203 6715<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:hartlg@who.int\">hartlg@who.int</a> </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Tarik Jasarevic<br/>\nCommunications Officer<br/>\nTelephone: +41 79 367 6214<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:jasarevict@who.int\">jasarevict@who.int</a>\n</span></p>\n<div> </div>",

      "description": "WHO and the World Bank today revealed new global estimates that more than one billion people experience some form of disability. They urged governments to step up efforts to enable access to mainstream services and to invest in specialized programmes to unlock the vast potential of people with disabilities.World report on disability provides global estimatesThe first-ever World report on disability provides the first global estimates of persons with disabilities in 40 years and an overview of the status of disability in the world. New research shows that almost one-fifth of the estimated global total of persons living with disabilities, or between 110-190 million, encounter significant difficulties. The report stresses that few countries have adequate mechanisms in place to respond to the needs of people with disabilities. Barriers include stigma and discrimination, lack of adequate health care and rehabilitation services; and inaccessible transport, buildings and information and communication technologies. As a result, people with disabilities experience poorer health, lower educational achievements, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disabilities.\"Disability is part of the human condition,\" says WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan. \"Almost every one of us will be permanently or temporarily disabled at some point in life. We must do more to break the barriers which segregate people with disabilities, in many cases forcing them to the margins of society.\"“Addressing the health, education, employment, and other development needs of people living with disabilities is fundamental to achieving the Millennium Development Goals,\" says Robert B. Zoellick, President of The World Bank Group. “We need to help people with disabilities to gain equitable access to opportunities to participate and contribute to their communities. They have much to offer if given a fair chance to do so.”Key findings and recommendationsThe report shows that people with disabilities are more than twice as likely to find healthcare provider skills inadequate to meet their needs, and nearly three times more likely to report being denied needed health care. In low-income countries people with disabilities are 50% more likely to experience catastrophic health expenditure than non-disabled people. Children with disabilities are less likely to start school than non-disabled children and have lower rates of staying in school. In Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the employment rate of people with disabilities (44%) is slightly over half that for people without disabilities (75%).The report recommends that governments and their development partners provide people with disabilities access to all mainstream services, invest in specific programmes and services for those people with disabilities who are in need, and adopt a national disability strategy and plan of action. In addition, governments should work to increase public awareness and understanding of disability, and support further research and training in the area. Importantly, people with disabilities should be consulted and involved in the design and implementation of these efforts.The report highlights a number of approaches used by countries worldwide to enable people with disabilities to access services, infrastructure, information and jobs.In Mozambique and United Republic of Tanzania, training workshops with information in Braille and sign language ensure that HIV messages reach young people with disabilities.In Uganda, the Sustainable Clubfoot Care Project improves detection and rehabilitation of children with clubfoot by raising public awareness that clubfoot is correctable, improving the provision of foot orthotics, training primary health personnel, and subsidizing transport costs.In Curitiba, Brazil, an integrated public transport system improves access for people with disabilities by adopting universal design and sensitizing drivers and other staff.In Viet Nam, children with disabilities are able to learn in mainstream schools by revising policies, making buildings accessible, providing specialized support for individual students, and training administrators, teachers and parents.In Malaysia, the Return to Work programme enables people with occupational injury-related disability to return to full-time employment by coordinating rehabilitation services and welfare support.Welcoming the report, renowned theoretical physicist Professor Stephen Hawking said, \"We have a moral duty to remove the barriers to participation for people with disabilities, and to invest sufficient funding and expertise to unlock their vast potential… It is my hope this century will mark a turning point for inclusion of people with disabilities in the lives of their societies.\"Nearly 150 countries and regional organizations have signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), and 100 have ratified it, committing them to removing barriers so that people with disabilities may participate fully in their societies. The World report on disability, developed with contributions from over 380 experts, will be a key resource for countries implementing the CRPD.",

The EU has long been a frontrunner in tobacco control. The 2001 Directive was adopted even before consensus was reached on the text of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in 2003. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The EU further showed its resolve to protect its citizens from the harms of tobacco use by ratifying the FCTC in 2005, the same year it came into force. However, in the intervening years, several market, scientific and international developments in the tobacco control sector have revealed a number of weaknesses, gaps and loopholes in the existing 2001 Directive rules.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Each year, tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke claim well more than 700 000 lives in European Union. As Party to the Treaty, the European Union has an obligation to strengthen its tobacco control legislation to reflect its international commitments.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span> Parties to the treaty are obliged over time to take a number of steps to reduce demand and supply for tobacco products including: protecting people from exposure to tobacco smoke; counteracting illicit trade; banning advertising, promotion and sponsorship; banning sales to minors; putting large health warnings on packages of tobacco; increasing tobacco taxes and creating a national coordinating mechanism for tobacco control. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Over the past months, the European Parliament’s Committee for the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has worked intensively to update and complete the 2001 Directive. The ongoing revision process of the EU Tobacco Products Directive is an excellent opportunity to align with the obligations under the WHO FCTC.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span> I am heartened to note that the current Directive draft is responsive to the health concerns of Europeans related to the tobacco epidemic, especially as studies show that the European public also supports strong tobacco control policies. I hope to see the same support from the legislators to the final legislative report during the next plenary session of the European Parliament. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>A strong EU Tobacco Products Directive would not only help save lives and protect young people from addiction, but will also signal to the world that the EU can continue to be seen as a strong ally in the fight against the tobacco epidemic. This is an epidemic which claimed an estimated 100 million lives during the previous century, and which could claim a billion more lives in the 21st century if countries do not implement the measures called for in the WHO FCTC. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In the case of the EU Directive, the tobacco industry is, once again, making an extraordinary effort to keep its products from being regulated, precisely because regulation works so well to reduce the vast harm caused by tobacco products. The tobacco industry is, once again, using an arsenal of economic arguments, precisely because such arguments are so effective in shifting the emphasis away from health, especially in times of financial austerity.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>I strongly encourage EU parliamentarians to remain steadfast in the midst of these pressures. In our shared zeal to abate the entirely avoidable deaths and diseases brought on by tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke, Europeans who are concerned about the toll of the tobacco epidemic and all of us in the public health community are urging you to hear our collective voices as we call on you to support the adoption of the Tobacco Products Directive.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO stands ready to support the process and the future steps which will be necessary to implement the new European Tobacco Products Directive.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For further information, please contact:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib <br/>\nCommunications Officer/WHO Spokesperson<br/> WHO<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 3228 <br/>\nMobile: +41 79 475 5556<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:chaibf@who.int\">chaibf@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

This is roughly half the number of under-fives who died in 1990, when more than 12 million children died. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“This trend is a positive one. Millions of lives have been saved,\" said Anthony Lake, UNICEF Executive Director. \"And we can do still better. Most of these deaths can be prevented, using simple steps that many countries have already put in place – what we need is a greater sense of urgency.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The leading causes of death among children aged less than five years include pneumonia, prematurity, birth asphyxia, diarrhoea and malaria. Globally, about 45% of under-five deaths are linked to undernutrition. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>About half of under-five deaths occur in only five countries: China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. India (22%) and Nigeria (13%) together account for more than one-third of all deaths of children under the age of five. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Newborn children are at particularly high risk </h3>\n<p>\n<span>“Care for mother and baby in the first 24 hours of any child’s life is critical for the health and wellbeing of both,” says Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General at WHO. “Up to half of all newborn deaths occur within the first day.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The lives of most of these babies could be saved if they had access to some basic health-care services. These include skilled care during and after childbirth; inexpensive medicines such as antibiotics; and practices such as skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their newborn babies and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Progress, challenges </h3>\n<p>\n<span>While the global average annual rate of reduction in under-five mortality accelerated from 1.2% a year for the period 1990–1995 to 3.9% for 2005–2012, it remains insufficient to reach Millennium Development Goal 4 which aims to reduce the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Continued investments by countries to strengthen health systems are essential to ensure that all mothers and children can get the affordable, quality care they need to live healthy, productive lives,” said Keith Hansen, Acting Vice President of Human Development at the World Bank Group.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, faces significant challenges as the region with the highest child mortality rates in the world. With a rate of 98 deaths per 1000 live births, a child born in sub-Saharan Africa faces more than 16 times the risk of dying before his or her fifth birthday than a child born in a high-income country. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>However, sub-Saharan Africa has shown remarkable acceleration in its progress, with the annual rate of reduction in deaths increasing from 0.8% in 1990–1995 to 4.1% in 2005–2012. This is the result of sound government policies, prioritized investments and actions to address the key causes of child mortality and reach even the most difficult to reach populations. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Global and national action to improve child health</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Both globally and in countries, a series of initiatives are in place aimed at improving access to maternal and child health care, inspired by the United Nations Secretary-General’s widely endorsed Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health which aims to save 16 million lives by 2015 through a “continuum of care” approach.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>As part of this strategy, focus on specific areas is given through:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Global Vaccine Action Plan that is working towards universal access to immunization by 2020. Vaccination against preventable diseases is one of most effective country-driven and globally-supported actions, as it currently averts an estimated two to three million deaths every year in all age groups from diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), and measles. In 2012, an estimated 83% (111 million) of infants worldwide were vaccinated with three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccine.</li>\n<li>Some 176 countries have signed on to A Promise Renewed – the call to action spearheaded by the Governments of Ethiopia, India and the United States, together with UNICEF in a global effort to stop children from dying of causes that are easily prevented. </li>\n<li>The United Nations Commission on Life-Saving Commodities for Women and Children is helping countries improve access to priority medicines such as basic antibiotics and oral rehydration salts.</li>\n<li>Earlier this year, WHO and UNICEF joined other partners in establishing a new Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea which aims to end preventable child deaths from these two major killers of under-fives by 2025. The plan promotes practices known to protect children from disease, such as creating a healthy home environment, and measures to ensure that every child has access to proven and appropriate preventive and treatment measures.</li>\n<li>Similarly, partners are working on Every Newborn: a global action plan to end preventable deaths. The aim is to launch this global newborn action plan in May 2014 and provide strategic directions to prevent and manage the most common causes of newborn mortality, which account for around 44% of all under-five mortality. </li>\n<li>UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank Group all support the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) global movement in its efforts to collaborate with countries to implement programmes to address poor nutrition at scale with a core focus on empowering women.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>\"Global partnerships to further accelerate the reduction of under-five mortality globally and in sub-Saharan Africa are essential,\" said Wu Hongbo, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs at the United Nations. \"In this regard, it is critical that national governments and development partners redouble efforts through to the end of 2015 and beyond.\"</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Note to editors:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Global estimates of child mortality are challenging to produce because many countries lack complete systems to track vital records. The estimates released today are based on statistical models and data from a variety of sources, including household surveys and censuses. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>All the numbers cited here fall within a statistical confidence range. For example, the estimated global number of 6.6 million deaths in 2012 falls within the statistical confidence range from 6.3 to 7.0. </span></p>\n<h5 class=\"section_head3\">About UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME) </h5>\n<p>\n<span>The report \"Levels &amp; trends in child mortality\" was produced by the IGME which is led by UNICEF and WHO, and also includes the World Bank and the United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. IGME was formed in 2004 to share data on child mortality, harmonize estimates within the UN system, improve methods for child mortality estimation report on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and enhance country capacity to produce timely and properly assessed estimates of child mortality.</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"section_head3\">About UNICEF</h5>\n<p>\n<span>UNICEF works in more than 190 countries and territories to help children survive and thrive, from early childhood through adolescence. The world’s largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. </span></p>\n<h5 class=\"section_head3\">About WHO</h5>\n<p>\n<span>WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system. It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries, and monitoring and assessing health trends and improving global health security.</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"section_head3\">About the World Bank Group</h5>\n<p>\n<span>The World Bank Group is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world, with the goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Improving health is integral to achieving these goals. The Bank Group provides financing, state-of-the-art analysis, and policy advice to help countries expand access to quality, affordable health care; protect people from falling into poverty or worsening poverty due to illness; and promote investments in all sectors that form the foundation of healthy societies.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">For more information please contact:</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib <br/>\nCommunications Officer/WHO Spokesperson<br/>\nWHO, Geneva<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 32 28<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 475 55 56<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:chaibf@who.int\">chaibf@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Kate Donavon<br/>\nUNICEF Media<br/>\nTelephone: + 1 212 326 7452<br/>\nMobile: + 1 917 378 2128<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:kdonovan@unicef.org\">kdonovan@unicef.org</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Marixie Mercado<br/>\nUNICEF Media in Geneva<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 909 5716<br/>\nMobile +41 79 756 7703 <br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:mmercado@unicef.org\">mmercado@unicef.org</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Iman Morooka<br/>\nUNICEF Strategic Communications<br/>\nTelephone: +1 212 326 7211<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:imorooka@unicef.org\">imorooka@unicef.org</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Melanie Mayhew<br/>\nWorld Bank Group<br/>\nTelephone: +1 202-459-7115<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:mmayhew1@worldbank.org\">mmayhew1@worldbank.org</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

The most common infections are urinary tract and surgical site infections, pneumonia and infections of the bloodstream and are often caused by multi-drug resistant germs such as methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA). Of every 100 hospitalized patients, at least seven in developed and 10 in developing countries will acquire a health care-associated infection. Among critically ill and vulnerable patients in intensive care units, that figure rises to around 30 per 100.

Key overlapping practices emerging from these experiences are summarized. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Findings from the report include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Indonesia (Aceh):</b> Like many provinces in Indonesia, Aceh had only institution-based care before the tsunami of 2004. Today, most districts have primary mental health services supported by secondary care at district general hospitals.</li>\n<li><b>Iraq:</b> Since 2004, significant progress has been made toward the creation of a comprehensive mental health system. More than 50% of general practitioners have received mental health training.</li>\n<li><b>Kosovo:</b> Starting from a hospital-based model of care in 1999 after the conflict, a system of community-based mental health care is now available. </li>\n<li><b>Sri Lanka:</b> Since the 2004 tsunami, a new national mental health policy has guided reform, which now extends to most parts of the country. Several new cadres of community-based mental health workers have been developed. </li>\n<li><b>Timor-Leste:</b> Building from a complete absence of mental health services in 1999, the country today has a comprehensive community-based mental health system. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>The possibilities presented by emergency situations are significant because major gaps remain worldwide in the realization of comprehensive, community-based mental health care. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span> “The current situation is alarming,” says Dr Shekhar Saxena, WHO Director for Mental Health. “Health systems have not yet adequately responded to the burden of mental disorders. We know that the vast majority of people with severe mental disorders receive no treatment whatsoever in low-income and middle-income countries.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Transforming the mental health care systems in turn would improve the well-being, functioning, and resilience of individuals, societies, and countries recovering from emergencies, the report notes. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>By releasing this report, WHO aims to help guide policymakers to reform their mental health systems, especially those which may be susceptible to future emergencies. Already in 2013, the world has witnessed numerous emergency situations, from the crisis in Syria and neighbouring countries to heavy fighting in Mali and the Central African Republic, major flooding in parts of the Americas, Africa, and Asia, and others. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information please contact:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Tarik Jasarevic<br/>\nWHO Communications Officer<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 5099<br/>\nMobile: +41 793 676 214<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:jasarevict@who.int\">jasarevict@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

They will also learn when to refer to more advanced treatment.” </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Traumatic events and loss a common experience</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Traumatic events and loss are common in people’s lives. In a previous WHO study of 21 countries, more than 10% of respondents reported witnessing violence (21.8%) or experiencing interpersonal violence (18.8%), accidents (17.7%), exposure to war (16.2%) or trauma to a loved one (12.5%). An estimated 3.6% of the world's population has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the previous year, the study showed. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Using the new protocol, which is co-published with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), primary health-care workers can offer basic psychosocial support to refugees as well as people exposed to trauma or loss in other situations.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Types of support offered can include psychological first aid, stress management and helping affected people to identify and strengthen positive coping methods and social supports. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In addition, referral for advanced treatments such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) or a new technique called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) should be considered for people suffering from PTSD.

More training and supervision is recommended to make these techniques more widely available. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Warnings against some popular treatments</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Primary health care staff are also warned against certain popular treatments. For example, benzodiazepines, which are anti-anxiety drugs, should not be offered to reduce acute traumatic stress symptoms or sleep problems in the first month after a potentially traumatic event. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“PTSD needs to be managed along with other common mental disorders” reports Dr Mark van Ommeren, Scientist in the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. “This new, simple WHO-UNHCR treatment protocol will guide health workers around the world to help adults and children who suffer from conditions specifically related to stress.” The new guidelines and protocol were published today in an article in \"The Journal of the American Medical Association\".</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Additional information</h3>\n<p>\n<span>There is no evidence on the benefits of benzodiazepines, a common anti-anxiety drug, on symptoms of traumatic stress after a recent potentially traumatic event.

    "content_html": "<p><strong></strong>The fight against leprosy has \r\nmade great progress in the past two decades but complacency may now be \r\nthreatening the last push towards a world free of this debilitating \r\ndisease, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned on the opening day \r\nof the International Leprosy Summit. </p><p>The three-day summit (24-26 July), being organized by WHO and \r\nthe Nippon Foundation, brought health ministers from eight countries and\r\n global experts to discuss the current leprosy situation and strategies \r\nfor further reducing the disease burden and realizing a leprosy-free \r\nworld.</p><p>The development of multidrug therapy in the 1980s effectively \r\ncured 16 million people in the past 20 years. But in many countries \r\nwhere the disease is endemic, new case-detection rates have been either \r\nstatic or showing increases. Globally, every 2 minutes, a new case of \r\nleprosy is detected and 7 out of every 100 cases is a child. \r\nMisinformation about leprosy is common and the disease continues to be \r\nshrouded in stigma with communities shunning patients even after they \r\nare cured. </p><p>“Our challenge is to sustain the quality of leprosy services \r\nand to ensure that all persons affected by leprosy, wherever they live, \r\nhave an equal opportunity to be diagnosed early and treated by competent\r\n health workers,” says Dr Samlee Plianbangchang, Regional Director, WHO \r\nSouth-East Asia. “While we’ve covered a lot of ground in reducing the \r\ndisease burden in all endemic countries, there is no room for \r\ncomplacency. The final battle against leprosy is yet to be won.”</p><p>Mr Yohei Sasakawa, chairman of the Nippon Foundation and WHO \r\nGoodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination, agreed with Dr Samlee and \r\ncautioned that the remaining challenges are becoming increasingly more \r\ndifficult and complex.</p><p>“The target populations are living in difficult to reach areas\r\n such as urban slums, border areas and ethnic minority areas. Moreover, \r\navailable resources in each country have declined,” Mr Sasakawa said.</p><p>He called on all parties involved to make political \r\ncommitments and contribute resources and expertise to the fight against \r\nleprosy. To this end the Nippon Foundation will be committing US$20 \r\nmillion for the next five years, Mr Sasakawa announced.</p><p>Since 1995, WHO has been providing free multidrug therapy \r\n(MDT) to all patients worldwide. This was initially funded through The \r\nNippon Foundation and, since 2000, through the MDT donation provided by \r\nthe Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development. Nearly 16 million \r\npeople have been cured of leprosy using MDT and more than 10 million \r\npeople have been prevented from developing visible deformities. </p><p>The number of highly endemic countries has gone down from 122 \r\nin 1985 to less than 20. However, despite significant progress, leprosy \r\ncontinues to be a health concern in these endemic pockets.</p><p>In 2012 there were 232 850 new cases of leprosy reported, with\r\n 94% of these cases restricted to 15 endemic countries - many of them in\r\n South-East Asia and Africa. This represents an increase of 6224 cases \r\nsince 2011. Additionally, the number of people with leprosy who sought \r\ntreatment only once they’d already developed visible deformities \r\nincreased from 13079 in 2011 to 14409 in 2012.

          "The fight against leprosy has \r\nmade great progress in the past two decades but complacency may now be \r\nthreatening the last push towards a world free of this debilitating \r\ndisease, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned on the opening day \r\nof the International Leprosy Summit.",
          "The three-day summit (24-26 July), being organized by WHO and \r\nthe Nippon Foundation, brought health ministers from eight countries and\r\n global experts to discuss the current leprosy situation and strategies \r\nfor further reducing the disease burden and realizing a leprosy-free \r\nworld.",
          "The development of multidrug therapy in the 1980s effectively \r\ncured 16 million people in the past 20 years. But in many countries \r\nwhere the disease is endemic, new case-detection rates have been either \r\nstatic or showing increases. Globally, every 2 minutes, a new case of \r\nleprosy is detected and 7 out of every 100 cases is a child. \r\nMisinformation about leprosy is common and the disease continues to be \r\nshrouded in stigma with communities shunning patients even after they \r\nare cured.",
          "“Our challenge is to sustain the quality of leprosy services \r\nand to ensure that all persons affected by leprosy, wherever they live, \r\nhave an equal opportunity to be diagnosed early and treated by competent\r\n health workers,” says Dr Samlee Plianbangchang, Regional Director, WHO \r\nSouth-East Asia. “While we’ve covered a lot of ground in reducing the \r\ndisease burden in all endemic countries, there is no room for \r\ncomplacency. The final battle against leprosy is yet to be won.”",
          "Mr Yohei Sasakawa, chairman of the Nippon Foundation and WHO \r\nGoodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination, agreed with Dr Samlee and \r\ncautioned that the remaining challenges are becoming increasingly more \r\ndifficult and complex.",
          "“The target populations are living in difficult to reach areas\r\n such as urban slums, border areas and ethnic minority areas. Moreover, \r\navailable resources in each country have declined,” Mr Sasakawa said.",
          "He called on all parties involved to make political \r\ncommitments and contribute resources and expertise to the fight against \r\nleprosy. To this end the Nippon Foundation will be committing US$20 \r\nmillion for the next five years, Mr Sasakawa announced.",
          "Since 1995, WHO has been providing free multidrug therapy \r\n(MDT) to all patients worldwide. This was initially funded through The \r\nNippon Foundation and, since 2000, through the MDT donation provided by \r\nthe Novartis Foundation for Sustainable Development. Nearly 16 million \r\npeople have been cured of leprosy using MDT and more than 10 million \r\npeople have been prevented from developing visible deformities.",
          "The number of highly endemic countries has gone down from 122 \r\nin 1985 to less than 20. However, despite significant progress, leprosy \r\ncontinues to be a health concern in these endemic pockets.",
          "In 2012 there were 232 850 new cases of leprosy reported, with\r\n 94% of these cases restricted to 15 endemic countries - many of them in\r\n South-East Asia and Africa. This represents an increase of 6224 cases \r\nsince 2011. Additionally, the number of people with leprosy who sought \r\ntreatment only once they’d already developed visible deformities \r\nincreased from 13079 in 2011 to 14409 in 2012. This is indicative of the\r\n need to detect cases early to prevent deformities among new cases.",
          "Significant gender inequities remain in reaching \r\nleprosy-affected persons, especially when it comes to case detection. \r\nAlthough the distribution of disease is likely to be even between women \r\nand men, leprosy is detected in a lower percentage of women.",
          "In order to bridge these gaps, and ensure that leprosy work \r\ncontinues on the path to further reduce the global disease burden, more \r\nwork needs to be done. WHO is advocating prompt treatment with MDT and \r\nallocating more resources to facilitate early case detection.

The resolution was adopted in ECOSOC’s 2013 Substantive Session being held in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>The Task Force will coordinate the activities of all UN organizations to implement the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2013. This is important because new WHO estimates show that 3 of the 4 leading causes of death worldwide are linked to noncommunicable diseases, specifically cardiovascular diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><p>The Action Plan aims to achieve 9 voluntary global targets, including a 25% reduction in premature mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases by 2025. The plan provides a road map and a menu of policy options for Member States, WHO, other UN organizations, NGOs and private sector entities to implement collectively. </p><p>Heads of State and Government in 2011 recognized the role and responsibility of governments in reducing noncommunicable diseases through the United Nations Political Declaration on the Prevention and Control of NCDs. With this resolution, ECOSOC is following up on those commitments.</p><p>WHO will convene a formal meeting with Member States on 13 November 2013 to complete the work on a draft terms of reference for the UN Task Force on NCDs.</p><h3>One of the major challenges for development in the 21st century</h3><p>The global burden of NCDs – mainly cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and chronic lung diseases – constitutes one of the major challenges for development in the 21st century. The vast majority (86%) of deaths between the ages of 30 and 70 from these diseases occur in low- and middle-income countries, representing 12 million premature deaths per year. </p><p>Most of these deaths are linked to common risk factors, namely tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet, and lack of physical activity. Premature deaths from NCDs cause human suffering, reduce productivity, curtail economic growth, and increase the financial burden for patients due to the high cost of health care that drives families below the poverty line. </p><p>To prevent premature deaths from NCDs, non-health sectors also need to take action. The Task Force will provide developing countries with policy advice, technical assistance and capacity building. It will share lessons learned in mobilizing different sectors of government to respond to NCDs.</p><h3>A role for each UN organization</h3><p>Within the UN System, WHO has been leading efforts to support countries in efforts to prevent and control NCDs.

      "description": "22 July 2013 | Geneva -- The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) adopted a resolution requesting the UN Secretary-General to establish a United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases. The Task Force will be convened and led by the WHO and will be created by expanding the mandate of the existing United Nations Ad Hoc Interagency Task Force on Tobacco Control and the work to support the implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). The resolution was adopted in ECOSOC’s 2013 Substantive Session being held in Geneva, Switzerland.The Task Force will coordinate the activities of all UN organizations to implement the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2013. This is important because new WHO estimates show that 3 of the 4 leading causes of death worldwide are linked to noncommunicable diseases, specifically cardiovascular diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.The Action Plan aims to achieve 9 voluntary global targets, including a 25% reduction in premature mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases by 2025. The plan provides a road map and a menu of policy options for Member States, WHO, other UN organizations, NGOs and private sector entities to implement collectively. Heads of State and Government in 2011 recognized the role and responsibility of governments in reducing noncommunicable diseases through the United Nations Political Declaration on the Prevention and Control of NCDs. With this resolution, ECOSOC is following up on those commitments.WHO will convene a formal meeting with Member States on 13 November 2013 to complete the work on a draft terms of reference for the UN Task Force on NCDs.One of the major challenges for development in the 21st centuryThe global burden of NCDs – mainly cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and chronic lung diseases – constitutes one of the major challenges for development in the 21st century.

Recent evidence indicates that earlier ART will help people with HIV to live longer, healthier lives, and substantially reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others. The move could avert an additional 3 million deaths and prevent 3.5 million more new HIV infections between now and 2025.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The new recommendations are presented in WHO’s \"Consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection\", as new data reveal a total of 9.7 million people were taking these lifesaving drugs at the end of 2012. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“These guidelines represent another leap ahead in a trend of ever-higher goals and ever-greater achievements,” says WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan. “With nearly 10 million people now on antiretroviral therapy, we see that such prospects – unthinkable just a few years ago – can now fuel the momentum needed to push the HIV epidemic into irreversible decline.” </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Call to initiate treatment at 500 CD4 cells/mm³ or less</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The new recommendations encourage all countries to initiate treatment in adults living with HIV when their CD4 cell count falls to 500 cells/mm³ or less – when their immune systems are still strong. The previous WHO recommendation, set in 2010, was to offer treatment at 350 CD4 cells/mm³ or less. 90% of all countries have adopted the 2010 recommendation. A few, such as Algeria, Argentina and Brazil, are already offering treatment at 500 cells/mm3.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO has based its recommendation on evidence that treating people with HIV earlier, with safe, affordable, and easier-to-manage medicines can both keep them healthy and lower the amount of virus in the blood, which reduces the risk of passing it to someone else. If countries can integrate these changes within their national HIV policies, and back them up with the necessary resources, they will see significant health benefits at the public health and individual level, the report notes. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Further recommendations</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The new recommendations also include providing antiretroviral therapy - irrespective of their CD4 count - to all children with HIV under 5 years of age, all pregnant and breastfeeding women with HIV, and to all HIV-positive partners where one partner in the relationship is uninfected. The Organization continues to recommend that all people with HIV with active tuberculosis or with hepatitis B disease receive antiretroviral therapy.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Another new recommendation is to offer all adults starting to take ART the same daily single fixed-dose combination pill. This combination is easier to take and safer than alternative combinations previously recommended and can be used in adults, pregnant women, adolescents and older children. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Advances like these allow children and pregnant women to access treatment earlier and more safely, and move us closer to our goal of an AIDS-free generation,” said UNICEF Executive Director, Anthony Lake. “Now, we must accelerate our efforts, investing in innovations that allow us to test new born babies faster and giving them the appropriate treatment so that they enjoy the best possible start in life.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Organization is further encouraging countries to enhance the ways they deliver HIV services, for example by linking them more closely with other health services, such as those for tuberculosis, maternal and child health, sexual and reproductive health, and treatment for drug dependence.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“The new WHO guidelines are very timely in view of the rapid progress we have made in expanding programmes for prevention and treatment,” says Dr Mark Dybul, Executive Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. “This is an example of how the Global Fund and the WHO work together to support countries as we move towards removing HIV as a threat to public health.\" Since its creation in 2002, the Global Fund has supported more than 1000 programmes in 151 countries, providing HIV treatment for 4.2 million people.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Challenges remain</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Challenges still remain. Alongside the new treatment guidelines, a treatment progress update by WHO, UNAIDS, UNICEF identified areas in need of attention. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>While the number of all eligible children on ART has increased by 10% between 2011 and 2012, this is still too slow compared to the 20% increase in adults. A further complication is that many key populations such as people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, transgender people and sex workers, continue to face legal and cultural barriers that prevent them getting treatment that otherwise would be more easily available. Another factor that needs to be addressed is the significant proportion of people who, for many reasons, ‘drop out’ of treatment. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Data reinforces feasibility of recommendations</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Despite this, the <i>Global update on HIV treatment: results, impact and opportunities</i> contains encouraging data that reinforces the feasibility of the new WHO recommendation on earlier ART, which would expand the global number of people eligible for antiretroviral therapy to 26 million. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Between 2011 and 2012, the largest acceleration ever of people enrolled on ART was achieved, with an extra 1.6 million people benefitting from antiretroviral therapy, increasing the total to 9.7 million people. Furthermore, increased coverage of treatment occurred in every region of the world, with Africa leading. Four out of 5 people who started treatment in 2012 were living in sub-Saharan Africa.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Today nearly 10 million people have access to lifesaving treatment. This is a true development triumph,” says Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). “But we now have a new challenge - ensuring that all 26 million people eligible for treatment have access - not one person less.

In some regions (including sub-Saharan Africa), they are 1.5 times more likely to acquire HIV. </li>\n<li><b>Unwanted pregnancy and abortion</b> – Both partner violence and non-partner sexual violence are associated with unwanted pregnancy; the report found that women experiencing physical and/or sexual partner violence are twice as likely to have an abortion than women who do not experience this violence.</li>\n<li><b>Low birth-weight babies</b> – Women who experience partner violence have a 16% greater chance of having a low birth-weight baby. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>“This new data shows that violence against women is extremely common.

They stress the importance of training all levels of health workers to recognize when women may be at risk of partner violence and to know how to provide an appropriate response. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>They also point out that some health-care settings, such as antenatal services and HIV testing, may provide opportunities to support survivors of violence, provided certain minimum requirements are met.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Health providers have been trained how to ask about violence.</li>\n<li>Standard operating procedures are in place.</li>\n<li>Consultation takes place in a private setting.</li>\n<li>Confidentiality is guaranteed.</li>\n<li>A referral system is in place to ensure that women can access related services.</li>\n<li>In the case of sexual assault, health care settings must be equipped to provide the comprehensive response women need – to address both physical and mental health consequences. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>The report’s authors stress the importance of using these guidelines to incorporate issues of violence into the medical and nursing curricula as well as during in-service training. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO will begin to work with countries in South-East Asia to implement the new recommendations at the end of June.

Obese children are more likely to be obese as adults, with an increased risk of diabetes and other diseases.</span></p><h3>WHO's Essential Nutrition Action</h3><p><span>To help countries close these policy gaps, WHO has issued a consolidated package of 24 Essential Nutrition Actions, which outline the most effective ways countries can improve their peoples’ nutritional status by preventing both undernutrition and overweight. There are many factors during pregnancy and infancy that can affect an older child’s and an adult’s weight.</span></p><div data-class=\"blockquote-container\"><blockquote>To avoid a massive explosion of nutrition problems in the next generation, policymakers urgently need to give more attention to improving the nutritional status of pregnant women and adolescent girls who will become mothers of the next generation.</blockquote><div>- Dr Francesco Branca, Director, WHO’s Department of Nutrition for Health and Development</div></div><p><span></span><span>Interventions include:</span></p><ul><li>improve nutrition of pregnant and breastfeeding women;</li><li>encourage early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months, then continued breastfeeding up to 2 years;</li><li>promote appropriate solid foods for young children; and</li><li>provide micronutrient supplements and fortified foods, when needed. </li></ul><p><span>“Increasingly, we find overweight children living in countries where undernutrition is also still an issue,” says Dr Francesco Branca, Director of WHO’s Department of Nutrition for Health and Development. “While it is vital to maintain efforts to reduce undernutrition, the world needs to do much more to prevent and care for the growing numbers of people that are overweight or obese and living in low- and middle-income countries.”</span></p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Causes of overweight and undernutrition</h3><p><span>These conditions – undernutrition, obesity and overweight – are forms of malnutrition with their causes and consequences closely linked to inadequacies in the food system. A food system that does not deliver a sufficient amount of quality food can lead both to poor growth and to excess weight gain. A child who has grown poorly in his first years of life may turn into a short but overweight adolescent and then later in life, develop chronic disease as an adult. </span></p><p><span>“To avoid a massive explosion of nutrition problems in the next generation, policymakers urgently need to give more attention to improving the nutritional status of pregnant women and adolescent girls who will become mothers of the next generation,” adds Dr Branca.</span></p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Essential Nutrition Actions address many health issues</h3><p><span>Many policies to address the other half of the “double burden” of malnutrition – obesity and diet-related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke – are much further behind, especially in Africa and South-East Asia. And even when policies to address obesity exist at a national level, they are often not implemented at provincial or district level. Only one-third of surveyed countries regulate the marketing of foods to children, and only a few have taken measures to reduce salt or transfats in foods.</span></p><p><span>Focusing on these essential nutrition actions, countries can reduce infant and child mortality, improve growth and development, and improve productivity. Countries such as Brazil, Ethiopia, and Peru and India’s second-most populous state, Maharashtra, have achieved such successes as a result of implementing these actions.</span></p><p><span>Worldwide, more than 100 million children under five years of age are underweight; 165 million are stunted i.e. have a low height for their age (which is a better indicator of chronic undernutrition). An estimated 35% of all deaths among children under five are associated with undernutrition.

Only one-third of surveyed countries regulate the marketing of foods to children, and only a few have taken measures to reduce salt or transfats in foods.",

An article published in WHO’s Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER) reveals that the Organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) has reviewed the latest evidence and concluded that a single dose of vaccination is sufficient to confer life-long immunity against yellow fever disease.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Since yellow fever vaccination began in the 1930s, only 12 known cases of yellow fever post-vaccination have been identified, after 600 million doses have been dispensed. Evidence showed that among this small number of “vaccine failures”, all cases developed the disease within five years of vaccination. This demonstrates that immunity does not decrease with time.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Important news for yellow fever endemic countries and travellers</h3>\n<p>\n<span> “The conventional guidance has been that the yellow fever vaccination has had to be boosted after ten years,” says Dr Helen Rees, chair of SAGE. “Looking at really very good evidence, it was quite clear to SAGE that in fact a single dose of yellow fever vaccine is effective. This is extremely important for countries where yellow fever is endemic, because it will allow them to reconsider their vaccine scheduling. It is also important for travelers.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes that is endemic to 44 countries in tropical areas of Africa and the Americas. Infection with the yellow fever virus causes varying degrees of disease, from mild symptoms to severe illness with bleeding and jaundice and fatal outcomes. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Estimated 200 000 new cases each year</h3>\n<p>\n<span>There are an estimated 200 000 cases of yellow fever worldwide each year. About 15% of people infected with yellow fever progress to a severe form of the illness, and up to half of those will die, as there is no cure for yellow fever. The treatment is aimed simply at reducing patients’ discomfort. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The vast majority of reported cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa. In endemic regions of Africa, yellow fever natural immunity is acquired with age, putting children at highest risk of infection. Over the past two decades, the number of yellow fever cases worldwide has increased due to declining population immunity to infection, deforestation, urbanization, population movements and climate change. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Vaccination is the most effective measure</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Vaccination is considered to be the most important and effective measure against yellow fever. Protective immunity develops within 30 days for 99% of people receiving the vaccination. For routine immunization programmes in Africa, home to 31 of the 44 yellow-fever endemic countries, the vaccine costs about $0.82 per dose.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>SAGE is the principal advisory group to WHO for vaccines and immunization. It is charged with advising WHO on overall global policies and strategies, ranging from vaccines and technology, research and development, to delivery of immunization and its linkages with other health interventions. SAGE is concerned with all vaccine-preventable diseases including childhood vaccines and immunization. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information please contact:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib<br/> Communications Officer/Spokesperson<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 32 28<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 475 55 56<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:chaibf@who.int\">chaibf@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

Some countries that were among those with the world’s highest child mortality rates in 1990 – including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Nepal, Rwanda, Senegal and Timor-Leste – have improved child survival to such an extent that they no longer belong to that group. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>However, despite the fact that 27 countries have reached the MDG target already, the current rates of progress will not be sufficient to reach the global target of a two-thirds reduction in 1990 levels of child mortality by 2015.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In 1990, countries with the highest rates of women dying in pregnancy and childbirth had on average 915 more maternal deaths per 100 000 live births than countries with the lowest rates. By 2010, this gap had narrowed to 512 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births. Unfortunately the global rate of decline (of 3%) will need to double to achieve the MDG target of reducing maternal mortality ratio by three quarters. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The gap between countries with the highest and lowest rates of new HIV infections narrowed from 360 to 261 people per 100 000 population between 1990 and 2011. While new HIV infections increased six-fold for countries with the lowest rates, the group of countries with the highest rates have cut new HIV infections by 27%. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Key trends outlined in the report</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Globally, tuberculosis (TB) deaths have decreased by more than 40% since 1990 and the trend indicates that this will reach 50% by 2015. The gap has narrowed between the top and bottom groups of countries from 62 TB deaths in 1990 to 41 deaths per 100 000 population in 2011.

          "“Intensive efforts to achieve the MDGs have clearly improved health for people all over the world,” says Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO. “But with less than 1000 days to go to reach the MDG deadline, it is timely to ask if these efforts have made a difference in reducing the unacceptable inequities between the richest and poorest countries.”",

Some countries that were among those with the world’s highest child mortality rates in 1990 – including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Nepal, Rwanda, Senegal and Timor-Leste – have improved child survival to such an extent that they no longer belong to that group.",
          "However, despite the fact that 27 countries have reached the MDG target already, the current rates of progress will not be sufficient to reach the global target of a two-thirds reduction in 1990 levels of child mortality by 2015.",
          "In 1990, countries with the highest rates of women dying in pregnancy and childbirth had on average 915 more maternal deaths per 100 000 live births than countries with the lowest rates. By 2010, this gap had narrowed to 512 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births. Unfortunately the global rate of decline (of 3%) will need to double to achieve the MDG target of reducing maternal mortality ratio by three quarters.",

WHO is calling on governments to take concrete actions to improve the safety of pedestrians. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Under the banner “Make Walking Safe”, the Second United Nations Global Road Safety Week (6-12 May) kicks off worldwide. With events registered in nearly 70 countries, the Week seeks to draw attention to the needs of pedestrians; generate action on measures to protect them; and contribute to achieving the goal of the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020 to save 5 million lives.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>There are many steps which can be taken to protect pedestrians on the roads. The newly released <i>Pedestrian safety: a road safety manual for decision-makers and practitioners</i>, produced by WHO and partners, promotes a focus on combined enforcement, engineering and education measures, which include among others:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>adopting and enforcing new and existing laws to reduce speeding, curb drinking and driving, decrease mobile phone use and other forms of distracted driving;</li>\n<li>putting in place infrastructure which separates pedestrians from other traffic (sidewalks, raised crosswalks, overpasses, underpasses, refuge islands and raised medians), lowers vehicle speeds (speed bumps, rumble strips and chicanes) and improves roadway lighting; </li>\n<li>creating pedestrian zones in city centres by restricting vehicular access; </li>\n<li>improving mass transit route design;</li>\n<li>developing and enforcing vehicle design standards for pedestrian protection, including soft vehicle fronts;</li>\n<li>organizing and/or further enhancing trauma care systems to guarantee the prompt treatment of those with life-threatening injuries. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>“The Second United Nations Global Road Safety Week offers an opportunity to highlight the myriad challenges that pedestrians face around the world each and every day,” notes WHO Assistant Director-General of Noncommunicable Diseases and Mental Health Dr Oleg Chestnov. “We are all pedestrians, and governments should put in place measures to better protect all of us. This will not only save lives, but create the conditions needed to make walking safe. When roads are safe, people will walk more, and this in turn will improve health and protect the environment.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Pedestrians are among the most vulnerable road users. Studies indicate that males, both children and adults, make up a high proportion of pedestrian deaths and injuries. In developed countries, older pedestrians are more at risk, while in low-income and middle-income countries, children and young adults are often affected. Both children and adults with disabilities suffer higher rates of injury as pedestrians compared to their non-disabled peers. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The proportion of pedestrians killed in relation to other road users is highest in the African Region (38%) and lowest in the South-East Asia Region (12%). In some countries, the proportion of pedestrian fatalities can reach nearly two thirds of road traffic deaths, such as in El Salvador (62%) and Liberia (66%). </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“More than 5000 pedestrians are killed on the world’s roads each week.

          "2 May 2013 | GENEVA - More than 270 000 pedestrians lose their lives on the world’s roads each year accounting for 22% of the total 1.24 million road traffic deaths. WHO is calling on governments to take concrete actions to improve the safety of pedestrians.",
          "Under the banner “Make Walking Safe”, the Second United Nations Global Road Safety Week (6-12 May) kicks off worldwide. With events registered in nearly 70 countries, the Week seeks to draw attention to the needs of pedestrians; generate action on measures to protect them; and contribute to achieving the goal of the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020 to save 5 million lives.",
          "There are many steps which can be taken to protect pedestrians on the roads. The newly released Pedestrian safety: a road safety manual for decision-makers and practitioners , produced by WHO and partners, promotes a focus on combined enforcement, engineering and education measures, which include among others:",
          "“The Second United Nations Global Road Safety Week offers an opportunity to highlight the myriad challenges that pedestrians face around the world each and every day,” notes WHO Assistant Director-General of Noncommunicable Diseases and Mental Health Dr Oleg Chestnov. “We are all pedestrians, and governments should put in place measures to better protect all of us. This will not only save lives, but create the conditions needed to make walking safe. When roads are safe, people will walk more, and this in turn will improve health and protect the environment.”",
          "Pedestrians are among the most vulnerable road users. Studies indicate that males, both children and adults, make up a high proportion of pedestrian deaths and injuries. In developed countries, older pedestrians are more at risk, while in low-income and middle-income countries, children and young adults are often affected. Both children and adults with disabilities suffer higher rates of injury as pedestrians compared to their non-disabled peers.",
          "The proportion of pedestrians killed in relation to other road users is highest in the African Region (38%) and lowest in the South-East Asia Region (12%). In some countries, the proportion of pedestrian fatalities can reach nearly two thirds of road traffic deaths, such as in El Salvador (62%) and Liberia (66%).",
          "“More than 5000 pedestrians are killed on the world’s roads each week. This is because their needs have been neglected for decades, often in favor of motorized transport,” says Dr Etienne Krug, WHO Director of the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability. “We need to rethink the way we organize our transport systems to make walking safe and save pedestrian lives.”",
          "About 1.24 million road traffic deaths occur annually on the world’s roads, making road traffic injuries the eighth leading cause of death globally, and the leading cause of death for young people aged 15–29 years. The Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, declared by the United Nations General Assembly, offers a broad framework for drawing attention to the need for greater safety on the roads. Launched in May 2011 by governments across the world, the Decade of Action seeks to build road safety management capacity in countries; improve the safety of roads and vehicles; enhance the behaviour of all road users; and strengthen post-crash care.",
          "WHO supports road safety efforts generally by providing guidance to countries on five key risk factors: speeding, drinking and driving, and failing to use motorcycle helmets, seat-belts and child restraints; assisting efforts to improve data collection and trauma care; monitoring progress through global status reports; and serving as the secretariat for the Decade of Action."

Global leaders and individual philanthropists signaled their confidence in the plan by pledging close to three-quarters of the plan’s projected US$5.5 billion cost over six years. They also called upon additional donors to commit up front the additional US$1.5 billion needed to ensure eradication. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The new plan capitalizes on the best opportunity to eradicate polio, with the number of children paralyzed by this disease at the lowest level ever: just 223 cases in 2012 and only 19 so far this year. The urgency is linked to the tremendous advances made in 2012 and the narrow window of opportunity to seize on that progress and stop all poliovirus transmission before polio-free countries become re-infected. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“After millennia battling polio, this plan puts us within sight of the endgame. We have new knowledge about the polioviruses, new technologies and new tactics to reach the most vulnerable communities. The extensive experience, infrastructure and knowledge gained from ending polio can help us reach all children and all communities with essential health services,” said World Health Organization Director-General Margaret Chan.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">A new plan to end polio, strengthen immunization systems and plan for transition</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The Polio Eradication &amp; Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018 was developed by the GPEI in extensive consultation with a broad range of stakeholders. The plan incorporates the lessons learned from India’s success becoming polio-free in early 2012 and cutting-edge knowledge about the risk of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses. It also complements the tailored Emergency Action Plans being implemented since last year in the remaining polio-endemic countries – Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria – including approaches in place to vaccinate children in insecure areas. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>At the Summit, held today in Abu Dhabi, global leaders announced their confidence in the plan’s ability to achieve a lasting polio-free world by 2018 and pledged their financial and political support for its implementation. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Ending polio will not only be an historic feat for humanity, but also a huge part of our efforts to reach every hard-to-reach child with a range of life-saving vaccines,” said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The plan addresses the operational challenges of vaccinating children, including in densely populated urban areas, hard-to-reach areas and areas of insecurity. The plan includes the use of polio eradication experience and resources to strengthen immunization systems in high-priority countries. It also lays out a process for planning how to transition the GPEI’s resources and lessons, particularly in reaching the most marginalized and vulnerable children and communities, so that they continue to be of service to other public health efforts. It is estimated that the GPEI’s efforts to eradicate polio could deliver total net benefits of US$40-50 billion by 2035 from reduced treatment costs and gains in productivity. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Earlier this month, in a Scientific Declaration on Polio Eradication, more than 400 scientists and global health experts from around the world endorsed the GPEI plan, and reaffirmed the conviction that a polio-free world can be secured by 2018.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Philanthropists endorse value of investing in the end of polio</h4>\n<p>\n<span>In remarks made at the Summit, Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, underscored the numerous benefits of ending polio and the need to provide health and development interventions to the hardest-to-reach children. He also called on additional donors to come forward with long-term commitments to fully fund the GPEI plan. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“This plan isn’t just a polio eradication plan, it’s a global immunization plan with the goal of ending polio while improving efforts to protect all children, including the most vulnerable, with life-saving vaccines,” said Gates. “Successful implementation of the plan requires a significant but time-limited investment that will deliver a polio-free world and pay dividends for future generations.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Gates announced that his foundation would commit one-third of the total cost of the GPEI’s budget over the plan’s six-year implementation, for a total of $1.8 billion. The funds will be allocated with the goal of enabling the GPEI to operate effectively against all of the plan's objectives. To encourage other donors to commit the remaining funding up front, the Gates funding for 2016-2018 will be released when the GPEI secures funding that ensures the foundation’s contribution does not exceed one-third of the total budget for those years.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Joining Gates was a new group of individual philanthropists that announced its support for full implementation of the new plan. The total new pledges from philanthropists to the polio initiative amounted to an additional US$335 million toward the plan’s six-year budget. The donors commended the tremendous progress toward eradication made in the last year and expressed their desire to help change history and end polio while the opportunity still exists. Philanthropies making commitments include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Albert L. Ueltschi Foundation</li>\n<li>Alwaleed Bin Talal Foundation-Global</li>\n<li>Bloomberg Philanthropies</li>\n<li>Carlos Slim Foundation</li>\n<li>Dalio Foundation</li>\n<li>The Foundation for a Greater Opportunity established by Carl C. Icahn</li>\n<li>The Tahir Foundation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">A fully funded plan and sustained political commitment will protect gains made to date and enable the GPEI to execute against short- and long-term objectives</h4>\n<p>\n<span>At the Summit, leaders from polio-endemic countries reaffirmed their continued focus on polio eradication and welcomed the plan’s broadened scope to improve immunization systems. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Praising the plan’s expanded focus to ensure that polio eradication efforts – which reach the world’s most vulnerable children – support broader health interventions, long-time donors Canada, Germany, Norway and the UK, as well as Nigeria, announced new commitments to support the plan’s long-term objectives. His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, announced a second pledge to polio eradication of US$120 million, adding to his first contribution made in 2011. A range of other donors, including the Islamic Development Bank, Ireland and Japan, helped round out the additional pledges. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Rotary International, the flagship donor to the GPEI, pledged its commitment through 2018 to raise funds and mobilize support of the endgame strategy. “To stop polio once and for all, we need to act quickly so that children are fully protected and countries are not re-infected,” said Rotary International President Sakuji Tanaka. “This takes the commitment of national and local leaders where polio still exists, the continued support of donor countries, and the steadfast commitment of heroic vaccinators.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The GPEI will work with donors on the timely conversion of these pledges into commitments and the disbursement of funds so that the program can fully deliver on the plan.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The plan’s US$5.5 billion budget over six years requires sustaining current yearly spending to eradicate polio. The new plan’s budget includes the costs of reaching and vaccinating more than 250 million children multiple times every year, monitoring and surveillance in more than 70 countries, and securing the infrastructure that can benefit other health and development programs. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Today we have the fewest cases in the fewest places ever, making it critical to use the best opportunity the world has ever had to put an end to this terrible, preventable disease,” said Anne Schuchat, M.D., head of the Center for Global Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Notes for editors</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The plan was created by the GPEI in extensive consultation with national health authorities, global health initiatives, scientific experts, donors and other stakeholders. There are four main objectives of the plan: 1) Poliovirus Detection and Interruption; 2) Immunization Systems Strengthening and Oral Polio Vaccine Withdrawal; 3) Containment and Certification; and 4) Legacy Planning.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus: On very rare occasions, the live, weakened poliovirus contained in the oral polio vaccine may genetically alter in the immunized person’s gut. If a population is seriously under-immunized, the virus may begin circulating in the community, and is referred to as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). Between 2000 and 2011 – a period in which more than 10 billion doses of oral polio vaccine were given worldwide – cVDPV outbreaks resulted in 580 polio cases. In the same period, wild poliovirus paralyzed more than 15,500 children. As wild poliovirus declines, however, the proportion of cVDPV in low-immunity communities rises. The new plan uses cutting-edge knowledge about these viruses and new tactics to raise immunity, including introduction of inactivated polio vaccine and phasing out use of the component of the oral polio vaccine which gives rise to the majority of cVDPV. If a population is fully immunized against polio, it will be protected against the spread of both wild and vaccine strains of poliovirus.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">About GPEI</h4>\n<p>\n<span>The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), launched in 1988, is spearheaded by national governments, the World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF, and supported by key partners including the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Since its launch, the incidence of polio has been reduced by more than 99 percent. In 1988, more than 350,000 children were paralyzed each year in more than 125 endemic countries. Today, only three countries remain endemic: Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Last year, cases of wild poliovirus plunged from 650 in 2011 to 223, the largest drop in a decade. As of 17 April, 19 cases have been reported, a 60% reduction compared to this time last year. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information please contact:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation<br/> Telephone: +1 206 709 3400 <br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:media@gatesfoundation.org\">media@gatesfoundation.org</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Rotary International<br/> Petina Dixon-Jenkins<br/> Telephone: +1 847 866 3054 <br/> E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:petina.dixon@rotary.org\">petina.dixon@rotary.org</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>UNICEF<br/> Sarah Crowe<br/>\nTelephone: +1 646 209 1590<br/> E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:scrowe@unicef.org\">scrowe@unicef.org</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>US CDC<br/> Alan Janssen<br/> Telephone: +1 404 639 8517 <br/> E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:axj3@cdc.gov\">axj3@cdc.gov</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO<br/> Sona Bari<br/> Telephone: +41 22 791 1476<br/> Mobile: +41 79 475 5511<br/> E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:baris@who.int\">baris@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

There are four main objectives of the plan: 1) Poliovirus Detection and Interruption; 2) Immunization Systems Strengthening and Oral Polio Vaccine Withdrawal; 3) Containment and Certification; and 4) Legacy Planning.",
          "Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus: On very rare occasions, the live, weakened poliovirus contained in the oral polio vaccine may genetically alter in the immunized person’s gut. If a population is seriously under-immunized, the virus may begin circulating in the community, and is referred to as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). Between 2000 and 2011 – a period in which more than 10 billion doses of oral polio vaccine were given worldwide – cVDPV outbreaks resulted in 580 polio cases. In the same period, wild poliovirus paralyzed more than 15,500 children. As wild poliovirus declines, however, the proportion of cVDPV in low-immunity communities rises. The new plan uses cutting-edge knowledge about these viruses and new tactics to raise immunity, including introduction of inactivated polio vaccine and phasing out use of the component of the oral polio vaccine which gives rise to the majority of cVDPV. If a population is fully immunized against polio, it will be protected against the spread of both wild and vaccine strains of poliovirus."

We are increasingly concerned by signs in the south-east Asia region that the malaria parasite is becoming resistant to some of the drugs that have helped make so much progress.” </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Antimalarial drug resistance </h3>\n<p>\n<span>Antimalarial drug resistance – the ability of the malaria parasite to survive drugs – first became a global problem in the 1960s when the parasite developed resistance to chloroquine, the then widely-used antimalarial. Resistance first emerged in the Greater Mekong subregion and later spread to Africa, triggering a dramatic increase in malaria-related illness and death – particularly among children.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Today the treatment of choice is artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).Resistance to artemisinins – the core component of the combination – has now been identified in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. National efforts to contain resistance have had some impact, but urgent action is needed to fully eliminate resistant strains of the parasite and to ensure that ACTs remain effective. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“The consequences of widespread resistance to artemisinins would be catastrophic,” says Dr Robert Newman, Director of WHO’s Global Malaria Programme. “We must act now to protect south-east Asia today and sub-Saharan Africa tomorrow.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Although major efforts are under way to develop new classes of antimalarials, there are no replacement products on the immediate horizon.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Scaled-up response in the Greater Mekong subregion </h3>\n<p>\n<span>“We need to invest more in order to tackle drug resistance,” said Dr Mark Dybul, Executive Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO is launching a new Emergency Response to Artemisinin Resistance in Phnom Penh at an event hosted by the Cambodian Ministry of Health. Building on WHO’s 2011 Global plan for artemisinin resistance containment, as well as a multi-partner evaluation of containment efforts to date, the emergency response framework will guide a major scale-up of WHO-recommended strategies to combat this public health threat. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The framework urges affected countries to remove poor-quality antimalarial drugs and oral artemisinin-based monotherapies from circulation, as their use is compromising both the efficacy of artemisinin and the drugs combined with them as part of ACTs. According to WHO’s latest assessment this month, at least 31 companies around the world are still marketing such monotherapies. Globally, 44 countries have withdrawn marketing authorization for these pills, but 14 countries continue to allow their marketing.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“We are at a tipping point. What seems to be a localised threat could easily get out of control and have serious implications for global health,” said Dr Newman. “This response will require substantial funding, a high level of political commitment, and strengthened regional and cross-border collaboration.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The emergency response, which also includes the establishment of a WHO regional hub in Phnom Penh to support containment efforts, has received financial support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and AusAID. In addition, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has recently announced the allocation of US$ 100 million to tackle this threat over the next three years. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>While these are significant steps forward, WHO currently estimates that about US$ 300-350 million of additional funding would be required from 2013-2015 to fully scale up malaria control and containment activities across affected countries in the Greater Mekong subregion. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Global funding needs for malaria control</h3>\n<p>\n<span>In total, an estimated US$ 5.1 billion is needed every year between 2011 and 2020 to achieve universal access to malaria prevention, diagnostic testing, and treatment around the world. Although many countries have increased domestic financing for malaria control, the total available global funding remained at US$ 2.3 billion in 2011 – less than half what is required. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Many people still lack access to prevention measures – such as mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying – and are unable to obtain diagnostic testing and effective medicines to treat malaria infection.

However, as richer countries have demonstrated, a number of elements are key to reducing infections and deaths from both diseases. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>For example, good nutrition and a clean environment help protect children from both pneumonia and diarrhoea. New vaccines are being introduced to protect children from these diseases. Good access to health services and the right medicines can ensure they get the treatment they need. But many existing efforts to address pneumonia and diarrhoea in low- and middle-income countries have yet to capitalize on these common elements.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“This is a question of equity. Poor children in low-income countries are most at risk of death from pneumonia or diarrhoea but much less likely to get the interventions they need,” said Dr Mickey Chopra, global head of UNICEF’s health programmes. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“We know what to do. If, in the 75 countries with the highest death rates, we apply to the entire population the same coverage of essential interventions enjoyed by the richest 20% of households, we can prevent the deaths of 2 million children even as soon as 2015, the deadline for the Millennium Development Goals.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The new WHO/UNICEF Action Plan sets clear goals for the world to achieve by 2025: a 75% reduction in incidence of severe pneumonia and diarrhoea from 2010 levels among children under five, and the virtual elimination of deaths from both diseases in the same age-group. It also aims for a 40% reduction in the global number of children under five who are stunted.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Action Plan’s targets are significantly higher than current levels. For example, it calls for 90% of all children to have access to antibiotics for pneumonia and oral rehydration salts for diarrhoea, up from current levels of 31 and 35% respectively. As an interim target, at least half of all children under six months should be exclusively breastfed, against 2012 levels of 39%. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>All children should have access to improved sanitation and safe drinking water, from 63 and 89% respectively; and building on the good progress already made in some countries in introducing new vaccines against pneumococcal bacteria and rotavirus, it aims for 90% coverage by the target date.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Action Plan calls on governments and other stakeholders to prioritize investment in the population groups with the poorest access to services to prevent and treat pneumonia and diarrhoea.

Growing alarm about the threat of multi-drug resistant TB, also known as MDR-TB, is making that even more pressing. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“We are treading water at a time when we desperately need to scale up our response to MDR-TB,” said Dr Chan. “We have gained a lot of ground in TB control through international collaboration, but it can easily be lost if we do not act now.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO and the Global Fund have identified an anticipated gap of US$ 1.6 billion in annual international support for the fight against tuberculosis in 118 low- and middle-income countries on top of an estimated US$ 3.2 billion that could be provided by the countries themselves. Filling this gap could enable full treatment for 17 million TB and multidrug-resistant TB patients and save 6 million lives between 2014-2016.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“It is critical that we raise the funding that is urgently needed to control this disease,” said Dr Dybul. “If we don’t act now, our costs could skyrocket. It is invest now or pay forever.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Dr Chan and Dr Dybul spoke to the media in Geneva in advance of World TB Day on 24 March, which commemorates the day in 1882 when Dr Robert Koch discovered the mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>While the Millennium Development Goal of turning around the TB epidemic has already been met, the 2% decline in the number of people falling ill with TB each year remains too slow. Two regions – Africa and Europe – are not on track to achieve the global target of halving the TB death rate between 1990 and 2015. In 2011, 1.4 million people died due to TB, with the greatest per capita death rate in Africa. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) presents a major threat, with an estimated 630 000 people ill worldwide with this form of TB today. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO worked with the Global Fund and the Stop TB Partnership to support selected high TB burden countries in reviewing their priorities for the next three years and estimating available funding and gaps. Estimates have been made for 118 countries eligible for Global Fund support. Of the US$ 1.6 billion gap in donor financing, almost 60% is for WHO’s Africa region. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In the 118 countries, there are four priority areas for domestic and international investment to drive down deaths, alleviate suffering, cut transmission and contain spread of drug resistance.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the core areas of expanded diagnosis and effective treatment for drug-susceptible TB (which will prevent MDR-TB), a total of US$ 2.6 billion is needed each year for the 2014-2016 period. For 2011, funding of about US$ 2 billion was available. In low-income countries, especially in Africa, this is the largest area for increased financing. </li>\n<li>Prompt and effective treatment for multidrug-resistant TB requires an estimated total of US$ 1.3 billion per year. This is where the greatest increase in funding is needed in the coming years. For 2011, funding of US$ 0.5 billion was available.</li>\n<li>Uptake of new rapid diagnostics and associated laboratory strengthening, especially for the diagnosis of MDR-TB and for TB diagnosis among people living with HIV, requires US$ 600 million per year. </li>\n<li>Excluding antiretroviral treatment for TB patients living with HIV, which is financed by HIV programmes and their donors, about US$ 330 million is required for HIV-associated TB interventions, such as testing TB patients for HIV, ensuring regular screening for active TB disease among people living with HIV, and providing TB preventive treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>In addition to the US$ 1.6 billion annual gap in international financing for the critical implementation interventions above, WHO and partners estimate that there is a US$ 1.3 billion annual gap for TB research and development during the period 2014-2016, including clinical trials for new TB drugs, diagnostics and vaccines. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">For more information please contact:</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib<br/> Communications Officer/Spokesperson<br/>\nWHO<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 32 28<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 475 55 56<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:chaibf@who.int\">chaibf@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Andrew Hurst<br/> Head of Media and Translations<br/>\nGlobal Fund<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 561 68 07<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:Andrew.hurst@theglobalfund.org\">Andrew.hurst@theglobalfund.org</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

          "WHO/Global Fund joint news release",
          "18 March 2013 | Geneva - WHO and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria said today that strains of tuberculosis with resistance to multiple drugs could spread widely and highlight an annual need of at least US$ 1.6 billion in international funding for treatment and prevention of the disease.",
          "Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO, and Dr Mark Dybul, Executive Director of the Global Fund, said that the only way to carry out the urgent work of identifying all new cases of tuberculosis, while simultaneously making progress against the most serious existing cases, will be to mobilize significant funding from domestic sources and international donors.",
          "“We are treading water at a time when we desperately need to scale up our response to MDR-TB” WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan",
          "With the overwhelming majority of international funding for tuberculosis coming through the Global Fund, they said, it is imperative that efforts to raise money be effective this year. Growing alarm about the threat of multi-drug resistant TB, also known as MDR-TB, is making that even more pressing.",
          "“We are treading water at a time when we desperately need to scale up our response to MDR-TB,” said Dr Chan. “We have gained a lot of ground in TB control through international collaboration, but it can easily be lost if we do not act now.”",
          "WHO and the Global Fund have identified an anticipated gap of US$ 1.6 billion in annual international support for the fight against tuberculosis in 118 low- and middle-income countries on top of an estimated US$ 3.2 billion that could be provided by the countries themselves. Filling this gap could enable full treatment for 17 million TB and multidrug-resistant TB patients and save 6 million lives between 2014-2016.",
          "“It is critical that we raise the funding that is urgently needed to control this disease,” said Dr Dybul. “If we don’t act now, our costs could skyrocket. It is invest now or pay forever.”",
          "Dr Chan and Dr Dybul spoke to the media in Geneva in advance of World TB Day on 24 March, which commemorates the day in 1882 when Dr Robert Koch discovered the mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis.",
          "While the Millennium Development Goal of turning around the TB epidemic has already been met, the 2% decline in the number of people falling ill with TB each year remains too slow. Two regions – Africa and Europe – are not on track to achieve the global target of halving the TB death rate between 1990 and 2015. In 2011, 1.4 million people died due to TB, with the greatest per capita death rate in Africa. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) presents a major threat, with an estimated 630 000 people ill worldwide with this form of TB today.",
          "WHO worked with the Global Fund and the Stop TB Partnership to support selected high TB burden countries in reviewing their priorities for the next three years and estimating available funding and gaps. Estimates have been made for 118 countries eligible for Global Fund support. Of the US$ 1.6 billion gap in donor financing, almost 60% is for WHO’s Africa region.",
          "In the 118 countries, there are four priority areas for domestic and international investment to drive down deaths, alleviate suffering, cut transmission and contain spread of drug resistance.",
          "In addition to the US$ 1.6 billion annual gap in international financing for the critical implementation interventions above, WHO and partners estimate that there is a US$ 1.3 billion annual gap for TB research and development during the period 2014-2016, including clinical trials for new TB drugs, diagnostics and vaccines."
        ],
        "bullets": [
          "For the core areas of expanded diagnosis and effective treatment for drug-susceptible TB (which will prevent MDR-TB), a total of US$ 2.6 billion is needed each year for the 2014-2016 period. For 2011, funding of about US$ 2 billion was available. In low-income countries, especially in Africa, this is the largest area for increased financing.",
          "Prompt and effective treatment for multidrug-resistant TB requires an estimated total of US$ 1.3 billion per year. This is where the greatest increase in funding is needed in the coming years. For 2011, funding of US$ 0.5 billion was available.",
          "Uptake of new rapid diagnostics and associated laboratory strengthening, especially for the diagnosis of MDR-TB and for TB diagnosis among people living with HIV, requires US$ 600 million per year.",
          "Excluding antiretroviral treatment for TB patients living with HIV, which is financed by HIV programmes and their donors, about US$ 330 million is required for HIV-associated TB interventions, such as testing TB patients for HIV, ensuring regular screening for active TB disease among people living with HIV, and providing TB preventive treatment."

Outside these parts - even in locations inside Fukushima Prefecture - no observable increases in cancer incidence are expected.” </span></p><p><span>In terms of specific cancers, for people in the most contaminated location, the estimated increased risks over what would normally be expected are:\r\n</span></p><ul><li>all solid cancers - around 4% in females exposed as infants;</li><li>breast cancer - around 6% in females exposed as infants; </li><li>leukaemia - around 7% in males exposed as infants; </li><li>thyroid cancer - up to 70% in females exposed as infants (the normally expected risk of thyroid cancer in females over lifetime is 0.75% and the additional lifetime risk assessed for females exposed as infants in the most affected location is 0.50%). </li></ul><p><span>For people in the second most contaminated location of Fukushima Prefecture, the estimated risks are approximately one-half of those in the location with the highest doses. </span></p><p><span>The report also references a section to the special case of the emergency workers inside the Fukushima NPP. Around two-thirds of emergency workers are estimated to have cancer risks in line with the general population, while one-third is estimated to have an increased risk.</span></p><p><span>The almost-200-page document further notes that the radiation doses from the damaged nuclear power plant are not expected to cause an increase in the incidence of miscarriages, stillbirths and other physical and mental conditions that can affect babies born after the accident.</span></p><p><span>“The WHO report underlines the need for long-term health monitoring of those who are at high risk, along with the provision of necessary medical follow-up and support services,” says Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director for Public Health and Environment. “This will remain an important element in the public health response to the disaster for decades.” </span></p><p><span>“In addition to strengthening medical support and services, continued environmental monitoring, in particular of food and water supplies, backed by the enforcement of existing regulations, is required to reduce potential radiation exposure in the future,” says Dr Angelika Tritscher, Acting Director for WHO’s Food Safety and Zoonosis Department. </span></p><p><span>As well as the direct health impact on the population, the report notes that the psychosocial impact may have a consequence on health and well-being. These should not be ignored as part of the overall response, say the experts. </span></p><p><span>This is the first-ever analysis of the global health effects due to radiation exposure after the Fukushima NPP accident and is the result of a two-year WHO-led process of analysis of estimated doses and their potential health implications. The independent scientific experts came from the fields of radiation risk modelling, epidemiology, dosimetry, radiation effects and public health.</span></p><h3>Download</h3><p><a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789241505130\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789241505130\" target=\"_blank\">Health risk assessment from the nuclear accident after the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami, based on a preliminary dose estimation</a></p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">For more information please contact:<span></span></h3><p><span>Nada Osseiran<br/>WHO Communications Officer, Public Health and Environment<br/>Telephone: +41 22 791 4475 <br/>Mobile: +41 79 445 1624 <br/>E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:osseirann@who.int\">osseirann@who.int</a></span></p><div></div>",

    "content_html": "<div> <p><span class=\"\">Joint WHO / World Bank statement</span>\n<br/>19 February 2013\n</p>\n</div> <p>\n<em class=\"dateline\">Geneva -</em>\n<span>Top officials from health and finance ministries from 27 countries joined other high-level health and development stakeholders at a two-day meeting this week in Geneva to discuss ways that countries are progressing towards universal health coverage. The meeting was convened jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank and took place just weeks after the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution supporting universal health coverage. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Delegates at the Geneva meeting expressed strong support for the ideas underlying universal health coverage: that everyone, irrespective of their ability to pay, should have access to the health services they need, without putting their families at financial risk. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Many speakers stressed the importance of getting political commitment to universal health coverage at the highest level. Some countries described how they are focusing their limited resources initially on providing coverage to the poor and vulnerable, while others have taken a more universal approach from the start. The use of general revenues to provide such coverage was a recurrent theme; but there was also some discussion about using earmarked revenues such as \"sin taxes.\"</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Participants agreed that human resource shortages posed a challenge, but also pointed to the need for more focus on the distribution of health workers —between rural and urban areas, and between poor and more affluent areas. Some speakers indicated that more could be achieved using existing resources. The meeting also discussed strategies to ensure an adequate supply of good quality and affordable essential medicines and technologies, noting the value of using financial incentives to promote efficiency and quality of health services.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The participants agreed on the importance of improving information systems and holding governments and health care providers more accountable for delivering results. Several speakers raised the challenge many faced of how to balance ensuring people receive the care they need at a cost the government can afford.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The importance of monitoring progress towards universal health coverage was also a recurrent theme, as was the important role played by of researchers, civil society, and international agencies. Several delegates expressed the hope that universal health coverage would feature in the post-2015 development goals. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO and the World Bank are working together at global, regional and country levels, and stand by ready to help countries confront the numerous challenges that the meeting highlighted in accelerating progress toward universal health coverage. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In response to country demand, WHO and the World Bank are already developing a monitoring framework that will help countries track their countries’ progress toward universal health coverage in a way that explicitly captures the potential importance of universal health coverage in achieving better health and higher living standards for everyone. The framework will be available for consultation with countries and other partners later this year. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The UN General Assembly resolution urges Member States to develop health systems that avoid significant direct payments at the point of care. It further encourages them to establish mechanisms for pooling risks to avoid catastrophic health expenditures that drive households into poverty.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information about WHO and World Bank work on UHC:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Melanie Mayhew<br/>\nCorporate Communications<br/>\nWorld Bank<br/>\nTelephone: +1 2024597115\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Gregory Härtl <br/>\nWHO Media Coordinator<br/> Department of Communications<br/>\nDirector-General's Office<br/>\nWHO, Geneva<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 203 6715<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:hartlg@who.int\">hartlg@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

Former Swiss President Ruth Dreifuss, who is also a former Chairperson of WHO’s Commission on Intellectual Property, Innovation and Public Health (CIPIH), chaired the event.</span>\n</p><p><span>“Public health remains a clear imperative for the international community,” said Madame Dreifuss. “Promoting both medical innovation and access to the fruits of that innovation is indispensable for progress towards improved and more equitable health outcomes.</span>\n</p><p><span>“But to achieve this result demands greater practical cooperation and dialogue within the international system — the launch of this study represents an important step forward in that direction.”</span>\n</p><p><span>This report “demystifies an intricate and extremely complex landscape of laws and policies and makes them accessible to the non-specialist,” said WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan.</span>\n</p><p><span>“In so doing, it sets out a comprehensive and coherent inventory of legal instruments and policy options that can be drawn on to craft measures that meet national public health objectives.”</span>\n</p><p><span>WIPO Director General Francis Gurry said: “This joint WHO-WIPO-WTO publication will enhance our shared understanding of health, trade and intellectual property and provide policy makers with a comprehensive compendium of the issues at stake.</span>\n</p><p><span>“We look forward to our continued collaboration, in particular to show that innovation and IP are essential components of an effective health policy.”</span>\n</p><p><span>“Access to medicines requires the right mix of health policies, intellectual property rules and trade policy settings,” said WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy. “And coherence is key to finding sustainable solutions. This is the spirit behind the joint study: to provide well informed, comprehensive policy choices.”</span>\n</p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Complex, linked issues</h3><p><span>The book covers a broad range of complex, yet linked issues relating to public health and innovation in medical technologies, with the ultimate goal of accessibility — making medical advances available globally to all who are sick.

Public health and innovation policies, and the rules of trade, competition and procurement, all play a part.</span>\n</p><p><span>The policy-making focus has broadened from the basic questions of ensuring access to essential medicines, and developing treatments for neglected diseases that are available and affordable for those who are primarily affected — the poor. This is part of the right to health.</span>\n</p><p><span>More recently, attention has turned to other aspects of how to meet this right: including the measures that are needed in order to provide incentives for medical innovations — such as medicines, vaccines and medical devices — and how to ensure equitable access to all of these vital medical technologies.</span>\n</p><p><span>Part of the picture is the international patent system and how governments implement it domestically according to the needs of their countries. The patent system is designed to support innovation, and it offers a mechanism to ensure that these innovations are accessible to society.</span>\n</p><p><span>The research-and-development pharmaceutical industry therefore relies heavily on exclusive patent rights in order to recoup the investment made in research and development, as shown by the high number of applications for patents on medical technologies under WIPO’s Patent Cooperation Treaty.</span>\n</p><p><span>The secretariats of the three organizations have drawn on their experience and the data available to them to produce this study, and to support discussions on policy options and legal issues.</span>\n</p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">What the book covers</h3><p><span>The book looks at the need for international cooperation, who is involved, and how to address the challenges that the sector is facing.

      "description": "Adults should consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, or 5 grams of salt, and at least 3,510 mg of potassium per day, according to new guidelines issued by the WHO. A person with either elevated sodium levels and low potassium levels could be at risk of raised blood pressure which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.Sodium is found naturally in a variety of foods, including milk and cream (approximately 50 mg of sodium per 100 g) and eggs (approximately 80 mg/100 g). It is also found, in much higher amounts, in processed foods, such as bread (approximately 250 mg/100 g), processed meats like bacon (approximately 1,500 mg/100 g), snack foods such as pretzels, cheese puffs and popcorn (approximately 1,500 mg/100 g), as well as in condiments such as soy sauce (approximately 7,000 mg/100 g), and bouillon or stock cubes (approximately 20,000 mg/100 g).Potassium-rich foods include: beans and peas (approximately 1,300 mg of potassium per 100 g), nuts (approximately 600 mg/100 g), vegetables such as spinach, cabbage and parsley (approximately 550 mg/100 g) and fruits such as bananas, papayas and dates (approximately 300 mg/100 g). Processing reduces the amount of potassium in many food products.Currently, most people consume too much sodium and not enough potassium.“Elevated blood pressure is a major risk for heart disease and stroke – the number one cause of death and disability globally,” says Dr Francesco Branca, Director of WHO’s Department of Nutrition for Health and Development. “These guidelines also make recommendations for children over the age of 2. This is critical because children with elevated blood pressure often become adults with elevated blood pressure.”The guidelines are an important tool for public health experts and policymakers as they work in their specific country situations to address noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. Public health measures to reduce sodium and increase potassium consumption and thereby decrease the population’s risk of high blood pressure and heart disease can include food and product labelling, consumer education, updating national dietary guidelines, and negotiating with food manufacturers to reduce the amount of salt in processed foods.WHO is also updating guidelines on the intake of fats and sugars associated to reduced risk of obesity and noncommunicable diseases.",

Due to these effects - and also because mercury can be passed from a mother to her unborn child, infants - children and women of child-bearing age are considered vulnerable populations.</span></p><p><span>Agreement on the treaty followed extensive analysis of evidence and a series of high level intergovernmental negotiations involving more than 140 countries. The final treaty negotiations occurred this week in Geneva and concluded today. </span></p><p><span>The treaty establishes a number of protective measures, including controls on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants and industry, as well as the use of mercury in artisanal and small scale gold mining, which are the major sources of mercury in the environment. The treaty also includes an article dedicated to health. In particular, the treaty sets a phase out date of 2020 for mercury thermometers and blood pressure measuring devices used in health care. This adds support to WHO’s programme assisting countries to replace these mercury devices with non-mercury alternatives.</span></p><p><span>WHO also supports the treaty’s “phasing-down“ of the use of dental amalgam (a compound of mercury and silver-based alloys). This action will contribute to a reduction of mercury use and the risk of release to the environment. </span></p><p><span>An important exception that was strongly supported in the negotiations was the use of thiomersal (ethyl-mercury) as a preservative in human and animal vaccines. WHO has closely monitored scientific evidence relating to the use of thiomersal as a vaccine preservative for more than 10 years, through its Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, and the Committee has consistently concluded that there is no evidence to suggest that the amount of thiomersal used in vaccines poses a health risk. </span></p><h4 class=\"section_head2\">For further information, please contact:</h4><p><span>Gregory Härtl <br/>WHO Media Coordinator<br/>Department of Communications<br/>Director-General's Office<br/>WHO, Geneva<br/>Mobile: +41 79 203 6715<br/>E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:hartlg@who.int\">hartlg@who.int</a></span></p><hr/><p><span><sup>1</sup> The “Minimata Convention”.\r\n</span></p><div></div>",
