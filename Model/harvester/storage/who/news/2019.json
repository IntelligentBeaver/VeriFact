While outbreaks are still ongoing in various countries, the case load represents a significant downward trend in cholera transmission that has continued\r\n    into 2019, according to data collected by WHO. <br/></p><p>“The global decrease in case numbers we are observing appears to be linked to large-scale vaccination campaigns and countries beginning to adopt the <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.gtfcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gtfcc-ending-cholera-a-global-roadmap-to-2030.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Global Roadmap to 2030 strategy</em></a><em> </em>in\r\n their national cholera action plans,” said Dr Dominique Legros, who heads WHO’s cholera programme in Geneva. “We must continue to strengthen our efforts to engage all cholera-endemic countries in this global strategy to eliminate\r\n    cholera.\"\r\n    <br/></p><p>Nearly 18 million doses of Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) were shipped to 11 countries in 2018. Since the OCV stockpile was created in 2013, almost 60 million doses have been shipped worldwide. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has provided funding for purchase\r\n    of the vaccine and financial support for the global vaccination drives. <br/></p><p>The Global Task Force on Cholera Control launched the Global Roadmap strategy for effective long-term cholera control and elimination in October 2017. The Global Roadmap aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90% and to eliminate transmission in up to 20 countries\r\n    by 2030. The strategy provides a framework for national action plans that emphasize three main axes of cholera control:</p><ul><li>early detection and rapid response to contain outbreaks </li><li>a multisectoral approach integrating strengthened surveillance, vaccination, community mobilization and water, sanitation and hygiene to prevent cholera in hotspots in endemic countries</li><li>An effective mechanism of coordination for technical support, resource mobilization and partnership at the local and global levels</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>“The Global Roadmap provides clear guidance for how to prevent and, ultimately, to eliminate cholera. Every death from cholera is preventable with the tools we have today,” said Dr Tedros.<br/></p><p>The new report shows several countries, including Zambia, South Sudan,United Republic of Tanzania, Somalia, Bangladesh, and Nigeria have made significant progress in developing national action plans within the framework of the Global Roadmap strategy.\r\n    <br/></p><p>“We are seeing the results of countries reporting – and acting – on cholera. And these countries are making remarkable gains in cholera control and prevention,” said Dr Legros. <br/></p><p>WHO, in collaboration with partners, provides support to ministries of health in countries affected by cholera to implement immediate, long-term cholera control, including surveillance, outbreak response and preventive measures such as OCV and risk communication.<br/></p><p>In 2018, WHO country offices worked with governments to respond urgently to major outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Uganda, Yemen, Zambia and Zimbabwe. WHO also worked with countries to transition from outbreak response to longer-term\r\n    cholera control and elimination, in Haiti, United Republic of Tanzania (Zanzibar) and Zambia.<br/></p><p>Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Cholera affects both children and adults and can kill within hours if left untreated. WHO estimates that each year cholera infects\r\n    1 million to 4 million people and claims up to 143 000 lives.   </p><p><br/></p><h4>Note to Editors: </h4><h4>About the estimates</h4><p>The total number of cholera cases in 2018 includes 371 326 cases reported from Yemen, where reporting has been imprecise, according to the report.</p><p>The <a href=\"/publications/journals/weekly-epidemiological-record\">Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER)</a> serves as an essential instrument for the rapid and accurate dissemination of epidemiological information on cases and outbreaks of diseases under the International Health\r\n    Regulations and on other communicable diseases of public health importance, including emerging or re-emerging infections.</p><p> </p>",

The findings, published today in a new WHO report, demonstrate how government-led action can protect communities from tobacco, save lives and prevent people suffering tobacco-related harm. </p><p>“Declines in tobacco use amongst males mark a turning point in the fight against tobacco,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “For many years now we had witnessed a steady rise in the number of males using deadly tobacco products. But now, for the first time, we are seeing a decline in male use, driven by governments being tougher on the tobacco industry. WHO will continue working closely with countries to maintain this downward trend.”</p><p>During nearly the past two decades, overall global tobacco use has fallen, from 1.397 billion in 2000 to 1.337 billion in 2018, or by approximately 60 million people, according to the WHO global report on trends in prevalence of tobacco use 2000-2025 third edition.</p><p>This has been largely driven by reductions in the number of females using these products (346 million in 2000 down to 244 million in 2018, or a fall over around 100 million). </p><p>Over the same period, male tobacco use had risen by around 40 million, from 1.050 billion in 2000 to 1.093 billion in 2018 (or 82% of the world’s current 1.337 billion tobacco users).</p><p>But positively, the new report shows that the number of male tobacco users has stopped growing and is projected to decline by more than 1 million fewer male users come  2020 (or 1.091 billion) compared to 2018 levels, and 5 million less by 2025 (1.087 billion). </p><p>By 2020, WHO projects there will be 10 million fewer tobacco users, male and female, compared to 2018, and another 27 million less by 2025, amounting to 1.299 billion. Some 60% of countries have been experiencing a decline in tobacco use since 2010.</p><p> “Reductions in global tobacco use demonstrate that when governments introduce and strengthen their comprehensive evidence-based actions, they can protect the well-being of their citizens and communities,” said Dr Ruediger Krech, Director of Health Promotion at WHO.</p><p>Despite such gains, progress in meeting the global target set by governments to cut tobacco use by 30% by 2025 remains off track. Based on current progress, a 23% reduction will be achieved by 2025. Only 32 countries are currently on track to reach the 30% reduction target.</p></div><br clear=\"all\"/><p>However, the projected decline in tobacco use among males, who represent the overwhelming majority of tobacco users, can be built on and used to accelerate efforts to reach to the global target, said Dr Vinayak Prasad, head of WHO’s tobacco control unit.</p><p>“Fewer people are using tobacco, which is a major step for global public health,” said Dr Prasad. “But the work is not yet done. Without stepped up national action, the projected fall in tobacco use still won’t meet global reduction targets. We must never let up in the fight against Big Tobacco.”</p><p>Other key findings of the report included:</p><ul><li>Children: Approximately 43 million children (aged 13-15) used tobacco in 2018 (14 million girls and 29 million boys).</li><li>Women: The number of women using tobacco in 2018 was 244 million. By 2025, there should be 32 million fewer women tobacco users. Most gains are being made in low- and middle-income countries. Europe is the region making the slowest progress in reducing tobacco use among females.</li><li>Asian trends: WHO’s South East Asian Region has the highest rates of tobacco use, of more than 45% of males and females aged 15 years and over, but the trend is projected to decline rapidly to similar levels seen in the European and Western Pacific regions of around 25% by 2025. The Western Pacific Region, including China, is projected to overtake South East Asia as the region with the highest average rate among men. </li><li>Trends in the Americas: Fifteen countries in the Americas are on track to reach the 30% tobacco use reduction target by 2030, making it the best performing of WHO’s six regions.</li><li>Policy action: more and more countries are implementing effective tobacco control measures, which are having the desired effect of reducing tobacco use. Tobacco taxes not only help reduce tobacco consumption and health-care costs, but also represent a rev­enue stream for financing for development in many countries.</li></ul><p>Every year, more than 8 million people die from tobacco use, approximately half of its users. More than 7 million of those deaths are from direct tobacco use while around 1.2 million are due to non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke. Most tobacco-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, areas that are targets of intensive tobacco industry interference and marketing. </p><h3><strong>Editors notes</strong></h3><p>The WHO report covers use of cigarettes, pipes, cigars, waterpipes, smokeless tobacco products (like cheroots and kretek) and heated tobacco products.

This is especially important in low- and middle-income countries, according to a new four-paper report published in <strong><em>The Lancet</em></strong><em>. </em>More than a third of such countries had overlapping forms of malnutrition (45 of 123 countries in the 1990s, and 48 of 126 countries in the 2010s), particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and east Asia and the Pacific. </p><p>Undernutrition and obesity can lead to effects across generations as both maternal undernutrition and obesity are associated with poor health in offspring. However, because of the speed of change in food systems, more people are being exposed to both forms of malnutrition at different points in their lifetimes, which further increases harmful health effects. </p><p>“We are facing a new nutrition reality,” said lead author of the report Dr Francesco Branca, Director of the Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, World Health Organization. “We can no longer characterize countries as low-income and undernourished, or high-income and only concerned with obesity. All forms of malnutrition have a common denominator – food systems that fail to provide all people with healthy, safe, affordable, and sustainable diets. Changing this will require action across food systems – from production and processing, through trade and distribution, pricing, marketing, and labelling, to consumption and waste. All relevant policies and investments must be radically re-examined.”</p><p>In a Lancet editorial accompanying the report, Dr Richard Horton, Editor-in-Chief of <strong><em>The Lancet</em></strong>, says: “Today’s publication of the WHO Series on the Double Burden of Malnutrition comes after 12 months of Lancet articles exploring nutrition in all its forms… With these and other articles across Lancet journals throughout 2019, it has become clear that nutrition and malnutrition need to be approached from multiple perspectives, and although findings have sometimes converged, there is still work to be done to understand malnutrition’s multiple manifestations… With 6 years remaining in the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016-2025), this Series and Comment define the future direction required to achieve the global goal of eradicating hunger and preventing malnutrition in all its forms.”</p><p>Globally, estimates suggest that almost 2.3 billion children and adults are overweight, and more than 150 million children are stunted. However, in low- and middle-income countries these emerging issues overlap in individuals, families, communities and countries. The new report explores the trends behind this intersection – known as the double burden of malnutrition – as well as the societal and food system changes that may be causing it, its biological explanation and effects, and policy measures that may help address malnutrition in all its forms. </p><p>The authors used survey data from low- and middle-income countries in the 1990s and 2010s to estimate which countries faced a double burden of malnutrition (ie, in the population, more than 15% of people had wasting, more than 30% were stunted, more than 20% of women had thinness, and more than 20% of people were overweight).</p><p>In the 2010s, 14 countries with some of the lowest incomes in the world had newly developed a double burden of malnutrition, compared with the 1990s. However, fewer low- and middle-income countries with the highest incomes were affected than in the 1990s. The authors say that this reflects the increasing prevalence of being overweight in the poorest countries, where populations still face stunting, wasting and thinness. </p><p>High-quality diets reduce the risk of malnutrition in all its forms by promoting healthy growth, development, and immunity, and preventing obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) throughout life. The components of healthy diets are: optimal breastfeeding practices in the first two years; a diversity and abundance of fruits and vegetables, wholegrains, fibre, nuts, and seeds; modest amounts of animal source foods; minimal amounts of processed meats, and minimal amounts of foods and beverages high in energy and added amounts of sugar, saturated fat, trans fat, and salt.</p><p>“Emerging malnutrition issues are a stark indicator of the people who are not protected from the factors that drive poor diets. The poorest low- and middle-income countries are seeing a rapid transformation in the way people eat, drink, and move at work, home, in transport and in leisure,” said report author Professor Barry Popkin, University of North Carolina, USA. “The new nutrition reality is driven by changes to the food system, which have increased availability of ultra-processed foods that are linked to increased weight gain, while also adversely affecting infant and pre-schooler diets. These changes include disappearing fresh food markets, increasing supermarkets, and the control of the food chain by supermarkets, and global food, catering and agriculture companies in many countries.”</p><p>Exposure to undernutrition early in life followed by becoming overweight from childhood onwards increases the risk of a range of non-communicable diseases – making the double burden of malnutrition a key factor driving the emerging global epidemics of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. Negative effects can also pass across generations – for example, the effect of maternal obesity on the likelihood of the child having obesity may be exacerbated if the mother was undernourished in early life.</p><p>Despite physiological links, actions to address all forms of malnutrition have historically not taken account of these or other key factors, including early-life nutrition, diet quality, socioeconomic factors, and food environments. In addition, there is some evidence that programmes addressing undernutrition have unintentionally increased risks for obesity and diet-related NCDs in low-income and middle-income countries where food environments are changing rapidly.</p><p>While it is critical to maintain these programmes for undernutrition, they need to be redesigned to do no harm. Existing undernutrition programmes delivered through health services, social safety nets, educational settings, and agriculture and food systems present opportunities to address obesity and diet-related NCDs.  </p><p>The report identifies a set of ‘double-duty actions’ that simultaneously prevent or reduce the risk of nutritional deficiencies leading to underweight, wasting, stunting or micronutrient deficiencies, and obesity or NCDs, with the same intervention, programme, or policy. These range from improved antenatal care and breastfeeding practices, to social welfare, and to new agricultural and food system policies with healthy diets as their primary goal. </p><p>“Continuing with business-as-usual is not fit for purpose in the new nutrition reality. The good news is that there are some powerful opportunities to use the same platforms to address different forms of malnutrition. The time is now to seize these opportunities for ‘double duty action’ to get results” said Professor Corinna Hawkes, Centre for Food Policy, City, University of London, UK.</p><p>To create the systemic changes needed to end malnutrition in all its forms, the authors call on governments, the UN, civil society, academics, the media, donors, the private sector and economic platforms to address the double burden of malnutrition and bring in new actors, such as grass-roots organizations, farmers and their unions, faith-based leaders, advocates for planetary health, innovators and investors who are financing fair and green companies, city mayors and consumer associations. </p><p>“Given the political economy of food, the commodification of food systems, and growing patterns of inequality worldwide, the new nutrition reality calls for a broadened community of actors who work in mutually reinforcing and interconnected ways on a global scale,” says Dr Branca. “Without a profound food system transformation, the economic, social, and environmental costs of inaction will hinder the growth and development of individuals and societies for decades to come.”</p><p><strong>Notes to editors</strong></p><p>Funding for the preparation of the Series was provided by WHO, through a grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as some additional funding through the National Institutes of Health, the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health led by the International Food Policy Research Institute, and from RTI International. </p><p> </p>",

      "description": "Twin presence of obesity and undernutrition reflects shifts in food systems A new approach is needed to help reduce undernutrition and obesity at the same time, as the issues become increasingly connected due to rapid changes in countries’ food systems. This is especially important in low- and middle-income countries, according to a new four-paper report published in The Lancet. More than a third of such countries had overlapping forms of malnutrition (45 of 123 countries in the 1990s, and 48 of 126 countries in the 2010s), particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and east Asia and the Pacific. Undernutrition and obesity can lead to effects across generations as both maternal undernutrition and obesity are associated with poor health in offspring. However, because of the speed of change in food systems, more people are being exposed to both forms of malnutrition at different points in their lifetimes, which further increases harmful health effects. “We are facing a new nutrition reality,” said lead author of the report Dr Francesco Branca, Director of the Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, World Health Organization. “We can no longer characterize countries as low-income and undernourished, or high-income and only concerned with obesity. All forms of malnutrition have a common denominator – food systems that fail to provide all people with healthy, safe, affordable, and sustainable diets. Changing this will require action across food systems – from production and processing, through trade and distribution, pricing, marketing, and labelling, to consumption and waste. All relevant policies and investments must be radically re-examined.”In a Lancet editorial accompanying the report, Dr Richard Horton, Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet, says: “Today’s publication of the WHO Series on the Double Burden of Malnutrition comes after 12 months of Lancet articles exploring nutrition in all its forms… With these and other articles across Lancet journals throughout 2019, it has become clear that nutrition and malnutrition need to be approached from multiple perspectives, and although findings have sometimes converged, there is still work to be done to understand malnutrition’s multiple manifestations… With 6 years remaining in the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016-2025), this Series and Comment define the future direction required to achieve the global goal of eradicating hunger and preventing malnutrition in all its forms.”Globally, estimates suggest that almost 2.3 billion children and adults are overweight, and more than 150 million children are stunted. However, in low- and middle-income countries these emerging issues overlap in individuals, families, communities and countries. The new report explores the trends behind this intersection – known as the double burden of malnutrition – as well as the societal and food system changes that may be causing it, its biological explanation and effects, and policy measures that may help address malnutrition in all its forms. The authors used survey data from low- and middle-income countries in the 1990s and 2010s to estimate which countries faced a double burden of malnutrition (ie, in the population, more than 15% of people had wasting, more than 30% were stunted, more than 20% of women had thinness, and more than 20% of people were overweight).In the 2010s, 14 countries with some of the lowest incomes in the world had newly developed a double burden of malnutrition, compared with the 1990s. However, fewer low- and middle-income countries with the highest incomes were affected than in the 1990s. The authors say that this reflects the increasing prevalence of being overweight in the poorest countries, where populations still face stunting, wasting and thinness. High-quality diets reduce the risk of malnutrition in all its forms by promoting healthy growth, development, and immunity, and preventing obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) throughout life. The components of healthy diets are: optimal breastfeeding practices in the first two years; a diversity and abundance of fruits and vegetables, wholegrains, fibre, nuts, and seeds; modest amounts of animal source foods; minimal amounts of processed meats, and minimal amounts of foods and beverages high in energy and added amounts of sugar, saturated fat, trans fat, and salt.“Emerging malnutrition issues are a stark indicator of the people who are not protected from the factors that drive poor diets. The poorest low- and middle-income countries are seeing a rapid transformation in the way people eat, drink, and move at work, home, in transport and in leisure,” said report author Professor Barry Popkin, University of North Carolina, USA. “The new nutrition reality is driven by changes to the food system, which have increased availability of ultra-processed foods that are linked to increased weight gain, while also adversely affecting infant and pre-schooler diets. These changes include disappearing fresh food markets, increasing supermarkets, and the control of the food chain by supermarkets, and global food, catering and agriculture companies in many countries.”Exposure to undernutrition early in life followed by becoming overweight from childhood onwards increases the risk of a range of non-communicable diseases – making the double burden of malnutrition a key factor driving the emerging global epidemics of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. Negative effects can also pass across generations – for example, the effect of maternal obesity on the likelihood of the child having obesity may be exacerbated if the mother was undernourished in early life.Despite physiological links, actions to address all forms of malnutrition have historically not taken account of these or other key factors, including early-life nutrition, diet quality, socioeconomic factors, and food environments. In addition, there is some evidence that programmes addressing undernutrition have unintentionally increased risks for obesity and diet-related NCDs in low-income and middle-income countries where food environments are changing rapidly.While it is critical to maintain these programmes for undernutrition, they need to be redesigned to do no harm. Existing undernutrition programmes delivered through health services, social safety nets, educational settings, and agriculture and food systems present opportunities to address obesity and diet-related NCDs.  The report identifies a set of ‘double-duty actions’ that simultaneously prevent or reduce the risk of nutritional deficiencies leading to underweight, wasting, stunting or micronutrient deficiencies, and obesity or NCDs, with the same intervention, programme, or policy. These range from improved antenatal care and breastfeeding practices, to social welfare, and to new agricultural and food system policies with healthy diets as their primary goal. “Continuing with business-as-usual is not fit for purpose in the new nutrition reality. The good news is that there are some powerful opportunities to use the same platforms to address different forms of malnutrition. The time is now to seize these opportunities for ‘double duty action’ to get results” said Professor Corinna Hawkes, Centre for Food Policy, City, University of London, UK.To create the systemic changes needed to end malnutrition in all its forms, the authors call on governments, the UN, civil society, academics, the media, donors, the private sector and economic platforms to address the double burden of malnutrition and bring in new actors, such as grass-roots organizations, farmers and their unions, faith-based leaders, advocates for planetary health, innovators and investors who are financing fair and green companies, city mayors and consumer associations. “Given the political economy of food, the commodification of food systems, and growing patterns of inequality worldwide, the new nutrition reality calls for a broadened community of actors who work in mutually reinforcing and interconnected ways on a global scale,” says Dr Branca. “Without a profound food system transformation, the economic, social, and environmental costs of inaction will hinder the growth and development of individuals and societies for decades to come.”Notes to editorsFunding for the preparation of the Series was provided by WHO, through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as some additional funding through the National Institutes of Health, the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health led by the International Food Policy Research Institute, and from RTI International.",

The group’s executive summary , published in August 2019, presents a set of findings and recommendations to the WHO Director-General. The full report will be published in early 2020"

Worryingly, only about 38% have finances in place to even partially implement their national strategy of plan, and fewer than 10% channelling resources to implement it completely.</p><p>“Climate change is not only racking up a bill for future generations to pay, it’s a price that people are paying for now with their health,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “It is a moral imperative that countries have the resources they need to act against climate change and safeguard health now and in the future.”</p><p>Forty-eight percent of countries have conducted an assessment of the climate risks to public health. The most common climate sensitive health risks were identified by countries as heat stress, injury or death from extreme weather events, food, water and vector-borne diseases (such as cholera, dengue or malaria). However, about 60% of these countries report that the assessment findings have had little or no influence on the allocation of human and financial resources to meet their adaptation priorities for protecting health. Mainstreaming health in national and international climate processes could help access the necessary funds.</p><p>The survey found that countries have difficulties in accessing international climate finance to protect the health of their people. Over 75% reported a lack of information on opportunities to access climate finance, over 60% a lack of connection of health actors to the climate finance processes, and over 50% a lack of capacity to prepare proposals.</p><p>While two-thirds of current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement mention health, and the health sector is among the five sectors most often described as vulnerable to climate change, this has not resulted in the necessary level of implementation and support.</p><p>In addition, previous work has shown that the value of health gains from reducing carbon emissions would be approximately double the cost of implementing these actions at global level, and meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement could save about a million lives a year worldwide by 2050 through reductions in air pollution alone.</p></div><p>However, many countries are not able to take advantage of this potential.  The survey shows that less than 25% of countries have clear collaborations between health and the key sectors driving climate change and air pollution; transportation, electricity generation and household energy.</p><p>The health gains that would result from cutting carbon emissions are rarely reflected in national climate commitments, with only one-fifth of NDCs mentioning health in the context of emissions reductions and 1 in 10 NDCs mentioning the expected health gains.</p><p>“For the Paris Agreement to be effective to protect people’s health, all levels of government need to prioritize building health system resilience to climate change, and a growing number of national governments are clearly headed in that direction,” said Dr Maria Neira, Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health, World Health Organization. </p><p>“By systematically including health in Nationally Determined Contributions – as well as National Adaptation Plans, climate finance pledges, and other National Communications to the UNFCCC — the Paris Agreement could become the strongest international health agreement of the century.”</p><p>But there are gaps that urgently need to be addressed. One is getting countries from making plans to implementing them by addressing barriers to action, such as making sure the health sector is included in climate change processes and ensuring that they have the capacity and support to access the finance they need.</p><p>Another is to get health factored into the decision-making processes that have implications for cutting carbon emissions and other sustainability goals, and to take account of the health gains that result from taking climate action.  </p><h2>Note to Editors</h2><ul><li><p>Half of countries surveyed by the World Health Organization now have national health and climate change strategies or plans, but the majority of them struggle to fully implement them.</p></li><li><p>Although knowledge of health impacts of climate change are informing national planning, it did not result in additional financial or human resources allocated to the health sector.</p></li></ul>",

The study, published in <em>The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health</em> journal and produced by researchers from the World Health Organization (WHO), finds that more than 80% of school-going adolescents globally did not meet current recommendations of at least one hour of physical activity per day – including 85% of girls and 78% of boys.</p>\n<p>The study – which is based on data reported by 1.6 million 11 to 17-year-old students – finds that across all 146 countries studied between 2001-2016 girls were less active than boys in all but four (Tonga, Samoa, Afghanistan and Zambia).</p>\n<p>The difference in the proportion of boys and girls meeting the recommendations was greater than 10 percentage points in almost one in three countries in 2016 (29%, 43 of 146 countries), with the biggest gaps seen in the United States of America and Ireland (more than 15 percentage points). Most countries in the study (73%, 107 of 146) saw this gender gap widen between 2001-2016.</p>\n<h2>Young people’s health compromised by insufficient physical activity</h2>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The authors say that levels of insufficient physical activity in adolescents continue to be extremely high, compromising their current and future health. “Urgent policy action to increase physical activity is needed now, particularly to promote and retain girls’ participation in physical activity,” says study author Dr Regina Guthold, WHO.</p>\n<p>The health benefits of a physically active lifestyle during adolescence include improved cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, bone and cardiometabolic health, and positive effects on weight.

Additionally, Nigeria – the last country in Africa to have cases of wild polio – has <a href=\"http://polioeradication.org/news-post/nigeria-three-years-free-from-wild-poliovirus/\">not seen wild polio since 2016</a> and the entire WHO African region could be certified wild polio-free in 2020. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of health workers, governments, donors and partners, wild polio only circulates in two countries: Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>“From supporting one of the world’s largest health workforces, to reaching every last child with vaccines, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is not only moving us closer to a polio-free world, it’s also building essential health infrastructure to address a range of other health needs,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization and Chair of the Polio Oversight Board. “We are grateful for the generous pledges made today and thank governments, donors and partners for standing with us. In particular, I would like to thank His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi for hosting the GPEI pledging moment and for his long-term support for polio eradication.”</p>\n<p>The commitments announced today come at a critical time for the polio eradication effort. Barriers to reaching every child – including inconsistent campaign quality, insecurity, conflict, massive mobile populations, and, in some instances, parental refusal to the vaccine – have led to ongoing transmission of the wild poliovirus in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Further, low immunity to the virus in parts of Africa and Asia where not all children are vaccinated has sparked outbreaks of a rare form of the virus. To surmount these obstacles and protect 450 million children from polio every year, governments and donors announced significant new financial commitments toward the $3.27 billion needed to support the Polio Endgame Strategy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Final-Pledging-Table-20191118.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Pledges</a> are from a diverse array of donors, including: US$160 million<strong> </strong>from the host of the pledging moment <strong>His Highness </strong><strong>Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi;</strong> countries, including US$215.92 million<strong> </strong>from the<strong> United States, </strong>US$160 million<strong> </strong>from <strong>the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, </strong>US$105.05 million from <strong>Germany, </strong>US$84.17 million from the <strong>Federal Government of</strong> <strong>Nigeria, </strong>US$10.83 million from <strong>Norway, </strong>US$10.29 million from <strong>Australia, </strong>US$7.4 million from <strong>Japan</strong><strong>, </strong>US$2.22 million from <strong>Luxembourg, </strong>US$1.34 million from <strong>New Zealand, </strong>US$116,000 from <strong>Spain, </strong>and US$10,000 from <strong>Liechtenstein</strong>; GPEI partners, including US$1.08 billion from <strong>the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation </strong>and US$150 million from <strong>Rotary International</strong>; philanthropic organizations, including US$50 million from <strong>Bloomberg Philanthropies</strong>, US$25 million from <strong>Dalio Philanthropies, </strong>US$15 million from the <strong>Tahir Foundation, </strong>US$6.4 million from the <strong>United Nations Foundation, </strong>US$2 million from <strong>Alwaleed Philanthropies,</strong> US$1 million from the <strong>Charina Endowment Fund, </strong>and US$1 million from <strong>Ningxia Yanbao Charity Foundation</strong>; and the private sector, including US$1 million from <strong>Ahmed</strong> <strong>Al Abdulla Group,</strong> US$1 million from <strong>Al Ansari Exchange, </strong>and US$340,000 from <strong>Kasta Technologies</strong>.

    "content_html": "<div><p>Millions of sanitation workers in the developing world are forced to work in conditions that endanger their health and lives, and violate their dignity and human rights, according to a report released today.</p><p>Sanitation workers provide an essential public service that is key to safeguarding human health. They are often the most marginalized, poor and discriminated against members of society, carrying out their jobs with no equipment, protection or legal rights.</p><p>“A fundamental principle of health is “first do no harm”. Sanitation workers make a key contribution to public health around the world – but in so doing, put their own health at risk. This is unacceptable,” said Dr Maria Neira, Director, Department of Public Health and Environment, WHO<strong>.</strong> “We must improve working conditions for these people and strengthen the sanitation workforce, so we can meet global water and sanitation targets.” </p><p>The report on the plight of sanitation workers in the developing world is jointly authored by the International Labour Organization, WaterAid, World Bank and World Health Organization to raise awareness of the de-humanizing working conditions and to push for change. It is the most extensive global study to date on the issue, and part of a growing body of work on sanitation workers. </p><p>Poor sanitation causes up to 432 000 diarrhoeal deaths annually and is linked to the transmission of other diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis A and polio. Sanitation workers are the people who work in jobs such as cleaning toilets, emptying pits and septic tanks, cleaning sewers and manholes and operating pumping stations and treatment plants. They play a valuable role in improving the health and well-being of populations around the world and have the same right to good health.</p><p>Waste must be correctly treated before being disposed of or used. However, workers often come into direct contact with human waste, working with no equipment or protection to remove it by hand which expose them to a long list of health hazards and diseases.</p><p>The work is often informal with workers subject to no rights or social protections. Pay can be inconsistent or non-existent – some workers report being paid in food rather than money. Sanitation work is often socially stigmatized and done at night.</p><p>The report highlights examples of good practice, where sanitation work has been officially acknowledged and formalized.  It also lays out four key action areas for countries and development partners: reform of policy, legislation and regulation; developing and adopting operational guidelines for workers; advocacy and empowerment of sanitation workers to claim their rights; and strengthening evidence on the status of sanitation work and good practice.  In South Africa for example, public and private employees follow national labour standards and have proper equipment and training.</p><p>The World Health Organization is helping to strengthen national capacities, focusing on ensuring protections of sanitation workers are included in national sanitation policies and risk-assessment and management at a local level. WHO will also work with partners to quantify the global sanitation workforce and try to estimate the burden of disease for sanitation workers. </p><p>Many of the challenges sanitation workers face stem from their lack of visibility in society. Few countries in the developing world have any guidelines to protect these workers. Where laws do exist, governments may lack the financial or technical means to implement them, and the informality of the roles presents further challenges.</p><p>The world will need many more sanitation workers with safe, healthy and dignified working conditions if we are to meet Sustainable Development Goal 6 to bring clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene to everyone, everywhere by 2030. Safe sanitation must go hand in hand with a safe and dignified working environment for those who run and maintain the sanitation services that protect our health.<br/></p></div>",

About 65 million people with type 2 diabetes need insulin, but only half of them are able to access it, largely due to high prices.  All people with type 1 diabetes need insulin to survive. </p><p>“Diabetes is on the rise globally, and rising faster in low-income countries,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Too many people who need insulin encounter financial hardship in accessing it, or go without it and risk their lives. WHO’s prequalification initiative for insulin is a vital step towards ensuring everyone who needs this life-saving product can access it.”</p><h2>Insulin prequalification can lead to lower prices</h2><p>WHO prequalification of insulin is expected to boost access by increasing the flow of quality-assured products on the international market, providing countries with greater choice and patients with lower prices. </p><p>Insulin was discovered as a treatment for diabetes almost 100 years ago and has been on WHO’s List of Essential Medicines since it was published in 1977.</p><p>Despite an ample supply, insulin prices are currently a barrier to treatment in most low- and middle-income countries.

Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death and a major cause of costly and debilitating complications such as heart attacks, stroke, kidney failure, blindness and lower limb amputations.</p><p>People with type 1 diabetes need insulin for survival and to maintain their blood glucose at levels to reduce the risk of common complications such as blindness and kidney failure. People with type 2 diabetes need insulin for controlling blood glucose levels to avoid complications when oral medicines become less effective as the illness progresses.</p><p>Insulin prequalification is one of a number of steps WHO will take in the coming year to address the diabetes burden. Plans are underway to update diabetes treatment guidelines, devise price reduction strategies for analogues and improve delivery systems and access to diagnostics. WHO also works with countries to promote healthier diets and physical activity to lower people’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p><h2>Note to editors</h2><p>The WHO Prequalification of Medicines Programme contributes to accelerating and increasing access to critical medical products that are quality-assured, affordable and adapted for markets in low- and middle-income countries. </p><p>The programme does this by evaluating medical products developed by manufacturers to ensure their quality, safety and efficacy, in turn expanding the pool of available quality medicines.</p><p>Evaluating and prequalifying health products then guides international procurement agencies, such as the Global Fund, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and UNICEF, and increasingly countries to make bulk purchases of medicines vaccines, diagnostics and other critical products at lower prices.</p>",

The most robust evidence comes from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), although information from a range of study designs may feed into the policy-making process. RCTs generate evidence under tightly controlled conditions, which has led to some malaria policies being overly prescriptive, stipulating that interventions should only be deployed in conditions matching those in the RCTs. The net result is that malaria control efforts may be overly constrained by the way that policy guidance is currently formulated.</p><p>From 17–18 September 2019, WHO held an <a href=\"/publications/m/item/WHO-CDS-GMP-MPAC-2019.19\" target=\"_blank\">informal consultation</a> to explore the advisability of moving to a new approach that draws on the transferability of study findings to inform policy recommendations. Key outcomes of the consultation included the identification of common themes and recommendations to prioritize for early review; identification of principles to apply when considering the modification or broadening of existing recommendations, or the development of new recommendations that extend beyond available evidence; and the development of a consensus statement.</p><h3>Statement by the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC)</h3><p>The past 15 years have seen a substantial decline in malaria cases and deaths following the scaling up of essential malaria control interventions, driven by increased investment and reduced commodity costs. This decline has resulted in increased heterogeneity in malaria burden, which demands the effective use of limited resources and a better targeting of interventions.</p><p>To achieve their malaria control targets, countries are working to develop detailed national strategic plans with robust stratification and tailored mixes of interventions at the subnational level, adapted to the local context and available resources. While the overall goal remains universal coverage with an appropriate mix of interventions for all populations at risk of malaria, there is broad recognition that, in many cases, available resources are insufficient to fund all elements of these national strategic plans; in these cases, countries are required to make difficult choices. The process of stratification and defining appropriate intervention mixes for each stratum requires additional data and, in turn, increased investment in the collection of routine data and surveillance systems.</p><p>MPAC agrees with the consensus statement that emerged from the WHO consultation, with some minor modifications:</p><ul><li>Intervention prioritization should not be driven solely by sequentially optimizing single interventions for maximal coverage.</li><li>Instead, intervention prioritization should be based on local evidence and aligned to the specific needs of different epidemiological strata/settings, as defined in the country’s national strategic plan.</li></ul><p>This new data-driven approach moves away from a one-size-fits-all perspective driven by the national strategic plan. It will be critical that countries monitor and document the impact of these stratified approaches through enhanced surveillance, both to learn from the process and to identify and rapidly mitigate potential problems.</p><p>MPAC appreciates the concept of “universal coverage” in striving to save lives, reduce disease and ultimately eradicate malaria. The Committee encourages countries to work towards universal coverage of the right mix of interventions, recognizing that coverage of individual interventions will vary by setting.</p><p>MPAC calls on the WHO Global Malaria Programme Secretariat to support countries in this prioritization exercise. Country programme funders are encouraged to embrace the flexibilities and additional data required to optimize the allocation of limited resources for maximum impact.</p><div><hr/></div><p>This statement is extracted from the October 2019 Malaria Policy Advisory Committee <a href=\"/publications/i/item/WHO-CDS-GMP-2019.12\" target=\"_blank\">meeting report</a>.</p><p> </p>",

          "From 17–18 September 2019, WHO held an informal consultation to explore the advisability of moving to a new approach that draws on the transferability of study findings to inform policy recommendations. Key outcomes of the consultation included the identification of common themes and recommendations to prioritize for early review; identification of principles to apply when considering the modification or broadening of existing recommendations, or the development of new recommendations that extend beyond available evidence; and the development of a consensus statement."

          "The past 15 years have seen a substantial decline in malaria cases and deaths following the scaling up of essential malaria control interventions, driven by increased investment and reduced commodity costs. This decline has resulted in increased heterogeneity in malaria burden, which demands the effective use of limited resources and a better targeting of interventions.",
          "To achieve their malaria control targets, countries are working to develop detailed national strategic plans with robust stratification and tailored mixes of interventions at the subnational level, adapted to the local context and available resources. While the overall goal remains universal coverage with an appropriate mix of interventions for all populations at risk of malaria, there is broad recognition that, in many cases, available resources are insufficient to fund all elements of these national strategic plans; in these cases, countries are required to make difficult choices. The process of stratification and defining appropriate intervention mixes for each stratum requires additional data and, in turn, increased investment in the collection of routine data and surveillance systems.",
          "MPAC agrees with the consensus statement that emerged from the WHO consultation, with some minor modifications:",
          "This new data-driven approach moves away from a one-size-fits-all perspective driven by the national strategic plan. It will be critical that countries monitor and document the impact of these stratified approaches through enhanced surveillance, both to learn from the process and to identify and rapidly mitigate potential problems.",
          "MPAC appreciates the concept of “universal coverage” in striving to save lives, reduce disease and ultimately eradicate malaria. The Committee encourages countries to work towards universal coverage of the right mix of interventions, recognizing that coverage of individual interventions will vary by setting.",
          "MPAC calls on the WHO Global Malaria Programme Secretariat to support countries in this prioritization exercise. Country programme funders are encouraged to embrace the flexibilities and additional data required to optimize the allocation of limited resources for maximum impact.",

The action plan agreed today focuses our efforts on helping the world benefit from digital health technologies and solutions while safeguarding the misuse of people’s data and protecting their health.”</p>\n<p>The two-day meeting at WHO’s headquarters in Geneva led to an agreed action plan to focus the expert group’s activities and priorities over the next two years. Meeting focused on better defining WHOs role in supporting global digital transformation. Topics included: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developing a global framework for WHO to validate, implement and scale up digital health technology and solutions.</li>\n<li>Recommendations for safe and ethical use of digital technologies to strengthen national health systems by improving quality and coverage of care, increasing access to health information.</li>\n<li>Advice on advocacy and partnership models to accelerate use of digital health capabilities in countries to achieve better health outcomes. </li>\n<li>Advice on emerging digital health technologies with global reach and impact, so no one is left behind.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Advisory group co-chair Steve Davis, president and chief executive officer of global health non-profit PATH, said the new plan provides direction to help WHO maximize the potential of the digital health landscape and chart future trends, tools and opportunities.<em> </em></p>\n<p>“The WHO continues to demonstrate its strong commitment to harnessing the power of digital technologies and data to address the world’s most pressing health challenges through the launch of this new Digital Health Technical Advisory Group. I am honored to be co-chairing this group that brings together diverse experts from government, civil society, technology innovators, and NGOs,” said Mr Davis. “We are committed to working with the WHO to identify sustainable and scalable digital and data tools and approaches that meet global health needs.”</p>\n<p>Bernardo Mariano, director of WHO’s Department of Digital health and Innovation, said: “Digital technologies can play a powerful role in improving the health of people worldwide.” </p>\n</div>\n<p>“WHO’s goal is to ensure digital technologies for health are safe and that proven tools reach everyone, everywhere,” Mr Mariano added. “Digital health can help expand primary health care, allow health workers to fight resurgent or new diseases and ensure people can benefit from the transformation in digital health.

He turned the meeting over to the Chair, Dr Robert Steffen. Dr Steffen also welcomed the Committee and gave the floor to the Secretariat.<br/><br/>Representatives of WHO’s legal department and the department of compliance, risk management, and ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities.<br/><br/>Committee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting.<br/><br/>The Chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters.\r\n</p><p>Presentations were made by representatives of the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), United Republic of Tanzania, Republic of Uganda, the UN Ebola Emergency Response Coordinator and the WHO Secretariat. </p><p>The current situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was reviewed. As of 13 October 2019, a total of 3228 cases were reported, of which 3114 confirmed and 114 probable, of which 2123 deaths (case fatality rate 66%). In the 21 days from 23 September to 13 October, the number of affected health areas has reduced, with 22 health areas and 10 health zones reporting new cases, predominated by Mandima, Mambasa and Kalunguta. The epidemic is currently concentrated in the Mandima health zone in the Biakato Mine health area. Priorities for the response include implementing a multimodal approach.<br/><br/>Uganda emphasized the efforts to vaccinate health care workers and strengthen community village health teams in the at-risk districts to enhance community surveillance. Uganda spoke about their approaches to rapidly address the EVD cases in June 2019, and highlighted efforts to strengthen preparedness, under the National EVD preparedness Task Force. Of note, Uganda’s surveillance system was able to detect numerous alerts of EVD suspect cases, with more than 1000 samples from across the country having been tested for Viral Hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs). Of these, 4 confirmed cases of Ebola were detected, 16 Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever and 8 Rift Valley fever. Also, strong cross-border collaboration, through regular screening at ground crossings and main international airport continued, which has enabled prompt follow up of lost high-risk contacts from the Democratic Republic of the Congo into Uganda.<br/><br/>Tanzania provided an update on their preparedness efforts, which continued since September 2018, through the Ebola Contingency plan, under the leadership of the National Task Force. Ten high-risk regions, were identified and supported to strengthen cross-border screening and raise awareness at health centers, ensure availability of personal protective equipment especially for health workers, strengthen public awareness of the disease through a toll-free hot-line, strengthen the surveillance system, and procure more than 2700 sets of personnel protective equipment.<br/>Thermoscanners were distributed in high-priority points of entry (PoEs), given the porous borders with more than 700 travelers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo per week. From August 2018 to date, 29 alerts of Ebola suspect cases were reported, 17 samples tested and were negative for Ebola (including 2 in September 2019). Tanzania continued to practice simulation exercises in 5 out of 10 regions.<br/><br/>The WHO Secretariat provided details on the latest risk assessment. Risk remains very high at national and regional levels but still low at global level. In recent weeks, the incidence of EVD cases has consistently declined, with 15 new confirmed cases, reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces during the last epidemiological week of 7–13 October, in comparison with 128 confirmed cases per week reported at the peak of the outbreak in April 2019. There is a shift in hot spots from urban settings to more rural, hard-to-reach communities, across a more concentrated geographical area. At present, 10 health zones are affected. These areas pose major security challenges. When response activities are suspended, the likelihood of underreporting and the potential for the disease to spread to new areas increases. In addition, continued transmission in remote areas where access is difficult creates the possibility of transmission chains going undetected.<br/><br/>The ring vaccination strategy is proving efficient and successful. Issues related to vaccine supply were reviewed. Given the uncertainty of the evolution of the epidemic, current supplies should be managed carefully.  The Secretariat also welcomed the commencement of Johnson and Johnson vaccine studies in Uganda and the imminent commencement of similar studies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in addition to continuing to track progress with other vaccine candidates.  <br/><br/>The United Nations Ebola Emergency Response Coordinator gave an update on the situation and efforts to maintain an enabling environment to improve access and acceptance of Ebola response in communities. He re-emphasized the need for stronger community engagement and access in all areas, increased multisectoral collaboration, and more financial and human resources. Insecurity remains the greatest concern. Efforts to increase security are underway. There is a need to focus both on intervention gaps and the quality of interventions. Identifying areas where the virus might migrate and securing these areas constitutes a major priority.<br/><br/>The Committee was also appraised by the WHO Secretariat on progress on preparedness efforts in the nine neighbouring countries (priority 1: Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda, and priority 2: Angola, Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Tanzania, and Zambia).  Bilateral roadmaps for cross-border coordination between DRC and the priority 1 countries are being implemented. On 21 October 2019, a high-level ministerial meeting will be held in Goma, DRC, to further strengthen alignment and coordination of cross-border surveillance across all nine high-risk neighbouring countries. A major challenge is the lack of funding for preparedness, particularly in the priority 2 countries. Of the US$ 66.6 million required for all the 9 countries, only US$ 4.5 million has been pledged. Compliance with IHR requirements for notification and verification of alerts was highlighted, in particular with regards to transparency and timely sharing of public health information.\r\n</p><h3><strong>Context and Discussion</strong></h3><p><strong></strong>The Committee commended the response to date, under the leadership of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministry of Health, and appreciated the progress made under the multisectoral coordination commission established in July 2019. Support provided by WHO, UN agencies, NGOs and other partners has also contributed to limiting the spread and impact of this virus in a difficult context in many areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The courage and commitment of all frontline workers were specifically praised by the Committee.<br/><br/>While the Committee commended the efforts made by the neighbouring countries to strengthen preparedness, it remained deeply concerned by the lack of sustained financial support for these activities.<br/><br/>The committee noticed with appreciation that the general compliance of all states with the WHO recommendations to keep borders open and air travel meant operations could continue and economies in the area were not harmed by border closures.<br/><br/>However, the Committee is concerned that a year into the outbreak, the access and security situations on the ground could hinder final efforts to eliminate the virus from rural communities.\r\n</p><h3><strong>Conclusions and Advice</strong></h3><p><strong></strong>It was the view of the Committee that this event still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under the IHR (2005). The Committee provided the following advice to the Director-General for his issuance as revised Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005).<br/><br/>For affected countries:\r\n</p><ul><li>Sustain the political commitment and multisectoral coordination approach to the response and expand this commitment to local areas and hot spots of the outbreak.</li><li>Further enhance the acceptance, access and security situation to provide an enabling environment for all response partners to support public health operations as an essential platform for accelerating disease-control efforts.</li><li>Continue to strengthen strategy, capacity, implementation, and coordination for community awareness and engagement, in particular in and around the current hot spots.</li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\">Continue cross-border screening and screening at main internal roads, with a particular focus on routes connected to areas with current transmission.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"></span>Accelerate comprehensive action for active surveillance for cases and unexplained deaths in all areas, with specific focus to detect all chains of transmission in hot spot areas and continue to implement real-time genetic sequencing of all new confirmed cases.</li><li>Continue to implement optimal vaccine strategies that have proven maximum impact on curtailing the outbreak, as recommended by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE).</li><li>Strengthen measures to prevent nosocomial infections, including systematic mapping of health facilities, targeting of IPC interventions and sustain support to those facilities through monitoring and sustained supervision.</li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\">Strengthen preparedness in non-affected provinces of DRC, and more generally strengthen health system across the country to respond to concurrent health emergencies, such as the current measles outbreak.</span></li></ul><p>For countries at-risk:</p><ul><li>At-risk countries should work urgently with partners to improve their preparedness for detecting and managing imported or locally-acquired cases, including the transparent sharing of detailed information on suspect cases, as required by the International Health Regulations (2005), and sharing laboratory samples of suspect cases for confirmatory testing in accordance with WHO norms and guidance.</li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\">Countries should continue to map population movements and sociological patterns that can predict risk of disease spread.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\">Risk communications and community engagement, especially at points of entry, should be increased.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\">At-risk countries should continue to put in place approvals for investigational medicines and vaccines as an immediate priority for preparedness.</span></li></ul><p> For all States:</p><ul><li>No country should close its borders or place any restrictions on travel and trade.

          "The Committee commended the response to date, under the leadership of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministry of Health, and appreciated the progress made under the multisectoral coordination commission established in July 2019. Support provided by WHO, UN agencies, NGOs and other partners has also contributed to limiting the spread and impact of this virus in a difficult context in many areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The courage and commitment of all frontline workers were specifically praised by the Committee. While the Committee commended the efforts made by the neighbouring countries to strengthen preparedness, it remained deeply concerned by the lack of sustained financial support for these activities. The committee noticed with appreciation that the general compliance of all states with the WHO recommendations to keep borders open and air travel meant operations could continue and economies in the area were not harmed by border closures. However, the Committee is concerned that a year into the outbreak, the access and security situations on the ground could hinder final efforts to eliminate the virus from rural communities."

      "description": "The meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) to review the current Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  took place on Friday, 18 October 2019, from 12:00 to 16:00 Geneva time (CEST).Proceedings of the meetingMembers and advisors of the Emergency Committee were convened by teleconference. The Director-General welcomed the Committee and thanked them for their support. He turned the meeting over to the Chair, Dr Robert Steffen. Dr Steffen also welcomed the Committee and gave the floor to the Secretariat.Representatives of WHO’s legal department and the department of compliance, risk management, and ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities.Committee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting.The Chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters.Presentations were made by representatives of the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), United Republic of Tanzania, Republic of Uganda, the UN Ebola Emergency Response Coordinator and the WHO Secretariat. The current situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was reviewed. As of 13 October 2019, a total of 3228 cases were reported, of which 3114 confirmed and 114 probable, of which 2123 deaths (case fatality rate 66%). In the 21 days from 23 September to 13 October, the number of affected health areas has reduced, with 22 health areas and 10 health zones reporting new cases, predominated by Mandima, Mambasa and Kalunguta. The epidemic is currently concentrated in the Mandima health zone in the Biakato Mine health area. Priorities for the response include implementing a multimodal approach.Uganda emphasized the efforts to vaccinate health care workers and strengthen community village health teams in the at-risk districts to enhance community surveillance. Uganda spoke about their approaches to rapidly address the EVD cases in June 2019, and highlighted efforts to strengthen preparedness, under the National EVD preparedness Task Force. Of note, Uganda’s surveillance system was able to detect numerous alerts of EVD suspect cases, with more than 1000 samples from across the country having been tested for Viral Hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs). Of these, 4 confirmed cases of Ebola were detected, 16 Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever and 8 Rift Valley fever. Also, strong cross-border collaboration, through regular screening at ground crossings and main international airport continued, which has enabled prompt follow up of lost high-risk contacts from the Democratic Republic of the Congo into Uganda.Tanzania provided an update on their preparedness efforts, which continued since September 2018, through the Ebola Contingency plan, under the leadership of the National Task Force. Ten high-risk regions, were identified and supported to strengthen cross-border screening and raise awareness at health centers, ensure availability of personal protective equipment especially for health workers, strengthen public awareness of the disease through a toll-free hot-line, strengthen the surveillance system, and procure more than 2700 sets of personnel protective equipment.Thermoscanners were distributed in high-priority points of entry (PoEs), given the porous borders with more than 700 travelers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo per week. From August 2018 to date, 29 alerts of Ebola suspect cases were reported, 17 samples tested and were negative for Ebola (including 2 in September 2019). Tanzania continued to practice simulation exercises in 5 out of 10 regions.The WHO Secretariat provided details on the latest risk assessment. Risk remains very high at national and regional levels but still low at global level. In recent weeks, the incidence of EVD cases has consistently declined, with 15 new confirmed cases, reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces during the last epidemiological week of 7–13 October, in comparison with 128 confirmed cases per week reported at the peak of the outbreak in April 2019. There is a shift in hot spots from urban settings to more rural, hard-to-reach communities, across a more concentrated geographical area. At present, 10 health zones are affected. These areas pose major security challenges. When response activities are suspended, the likelihood of underreporting and the potential for the disease to spread to new areas increases. In addition, continued transmission in remote areas where access is difficult creates the possibility of transmission chains going undetected.The ring vaccination strategy is proving efficient and successful. Issues related to vaccine supply were reviewed. Given the uncertainty of the evolution of the epidemic, current supplies should be managed carefully.  The Secretariat also welcomed the commencement of Johnson and Johnson vaccine studies in Uganda and the imminent commencement of similar studies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in addition to continuing to track progress with other vaccine candidates.  The United Nations Ebola Emergency Response Coordinator gave an update on the situation and efforts to maintain an enabling environment to improve access and acceptance of Ebola response in communities. He re-emphasized the need for stronger community engagement and access in all areas, increased multisectoral collaboration, and more financial and human resources. Insecurity remains the greatest concern. Efforts to increase security are underway. There is a need to focus both on intervention gaps and the quality of interventions. Identifying areas where the virus might migrate and securing these areas constitutes a major priority.The Committee was also appraised by the WHO Secretariat on progress on preparedness efforts in the nine neighbouring countries (priority 1: Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda, and priority 2: Angola, Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Tanzania, and Zambia).  Bilateral roadmaps for cross-border coordination between DRC and the priority 1 countries are being implemented. On 21 October 2019, a high-level ministerial meeting will be held in Goma, DRC, to further strengthen alignment and coordination of cross-border surveillance across all nine high-risk neighbouring countries. A major challenge is the lack of funding for preparedness, particularly in the priority 2 countries. Of the US$ 66.6 million required for all the 9 countries, only US$ 4.5 million has been pledged. Compliance with IHR requirements for notification and verification of alerts was highlighted, in particular with regards to transparency and timely sharing of public health information.Context and DiscussionThe Committee commended the response to date, under the leadership of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministry of Health, and appreciated the progress made under the multisectoral coordination commission established in July 2019. Support provided by WHO, UN agencies, NGOs and other partners has also contributed to limiting the spread and impact of this virus in a difficult context in many areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The Committee provided the following advice to the Director-General for his issuance as revised Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005).For affected countries:Sustain the political      commitment and multisectoral coordination approach to the response and      expand this commitment to local areas and hot spots of the outbreak.Further enhance the      acceptance, access and security situation to provide an enabling      environment for all response partners to support public health operations      as an essential platform for accelerating disease-control efforts.Continue to strengthen      strategy, capacity, implementation, and coordination for community      awareness and engagement, in particular in and around the current hot      spots.Continue cross-border      screening and screening at main internal roads, with a particular focus on      routes connected to areas with current transmission.Accelerate comprehensive      action for active surveillance for cases and unexplained deaths in all      areas, with specific focus to detect all chains of transmission in hot      spot areas and continue to implement real-time genetic sequencing of all      new confirmed cases.Continue to implement      optimal vaccine strategies that have proven maximum impact on curtailing      the outbreak, as recommended by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts      (SAGE).Strengthen measures to      prevent nosocomial infections, including systematic mapping of health      facilities, targeting of IPC interventions and sustain support to those      facilities through monitoring and sustained supervision.Strengthen preparedness in      non-affected provinces of DRC, and more generally strengthen health system      across the country to respond to concurrent health emergencies, such as      the current measles outbreak.For countries at-risk:At-risk countries should      work urgently with partners to improve their preparedness for detecting      and managing imported or locally-acquired cases, including the transparent      sharing of detailed information on suspect cases, as required by the      International Health Regulations (2005), and sharing laboratory samples of      suspect cases for confirmatory testing in accordance with WHO norms and      guidance.Countries should continue      to map population movements and sociological patterns that can predict      risk of disease spread.Risk communications and      community engagement, especially at points of entry, should be increased.At-risk countries should      continue to put in place approvals for investigational medicines and      vaccines as an immediate priority for preparedness. For all States:No country should close its      borders or place any restrictions on travel and trade. Such measures are      usually implemented out of fear and have no basis in science. They push      the movement of people and goods to informal border crossings that are not      monitored, thus increasing the chances of the spread of disease. Most      critically, these restrictions can also compromise local economies and negatively      affect response operations from a security and logistics perspective.National authorities should      work with airlines and other transport and tourism industries to ensure      that they do not exceed WHO’s advice on international traffic.The Committee does not      consider entry screening at airports or other ports of entry outside the      region to be necessary.The Committee emphasized the importance of continued support by WHO and other national and international partners towards the effective implementation and monitoring of these recommendations.Based on this advice, the reports made by the affected State Party, and the currently available information, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 18 October 2019 maintained the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s advice and issued them as Temporary Recommendations under IHR (2005) to reduce the international spread of Ebola, effective 18 October 2019.

      "description": "The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomes the European Medicines Agency (EMA) announcement recommending a conditional marketing authorization for the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine, which has been shown to be effective in protecting people from the Ebola virus. \r\n    Today’s announcement by EMA, the European agency responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies, is a key step before the European Commission decision on licensing. In parallel, WHO will move towards prequalification of the vaccine. “The conditional authorization of the world’s first Ebola vaccine is a triumph for public health, and a testimony to the unprecedented collaboration between scores of experts worldwide,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.\r\n    “My deepest gratitude is to the studies’ volunteers, researchers, health workers in Guinea, other countries and the Democratic Republic of the Congo who have put themselves at risk to ensure people are protected with this vaccine.”In the past five years, WHO has convened experts to review the evidence on various Ebola vaccine candidates, informed policy recommendations, and mobilized a multilateral coalition to accelerate clinical evaluations. The EMA review was unique in that\r\n    WHO and African regulators actively participated through an innovative cooperative arrangement put in place by WHO, which will help accelerate registration for the countries most at risk.   A randomized trial for the vaccine began during the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2015. When no other organization was positioned to run a trial in Guinea during the complex emergency, the government of Guinea and WHO took the unusual step to lead the\r\n    trial. A global coalition of funders and researchers provided the critical support required. Funders included the Canadian Government (through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, International Development Research Centre,\r\n    Global Affairs Canada); the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (through the Research Council of Norway's GLOBVAC programme); the Wellcome Trust; the UK government through the Department for International Development; and Médecins Sans Frontières.The trial was successfully run using an innovative ring vaccination design. In the 1970s, this ring strategy helped to eradicate smallpox, but this was the first time that an experimental vaccine was evaluated this way.  WHO celebrates the commitment and sacrifices made by so many over the last five years, an international effort that led to this landmark moment in public health. The difficult and painstaking work was undertaken by a global team of researchers, health\r\n    workers, partners, regulators, governments and field workers from logisticians to vaccinators, and finally, local communities. Together they overcame many obstacles. WHO also recognizes the Canadian government contribution to the early development\r\n    of this vaccine.Anticipating that in coming years there will be higher Ebola vaccine demand during and between outbreaks, WHO is working with Gavi, UNICEF and other partners to develop a Global Ebola Vaccines Security Plan, as increased supply capacity and multiple manufacturers\r\n    will be needed in the short- to medium-term to meet this demand and ensure vaccine security. There are 8 vaccines undergoing clinical evaluation.

Globally, 7 million people were diagnosed and treated for TB - up from 6.4 million in 2017 – enabling the world to meet one of the milestones towards the United Nations political declaration targets on TB. </p><p>WHO’s latest Global TB Report says that 2018 also saw a reduction in the number of TB deaths: 1.5 million people died from TB in 2018, down from 1.6 million in 2017.  The number of new cases of TB has been declining steadily in recent years. However, the burden remains high among low-income and marginalized populations: around 10 million people developed TB in 2018.</p><p>“Today we mark the passing of the first milestone in the effort to reach people who’ve been missing out on services to prevent and treat TB,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. </p><p>“This is proof that we can reach global targets if we join forces together, as we have done through the Find.Treat.All.EndTB joint initiative of WHO, Stop TB Partnership and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria”.</p><p>WHO’s latest <a href=\"/teams/global-programme-on-tuberculosis-and-lung-health/tb-reports\">Global TB Report</a>, released today, highlights that the world must accelerate progress if it is to reach the Sustainable Development Goal of ending TB by 2030. The report also notes that an estimated 3 million of those with TB still are not getting the care they need.  </p><h2>The role of Universal Coverage</h2><p>In many countries today, fragile health infrastructure and workforce shortages make it difficult to provide timely diagnosis and the right treatments for TB. Weak reporting systems are another problem: health providers may treat people but fail to report cases to national authorities, leaving an incomplete picture of national epidemics and service needs. Further, up to 80 per cent of TB patients in high burden countries spend more than 20 per cent of their annual household income on treating the disease. </p><p>Dr Tedros added: “Sustained progress on TB will require strong health systems and better access to services. That means a renewed investment in primary health care and a commitment to universal health coverage.”</p><p>Last month heads of state agreed a political declaration on Universal Health Coverage at the United Nations in New York, highlighting the importance of expanding service coverage and committing specifically to strengthen efforts to address communicable diseases like HIV, TB, and malaria. </p><p>One way to improve coverage is to adopt more people-centered comprehensive approaches. Better integrated HIV and TB programmes already mean that two thirds of people diagnosed with TB now know their HIV status. In addition, more people living with HIV are taking treatment. </p><p>But child health programmes still do not always focus adequately on TB: half of children with TB do not access quality care and only a quarter of children under the age of 5 in TB-affected households currently receive preventive treatment.</p><h2>Tackling drug resistance</h2><p>Drug resistance remains another impediment to ending TB. In 2018, there were an estimated half a million new cases of drug-resistant TB. Only one in three of these people was enrolled in treatment. </p><p>New WHO guidance aims to improve treatment of multidrug resistant TB, by shifting to fully oral regimens that are safer and more effective. The guidance is part of a larger package of steps released on 24 March 2019 -- World TB Day -- to help countries speed up efforts to end the disease.  </p><p>“WHO is working closely with countries, partners and civil society to accelerate the TB response,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Global TB Programme. “Working across different sectors is key if we are to finally get the better of this terrible disease and save lives.” </p><h2>Funding</h2><p>The fight against TB remains chronically underfunded. WHO estimates the shortfall for TB prevention and care in 2019 at US$3.3 billion. International funding (which is critical for many low- and middle-income countries) amounts to US$0.9 billion in 2019, with 73% coming through the Global Fund. Last week’s <a href=\"/news/item/10-10-2019-who-welcomes-vital-new-funding-for-the-global-fund\">successful replenishment of the Global Fund</a> will be critical to strengthen international financing.</p><p>The largest bilateral donor is the US government, which provides almost 50% of total international donor funding for TB when combined with funds channeled through and allocated by the Global Fund. </p><p>There is an urgent need for funding of TB research and development, with an annual shortfall of US$1.2 billion. Priority needs include a new vaccine or effective preventive drug treatment; rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests; and safer, simpler, shorter drug regimens to treat TB.</p><p>“To accelerate TB research and innovation, WHO is developing a global strategy,” adds Kasaeva. “We are collaborating with academia, research networks such as the BRICS TB Research network, and partners including the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, UNITAID and others in a quest to bring innovations into practice to break the trajectory of the TB epidemic”.</p><h2>Notes for editors</h2><h3>Global TB targets:</h3><p><strong>SDG 3.3 </strong>includes a target of ending the TB epidemic by 2030</p><p><strong>The World Health Assembly-approved Global TB Strategy </strong>aims for a 90 per cent reduction in TB deaths and an 80 per cent reduction in the TB incidence rate by 2030 compared with 2015 levels.

Last month, the world’s leaders signalled their readiness to make that choice.  Now it’s time to turn those commitments into health results,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.</p><p>He added: “Parliamentarians have a vital role to play in making this happen. Because it’s parliamentarians who pass laws and allocate funding. It’s parliaments who , keep government accountable for the commitments it’s made and who forge  the partnerships that help countries make universal health coverage a reality.”</p><p>Today’s Resolution calls on parliaments and parliamentarians to “take all possible measures to achieve UHC”, stressing the need for robust legal frameworks and the need to allocate adequate resources.</p><p>Like the UN declaration, it highlights the importance of assuring strong primary health care – the provision of essential health services at the community level –  and strengthening health systems. It also emphasizes the role strong health systems and services play in assuring global health security. Only when  the most vulnerable groups can obtain health care, can a country protect its people and ensure that outbreaks do not turn into epidemics.The resolution includes a strong focus on women, children and adolescent health including sexual and reproductive health as a key component of UHC.</p><p>The Resolution ends with a request to WHO to work with the IPU and other partners to support the implementation of the resolution at the global, regional and country levels and to monitor progress.</p><p>“The resolution highlights the power of the collaboration between IPU and WHO, and builds on the Memorandum of Understanding we both signed  in October 2018,” added Dr Tedros.</p><h2>Notes to editors:</h2><p>In September 2019 during the UN General Assembly, WHO and 11 partner organizations launched, <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"/publications/i/item/9789241516433\"><em>Stronger Collaboration, Better Health</em>: <em>Global Action Plan for Healthy Living and Well-Being for All</em></a>.

Including eye care in national health plans and essential packages of care is an important part of every country’s journey towards universal health coverage.”</p>\n<p>Dr Tedros adds: “It is unacceptable that 65 million people are blind or have impaired sight when their vision could have been corrected overnight with a cataract operation, or that over 800 million struggle in everyday activities because they lack access to a pair of glasses.”</p>\n<p>Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. </p>\n<p>Other main findings of the report include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The burden of eye conditions and vision impairment is not borne equally: it is often far greater in people living in rural areas, those with low incomes, women, older people, people with disabilities, ethnic minorities and indigenous populations. </li>\n<li>The unmet need of distance vision impairment in low- and middle-income regions is estimated to be four times higher than in high-income regions.</li>\n<li>Low- and middle-income regions of western and eastern sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have rates of blindness that are eight times higher than in all high-income countries. Rates of cataract and trachomatous trichiasis are higher among women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</li>\n<li>US$14.3 billion is needed to address the backlog of 1 billion people living with vision impairment or blindness due to short and far sightedness, and cataracts.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<strong><br clear=\"all\"/>\n</strong>\n<p><strong>Main causes of rising cases of vision impairment</strong></p>\n<p>Eye conditions that can cause vision impairment and blindness – such as cataract, trachoma and refractive error – are the main focus of national prevention and other eye care strategies. But eye conditions that do not typically impair vision, including dry eye and conjunctivitis, must not be overlooked as they are among the main reasons for people to seek eye health care services in all countries, the report states.</p>\n<p>The combination of a growing and ageing population will significantly increase the total number of people with eye conditions and vision impairment, since prevalence increases with age.</p>\n<p>Other main drivers of the most common eye conditions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Myopia (near-sightedness): <strong>Increased time spent indoors</strong>  and increased “near work” activities are leading to more people suffering from myopia.

Nearly all people with diabetes will have some form of retinopathy in their lifetimes.

    "lead": "Globally, 219 million cases of malaria were reported in 2018, and an estimated 435 000 people, including 260 000 African children, died from malaria in 2017. Scale up of WHO-recommended preventive measures resulted in a substantial decline in malaria morbidity and mortality between 2000 and 2015. However, in 2015 and 2016, progress with malaria control stalled and started to reverse, with an upswing in malaria cases, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. A malaria vaccine such as RTS,S has the potential to help get malaria control back on track, and may prove to be an important addition to current control tools.

    "content_html": "<div><p style=\"text-align:left;\">The twenty-second meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director General on 16 September 2019 at WHO headquarters with members, advisers and invited Member States attending via teleconference, supported by the WHO secretariat.  </p><p>The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV).  The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations.  The following IHR States Parties provided an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 14 May 2019: Afghanistan, Benin, Central African Republic (CAR), China, Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), Ghana, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan and Somalia.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Wild poliovirus</strong></p><p>The Committee is gravely concerned by the significant further increase in WPV1 cases globally to 73 in 2019 year to date, compared to 15 for the same period in 2018, with most of the increase due to the ongoing outbreaks in Pakistan.  In Pakistan transmission continues to be widespread, as indicated by both AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) surveillance and environmental sampling, although the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was of particular concern.  The increasing refusal by individuals and communities to accept vaccination is a serious setback to eradication.  The committee was very concerned about the current status of the management of the polio program in Pakistan, but understood that steps are being taken to get the program back on track.</p><p>Highlighting these concerns, the committee noted that based on sequencing of viruses, there were new and recent instances of international spread of viruses from Pakistan to Afghanistan, in addition to the earlier reported exportation of virus to Iran (but without further transmission.  The resumption of WPV1 international spread between Pakistan and Afghanistan suggests that rising transmission in Pakistan correlates with increasing risk of WPV1 exportation beyond the single epidemiological block formed by the two countries. </p><p>In Afghanistan, the deteriorating security situation has seriously hampered progress towards global polio eradication.  Inaccessible and missed children particularly in the Southern Region mean there is a large and growing cohort of susceptible children in this part of Afghanistan.  The risk of a major upsurge of cases is growing, with other parts of the country that have been free of WPV1 for some time now at risk of outbreaks. This would again increase the risk of international spread.  Major efforts must be made to improve access if eradication efforts are going to progress.</p><p>The Committee noted the continued cooperation and coordination between Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border and welcomed the all-age vaccination now being taken at key border points between the two countries.  The committee was concerned that after five years of vaccinating travellers as a means to limit the risk of international spread, there was some evidence of complacency about this aspect of the program, particularly at airports, and this must be addressed to prevent  further international spread.</p><p>In Nigeria, there has been no WPV1 detected for three years, and it is possible that the African Region may be certified WPV free in early 2020.  However, this will require careful assessment of the risk of missed transmission in inaccessible areas of Borno, and in other countries in the region where confidence in surveillance is lacking.  The Committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity. <br/><br/></p><p><strong>Vaccine derived poliovirus</strong></p><p>The multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks on the continent of Africa are now at unprecedented levels and need to be treated by countries as a national public health emergency.  The committee welcomed the decision by the Director-General to write to all infected countries to highlight the gravity of the situation of a cVDPV2 outbreak.</p><p>The multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks with international spread on the continent of Africa are very concerning especially given the widening mucosal immunity gap in young children.  Outbreaks in Niger, Cameroon, Benin, Ghana and Ethiopia were seeded by exportation from Nigeria in west Africa and Somalia in the Horn of Africa.  Furthermore, the global nature of the risk is highlighted by the appearance of cVDPV2 in China and the Philippines, with undetected transmission for about a year in China, and much longer in the Philippines.  Use of mOPV2 is now clearly demonstrated as a source of cVDPV2 emergence in areas where the vaccine has been used. In addition, cVDPV2 has emerged in parts of countries distant from the  mOPV2 implementation area and in neighbouring countries that have not used mOPV2, presumed to be due to the spread of Sabin-like viruses.  To mitigate these risks, more attention will be needed to ensure sufficient coverage in the target populations through good quality campaigns, rigorous management of unused mOPV2 vials, better education of health care workers and care-givers to avoid spreading Sabin2 viruses, and urgent steps to ensure early detection of virus.  Countries particularly in sub-Saharan Africa must be on alert and prepared for importation of cVDPV2, review response arrangements, even in countries with good routine immunization and no history of mOPV2 use.</p><p>The cVDPV1 outbreaks in Myanmar, PNG and Indonesia and cVDPV3 in Somalia highlight the gaps in population immunity due to pockets of persistently low routine immunization coverage in many parts of the world.  However, these outbreaks seem to pose a lesser risk of international spread as bOPV vaccine is already available in these countries, is available for traveller vaccination, and global population immunity is far higher for type 1 and 3 than for type 2.  It appears likely there has been missed transmission of cVDPV1 in Indonesia although there no evidence so far that the virus has spread beyond Papua.  Large inaccessible areas of Somalia are a significant constraint on achieving interruption of transmission, exacerbated by large nomadic population movements.</p><p>The committee noted that routine immunization was weak in all infected countries with consequent  low coverage in many areas of these countries.</p><p>Inaccessibility is a major risk to interruption of transmission in Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Afghanistan, and conflict in these countries and DR Congo makes control of these outbreaks even more challenging.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Rising risk of WPV1 international spread:</span> The progress made in recent years appears to have reversed, with the committee’s assessment that the risk of international spread is at the highest point since 2014 when the PHEIC was declared. This risk assessment is based on the following:</p><ul><li>the WPV1 exportation in 2019 from Pakistan to Iran and to Afghanistan;</li><li>ongoing rise in the number of WPV1 cases and positive environmental samples in Pakistan, and to a lesser extent Afghanistan;</li><li>the quickly increasing cohort of unvaccinated children in Afghanistan, with the risk of a major outbreak imminent if nothing is done to access these children;</li><li>the urgent need to overhaul the program in Pakistan, which although already commencing, will take some time to lead to more effective control of transmission and ultimately eradication;</li><li>increasing community and individual resistance to the polio program.</li><li>Possible fatigue in implementing traveller immunization at airports increasing the risk of international spread beyond Pakistan and Afghanistan</li></ul><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Rising risk of cVDPV spread:</span> The clearly documented spread of cVDPV2 from Nigeria to Niger, Cameroon, Benin, and Ghana, and from Somalia to Ethiopia demonstrate the unusual nature of the current situation, as international spread of cVDPV in the past has been very infrequent. The emergence of cVDPV2 in CAR and Angola, which had not used mOPV2, raises further concern. The risk of new outbreaks in new countries is considered extremely high, even probable. The outbreak of cVDPV1 in Myanmar on the border with Thailand in a population unreachable by the central government for immunization is an example of how border populations in countries affected by conflict can pose a special risk.</p><ul><li>Falling PV2 immunity: Global population mucosal immunity to type 2 polioviruses (PV2) continues to fall, as the cohort of children born after OPV2 withdrawal grows, exacerbated by poor coverage with IPV particularly in some of the cVDPV infected countries.</li><li>Protracted outbreaks: The difficulty in rapidly controlling cVDPV outbreaks in Nigeria and DR Congo is another risk.</li><li>Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. </li><li>Surveillance gaps: The appearance of highly diverged VDPVs in the Philippines, Somalia and Indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance, heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries. Furthermore, the missed transmission in China for a year illustrates that even countries with generally good surveillance can miss VDPV transmission.</li><li>Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger, Somalia, Myanmar and Indonesia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.</li><li>Population movement: The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks. A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Risk categories</strong></p><p>The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:</p><ul><li>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread.</li><li>States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread.</li><li>States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.</li></ul><p>Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:</p><ul><li>Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.</li><li>Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period</li><li>These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (e.g. Borno)</li></ul><p>Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report.</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">TEMPORARY RECOMMENDATIONS</span></strong></p><p><strong>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread</strong></p><p><strong>WPV1</strong>                                                                                                        <strong> </strong></p><ul><li>Afghanistan (most recent detection 27 August 2019)                                                </li><li>Pakistan (most recent detection 26 August 2019)</li><li>Nigeria (most recent detection 27 Sept 2016) </li></ul><p><strong>cVDPV1</strong></p><ul><li>Papua New Guinea (most recent detection 7 November 2018)</li><li>Indonesia (most recent detection 13 February 2019)</li><li>Myanmar (most recent detection 23 July 2019)</li></ul><p><strong>cVDPV3</strong></p><ul><li>Somalia (most recent detection 7 Sept 2018)</li></ul><p>These countries should:</p><ul><li><p>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. &gt; four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that such travellers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.</p></li><li><p>Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination.

style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Additional considerations</span></p><p>The committee urged all countries, particularly those in Africa, be on high alert for the possibility of cVDPV2 importation and respond to such importations as a national public health emergency.  This means countries should ensure polio surveillance can rapidly detect cVDPV2, and plans are in place to respond rapidly with well planned and executed mOPV2 campaigns, and with strict procedures to ensure unused vials are returned and managed so that inappropriate or accidental use is avoided.  Campaign communications need to address issues around avoiding spreading excreted Sabin-like viruses through good hygiene.  Noting that most cVDPV2 outbreaks have been assessed as grade 2 according to the WHO Health Emergency Program framework, in some circumstances it may be more appropriate to make it grade 3.  The committee noted the recommendations of the SAGE Polio Working Group and reinforced their recommendations that new capacity to ensure mOPV2 supply is of critical importance, and endorsed that Emergency Use Listing be considered to accelerate the availability of novel OPV2 that is in development.  The committee urged the GPEI and donor partners to ensure that funding of outbreak response was sufficient and mechanisms to relay funds to infected districts should be urgently implemented reflecting the urgency of the response.</p><p>The committee noted that as the risk of international spread of WPV1 was the highest since 2014, the risk of exportation events from Pakistan and Afghanistan through air travel was also greater than in recent years and urged both countries to ensure adequate funding and monitoring of airport and travel vaccination was in place.  While travel vaccination may not be a major priority in terms of impact on the control of WPV1 in the two countries, it represents a critical control point in preventing international spread.</p><p>Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 25 September 2019 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 25 September 2019.</p>",

          "Additional considerations",
          "The committee urged all countries, particularly those in Africa, be on high alert for the possibility of cVDPV2 importation and respond to such importations as a national public health emergency.  This means countries should ensure polio surveillance can rapidly detect cVDPV2, and plans are in place to respond rapidly with well planned and executed mOPV2 campaigns, and with strict procedures to ensure unused vials are returned and managed so that inappropriate or accidental use is avoided.  Campaign communications need to address issues around avoiding spreading excreted Sabin-like viruses through good hygiene.  Noting that most cVDPV2 outbreaks have been assessed as grade 2 according to the WHO Health Emergency Program framework, in some circumstances it may be more appropriate to make it grade 3.  The committee noted the recommendations of the SAGE Polio Working Group and reinforced their recommendations that new capacity to ensure mOPV2 supply is of critical importance, and endorsed that Emergency Use Listing be considered to accelerate the availability of novel OPV2 that is in development.  The committee urged the GPEI and donor partners to ensure that funding of outbreak response was sufficient and mechanisms to relay funds to infected districts should be urgently implemented reflecting the urgency of the response.",
          "The committee noted that as the risk of international spread of WPV1 was the highest since 2014, the risk of exportation events from Pakistan and Afghanistan through air travel was also greater than in recent years and urged both countries to ensure adequate funding and monitoring of airport and travel vaccination was in place.  While travel vaccination may not be a major priority in terms of impact on the control of WPV1 in the two countries, it represents a critical control point in preventing international spread.",
          "Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 25 September 2019 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 25 September 2019."

      "Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.",
      "Surveillance gaps: The appearance of highly diverged VDPVs in the Philippines, Somalia and Indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance, heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries. Furthermore, the missed transmission in China for a year illustrates that even countries with generally good surveillance can miss VDPV transmission.",
      "Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger, Somalia, Myanmar and Indonesia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.",
      "Population movement: The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks.

Demand from countries for the Global Action Plan is growing. “Achieving the health-related SDG goals is key\r\n        for Nepal.

The right collaboration can become a lever for wider primary health care and, by extension, universal health coverage. That is why this new plan is so important, bringing together some of the biggest players in global health\r\nto create the conditions for better health and well-being for all.”\r\n<p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Dr Muhammad Ali Pate, Director - The Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents (The GFF)</strong></p>“The Global Financing Facility supports the Global Action Plan because it recognizes that collaboration needs to take\r\nplace at the country level and must start from a country’s specific needs and priorities.

In the AIDS response, community engagement and ownership have resulted in an increase in the uptake of HIV prevention and treatment services, a reduction in stigma and discrimination and in the protection of human rights.\r\nEmpowering communities will be central to achieving good health for all.”   \r\n<p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Achim Steiner, Administrator - United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)</strong></p><p>“The Global Action Plan is the kind of system-wide partnership that can help countries to accelerate progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and realize the promise of health and well-being for all.”</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Natalia Kanem, Executive Director - United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)</strong></p>“Ensuring that health systems can deliver sexual and reproductive health services to all women and young people is integral to ensuring good health and\r\nwell-being across the life course.

This vaccine, which is given as a 2-dose course, 56 days apart, will be provided under approved protocols to targeted at-risk populations in areas that do not have active Ebola transmission as an additional tool to extend protection against the virus.“The DRC authorities, in deciding to deploy the second experimental vaccine to extend protection against this deadly virus, have once again shown leadership and their determination to end this outbreak as soon as possible,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.“The evaluation of the second Ebola vaccine will help ensure that we have potentially an additional tool to prevent the expansion of the outbreak and also a potential tool to protect populations before outbreaks hit areas at risk,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s Regional Director for Africa.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine will complement the current vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV-GP, manufactured by Merck), which has proven highly effective and safe, and which has helped protect thousands of lives. The Merck vaccine will continue to be provided to all people at high risk of Ebola infection including those who have been in contact with a person confirmed to have Ebola, all contacts of contacts, and others determined to be at high risk of contracting Ebola. To date over 223,000 people have received this vaccination during the current outbreak.In May 2019, WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) reviewed use of vaccines in the ongoing Ebola outbreak and issuedrecommendations. These included adjusting the dose of the Merck vaccine, evaluating a second vaccine under appropriate protocols, changing strategies when insecurity makes it difficult to reach people – such as providing pop-up vaccination stations -- and increasing the number of people vaccinated within communities with ongoing transmission, sometimes vaccinating whole villages.“In everything we do, we are driven by science,” Dr Tedros said. “The advice we were given by SAGE in May has been applied, always taking into account community needs and preferences, as we know this will make the approach more effective. The changes made have saved thousands of lives in this outbreak.”New therapeutics and better use of treatment protocols have also saved many lives. “To date, 973 people have been successfully treated and released from Ebola treatment centres, and we expect that the 1000thsurvivor will return to his or her community in the coming weeks,” Dr Moeti said.",

It warns that if current trends continue, <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" name=\"_Hlk19609018\">up to 5 billion people will still be unable to access health care in 2030 </a>– the deadline world leaders have set for achieving universal health coverage. Most of those people are poor and already disadvantaged. </p><div><h2>Primary health care key to health for all</h2></div><p>“If we are really serious about achieving universal health coverage and improving people’s lives, we must get serious about primary health care,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “That means providing essential health services like immunization, antenatal care, healthy lifestyle advice as close to home as possible – and making sure people do not have to pay for this care out of their own pockets.”</p><p>Investing an additional USD200 billion a year on scaling up primary health care across low and middle-income countries would potentially save 60 million lives, increase average life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030, and contribute significantly to socio-economic development. It would represent about 3% increase on the USD7.5 trillion already spent on health globally each year. </p><p>Most of that funding would come from countries themselves. The report says that most countries can scale up primary health care using domestic resources – either by increasing public spending on health in general, or by reallocating spending towards primary health care – or by doing both.  At present, most countries are underinvesting in primary health care.</p><p>But for the poorest countries, including many affected by conflict, this may not be feasible. These countries will continue to require assistance from outside. This funding must be carefully targeted to result in a lasting improvement to health systems and services – via a systematic strengthening of primary health care countrywide.</p><div><h2>Accelerate scale-up of services</h2><p>Countries must also renew efforts to scale up service coverage countrywide. Although coverage has increased steadily since 2000, progress has slowed down in recent years. Most increases have occurred in lower income countries, but these countries are still lagging behind. The biggest health service gaps are in the poorest countries and those affected by conflict.</p></div><p>“Too many women and children continue to die from easily preventable and treatable causes simply because they can’t get the care they need to survive,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “By working with communities to provide primary health care to the poorest and the most vulnerable, we can reach the last mile and save millions of lives.”</p><p>Coverage is generally lower in rural areas than in towns.

    "content_html": "<div><p>More women and their children are surviving today than ever before, according to new child and maternal mortality estimates released today by United Nations groups* led by UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p><p>Since 2000, child deaths have reduced by nearly half and maternal deaths by over one-third, mostly due to improved access to affordable, quality health services.</p><p>“In countries that provide everyone with safe, affordable, high-quality health services, women and babies survive and thrive,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. “This is the power of universal health coverage.”  </p><p>Still, the new estimates reveal that 6.2 million children under 15 years died in 2018, and over 290 000 women died due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth in 2017. Of the total child deaths, 5.3 million occurred in the first 5 years,\r\n        with almost half of these in the first month of life.</p><p>Women and newborns are most vulnerable during and immediately after childbirth. An estimated 2.8 million pregnant women and newborns die every year, or 1 every 11 seconds, mostly of preventable causes, the new estimates say.</p><p>Children face the highest risk of dying in the first month, especially if they are born too soon or too small, have complications during birth, congenital defects, or contract infections. About a third of these deaths occur within the first day and\r\n        nearly three quarters in the first week alone.</p><p>“Around the world, birth is a joyous occasion. Yet, every 11 seconds, a birth is a family tragedy,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “A skilled pair of hands to help mothers and newborns around the time of birth, along\r\n        with clean water, adequate nutrition, basic medicines and vaccines, can make the difference between life and death. We must do all it takes to invest in universal health coverage to save these precious lives.”</p><h2>Vast inequalities worldwide</h2><p>The estimates also show vast inequalities worldwide, with women and children in sub-Saharan Africa facing a substantially higher risk of death than in all other regions.</p><p>Levels of maternal deaths are nearly 50 times higher for women in sub-Saharan Africa and their babies are 10 times more likely to die in their first month of life, compared to high-income countries.</p></div><p>In 2018, 1 in 13 children in sub-Saharan Africa died before their fifth birthday– this is 15 times higher than the risk a child faces in Europe, where just 1 in 196 children aged less than 5 die.</p><p>Women in sub-Saharan Africa face a 1 in 37 lifetime risk of dying during pregnancy or childbirth. By comparison, the lifetime risk for a woman in Europe is 1 in 6500. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia account for around 80% of global maternal and child\r\n    deaths. Countries in conflict or humanitarian crisis often have weak health systems that prevent women and children from accessing essential lifesaving care.</p><h2>Progress linked to universal health coverage</h2><p>The world has made substantial progress in reducing child and maternal mortality. Since 1990, there has been a 56% reduction in deaths of children under 15 years from 14.2 million deaths to 6.2 million in 2018. Countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia\r\n    have made the most progress, with an 80% decline in under-five deaths.</p><p>And from 2000 to 2017, the maternal mortality ratio declined by 38%. Southern Asia has made the greatest improvements in maternal survival with a nearly 60% reduction in the maternal mortality ratio since 2000.</p><p>Belarus, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Malawi, Morocco, Mongolia, Rwanda, Timor-Leste and Zambia are some of the countries that have shown substantial progress in reducing child or maternal mortality. Success has been due to political will to improve\r\n    access to quality health care by investing in the health workforce, introducing free care for pregnant women and children and supporting family planning. Many of these countries focus on primary health care and universal health coverage.</p><h2>Note to editors:</h2><p>For children who survive the first month, infectious diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria account for the most deaths globally. In older children, injuries, including road traffic injuries and drowning become important causes of death and\r\n    disability.</p><p>Maternal deaths are caused by obstetric complications such as high blood pressure during pregnancy and severe bleeding or infections during or after childbirth; and increasingly due to an existing disease or condition aggravated by the effects of pregnancy. </p><h2>Global targets:</h2><p>The global target for ending preventable maternal mortality (SDG target 3.1) is to reduce global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to less than 70 per 100 000 live births by 2030. The world will fall short of this target by more than 1 million lives if the\r\n    current pace of progress continues.</p><p>The SDG target (3.2) for ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under age 5 is to reduce neonatal mortality to at least 12 per 1000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least 25 per 1000 live births. In 2018, 121 countries had already achieved\r\n    this under-five mortality rate. Among the remaining 74, 53 countries will need to accelerate progress to reach the SDG target on child survival by 2030.<br/>_____________________________________________________<br/><br/>Note that regions named\r\n    in this release are the <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2019/regional-groups/\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations SDG Regions</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Download photos and broll from UNICEF <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AMZIFJV9FKN\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>Download the reports, fact sheets, photos and soundbites from WHO <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://who.canto.global/v/MediaAssets\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</strong><br/><br/>* These estimates are from two UN reports as outlined below:</p><p><strong>About the child mortality estimates</strong></p><p><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.unicef.org/reports/levels-and-trends-child-mortality-report-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Levels and trends in child mortality: Report 2019</a></p><p>The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) is led by UNICEF and includes WHO, the World Bank Group and the United Nations Population Division. </p><p>UN IGME was formed in 2004 to share data on child mortality improve methods for child mortality estimation, report on progress towards child survival goals and enhance country capacity to produce timely and properly assessed estimates of child mortality.\r\n    <br/><a href=\"/data/maternal-newborn-child-adolescent-ageing\" target=\"_blank\">More information </a>\n</p><p><strong>About the maternal mortality estimates</strong></p><p><a href=\"/publications/i/item/9789241516488\">Trends in maternal mortality: 2000 to 2017</a></p><p>The Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG) is led by WHO and includes UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group and the United Nations Population Division.

There has been a global decline in stunting (low height-for-age ratio): between 1990 and 2018, the prevalence of stunting in children aged under 5 years declined from 39.2% to 21.9%, or from 252.5 million to 149.0 million children, though progress has been much slower in Africa and South-East Asia. </p><p>Obesity, however, is on the rise. The prevalence of children considered overweight rose from 4.8% to 5.9% between 1990 and 2018, an increase of over 9 million children. Adult overweight and obesity are also rising in nearly every region and country, with 1.9 billion people overweight in 2016, of which 650 million (13% of the world’s population) are obese.</p><p>Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes; cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke); musculoskeletal disorders (especially osteoarthritis – a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints); and some cancers (including endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and colon).</p><p>An increased focus on nutrition by the health services is key to addressing both aspects of the “double-burden” of malnutrition. The Essential Nutrition Actions publication is a compilation of nutrition actions to address this “double burden” of underweight and overweight and provide a tool for countries to integrate nutrition interventions into their national health and development policies.</p><div><br clear=\"all\"/><hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"/><div id=\"ftn1\"><p><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/reinfeldem/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/H3B1HB2Q/50%20Press%20release%20Nutrition.docx#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>World Bank:  Source: Shekar M, Kakietek J, D'Alimonte M, Sullivan L , Walters D, Rogers H, Dayton Eberwein J, Soe-Lin S, Hecht R.

          "Health services must integrate a stronger focus on ensuring optimum nutrition at each stage of a person’s life, according to a new report released by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is  estimated that the right investment in nutrition could save 3.7 million lives by 2025 [1] .",
          "“In order to provide quality health services and achieve Universal Health Coverage, nutrition should be positioned as one of the cornerstones of essential health packages,” said Dr Naoko Yamamoto, Assistant Director-General at WHO. “We also need better food environments which allow all people to consume healthy diets.”",
          "Essential health packages in all settings need to contain robust nutrition components but countries will need to decide which interventions best support their national health policies, strategies and plans.",
          "Key interventions include: providing iron and folic acid supplements as part of antenatal care; delaying umbilical cord clamping to ensure babies receive important nutrients they need after birth; promoting, protecting and supporting breastfeeding; providing advice on diet such as limiting the intake of free sugars [2] in adults and children and limiting salt intake to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.",
          "Investment in nutrition actions will help countries get closer to their goal of achieving universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals. It can also help the economy, with every US$1 spent by donors on basic nutrition programmes returning US$ 16 to the local economy [3] .",
          "The world has made progress in nutrition but major challenges still exist. There has been a global decline in stunting (low height-for-age ratio): between 1990 and 2018, the prevalence of stunting in children aged under 5 years declined from 39.2% to 21.9%, or from 252.5 million to 149.0 million children, though progress has been much slower in Africa and South-East Asia.",
          "Obesity, however, is on the rise. The prevalence of children considered overweight rose from 4.8% to 5.9% between 1990 and 2018, an increase of over 9 million children. Adult overweight and obesity are also rising in nearly every region and country, with 1.9 billion people overweight in 2016, of which 650 million (13% of the world’s population) are obese.",
          "Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes; cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke); musculoskeletal disorders (especially osteoarthritis – a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints); and some cancers (including endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and colon).",
          "An increased focus on nutrition by the health services is key to addressing both aspects of the “double-burden” of malnutrition. The Essential Nutrition Actions publication is a compilation of nutrition actions to address this “double burden” of underweight and overweight and provide a tool for countries to integrate nutrition interventions into their national health and development policies."

The 18-member committee also announced an online consultation on the governance of genome editing.  </p>\n<p>Addressing the second meeting of the committee on effective governance and oversight of human genome editing, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s Director-General, said, “Since our last meeting, some scientists have announced their wish to edit the genome of embryos and bring them to term. This illustrates how important our work is, and how urgent. New genome editing technologies hold great promise and hope for those who suffer from diseases we once thought untreatable. But some uses of these technologies also pose unique and unprecedented challenges – ethical, social, regulatory and technical.”</p>\n<p>Dr Tedros emphasized that countries should not allow any further work on human germline genome editing in human clinical applications until the technical and ethical implications have been properly considered.</p>\n<p>Accepting the recommendation of the Committee, WHO announced plans for an initial phase of the registry using the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), a WHO entity. This phase will include somatic and germline clinical trials.

          "A WHO expert advisory committee has approved the first phase of a new global registry to track research on human genome editing. The 18-member committee also announced an online consultation on the governance of genome editing.",
          "Addressing the second meeting of the committee on effective governance and oversight of human genome editing, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s Director-General, said, “Since our last meeting, some scientists have announced their wish to edit the genome of embryos and bring them to term. This illustrates how important our work is, and how urgent. New genome editing technologies hold great promise and hope for those who suffer from diseases we once thought untreatable. But some uses of these technologies also pose unique and unprecedented challenges – ethical, social, regulatory and technical.”",
          "Dr Tedros emphasized that countries should not allow any further work on human germline genome editing in human clinical applications until the technical and ethical implications have been properly considered.",
          "Accepting the recommendation of the Committee, WHO announced plans for an initial phase of the registry using the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), a WHO entity. This phase will include somatic and germline clinical trials. In order to ensure that the registry is fit for purpose and transparent, the committee will engage with a broad range of stakeholders on how it will operate. The Committee called on all relevant research and development initiatives to register their trials. To enhance the development of a global governance framework for human genome editing, the Committee will undertake online consultations and in-person engagement.",

Building strong systems is what will protect people, communities and the world.“With a population of 80 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has more than 4 million displaced and is home to the world’s second largest food crisis with 13 million people food insecure. Since January 2019, there have been outbreaks of cholera (15,331 cases, 287 deaths), measles (161,397 cases, 3,117 deaths) and malaria, the leading cause of death in the DRC, which kills more than48,000people every year.Dr Tedros will accompany UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on his mission to the country this weekend, along with senior officials, including Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.“We are working in an incredibly complex environment, but thanks to support from donors and actions taken by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, we have saved thousands of lives,” said Dr Moeti. “We strive towards a much more united approach and call on NGOs and UN partners to continue to accelerate all activities. Everyone has a role to play and we each must be accountable for what we signed up to do, only then will we end this outbreak.”The outbreak was declared on 1 August 2018. As of 27 August, there have been 2,997 cases of Ebola, with 1,998 deaths and 893 survivors. Most of the cases are in North Kivu province. In the past 10 weeks, an average of 80 people per week are sickened by the virus.More than 200,000 people have been vaccinated against Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, along with health and frontline workers in Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda and Burundi. Two therapeutic treatments being used in the country as part of a clinical trial have shown to save 9 of 10 lives if used at the right time.More than 89 million screenings within the country and at international borders have helped control the spread, by identifying and providing care to anyone with symptoms.

But a new WHO report shows many countries are still not adequately implementing policies, including helping people quit tobacco, that can save lives from tobacco. </p>\n<p>The seventh WHO Report on the global tobacco epidemic analyses national efforts to implement the most effective measures from the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) that are proven to reduce demand for tobacco.</p>\n<p>These measures, like the “MPOWER” interventions, have been shown to save lives and reduce costs from averted healthcare expenditure. The MPOWER report was launched in 2007 to promote government action on six tobacco control strategies in-line with the WHO FCTC to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor tobacco use and prevention policies.</li>\n<li>Protect people from tobacco smoke.</li>\n<li>Offer help to quit tobacco use.</li>\n<li>Warn people about the dangers of tobacco.</li>\n<li>Enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship.</li>\n<li>Raise taxes on tobacco.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tobacco cessation services must be stepped up</h2>\n<p>The focus of the latest report is on the progress countries have made to help tobacco users quit. It is being launched today in Brazil, a country that has become the second, after Turkey, to fully implement all the MPOWER measures at the highest level of achievement.</p>\n<p>Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said governments should implement cessation services as part of efforts to ensure universal health coverage for their citizens.</p>\n<p>“Quitting tobacco is one of the best things any person can do for their own health,” said Dr Tedros. “The MPOWER package gives governments the practical tools to help people kick the habit, adding years to their life and life to their years.”</p>\n<p>Progress is being made, with 2.4 billion people living in countries now providing comprehensive cessation services (2 billion more than in 2007). But only 23 countries are providing cessation services at the best-practice level, making it the most under-implemented MPOWER measure in terms of number of countries offering full coverage.</p>\n<p>Tobacco cessation services include national toll-free quit lines, “mCessation” services to reach larger populations via mobile phones, counselling by primary health care providers and cost-covered nicotine replacement therapy.</p>\n<p>Michael R. Bloomberg, WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries  and founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies, said the report shows government-led efforts to help people quit tobacco work when properly implemented.</p>\n<p>“More countries are making tobacco control a priority and saving lives, but there’s still much more work to be done,” said Mr Bloomberg. “The WHO’s new report shines a spotlight on global efforts to help people quit using tobacco and it details some of our most important gains.”</p>\n<p>The report, funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, showed that while only 23 countries have implemented cessation support policies at the highest level, 116 more provide fully or partially cost-covered services in some or most health facilities, and another 32 offer services but do not cost-cover them, demonstrating a high level of public demand for support to quit.</p>\n<p>Tobacco use has also declined proportionately in most countries, but population growth means the total number of people using tobacco has remained stubbornly high. Currently, there are an estimated 1.1 billion smokers, around 80% of whom live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p>\n<h2>Editor’s note</h2>\n<p>Since the last report, issued in 2017, the WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic, 2019, also finds that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>36 countries have introduced one or more MPOWER measures at the highest level of achievement.</li>\n<li>Over half of the world’s population – 3.9 billion people living in 91 countries – benefit from large graphic pack warnings featuring all recommended characteristics, making it the MPOWER measure with both the highest population coverage and the most countries covered.</li>\n<li>14 countries have implemented large graphic warning laws at best practice level, making it the MPOWER policy with the greatest growth in terms of country uptake during the last two years.</li>\n<li>The greatest growth in population coverage was seen in tobacco taxation. The population coverage from this MPOWER policy has almost doubled from 8% in 2016 to 14% in 2018.

    "content_html": "<div>\n<p>Ahead of World Hepatitis Day (28 July), WHO calls on countries to take advantage of recent reductions in the costs of diagnosing and treating viral hepatitis and scale up investments in disease elimination. </p>\n<p>A new study by WHO, published today in <em>Lancet Global Health</em>, has found that investing US$6bn per year in eliminating hepatitis in 67 low- and middle-income countries  would avert 4.5 million premature deaths by 2030, and more than 26 million deaths beyond that target date.</p>\n<p>A total of US$58.7 billion is needed to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat in these 67 countries by 2030. This means reducing new hepatitis infections by 90% and deaths by 65%.</p>\n<p>“Today 80% of people living with hepatitis can’t get the services they need to prevent, test for and treat the disease,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “On World Hepatitis Day, we’re calling for bold political leadership, with investments to match. We call on all countries to integrate services for hepatitis into benefit packages as part of their journey towards universal health coverage.”</p>\n<p>By investing in diagnostic tests and medicines for treating hepatitis B and C now, countries can save lives and reduce costs related to long-term care of cirrhosis and liver cancer that result from untreated hepatitis.</p>\n<p>Some countries are already taking action. The Government of India, for example, has announced that it will offer free testing and treatment for both hepatitis B and C, as part of its universal health coverage plan. This has been facilitated through the reduction in prices of medicines. In India, a hepatitis C cure costs less than US$40 and a year of hepatitis B treatment costs less than US$30. At these prices, hepatitis C cure will result in healthcare cost savings within three years.</p>\n<p>The Government of Pakistan has also been able to procure hepatitis C curative treatment at similarly low prices.

In 2019, 12 out of 18 countries surveyed by WHO reported pre-treatment drug resistance levels exceeding the recommended threshold of 10%. \r\nAll of above findings informed the decision to update the 2019 guidelines.\r\nIn 2019, 82 low- and middle-income countries reported to be transitioning to DTG-based HIV treatment regimens. The new updated recommendations aim to help more countries improve their HIV policies. \r\nAs for any medications, informed choice is important. Every treatment decision needs to be based on an informed discussion with the health provider weighing the benefits and potential risks. \r\nWHO also stresses the importance of providing information and options to help women make an informed choice. To this end WHO has convened an advisory group of women living with HIV from diverse backgrounds to advise on policy issues related to their health, including sexual and reproductive health. WHO highlights the need to continually monitor the risk of neural tube defects associated with DTG.",

There are increased numbers of cases in Butembo and Mabalako; the epicentre has moved from Mabalako to Beni; and there is one imported case in Goma. Factors affecting\r\n            the outbreak include population movement in highly densely populated areas; weak infection and prevention control practices in many health facilities; complex political environment; continued reluctance in the community; and the ongoing unstable\r\n            security situation, which led to the recent murders of two community health workers. More than 70 entry points are being monitored and 75 million screenings have been conducted, with 22 cases detected in this manner. Beni is the main hotspot;\r\n            cases in other areas are decreasing. There are 2512 confirmed or probable cases, including 136 health workers affected, with 40 deaths among them.</p><p>Beni remains the epicentre of the outbreak, with 46% of the cases over the last 3 weeks. Mangina has 18% of the cases, and one new case in Goma came from Beni, with diagnosis confirmed within one hour of the patient’s arrival at a health\r\n            facility. The patient, who was not known to be a contact, traveled to Goma with several other people in a bus. When the vehicle broke down, he went to a health facility via motorbike. He was transferred to an Ebola Treatment Centre, but later\r\n            died. Response to the case in Goma took place within 72 hours.</p><p>Contact tracing was performed, with 75 contacts vaccinated, as well as co-travellers, and family members are being monitored. Surveillance is being reinforced and readiness strengthened.</p><p>15,000 people cross the border from Goma to Rwanda every day, as Goma is an important centre of economic activities with Rwanda. Closing this border would strongly affect the population of Goma and have adverse implications for the response. There\r\n            is a continuing need for increased awareness among the population on the outbreak situation and stronger engagement on health-seeking behaviours. </p><p>The UN Ebola Emergency Response Coordinator gave an update on the situation and efforts to maintain an enabling environment to support outbreak response. He emphasized the need for community engagement and access in all areas, increased multisectoral\r\n            collaboration, and more financial and human resources. Insecurity is the greatest concern, especially after two community health workers were killed last week. Efforts to increase security are underway.</p><p>There is a need to focus both on intervention gaps and the quality of interventions.</p><p>The WHO Secretariat provided details on the latest rapid risk assessment. The Secretariat highlighted the effectiveness of the response; there have been improvements in surveillance and the intensity of virus transmission has been reduced, but\r\n            there has been a geographical extension. There has been no local transmission in these areas, but the continued seeding of virus into new areas represents a constant risk of further amplification.</p></div><div><p>Risk remains very high at national and regional levels but still low at global level. There is cause for concern linked to the recent case in Goma, as the city is a provincial capital with an airport with international flights.<br/></p><p>The intensity of the epidemiological situation is fluctuating, with about 80 new cases reported weekly. There is continued shifting of hotspots and associated risks. There is continued seeding to new or previously cleared areas but thus far without\r\n            sustained local transmission. The recent travel to and from Uganda of a local trader who later died of Ebola demonstrates that the risk remains high for bordering countries. The virus has extended geographically but transmission is not as\r\n            intense. However, the situation in Beni remains difficult and worrisome, especially as the proportion of community deaths has been rising. Ongoing challenges include insecurity, community acceptance, delays in case detection and isolation,\r\n            challenges in contact tracing, a highly mobile population, and multiple routes of transmission. Nosocomial transmission, burial practices, and the use of traditional healers continue to amplify transmission in affected communities. The level\r\n            of preparedness in Goma and priority actions for Rwanda were presented, demonstrating significant improvements across a number of key preparedness pillars (surveillance, Ebola Treatment Centres, etc.). Gaps and challenges remain, specifically\r\n            at the district level.<br/></p><p>The ring vaccination strategy is proving efficient and successful. Issues related to vaccine supply were reviewed. Vaccine supply and availability data were presented and show that vaccine supplies are currently insufficient, thereby necessitating\r\n            the introduction of an adjusted dose. The Secretariat welcomed the increased production planned by Merck, which will effectively double the supply of rVSV-EBOV in 2020. Further, the EVD Working Group of SAGE will monitor vaccine supplies and\r\n            suggest any further dose adjustment that might be required to assure adequate doses until further production is available.<br/></p><h3>Context and Discussion<br/></h3><p>The Committee commended the response to date, under the leadership of the DRC Ministry of Health, and supported by WHO, UN agencies, NGOs and other partners. The response has contributed to limiting the spread and impact of this virus in a difficult\r\n            context in many areas in DRC. The courage and commitment of all frontline workers were specifically praised by the Committee.</p><p>However, the Committee is concerned that a year into the outbreak, there are worrying signs of possible extension of the epidemic. Despite significant improvement in many places, there is concern about potential spread from Goma, even though there\r\n            have been no new cases in that city. The Committee is also concerned by the reinfection and ongoing transmission in Beni, <span style=\"background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\">which has been previously associated with seeding of virus into multiple other locations. Further, the murder of two HCWs demonstrates continued risk for responders owing to the security situation.</span></p></div><div><p>In addition, despite previous recommendations for increased resources, the global community has not contributed sustainable and adequate technical assistance, human or financial resources for outbreak response.<br/></p><h3>Conclusions and Advice<br/></h3><p>It was the view of the Committee that a coordinated international response under the International Health Regulations (2005) is required. Thus, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) under the IHR (2005)\r\n            have been met.<br/></p><p>The Committee discussed the impact of a PHEIC declaration on the response, possible unintended consequences, and how these might be managed. The global community should anticipate possible negative consequences and proactively prevent them from\r\n            occurring, taking into account experience with Ebola in West Africa in 2014. </p><p>The declaration of the PHEIC is not a reflection on the performance of the response team but rather a measure that recognizes the possible increased national and regional risks and the need for intensified and coordinated action to manage them.<br/></p><p>The Committee provided the following advice to the Director-General for his issuance as formal Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005).<br/></p><p>For affected countries: </p><ul><li>Continue to strengthen community awareness, engagement, and participation, including at points of entry, with at-risk populations, in particular to identify and address cultural norms and beliefs that serve as barriers to their full participation\r\n                in the response.</li><li>Continue cross-border screening and screening at main internal roads to ensure that no contacts are missed and enhance the quality of screening through improved sharing of information with surveillance teams.</li><li>Continue to work and enhance coordination with the UN and partners to reduce security threats, mitigate security risks, and create an enabling environment for public health operations as an essential platform for accelerating disease-control\r\n                efforts.\r\n                <div></div></li><li>Strengthen surveillance with a view towards reducing the proportion of community deaths and the time between detection and isolation, and implementing real-time genetic sequencing to better understand the dynamics of disease transmission.</li><li>Optimal vaccine strategies that have maximum impact on curtailing the outbreak, as recommended by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), should be implemented rapidly.</li><li>Strengthen measures to prevent nosocomial infections, including systematic mapping pf health facilities, targeting of IPC interventions and sustain support to those facilities through monitoring and sustained supervision.</li></ul><p>For neighbouring countries:</p><ul><li>At-risk countries should work urgently with partners to improve their preparedness for detecting and managing imported cases, including the mapping of health facilities and active surveillance with zero reporting.</li><li>Countries should continue to map population movements and sociological patterns that can predict risk of disease spread.</li><li>Risk communications and community engagement, especially at points of entry, should be increased.</li><li>At-risk countries should put in place approvals for investigational medicines and vaccines as an immediate priority for preparedness.</li></ul><p>For all States:</p><ul><li>No country should close its borders or place any restrictions on travel and trade. Such measures are usually implemented out of fear and have no basis in science. They push the movement of people and goods to informal border crossings that\r\n                are not monitored, thus increasing the chances of the spread of disease. Most critically, these restrictions can also compromise local economies and negatively affect response operations from a security and logistics perspective.</li><li>National authorities should work with airlines and other transport and tourism\r\n                industries to ensure that they do not exceed WHO’s advice on international traffic.\r\n            </li><li>The Committee does not consider entry screening at airports or other ports of entry outside the region to be necessary.</li></ul><p>The Committee recognizes the shortage of supply of rVSV ZEBOV GP vaccine, despite the commendable efforts of the manufacturer of doubling the supply by 2020, and recommends</p><p>that WHO works with member states and manufacturers to immediately take all measures to increases supplies, including consideration of working with Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs) and transfer of technology.</p><p>The Committee emphasized the importance of continued support by WHO and other national and international partners towards the effective implementation and monitoring of these recommendations.</p><p>Based on this advice, the reports made by the affected State Party, and the currently available information, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 17 July 2019 declared the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic\r\n                    Republic of the Congo a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).</p><p>The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s advice and issued them as Temporary Recommendations under IHR (2005) to reduce the international spread of Ebola, effective 17 July 2019. The Director-General thanked the Committee Members\r\n                    and Advisors for their advice and requested their reassessment of this situation within three months.</p></div>",

Efforts to increase security are underway.There is a need to focus both on intervention gaps and the quality of interventions.The WHO Secretariat provided details on the latest rapid risk assessment. The Secretariat highlighted the effectiveness of the response; there have been improvements in surveillance and the intensity of virus transmission has been reduced, but\r\n            there has been a geographical extension. There has been no local transmission in these areas, but the continued seeding of virus into new areas represents a constant risk of further amplification.Risk remains very high at national and regional levels but still low at global level. There is cause for concern linked to the recent case in Goma, as the city is a provincial capital with an airport with international flights.The intensity of the epidemiological situation is fluctuating, with about 80 new cases reported weekly. There is continued shifting of hotspots and associated risks. There is continued seeding to new or previously cleared areas but thus far without\r\n            sustained local transmission. The recent travel to and from Uganda of a local trader who later died of Ebola demonstrates that the risk remains high for bordering countries. The virus has extended geographically but transmission is not as\r\n            intense. However, the situation in Beni remains difficult and worrisome, especially as the proportion of community deaths has been rising. Ongoing challenges include insecurity, community acceptance, delays in case detection and isolation,\r\n            challenges in contact tracing, a highly mobile population, and multiple routes of transmission. Nosocomial transmission, burial practices, and the use of traditional healers continue to amplify transmission in affected communities. The level\r\n            of preparedness in Goma and priority actions for Rwanda were presented, demonstrating significant improvements across a number of key preparedness pillars (surveillance, Ebola Treatment Centres, etc.). Gaps and challenges remain, specifically\r\n            at the district level.The ring vaccination strategy is proving efficient and successful. Issues related to vaccine supply were reviewed. Vaccine supply and availability data were presented and show that vaccine supplies are currently insufficient, thereby necessitating\r\n            the introduction of an adjusted dose. The Secretariat welcomed the increased production planned by Merck, which will effectively double the supply of rVSV-EBOV in 2020. Further, the EVD Working Group of SAGE will monitor vaccine supplies and\r\n            suggest any further dose adjustment that might be required to assure adequate doses until further production is available.Context and DiscussionThe Committee commended the response to date, under the leadership of the DRC Ministry of Health, and supported by WHO, UN agencies, NGOs and other partners. The response has contributed to limiting the spread and impact of this virus in a difficult\r\n            context in many areas in DRC. The courage and commitment of all frontline workers were specifically praised by the Committee.However, the Committee is concerned that a year into the outbreak, there are worrying signs of possible extension of the epidemic. Despite significant improvement in many places, there is concern about potential spread from Goma, even though there\r\n            have been no new cases in that city. The Committee is also concerned by the reinfection and ongoing transmission in Beni, which has been previously associated with seeding of virus into multiple other locations. Further, the murder of two HCWs demonstrates continued risk for responders owing to the security situation.In addition, despite previous recommendations for increased resources, the global community has not contributed sustainable and adequate technical assistance, human or financial resources for outbreak response.Conclusions and AdviceIt was the view of the Committee that a coordinated international response under the International Health Regulations (2005) is required. Thus, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) under the IHR (2005)\r\n            have been met.The Committee discussed the impact of a PHEIC declaration on the response, possible unintended consequences, and how these might be managed. The global community should anticipate possible negative consequences and proactively prevent them from\r\n            occurring, taking into account experience with Ebola in West Africa in 2014. The declaration of the PHEIC is not a reflection on the performance of the response team but rather a measure that recognizes the possible increased national and regional risks and the need for intensified and coordinated action to manage them.The Committee provided the following advice to the Director-General for his issuance as formal Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005).For affected countries: Continue to strengthen community awareness, engagement, and participation, including at points of entry, with at-risk populations, in particular to identify and address cultural norms and beliefs that serve as barriers to their full participation\r\n                in the response.Continue cross-border screening and screening at main internal roads to ensure that no contacts are missed and enhance the quality of screening through improved sharing of information with surveillance teams.Continue to work and enhance coordination with the UN and partners to reduce security threats, mitigate security risks, and create an enabling environment for public health operations as an essential platform for accelerating disease-control\r\n                efforts.\r\n                Strengthen surveillance with a view towards reducing the proportion of community deaths and the time between detection and isolation, and implementing real-time genetic sequencing to better understand the dynamics of disease transmission.Optimal vaccine strategies that have maximum impact on curtailing the outbreak, as recommended by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), should be implemented rapidly.Strengthen measures to prevent nosocomial infections, including systematic mapping pf health facilities, targeting of IPC interventions and sustain support to those facilities through monitoring and sustained supervision.For neighbouring countries:At-risk countries should work urgently with partners to improve their preparedness for detecting and managing imported cases, including the mapping of health facilities and active surveillance with zero reporting.Countries should continue to map population movements and sociological patterns that can predict risk of disease spread.Risk communications and community engagement, especially at points of entry, should be increased.At-risk countries should put in place approvals for investigational medicines and vaccines as an immediate priority for preparedness.For all States:No country should close its borders or place any restrictions on travel and trade. Such measures are usually implemented out of fear and have no basis in science. They push the movement of people and goods to informal border crossings that\r\n                are not monitored, thus increasing the chances of the spread of disease. Most critically, these restrictions can also compromise local economies and negatively affect response operations from a security and logistics perspective.National authorities should work with airlines and other transport and tourism\r\n                industries to ensure that they do not exceed WHO’s advice on international traffic.\r\n            The Committee does not consider entry screening at airports or other ports of entry outside the region to be necessary.The Committee recognizes the shortage of supply of rVSV ZEBOV GP vaccine, despite the commendable efforts of the manufacturer of doubling the supply by 2020, and recommendsthat WHO works with member states and manufacturers to immediately take all measures to increases supplies, including consideration of working with Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs) and transfer of technology.The Committee emphasized the importance of continued support by WHO and other national and international partners towards the effective implementation and monitoring of these recommendations.Based on this advice, the reports made by the affected State Party, and the currently available information, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 17 July 2019 declared the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic\r\n                    Republic of the Congo a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s advice and issued them as Temporary Recommendations under IHR (2005) to reduce the international spread of Ebola, effective 17 July 2019. The Director-General thanked the Committee Members\r\n                    and Advisors for their advice and requested their reassessment of this situation within three months.",

    "content_html": "Almost a year after the outbreak of Ebola was declared in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and with the number of new cases at worrying levels, the United Nations hosted a high-level meeting today in Geneva to take stock of the coordinated response and galvanize further support for the government-led effort to defeat the deadly disease.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYesterday, 14 July, the first case of Ebola was confirmed in Goma, a city of about 1 million people south of the outbreak’s epicenter. Almost 3,000 health workers have so far been vaccinated against the disease in Goma. More than 1,650 people have died in the current outbreak, while about 12 new cases are reported every day.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith the outbreak still confined to the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, the response is at a critical juncture.  WHO assesses the risk of spread to neighbouring provinces and countries as very high.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChaired by the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock, today’s event included the DRC Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga, the Minister for Solidarity and Humanitarian Action, Mr. Bernard Biando Sango, and the Secretary of State for International Development of the United Kingdom, the Rt. Hon. Rory Stewart, as keynote speakers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n“The tenth outbreak of Ebola is a public health crisis taking place in an environment characterized by development challenges and deficiencies in the health system,” said Dr. Ilunga.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n“The Government acknowledges how difficult it has been to get ahead of this outbreak of Ebola in our country. The response is being carried out in a very complex environment, but with support from our friends in the international community, the Congolese are committed to bringing down the number of cases to zero,” said Mr. Biando Sango.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n“Together with the government, we can and will end this outbreak. We have better public health tools than ever to respond to Ebola, including an effective vaccine,” said Dr. Tedros. “But we need to see an end to the attacks and other disruptions to the response.” <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSince January, there have been 198 attacks against the health response that have resulted in 7 deaths and left 58 healthcare workers and patients injured. “We need political support from all parties, and community ownership, for the responders to do their work safely and without interruptions. This is the only way to stop the virus from continuing to spread.” <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDr. Tedros also announced that he will reconvene the Emergency Committee as soon as possible to assess the latest development and advise him accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe areas of Ituri and North Kivu provinces affected by Ebola are characterised by poor infrastructure, political instability and ongoing conflict involving scores of armed militia groups and community mistrust of national authorities and outsiders.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn May, the UN Secretary-General and the inter-agency humanitarian system bolstered joint UN action. This included the appointment of a UN Ebola Emergency Response Coordinator (UN EERC), Mr. David Gressly, who is based in the affected areas to ensure an enabling environment for the public health response, including appropriate security, logistics, political and community engagement, and action to address the concerns of affected communities.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n“Today, donors and responders expressed confidence in the approach we are now taking,” said Mr. Lowcock. “Unless we get substantially more financial resources immediately, it will not be possible to end the outbreak. Every delay gives the virus an opportunity to spread, which has disastrous consequences. We need to do everything possible now to avoid reaching the scale of the outbreak we saw in West Africa five years ago when more than 10,000 lives were lost before a multi-billion-dollar response brought the cases down to zero.”<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpeaking on the role of the international community, Rt. Hon. Rory Stewart, said: “We are on the edge with this crisis. My visit to eastern DRC this month only reinforced my view about just how urgent our response to this crisis must be. This is very, very real. We are essentially chasing Ebola – one of the world’s most deadly diseases – around an area overrun by armed groups. We need the international community to step up and stop this outbreak from escalating. There is a real danger that, if we lose control of it, this disease could spread beyond DRC’s borders to the wider region.”<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUN EERC Gressly, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Emergency Response, Dr. Ibrahima Socé Fall, and the president of the DRC Ebola Survivors’ Association, Dr. Maurice Kakule joined the event from eastern DRC via video-conference. Ms. Annette Dixon, World Bank Group Vice President for Human Development, also participated via video-conference from Washington DC.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n“We need to substantially improve our readiness and surveillance mechanisms so that we are getting ahead of the virus instead of chasing the virus. There is no room for complacency. It is not over until the transmission is broken in all affected areas,” UN EERC Gressly said from Goma.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUNICEF Deputy Executive Director Dr. Omar Abdi spoke about community engagement, and the Secretary General of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Mr. Elhadj As Sy, spoke on preparedness in the DRC and in neighbouring countries. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, also addressed preparedness. A representative from Medair, Dr. Trina Helderman, discussed the critical role that NGOs are playing in the response.<br/>\n<br/>",

      "description": "Almost a year after the outbreak of Ebola was declared in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and with the number of new cases at worrying levels, the United Nations hosted a high-level meeting today in Geneva to take stock of the coordinated response and galvanize further support for the government-led effort to defeat the deadly disease.\r\n\r\nYesterday, 14 July, the first case of Ebola was confirmed in Goma, a city of about 1 million people south of the outbreak’s epicenter. Almost 3,000 health workers have so far been vaccinated against the disease in Goma. More than 1,650 people have died in the current outbreak, while about 12 new cases are reported every day.\r\n\r\nWith the outbreak still confined to the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, the response is at a critical juncture.  WHO assesses the risk of spread to neighbouring provinces and countries as very high.\r\n\r\nChaired by the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock, today’s event included the DRC Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga, the Minister for Solidarity and Humanitarian Action, Mr. Bernard Biando Sango, and the Secretary of State for International Development of the United Kingdom, the Rt. Hon. Rory Stewart, as keynote speakers.\r\n\r\n“The tenth outbreak of Ebola is a public health crisis taking place in an environment characterized by development challenges and deficiencies in the health system,” said Dr. Ilunga.\r\n\r\n“The Government acknowledges how difficult it has been to get ahead of this outbreak of Ebola in our country. The response is being carried out in a very complex environment, but with support from our friends in the international community, the Congolese are committed to bringing down the number of cases to zero,” said Mr. Biando Sango.\r\n\r\n“Together with the government, we can and will end this outbreak. We have better public health tools than ever to respond to Ebola, including an effective vaccine,” said Dr. Tedros. “But we need to see an end to the attacks and other disruptions to the response.” \r\n\r\nSince January, there have been 198 attacks against the health response that have resulted in 7 deaths and left 58 healthcare workers and patients injured. “We need political support from all parties, and community ownership, for the responders to do their work safely and without interruptions. This is the only way to stop the virus from continuing to spread.” \r\n\r\nDr. Tedros also announced that he will reconvene the Emergency Committee as soon as possible to assess the latest development and advise him accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe areas of Ituri and North Kivu provinces affected by Ebola are characterised by poor infrastructure, political instability and ongoing conflict involving scores of armed militia groups and community mistrust of national authorities and outsiders.\r\n\r\nIn May, the UN Secretary-General and the inter-agency humanitarian system bolstered joint UN action. This included the appointment of a UN Ebola Emergency Response Coordinator (UN EERC), Mr. David Gressly, who is based in the affected areas to ensure an enabling environment for the public health response, including appropriate security, logistics, political and community engagement, and action to address the concerns of affected communities.\r\n\r\n“Today, donors and responders expressed confidence in the approach we are now taking,” said Mr. Lowcock. “Unless we get substantially more financial resources immediately, it will not be possible to end the outbreak. Every delay gives the virus an opportunity to spread, which has disastrous consequences. We need to do everything possible now to avoid reaching the scale of the outbreak we saw in West Africa five years ago when more than 10,000 lives were lost before a multi-billion-dollar response brought the cases down to zero.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the role of the international community, Rt. Hon. Rory Stewart, said: “We are on the edge with this crisis. My visit to eastern DRC this month only reinforced my view about just how urgent our response to this crisis must be. This is very, very real. We are essentially chasing Ebola – one of the world’s most deadly diseases – around an area overrun by armed groups. We need the international community to step up and stop this outbreak from escalating. There is a real danger that, if we lose control of it, this disease could spread beyond DRC’s borders to the wider region.”\r\n\r\nUN EERC Gressly, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Emergency Response, Dr. Ibrahima Socé Fall, and the president of the DRC Ebola Survivors’ Association, Dr. Maurice Kakule joined the event from eastern DRC via video-conference. Ms. Annette Dixon, World Bank Group Vice President for Human Development, also participated via video-conference from Washington DC.\r\n\r\n“We need to substantially improve our readiness and surveillance mechanisms so that we are getting ahead of the virus instead of chasing the virus. There is no room for complacency. It is not over until the transmission is broken in all affected areas,” UN EERC Gressly said from Goma.\r\n\r\nUNICEF Deputy Executive Director Dr. Omar Abdi spoke about community engagement, and the Secretary General of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Mr. Elhadj As Sy, spoke on preparedness in the DRC and in neighbouring countries. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, also addressed preparedness. A representative from Medair, Dr. Trina Helderman, discussed the critical role that NGOs are playing in the response.",

This underscores the immense challenge of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger by 2030, says a new edition of the annual <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/ca5162en/ca5162en.pdf\">The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World</a> report released today.</p>\n<p>The pace of progress in halving the number of children who are stunted and in reducing the number of babies born with low birth weight is too slow, which also puts the SDG 2 nutrition targets further out of reach, according to the report.</p>\n<p>At the same time, adding to these challenges, overweight and obesity continue to increase in all regions, particularly among school-age children and adults.</p>\n<p>The chances of being food insecure are higher for women than men in every continent, with the largest gap in Latin America.</p>\n<p>“Our actions to tackle these troubling trends will have to be bolder, not only in scale but also in terms of multisectoral collaboration,” the heads of the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) urged in their joint foreword to the report.</p>\n<p>Hunger is increasing in many countries where economic growth is lagging, particularly in middle-income countries and those that rely heavily on international primary commodity trade. The annual UN report also found that income inequality is rising in many of the countries where hunger is on the rise, making it even more difficult for the poor, vulnerable or marginalized to cope with economic slowdowns and downturns.</p>\n<p>“We must foster pro-poor and inclusive structural transformation focusing on people and placing communities at the centre to reduce economic vulnerabilities and set ourselves on track to ending hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition,” the UN leaders said.</p>\n<h2>Slow progress in Africa and Asia</h2>\n<p>The situation is most alarming in Africa, as the region has the highest rates of hunger in the world and which are continuing to slowly but steadily rise in almost all subregions. In Eastern Africa in particular, close to a third of the population (30.8 percent) is undernourished. In addition to climate and conflict, economic slowdowns and downturns are driving the rise. Since 2011, almost half the countries where rising hunger occurred due to economic slowdowns or stagnation were in Africa.</p>\n<p>The largest number of undernourished people (more than 500 million) live in Asia, mostly in southern Asian countries. Together, Africa and Asia bear the greatest share of all forms of malnutrition, accounting for more than nine out of ten of all stunted children and over nine out of ten of all wasted children worldwide. In southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, one child in three is stunted.</p>\n<p>In addition to the challenges of stunting and wasting, Asia and Africa are also home to nearly three-quarters of all overweight children worldwide, largely driven by consumption of unhealthy diets.</p>\n<h2>Going beyond hunger\n</h2>\n<p>This year’s report introduces a new indicator for measuring food insecurity at different levels of severity and monitoring progress towards SDG 2: the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity. This indicator is based on data obtained directly from people in surveys about their access to food in the last 12 months, using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). People experiencing moderate food insecurity face uncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have had to reduce the quality and/or quantity of food they eat to get by.</p>\n<p>The report estimates that over 2 billion people, mostly in low- and middle-income countries, do not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food. But irregular access is also a challenge for high-income countries, including 8 percent of the population in Northern America and Europe.\nThis calls for a profound transformation of food systems to provide sustainably-produced healthy diets for a growing world population.</p>\n<h2>Key facts and figures</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of hungry people in the world in 2018: 821.6 million (or 1 in 9 people)\n    <ul>\n<li>in Asia: 513.9 million</li>\n<li>in Africa: 256.1million</li>\n<li>in Latin America and the Caribbean: 42.5 million</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Number of moderately or severely food insecure: 2 billion (26.4%)</li>\n<li>Babies born with low birth weight: 20.5 million (one in seven)</li>\n<li>Children under 5 affected by stunting (low height-for-age): 148.9 million (21.9%)</li>\n<li>Children under 5 affected by wasting (low weight-for-height): 49.5 million (7.3%)</li>\n<li>Children under 5 who are overweight (high weight-for-height): 40 million (5.9%)</li>\n<li>School-age children and adolescents who are overweight: 338 million</li>\n<li>Adults who are obese: 672 million (13% or 1 in 8 adults)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Note to editors</h2>\n<p>The heads of agencies issuing today's report are: José Graziano da Silva, Director-General of FAO; Gilbert F.

      "description": "20 million children worldwide – more than 1 in 10 – missed out on lifesaving vaccines such as measles, diphtheria and tetanus in 2018, according to new data from WHO and UNICEF.Globally, since 2010, vaccination coverage with three doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) and one dose of the measles vaccine has stalled at around 86 percent. While high, this is not sufficient. 95 percent coverage is needed – globally, across countries, and communities - to protect against outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.“Vaccines are one of our most important tools for preventing outbreaks and keeping the world safe,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “While most children today are being vaccinated, far too many are left behind. Unacceptably, it’s often those who are most at risk– the poorest, the most marginalized, those touched by conflict or forced from their homes - who are persistently missed.”Most unvaccinated children live in the poorest countries, and are disproportionately in fragile or conflict-affected states. Almost half are in just 16 countries - Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Haiti, Iraq, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\r\n\r\nIf these children do get sick, they are at risk of the severest health consequences, and least likely to access lifesaving treatment and care.Measles outbreaks reveal entrenched gaps in coverage, often over many yearsStark disparities in vaccine access persist across and within countries of all income levels. This has resulted in devastating measles outbreaks in many parts of the world – including countries that have high overall vaccination rates.In 2018, almost 350,000 measles cases were reported globally, more than doubling from 2017.“Measles is a real time indicator of where we have more work to do to fight preventable diseases,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF’s Executive Director. “Because measles is so contagious, an outbreak points to communities that are missing out on vaccines due to access, costs or, in some places, complacency.

The 12 medicines WHO added to the new Medicines List for five cancer therapies are regarded as the best in terms of survival rates to treat melanoma, lung, prostate, multiple myeloma and leukemias cancers.</p>\n<p>For example, two recently developed immunotherapies (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) have delivered up to 50% survival rates for advanced melanoma, a cancer that until recently was incurable.</p>\n<p><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> The Essential Medicines Committee strengthened advice on antibiotic use by updating the AWARE categories, which indicate which antibiotics to use for the most common and serious infections to achieve better treatment outcomes and reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance.  The committee recommended that three new antibiotics for the treatment of multi-drug resistant infections be added as essential.  </p>\n<p><strong>Other updates to the medicines list include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New oral anticoagulants to prevent stroke as an alternative to warfarin for atrial fibrillation and treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

For example, medicines for multiple sclerosis submitted for inclusion were not listed.

To support appropriate cancer diagnosis, a new section covering anatomical pathology testing was added; this service must be made available in specialized laboratories.</p>\n<p><strong>Infectious diseases</strong>: The list focuses on additional infectious diseases prevalent in low- and middle-income countries such as cholera, and neglected diseases like leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, dengue, and zika. </p>\n<p>In addition, a new section for influenza testing was added for community health settings where no laboratories are available.</p>\n<p><strong>General test:</strong> The list was also expanded to include additional general tests which address a range of different diseases and conditions, such as iron tests (for anemia), and tests to diagnose thyroid malfunction and sickle cell (an inherited form of anemia very widely present in Sub-Saharan Africa).    </p>\n<p>Another notable update is a new section specific to tests intended for screening of blood donations.  This is part of a WHO-wide strategy to make blood transfusions safer.</p>\n<p>“The List of Essential Diagnostics was introduced in 2018 to guide the supply of tests and improve treatment outcomes,” said Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant Director-General for Medicines and Health Products. “As countries move towards universal health coverage and medicines become more available, it will be crucial to have the right diagnostic tools to ensure appropriate treatment.”</p>\n<h2>Note to editors</h2>\n<p>The updated Essential Medicines List adds 28 medicines for adults and 23 for children and specifies new uses for 26 already-listed products, bringing the total to 460 products deemed essential for addressing key public health needs.  While this figure may seem high, it corresponds to a fraction of the number of medicines available on the market.  By focusing the choices, WHO is emphasizing patient benefits and wise spending with a view to helping countries prioritize and achieve universal health coverage.   </p>\n<p>The updated List of Essential Diagnostics contains 46 general tests that can be used for routine patient care as well as for the detection and diagnosis of a wide array of disease conditions, and 69 tests intended for the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of specific diseases.</p>\n<p>The List is divided into two sections depending on the user and setting: one for community settings, which includes self-testing; and a second one for clinical laboratories, which can be general and specialized facilities.  </p>\n<p>Both WHO lists are models for countries to develop their own national lists.  National lists based on local disease burden and existing healthcare delivery infrastructure provide an excellent framework from which countries can plan and implement the laboratory services and the medicines they need.  Access to these health products requires good procurement practices, effective supply chains, quality management protocols and qualified health care workforces.

    "content_html": "<div>\n<p>The number of people at risk of trachoma – the world’s leading infectious cause of blindness – has fallen from 1.5 billion in 2002 to just over 142 million in 2019, a reduction of 91%, WHO has reported. </p>\n<p>New data presented today at the 22nd meeting of the WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020 (GET2020) also show that the number of people requiring surgery for trachomatous trichiasis<em> </em>– the late, blinding stage of trachoma – has dropped from 7.6 million in 2002 to 2.5 million in 2019, a reduction of 68%.</p>\n<p>“<em>Eliminating trachoma contributes to the ocular health and quality of life of the poorest,  most disadvantaged people worldwide and thereby moves us a step closer to achieving universal health coverage</em>,” said Dr Mwelecele Ntuli Malecela, Director, WHO Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases. “<em>Ridding the world of this painful, debilitating disease is being made possible through generous donations of the antibiotic azithromycin, sustained contributions from a network of dedicated funding agencies and partners, and the efforts of hundreds of thousands of front-line workers who work tirelessly to engage communities and deliver interventions.”<br/>\n</em> </p>\n<p>Trachoma remains endemic in 44 countries and has blinded or visually impaired around 1.9 million people worldwide. Mapping of trachoma has been completed to identify its distribution and target control measures through the SAFE strategy, namely: surgery for trichiasis, antibiotics to clear infection, and facial cleanliness and environmental improvement to reduce transmission. The disease is caused by infection with a bacterium.</p>\n<p><em>“Eliminating trachoma has immediate benefit in preserving vision for people at risk. But work against trachoma has required the creation of innovative partnerships, which will help ensure that the most remote and marginalized people are not left behind as more comprehensive health services are strengthened,” </em>said Mr Scott McPherson, Chair, International Coalition for Trachoma Control.</p>\n<p>In 2018 alone, 146112 cases of trichiasis were managed and almost 90 million people were treated with antibiotics for trachoma in 782 districts worldwide.</p>\n<p>Since 2011, eight countries have been validated by WHO as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem<sup>1</sup>.  At least one country in every trachoma-endemic WHO Region has now achieved this milestone, demonstrating the effectiveness of the SAFE strategy in different settings.</p>\n<p>“<em>This is great progress, but we cannot afford to become complacent,</em>” said Dr Anthony Solomon, Medical Officer in charge of WHO’s global trachoma elimination programme. “<em>We should be able to relegate trachoma to the history books in the next few years, but we will only do so by redoubling our efforts now. The last few countries are likely to be the hardest</em>.”</p>\n<p>The significant reduction in the global prevalence of trachoma has resulted from increased political will in endemic countries, expansion of control measures and generation of high-quality data. The global programme has been supported by the world’s largest infectious disease mapping effort – the Global Trachoma Mapping Project (2012–2016) – and, since 2016, by Tropical Data, which has assisted health ministries to complete more than 1500 internationally-standardized, quality-assured and quality-controlled prevalence surveys.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>GET2020</h2>\n<p>In 1996, WHO launched GET2020, and with other partners in the Alliance, supports country implementation of the SAFE strategy and strengthening of national capacity for epidemiological assessment, monitoring, surveillance, project evaluation and resource mobilization.</p>\n<p>Elimination of trachoma is inexpensive, simple and highly cost–effective, yielding a high rate of net economic return.</p>\n<h2>Note to editors</h2>\n<p>Trachoma is a disease of the eye caused by infection with the bacterium <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>.

    "content_html": "<div><p>Three quarters of people living with epilepsy in low-income countries do not get the treatment they need, increasing their risk of dying prematurely and condemning many to a life of stigma.</p><p>The findings are published in “  <a href=\"/publications/i/item/epilepsy-a-public-health-imperative\" target=\"_blank\">Epilepsy: a public health imperative</a>” released today by WHO and leading nongovernmental organizations for epilepsy, the International League Against Epilepsy and the International Bureau for Epilepsy. </p><p>“The treatment gap for epilepsy is unacceptably high, when we know that 70% of people with the condition can be seizure-free when they have access to medicines that can cost as little as US$5 per year and can be delivered through primary health systems,” said Dr Tarun Dua, from WHO’s Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. </p><h2>Premature death is three times higher in people with epilepsy</h2><p>The risk of premature death in people with epilepsy is up to three times higher than for the general population.<strong> </strong>In low- and middle-income countries, early death among people with epilepsy is significantly higher than in high-income countries. Reasons for this premature mortality in low- and middle-income countries are likely associated with lack of access to health facilities when seizures are long-lasting or occur close together without recovery in between, and preventable causes such as drowning, head injuries and burns. </p><p>Roughly half of adults with epilepsy have at least one other health condition. The most common are depression and anxiety: 23% of adults with epilepsy will experience clinical depression during their lifetime and 20% will have anxiety. Mental health conditions such as these can make seizures worse and reduce quality of life. Development and learning difficulties are experienced by 30-40% of children with epilepsy.</p><h2>Stigma is widespread</h2><p>Stigma about the condition is also widespread. “The stigma associated with epilepsy is one of the main factors preventing people from seeking treatment,” said Dr Martin Brodie, President of the International Bureau for Epilepsy. “Many children with epilepsy do not go to school and adults are denied work, the right to drive and even to get married. These human rights violations experienced by people with epilepsy need to come to an end.”</p><p>Public information campaigns in schools, workplaces, and the broader community to help reduce stigma and the introduction of legislation to prevent discrimination and violations of human rights are also important elements of the public health response.</p><h2>Treatment for epilepsy can be integrated into primary health services</h2></div><p>But the report also shows that when the political will exists, the diagnosis of and treatment for epilepsy can be successfully integrated into primary health services. Pilot programmes introduced in Ghana, Mozambique, Myanmar and Viet Nam as part of WHO’s “Reducing the epilepsy treatment gap” programme have led to a considerable increase in access, such that 6.5 million more people have access to treatment for epilepsy should they need it. </p><p>“We know how to reduce the epilepsy treatment gap. Now action to introduce the measures needed to make a difference needs to be accelerated,” said Dr Samuel Wiebe, President of the International League Against Epilepsy. “Ensuring uninterrupted supply of access to antiseizure medicines is one of the highest priorities, as is training of non-specialist health providers working in primary health-care centres.” </p><h2>25% epilepsy cases can be prevented</h2><p>Causes of epilepsy include injury around the time of birth, traumatic brain injury, infections of the brain (such as meningitis or encephalitis) and stroke. It is estimated that 25% of cases can be prevented. </p><p>Effective interventions for prevention of epilepsy can be delivered as part of broader public health responses in maternal and newborn health care, communicable disease control, injury prevention and cardiovascular health. Screening for pregnancy complications and the presence of trained birth attendants can help prevent injury around the time of birth; immunization against pneumonia and meningitis; malaria control programmes in endemic areas; initiatives to reduce road traffic injuries, violence and falls; and health and community interventions to prevent high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and tobacco use can all help reduce epilepsy rates. </p><h2>About epilepsy</h2><p>Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases, affecting nearly 50 million people of all ages around the world<strong>. </strong>It is a brain disease characterized by abnormal electrical activity causing seizures or unusual behaviour, sensations and sometimes loss of awareness.

      "description": "Three quarters of people living with epilepsy in low-income countries do not get the treatment they need, increasing their risk of dying prematurely and condemning many to a life of stigma.The findings are published in “  Epilepsy: a public health imperative” released today by WHO and leading nongovernmental organizations for epilepsy, the International League Against Epilepsy and the International Bureau for Epilepsy. “The treatment gap for epilepsy is unacceptably high, when we know that 70% of people with the condition can be seizure-free when they have access to medicines that can cost as little as US$5 per year and can be delivered through primary health systems,” said Dr Tarun Dua, from WHO’s Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. Premature death is three times higher in people with epilepsyThe risk of premature death in people with epilepsy is up to three times higher than for the general population. In low- and middle-income countries, early death among people with epilepsy is significantly higher than in high-income countries. Reasons for this premature mortality in low- and middle-income countries are likely associated with lack of access to health facilities when seizures are long-lasting or occur close together without recovery in between, and preventable causes such as drowning, head injuries and burns. Roughly half of adults with epilepsy have at least one other health condition. The most common are depression and anxiety: 23% of adults with epilepsy will experience clinical depression during their lifetime and 20% will have anxiety. Mental health conditions such as these can make seizures worse and reduce quality of life. Development and learning difficulties are experienced by 30-40% of children with epilepsy.Stigma is widespreadStigma about the condition is also widespread. “The stigma associated with epilepsy is one of the main factors preventing people from seeking treatment,” said Dr Martin Brodie, President of the International Bureau for Epilepsy. “Many children with epilepsy do not go to school and adults are denied work, the right to drive and even to get married. These human rights violations experienced by people with epilepsy need to come to an end.”Public information campaigns in schools, workplaces, and the broader community to help reduce stigma and the introduction of legislation to prevent discrimination and violations of human rights are also important elements of the public health response.Treatment for epilepsy can be integrated into primary health servicesBut the report also shows that when the political will exists, the diagnosis of and treatment for epilepsy can be successfully integrated into primary health services. Pilot programmes introduced in Ghana, Mozambique, Myanmar and Viet Nam as part of WHO’s “Reducing the epilepsy treatment gap” programme have led to a considerable increase in access, such that 6.5 million more people have access to treatment for epilepsy should they need it. “We know how to reduce the epilepsy treatment gap. Now action to introduce the measures needed to make a difference needs to be accelerated,” said Dr Samuel Wiebe, President of the International League Against Epilepsy. “Ensuring uninterrupted supply of access to antiseizure medicines is one of the highest priorities, as is training of non-specialist health providers working in primary health-care centres.” 25% epilepsy cases can be preventedCauses of epilepsy include injury around the time of birth, traumatic brain injury, infections of the brain (such as meningitis or encephalitis) and stroke. It is estimated that 25% of cases can be prevented. Effective interventions for prevention of epilepsy can be delivered as part of broader public health responses in maternal and newborn health care, communicable disease control, injury prevention and cardiovascular health. Screening for pregnancy complications and the presence of trained birth attendants can help prevent injury around the time of birth; immunization against pneumonia and meningitis; malaria control programmes in endemic areas; initiatives to reduce road traffic injuries, violence and falls; and health and community interventions to prevent high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and tobacco use can all help reduce epilepsy rates. About epilepsyEpilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases, affecting nearly 50 million people of all ages around the world. It is a brain disease characterized by abnormal electrical activity causing seizures or unusual behaviour, sensations and sometimes loss of awareness. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, with peaks among children and the over-60s. It has neurological, cognitive, psychological and social consequences.More information on epilepsyWHO’s work on mental health and neurological disordersBrain health is a priority area of work for WHO due to the large burden of death and disability caused by neurological disorders. At the core of our work is the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP). Through the mhGAP Programme, non-specialists are trained to provide first-line support for mental, neurological and substance use disorders. WHO provides support to Member States to help them incorporate brain health into relevant policies and plans and to improve management of neurological disorders through models of care integrated into the primary health care system. International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE)The IBE is made up of laypersons and professionals interested in the medical and non-medical aspects of epilepsy. The Bureau addresses social problems such as education, employment, insurance, driving licence restrictions and public awareness. The IBE was established in 1961 and has grown to almost 140 chapters in over 100 countries. International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)The goals of the ILAE are to: advance and disseminate knowledge about epilepsy; promote research, education and training; and improve services and care for patients, especially by prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The League was founded in 1909 and consists of more than 100 national chapters.",

In particular, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal health is fueling resistance.  </p><p>The rise of AMR, poses a threat described as a “silent tsunami”.   Drug-resistant microorganisms now account for an estimated 700,000 deaths a year, a figure that could increase to 10 million deaths each year if no action is taken.  </p><p>“Combating antibiotics resistance is fundamentally a behaviour change issue. I’m not talking about washing hands more often, but about ensuring antibiotics are prescribed less readily and that work methods are changed to reduce the chance of resistant bacteria spreading,” said the Netherlands Medical Care and Sports Minister Bruno Bruins. “This topic is so important that it deserves to stay at the top of the international political agenda. Countries have made outstanding plans and it’s time now to carry them out. The Multi-Partner Trust Fund that we’re launching today will help us do this because the problem is too big for countries to tackle alone,” he added.</p><p>“Unfortunately, borders don’t stop bacteria. But by pooling our efforts and knowledge, we can help each other combat AMR,” said Carola Schouten, the Netherlands Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality. “There’s still scope for improving the way antibiotics are used in livestock production, too. This conference is an excellent opportunity to engage in dialogue and learn from each other,” she added.</p><p>“We all have a role to play to protect the efficacy of antimicrobial agents and the AMR Trust Fund gives us the opportunity to support the efforts of the different sectors at national, regional and global levels,” said the OIE Director General, Dr Monique Eloit. “AMR must be addressed in a One Health approach and supported by long-term commitments from all stakeholders. The OIE is committed to supporting the animal health sector in fulfilling its commitments to ensure that both animals and humans will continue to benefit from available and efficient antimicrobials to treat their diseases for the future.</p><p>“FAO is fully dedicated to help eliminate hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition and dedicated to produce safe food for a growing world population in a sustainable way, said FAO Deputy-Director General, Climate and Natural Resources Maria Helena Semedo.  “Antimicrobials are necessary tools to ensure food security, but they need to be used in a responsible way. FAO considers the Multi Partner Trust Fund as a milestone in our Tripartite efforts to reduce AMR” she added.</p><p>“This new Trust Fund signals an important new commitment to combat antimicrobial resistance. AMR is a serious challenge to reaching universal health coverage and a threat to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, Deputy Director-General, WHO.</p><h2>Funding appeal</h2><p>The immediate funding appeal is for US$70 million, to be used to support countries and the implementation of the Tripartite’s AMR Workplan 2019-2020, particularly in providing technical support to countries designing National Action Plans on AMR and to scale up local action.</p><p>Prominent among the AMR Trust Fund’s ultimate desired outcomes is a world where infectious diseases can continue to be treated with effective and safe antimicrobials and one in which resistance is monitored and controlled at a slower pace. The pathway to that success entails activities ranging from awareness raising and the drafting of national action plans to surveillance of AMR trends and better ensuring responsible antimicrobial sales and use patterns. </p><p>Inaction, due to policy or implementation inadequacies, threatens to make common infections more difficult to treat and lifesaving medical procedures and treatments riskier to perform.  </p><p>Inaction could also raise food insecurity and rural poverty, when animal illnesses can no longer be effectively treated using veterinary medicines.</p><p>The AMR Trust Fund provides a joint mechanism for clear attribution and transparency of all sources of finance, while its activities will be based on the application of best practices, scaling up activities that have worked and innovative approaches to ensure that today’s cures are available for future generations.</p><p>*Editor’s note:  The UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office, the UN center of expertise in pooled funding mechanisms, will act as trustee of the Fund.

He was speaking to Member States in Geneva after returning from a visit to DRC, where he reviewed the health response and met with leaders from multiple sectors to galvanize their commitment. The organization is also facing a severe funding gap for the response.Political cooperation must come from across party lines and across borders,” said Dr Tedros. “Bipartisan political leadership in DRC is the only way that communities will eventually understand the threat of Ebola and take ownership in ending the outbreak. Meanwhile, other countries have a global responsibility to support the dedicated health responders—from DRC, from across Africa and across the world—who are bravely working to save lives.”WHO’s funding needs for the response are US$98 million, of which US$44 million have been received, leaving a gap of US$54 million. The funding shortfall is immediate and critical: if the funds are not received, WHO will be unable to sustain the response at the current scale. Other partners are also facing shortfalls that have led some to reduce or stop operations. The response risks being driven by decisions related to financial capacity rather than operational needs.During his most recent visit to DRC, Dr Tedros met with Prime Minister Sylvester Ilunga Ilunkamba and opposition leaders—including Martin Fayulu and Mbusa Nyamwisi—as well as religious leaders and partners in Kinshasa, followed by meetings in Butembo, one of the outbreak’s hotspots, with community, religious, business leaders and partners, including non-governmental organizations and other UN agencies.Dr Tedros said, “I met with many leaders from all sectors of society. They agreed that they all have a role to play to help people understand the gravity of this disease. The virus steps between the gaps when we do not join hands.”This was Dr Tedros’ ninth mission to the country. His most recent visit to Butembo was in late April after multiple attacks on health workers and facilities, and the death of colleague Dr Richard Mouzoko left staff fearful but still determined to end the Ebola outbreak.“The last time I was in DRC it was a very difficult time,” said Dr Tedros. “But the hundreds of responders working to end this outbreak are committed because the people of DRC need their help. So we sat together to find ways to revitalise and strengthen the response. I returned this time to review progress, and to see whether the changes needed have been made and are working.”Clear needs were identified at that time, for a more secure working environment, and for more participation by other UN partners and non-governmental organizations. Another clear need was better use of the Ebola vaccine, which is a very effective tool if provided to all people who have been in contact with a confirmed case.Vaccination is being stepped up and offered to more people, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, and children over six months old (rather than only 1 year and older). The new protocol was launched by Dr Tedros on Sunday in Katwa, another Ebola hotspot. The adaptation of the strategy is now showing signs of paying dividends, with better trends in Butembo and Katwa, though Mabalako is becoming a new hotspot.In two days of meetings in Uganda, Dr Tedros met with the Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, Minister of Health, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, the leadership of Uganda Virus Research Institute, UN Resident Coordinator Rosa Malango, US Ambassador Deborah Malac and others.The country has been in response mode since last week when they confirmed Ebola in three people who had been infected in DRC. Since then, sadly all three of those cases have died, while no further cases have been confirmed. Dr Tedros noted that the country’s investment in preparedness had led to the rapid response.“After seeing the rapid response in Uganda, I can only urge the international community to continue to support the preparedness activities ongoing there and in neighbouring countries,” said Dr Tedros. “We have seen concretely how this investment saves lives by controlling the spread of a dangerous pathogen.",

Some 2.2 billion people around the world do not have safely managed* drinking water services, 4.2 billion people do not have safely managed sanitation services, and 3 billion lack basic** handwashing facilities.</p><p>The Joint Monitoring Programme report, <em>Progress on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene: 2000-2017: Special focus on inequalities</em> finds that, while significant progress has been made toward achieving universal access to basic water, sanitation and hygiene, there are huge gaps in the quality of services provided.</p><p>“Mere access is not enough. If the water isn’t clean, isn’t safe to drink or is far away, and if toilet access is unsafe or limited, then we’re not delivering for the world’s children,” said Kelly Ann Naylor, Associate Director of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, UNICEF. “Children and their families in poor and rural communities are most at risk of being left behind. Governments must invest in their communities if we are going to bridge these economic and geographic divides and deliver this essential human right.” </p><p>The report reveals that 1.8 billion people have gained access to basic drinking water services since 2000, but there are vast inequalities in the accessibility, availability and quality of these services. It is estimated that 1 in 10 people (785 million) still lack basic services, including the 144 million who drink untreated surface water. The data shows that 8 in 10 people living in rural areas lacked access to these services and in one in four countries with estimates for different wealth groups, coverage of basic services among the richest was at least twice as high as among the poorest.</p><p>“Countries must double their efforts on sanitation or we will not reach universal access by 2030,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. “If countries fail to step up efforts on sanitation, safe water and hygiene, we will continue to live with diseases that should have been long ago consigned to the history books: diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A and neglected tropical diseases including trachoma, intestinal worms and schistosomiasis. Investing in water, sanitation and hygiene is cost-effective and good for society in so many ways. It is an essential foundation for good health.”</p><p>The report also says that 2.1 billion people have gained access to basic sanitation services since 2000 but in many parts of the world the wastes produced are not safely managed. It also reveals that 2 billion people still lack basic sanitation, among whom 7 out of 10 live in rural areas and one third live in the Least Developed Countries. </p><p>Since 2000, the proportion of the population practising open defecation has been halved, from 21 per cent to 9 per cent, and 23 countries have achieved near elimination, meaning less than 1 per cent of the population is practising open defecation. Yet, 673 million people still practise open defecation, and they are increasingly concentrated in ‘high burden’ countries***.  Worse, in 39 countries, the number of people practising open defecation actually increased, the majority of which are in sub-Saharan Africa where many countries have experienced strong population growth over this period.</p><p>Finally, the report highlights new data showing 3 billion people lack basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home in 2017. It also shows that nearly three quarters of the population of the Least Developed Countries did not have basic handwashing facilities. Every year, 297 000 children under 5 years die due to diarrhea linked to inadequate WASH. Poor sanitation and contaminated water are also linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A, and typhoid.</p><p>“Closing inequality gaps in the accessibility, quality and availability of water, sanitation and hygiene should be at the heart of government funding and planning strategies. To relent on investment plans for universal coverage is to undermine decades worth of progress at the expense of coming generations,” said Kelly Ann Naylor.   </p><h2><strong>Note to editors</strong></h2><p><strong>*Safely managed drinking water and sanitation services: </strong>Drinking water from sources located on premises, free from contamination and available when needed, and using hygienic toilets from which wastes are treated and disposed of safely.</p><p> <strong>**Basic services:</strong> Having a protected drinking water source that takes less than thirty minutes to collect water from, using an improved toilet or latrine that does not have to be shared with other households, and having handwashing facilities with soap and water in the home.</p><p> <strong>***High burden countries:</strong> More than 5 per cent of the population practised open defecation in 2017 include: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Chad, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan Philippines, Sudan, South Sudan, Togo, United Republic of Tanzania, Yemen.</p><h2><strong>About the JMP</strong></h2><p>The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene is the official United Nations mechanism tasked with monitoring country, regional and global progress, and especially toward the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets relating to universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene.

    "content_html": "<p>The meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) regarding Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) took place on Friday, 14 June 2019, from 12:00 to 17:00 Geneva time (CEST). </p>\n<h2>Context and Discussion </h2>\n<p>The Committee expressed its deep concern about the ongoing outbreak, which, despite some positive epidemiological trends, especially in the epicentres of Butembo and Katwa, shows that the extension and/or reinfection of disease in other areas like Mabalako, presents, once again, challenges around community acceptance and security. In addition, the response continues to be hampered by a lack of adequate funding and strained human resources. </p>\n<p>The cluster of cases in Uganda is not unexpected; the rapid response and initial containment is a testament to the importance of preparedness in neighbouring countries. The Committee commends the communication and collaboration between DRC and Uganda. </p>\n<p>At the same time, the exportation of cases into Uganda is a reminder that, as long as this outbreak continues in DRC, there is a risk of spread to neighbouring countries, although the risk of spread to countries outside the region remains low. </p>\n<p>The Committee wishes to commend the heroic work of all responders, who continue to work under extremely challenging and stressful conditions. </p>\n<p> The Committee extensively debated the impact of a PHEIC declaration on the response, possible unintended consequences, and how these might be managed. Differing views were expressed, as the Committee acknowledged that recent cases in Uganda constitute international spread of disease.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions and Advice </h2>\n<p>It was the view of the Committee that the outbreak is a health emergency in DRC and the region but does not meet all the three criteria for a PHEIC under the IHR. While the outbreak is an extraordinary event, with risk of international spread, the ongoing response would not be enhanced by formal Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005). </p>\n<p>The Committee provided the following public health advice, which it strongly urges countries and responding partners to heed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At-risk countries should improve their preparedness for detecting and managing exported cases, as Uganda has done. </li>\n<li>Cross-border screening in DRC should continue and its quality improved and sustained. </li>\n<li>Continue to map population movements and sociological patterns that can predict risk of disease spread. </li>\n<li>All priority countries should put in place approvals for investigational medicines and vaccines as an immediate priority for preparedness. </li>\n<li>Optimal vaccine strategies that have maximum impact on curtailing the outbreak, as recommended by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), should be implemented rapidly. </li>\n<li>The Committee is deeply disappointed that WHO and the affected countries have not received the funding and resources needed for this outbreak. The international community must step up funding and support strengthening of preparedness and response in DRC and neighbouring countries. </li>\n<li>Continue to strengthen community awareness, engagement, and participation. There has been a great deal of progress in community engagement activities. However, in border communities, where mobility is especially likely, community engagement needs to be more sharply targeted to identify the populations most at risk. </li>\n<li>\n<p>The implementation by the UN and partners of more coordinated measures to reduce security threats, mitigate security risks, and create an enabling environment for public health operations is welcomed and encouraged by the Committee as an essential platform for accelerating disease-control efforts. </p>\n</li>\n<li>The Committee strongly emphasizes its previous advice against the application of any international travel or trade restrictions. </li>\n<li>The Committee does not consider entry screening at airports or other ports of entry to be necessary. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Committee advised the WHO Director-General to continue to monitor the situation closely and reconvene the Emergency Committee as needed. </p>\n<p>Proceedings of the meeting </p>\n<p>Members and advisors of the Emergency Committee were convened by teleconference. </p>\n<p>Because the Chair, Dr Robert Steffen, was unable to attend the meeting in person, Dr Preben Aavitsland chaired the proceedings. </p>\n<p>The Director-General welcomed the Committee by phone from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. </p>\n<p>Representatives of WHO’s legal department and the department of compliance, risk management, and ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities, as well as the requirements of the IHR and the criteria that define a PHEIC: an extraordinary event that poses a public health risk to other countries through international spread and that requires a coordinated international response. The Committee’s role is to give advice to the Director-General, who makes the final decision on the determination of a PHEIC. The Committee also provides advice or temporary recommendations as appropriate. </p>\n<p>Committee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were identified. </p>\n<p>The Chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters. Presentations were made by representatives of the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the National Communicable Disease Control Commission of Uganda. </p>\n<p>The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was reviewed, including the current epidemiological situation and response strategies, including changes instituted to improve community engagement. Sustained, serious security incidents, which have resulted in injuries and deaths among responses have seriously impeded the response. There have been four waves of the outbreak since August 2018, but during the last month there has been a reduction in numbers of cases. Active case-finding for missing contacts is ongoing. Factors contributing to the ongoing outbreak include population movement, health-seeking behavior directed to traditional healers, poor infection prevention and control measures in health facilities, security challenges, and lack of involvement by political leaders. </p>\n<p>Representatives of the National Communicable Disease Control Commission in Uganda reviewed recent cases, contacts, and contact tracing. They updated the Committee on their response actions, including notification to WHO and political involvement, and preparedness activities that have been taking place since August 2018. A national coordination task force has been activated and a rapid response team deployed. Clinical management is available in an Ebola Treatment Unit in Bwera. Screening is taking place at official points of entry. Ring vaccination will begin on 15 June. </p>\n<p>A representative of the WHO Regional Office for Africa presented the status of regional preparedness activities, particularly in Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda. Ongoing challenges were noted, especially at district/subnational levels, as well as inadequate crossborder collaboration and a lack of funding to sustain preparedness activities.</p>\n<p>A representative of the International Organization for Migration updated the Committee on prevention, detection, and control measures at points of entry, for cross-border preparedness. </p>\n<p>The UN Ebola Emergency Response Coordinator gave an update on the security situation and efforts to create a dynamic, nimble enabling environment to support outbreak response. There have been frequent disruptions to the response, which has had implications for increased numbers of cases. UN-wide support is needed to strengthen the public health response and coordinate international assistance. Access and community acceptance are increasing, with decreases in cases in some areas. Increases in attacks in some areas are being addressed. </p>\n<p>The WHO Secretariat gave an update on the current situation and provided details on the response to the current Ebola outbreak and preparedness activities in neighbouring countries. The risk assessment for DRC remains very high at national and regional levels but low at global level. Risk in Uganda remains moderate at the national level and low and regional and global levels. However, the high risks of the Uganda event have been mitigated by rapid communication and coordination among authorities across jurisdictions; detection at points of entry and subsequent response activities; and operational preparedness and readiness in Uganda. A high level of cooperation and transparency between DRC and Uganda was noted with appreciation. There has been an overall decline in case incidence in the last 5 weeks, but substantial rates of transmission continue, especially in a few hotspots. IPC measures, safe burials, and population mobility were reviewed, along with details of contact tracing. Operational scale-up was reviewed and a serious need for funding, both for the response and for preparedness, was underscored. Less than one-third of the resources needed are available; presently there is a funding shortfall of USD $54 million against $98 million needed for the response through July 2019. </p>\n<p>\r\nBased on the above advice, the reports made by the affected States Parties, and the currently available information, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment that the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo does not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In light of the advice of the Emergency Committee, WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions. The Director-General thanked the Committee Members and Advisors for their advice.</p>",

If untreated, they can lead to serious and chronic health effects that include neurological and cardiovascular disease, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirths,\r\n        and increased risk of HIV. They are also associated with significant levels of stigma and domestic violence.</p><p>Syphilis alone caused an estimated 200 000 stillbirths and newborn deaths in 2016, making it one of the leading causes of baby loss globally.  </p><h2><strong>STIs remain a persistent and endemic health threat worldwide</strong></h2><p>Since the last published data for 2012, there has been no substantive decline in either the rates of new or existing infections. On average, approximately 1 in 25 people globally have at least one of these STIs, according to the latest figures,\r\n        with some experiencing multiple infections at the same time.</p><p>STIs spread predominantly through unprotected sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex. Some—including chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and syphilis—can also be transmitted during pregnancy and childbirth, or, in the case of syphilis,\r\n        through contact with infected blood or blood products, and injecting drug use.</p><p>STIs are preventable through safe sexual practices, including correct and consistent condom use and sexual health education.</p><p>Timely and affordable testing and treatment are crucial for reducing the burden of STIs globally, alongside efforts to encourage people who are sexually active to get screened for STIs. WHO further recommends that pregnant women should be systematically\r\n        screened for syphilis as well as HIV.</p></div><p>All bacterial STIs can be treated and cured with widely available medications. However, recent shortages in the global supply of benzathine penicillin has made it more difficult to treat syphilis. Rapidly increasing antimicrobial resistance to gonorrhoea\r\n    treatments is also a growing health threat, and may lead eventually to the disease being impossible to treat.</p><h2><strong>Expanding access to prevention, testing and treatment</strong></h2><p>WHO generates estimates to assess the global burden of STIs, and to help countries and health partners respond.

Unsafe food also hinders development in many low- and middle-income economies, which lose around US$ 95 billion in productivity associated with illness, disability, and premature death suffered by workers.</p> <p><font size=\"-1\">World Food Safety Day 2019’s theme is that food safety is everyone’s business.

      "description": "The first ever celebration of the United Nations World Food Safety Day, to be marked globally on 7 June, aims to strengthen efforts to ensure that the food we eat is safe.Every year, nearly one in ten people in the world (an estimated 600 million people) fall ill and 420,000 die after eating food contaminated by bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances. Unsafe food also hinders development in many low- and middle-income economies, which lose around US$ 95 billion in productivity associated with illness, disability, and premature death suffered by workers. World Food Safety Day 2019’s theme is that food safety is everyone’s business. Food safety contributes to food security, human health, economic prosperity, agriculture, market access, tourism and sustainable development.The UN has designated two of its agencies, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to lead efforts in promoting food safety around the world.FAO and WHO are joining forces to assist countries to prevent, manage and respond to risks along the food supply chain, working with food producers and vendors, regulatory authorities and civil society stakeholders, whether the food is domestically produced or imported.“Whether you are a farmer, farm supplier, food processor, transporter, marketer or consumer, food safety is your business,” FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva said. “There is no food security without food safety,” he said.“Unsafe food kills an estimated 420,000 people every year.

Safe food production improves sustainability by enabling market access and productivity, which drives economic development and poverty alleviation, especially in rural areas.Investment in consumer food safety education has the potential to reduce foodborne disease and return savings of up to $10 for each dollar invested.Get involved in World Food Safety DayActivities around the world for World Food Safety Day aim to inspire action to help prevent, detect and manage foodborne health risks. The right actions along the food supply chain, from farmers to consumers, as well as good governance and regulations, are essential to food safety. FAO and WHO have created a new guide to show how everyone can get involved. The guide includes five steps to make a sustained difference to food safety:Ensure it’s safe. Governments must ensure safe and nutritious food for all. Grow it safe.  Agriculture and food producers need to adopt good practices.Keep it safe. Business operators must make sure food is safely transported, stored and prepared.Check it’s safe. Consumers need access to timely, clear and reliable information about the nutritional and disease risks associated with their food choices.Team up for safety. Governments, regional economic bodies, UN organizations, development agencies, trade organizations, consumer and producer groups, academic and research institutions and private sector entities must work together on food safety issues.Starting in 2019, every 7 June will be a time to highlight the benefits of safe food.

Millions more live with lung cancer, tuberculosis, asthma or chronic lung disease caused by tobacco,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Healthy lungs are essential to living a healthy life. Today – and everyday – you can protect your lungs and those of your friends and family by saying no to tobacco.”</p><p>In 2017, tobacco killed 3.3 million users and people exposed to second-hand smoke from lung-related conditions, including:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li data-level=\"1\" data-list=\"0\">1.5 million people dying from chronic      respiratory diseases</li><li data-level=\"1\" data-list=\"0\">1.2 million deaths from cancer      (tracheal, bronchus and lung)</li><li data-level=\"1\" data-list=\"0\">600 000 deaths from      respiratory infections and tuberculosis</li></ul><p>More than 60 000 children aged under 5 die of lower respiratory infections caused by second-hand smoke. Those who live on into adulthood are more likely to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) later in life.</p><h2>What can be done?</h2><p>WHO is urging countries to fight the tobacco epidemic through full implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) and enforcing effective tobacco control actions, including WHO’s recommended “MPOWER” policy measures, for example by reducing demand for tobacco through taxation, creating smoke-free places and cessation support.</p><p>The Organization also encourages parents and community leaders to take steps to safeguard the health of their families and communities by informing them of and protecting them from the harms caused by tobacco.</p><h2>Note to editors</h2><p>Exposure to tobacco impacts greatly on the lung health of people around the world, including in the following ways:</p><p><b>Lung cancer:</b> Tobacco smoking is the primary cause for lung cancer, responsible for over two thirds of lung cancer deaths globally.

Quitting smoking can reduce the risk of lung cancer: after 10 years of quitting smoking, risk of lung cancer falls to about half that of a smoker.</font></p></div><p><b>Chronic respiratory disease:</b> Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition where the build-up of pus-filled mucus in the lungs results in a painful cough and agonizing breathing difficulties. The risk of developing COPD is particularly high among individuals who start smoking at a young age, and those exposed to second-hand smoke, as tobacco smoke significantly slows lung development. Tobacco also exacerbates asthma, which restricts activity and contributes to disability. Early smoking cessation is the most effective treatment for slowing the progression of COPD and improving asthma symptoms.</p><p><b>Across the life-course:</b> Infants exposed in-utero to tobacco smoke toxins, through maternal smoking or maternal exposure to second-hand smoke, frequently experience reduced lung growth and function. Young children exposed to second-hand smoke are at risk of the onset and exacerbation of asthma, pneumonia and bronchitis, and frequent lower respiratory infections. Smokers should ensure they never smoke in the presence of an infant or young child.</p><p><b>Tuberculosis.</b> Tuberculosis (TB) damages the lungs and reduces lung function, which is further exacerbated by tobacco smoking. About one quarter of the world’s population has latent TB, placing them at risk of developing the active disease. People who smoke are twice as likely to fall ill with TB. Active TB, compounded by the damaging lung health effects of tobacco smoking, substantially increases risk of disability and death from respiratory failure. TB sufferers should take immediate steps to quit tobacco to enable their TB treatment regime to be effective.</p><p><b>Air pollution:</b> Tobacco smoke is a dangerous form of indoor air pollution: it contains more than 7 000 chemicals, 69 of which are known to cause cancer. Though smoke may be invisible and odourless, it can linger in the air for up to five hours. </p><p><b>How tobacco relates to the SDGs: </b>In order to achieve the <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.who.int/sdg/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable Development Goal</a> (SDG) target of a one-third reduction in NCD premature mortality by 2030, tobacco control must be a priority for governments and communities worldwide. The world is not on track to meet this target.</p>",

    "lead": "The twenty-first meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director-General on 14 May 2019 at WHO headquarters with members, advisers and invited Member States attending via teleconference, supported by the WHO secretariat.The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV). The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations. The following IHR States Parties provided an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 19 February 2019: Afghanistan, DR Congo, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Somalia.The committee commended all countries that presented on the quality of information provided, and the transparency with which countries discussed their challenges.Wild poliovirusThe Committee is gravely concerned by the significant further increase in WPV1 cases globally in 2019, particularly in Pakistan where 15 cases have already been reported. In Pakistan transmission continues to be widespread, as indicated by the number of positive environmental isolates in many areas of the country, and the proportion of samples that detect WPV1 is rising. The recent cluster of cases in Lahore also indicates that vulnerabilities still exist outside the high-risk corridors. Notably, the increased rate of infection during what is usually the low season may herald even higher rates of infection in the coming high season unless urgent remedial steps are taken. The committee was very concerned about attacks on vaccinators and on the police protecting them. The increasing refusal by individuals and communities to accept vaccination also needs to be actively addressed. While the committee understood that the recent elections and political transition may have adversely affected delivery of the polio program, it is now essential that the new government renews its efforts, noting that the eradication program in the country is no longer on-track.Highlighting these concerns, the committee noted the recent detection of WPV1 in sewage in Iran in an area close to the international border with Pakistan. Based on genetic sequencing, the virus is most closely linked to viruses found recently in Karachi, Pakistan. While there is no evidence currently that transmission has occurred in Iran and routine immunization coverage is high there, this finding together with the resumption of WPV1 international spread between Pakistan and Afghanistan suggests that rising transmission in Pakistan correlates with increasing risk of WPV1 exportation beyond the single epidemiological block formed by the two countries. The Iran event is the first such exportation detected since 2014 and signals that the hard fought gains of recent years can easily be reversed.In Afghanistan, the critical issue of access is seriously hampering progress towards global eradication and needs to be resolved. Inaccessible and missed children particularly in the Southern Region mean there is a large cohort of susceptible children in this part of Afghanistan. Environmental surveillance has found an increased proportion of positive samples in 2019. The security situation and access will need to significantly improve for eradication efforts to progress.The Committee noted the continued high degree of cooperation and coordination between Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border and welcomed the all age vaccination now being taken at key border points between the two countries.\r\nIn Nigeria, there has been no WPV1 detected for over two and a half years, and it is possible that the African Region may be certified WPV free in early 2020. However, this will require careful assessment of the risk of missed transmission in inaccessible areas of Borno, and in other countries in the region where confidence in surveillance is lacking. The Committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity, and noted that the inaccessible target population was now down to around 60 000 children, scattered across Borno State in smaller pockets. The committee noted the delays between case investigation and final laboratory results in Nigeria and suggested an analysis be undertaken to understand the reasons for this.Vaccine derived poliovirusThe multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks on the continent of Africa are as concerning as the WPV1 situation in Asia. The emergence of new strains of cVDPV2 in areas where mOPV2 has been used, the recent spread of cVDPV2 into southern Nigeria, including the densely populated Lagos region, and evidence of missed transmission in Nigeria and Somalia suggests that the situation continues to deteriorate. Insufficient coverage with IPV exacerbates the growing vulnerability on the continent to cVDPV2 transmission. Early detection of any international spread from the five currently infected countries and prioritized use of mOPV2 is essential to mitigate further depletion of the limited mOPV2 supply. Repeatedly, cases have occurred in border districts (in Nigeria, close to Benin, in DR Congo close to Angola, in Somalia, close to Ethiopia, and in Mozambique, close to Malawi).The cVDPV1 outbreaks in PNG and Indonesia and cVDPV3 in Somalia highlight the gaps in population immunity due to pockets of persistently low routine immunization coverage in many parts of the world. However, these outbreaks seem to pose a lesser risk of international spread, as bOPV vaccine is already available in the country, and available for traveler vaccination, and global population immunity is far higher than for type 2. It appears likely there has been missed transmission of cVDPV1 in Indonesia although no evidence so far that the virus has spread beyond Papua. Large inaccessible areas of Somalia are a significant constraint on achieving interruption of transmission, exacerbated by large nomadic population movements.The committee noted that in all infected countries, routine immunization was weak, and coverage remains very poor in many areas of these countries.Inaccessibility is a major risk to interruption of transmission in Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Afghanistan, and conflict in these countries and DR Congo makes control of these outbreaks even more challenging.ConclusionThe Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:Rising risk of WPV1 international spread:The progress made in recent years appears to be reversing, with the committee’s assessed risk of international spread the highest since 2014 when the PHEIC was declared. This risk assessment is based on the following:the first WPV1 exportation outside of the single epidemiological block of Afghanistan and Pakistan since 2014;rising number of WPV1 cases in Pakistan; o rising proportion of environmental samples that are positive for WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan;widespread detection of WPV1 in Pakistan in environmental samples; o clusters of cases in areas not considered high risk such as Lahore;the fact that all of these observations have been made during the part of the year normally considered as low transmission season;Increasing community and individual resistance to the polio program.Rising risk of cVDPV spread:The newly emerged strains of cVDPV2 in Nigeria and DR Congo, and the increased number of infected states / provinces in these two countries, together with evidence of missed transmission in Nigeria, Somalia and Indonesia also suggests the risk of international spread of cVDPV, especially type 2, is rising.Falling PV2 immunity:Global population immunity to type 2 polioviruses (PV2) continues to fall, as the cohort of children born after OPV2 withdrawal grows, exacerbated by poor coverage with IPV particularly in some of the cVDPV infected countries. Protracted outbreaks: The difficulty in rapidly controlling cVDPV outbreaks in Nigeria and DR Congo is another risk.Weak routine immunization:Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.Surveillance gaps:The appearance of highly diverged VDPVs in Somalia and Indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance, heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries. Similar gaps exist in Lake Chad countries and around the Horn of Africa.Lack of access:Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Papua, Indonesia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.Population movement:The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks. A regional approach and strong cross-border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.Risk categoriesThe Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread.States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread.States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:Poliovirus Case:12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case):12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period.These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (e.g. Borno).Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months. After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report.Temporary recommendationsStates infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spreadWPV1Afghanistan                          (most recent detection 3 April 2019)Pakistan                               (most recent detection 26 April 2019)Nigeria                                  (most recent detection 27 Sept 2016)cVDPV1Papua New Guinea             (most recent detection 7 November 2018)Indonesia                             (most recent detection 13 February 2019)cVDPV3Somalia                                (most recent detection 7 Sept 2018)These countries should:Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.Ensure that all residents and long-term visitors (i.e. > four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers.Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea).Further intensify cross-border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross-border populations. Improved coordination of cross-border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication.Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected.Provide to the Director-General a regular report on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel.States infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spreadDR Congo                            (most recent detection 8 February 2019)Mozambique                        (most recent detection 17 December 2018)Niger                                     (most recent detection 16 March 2019)Nigeria                                  (most recent detection 16 April 2019)Somalia                                (most recent detection 15 March 2019)These countries should:Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained.Noting the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections, consider requesting vaccines from the global mOPV2 stockpile based on the recommendations of the Advisory Group on mOPV2.Encourage residents and long-term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel; those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure.Ensure that travelers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status.Intensify regional cooperation and cross-border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus, and vaccinate refugees, travelers and cross-border populations, according to the advice of the Advisory Group.Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication.Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without the detection of circulation of VDPV2 in the country from any source, and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the criteria of a state no longer infected.At the end of 12 months without evidence of transmission, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPVWPV1Cameroon

                                                     (last case 21 Sept 2017)Kenya                                                    (last env positive specimen 21 March 2018)These countries should:Urgently strengthen routine immunization to boost population immunity.Enhance surveillance quality, including considering introducing supplementary methods such as environmental surveillance, to reduce the risk of undetected WPV1 and cVDPV transmission, particularly among high risk mobile and vulnerable populations.Intensify efforts to ensure vaccination of mobile and cross-border populations, Internally Displaced Persons, refugees and other vulnerable groups.Enhance regional cooperation and cross border coordination to ensure prompt detection of WPV1 and cVDPV, and vaccination of high risk population groups.Maintain these measures with documentation of full application of high quality surveillance and vaccination activities.At the end of 12 months* without evidence of reintroduction of WPV1 or new emergence and circulation of cVDPV, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.*For the Lake Chad countries, this will be linked to when Nigeria is considered no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV2.Additional considerationsThe committee suggested a thorough analysis of the situation in Pakistan be urgently undertaken, to understand what factors have led to the recent but most serious deterioration in polio eradication seen since 2014. Government, program and community factors need to be all included in such a review. Similarly, in Afghanistan there needs to be an analysis of why anti-government elements have withdrawn cooperation with the polio program. These analyses should be used to tailor programmatic responses to the current situation, as current methods appear to be failing. The committee felt that due to the serious risk of failure of eradication, the GPEI leadership including the Director-General of WHO should engage at the level of head of State in polio affected countries, to advocate for greater levels of government ownership of eradication. Noting the environmental detection of WPV1 in Iran, the committee recommended that Iran review its surveillance and immunisation coverage in the affected region, and further requested Iran and Pakistan to consider whether further measures are required on their borders to prevent exportation.Recognizing the limited tools available to prevent cVDPV2 exportation through traveler vaccination with respect to these outbreaks, the committee urged that all countries neighboring cVDPV2 infected countries urgently review surveillance and immunity indicators, particularly in border zones and other high risk population groups. Early detection of importation events is essential in the current situation, and every effort is needed to avoid missed transmission. Countries at highest risk currently are Benin, Ethiopia, Malawi, and Angola. Other countries in the vicinity must also act quickly to enhance surveillance and preparedness level to be ready to mount effective and timely response in case of any evidence of geographic expansion of outbreak transmission. Ongoing efforts are needed also in Lake Chad basin countries and the Central African Republic.The heightened risk of international spread of polioviruses should be communicated clearly, including engaging infected and high risk countries at the upcoming WHA.The situation in Iran needs to be closely monitored, and the committee be updated at the next meeting, or alerted sooner if the situation suggests transmission is occurring there.Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by Afghanistan, DR Congo, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Somalia, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 21 May 2019 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 21 May 2019.",

The security situation and access will need to significantly improve for eradication efforts to progress. <br/><br/>The Committee noted the continued high degree of cooperation and coordination between Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border and welcomed the all age vaccination now being taken at key border points between the two countries.\r\nIn Nigeria, there has been no WPV1 detected for over two and a half years, and it is possible that the African Region may be certified WPV free in early 2020. However, this will require careful assessment of the risk of missed transmission in inaccessible areas of Borno, and in other countries in the region where confidence in surveillance is lacking. The Committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity, and noted that the inaccessible target population was now down to around 60 000 children, scattered across Borno State in smaller pockets. The committee noted the delays between case investigation and final laboratory results in Nigeria and suggested an analysis be undertaken to understand the reasons for this. \r\n<h2>Vaccine derived poliovirus </h2><p>The multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks on the continent of Africa are as concerning as the WPV1 situation in Asia. The emergence of new strains of cVDPV2 in areas where mOPV2 has been used, the recent spread of cVDPV2 into southern Nigeria, including the densely populated Lagos region, and evidence of missed transmission in Nigeria and Somalia suggests that the situation continues to deteriorate. Insufficient coverage with IPV exacerbates the growing vulnerability on the continent to cVDPV2 transmission. Early detection of any international spread from the five currently infected countries and prioritized use of mOPV2 is essential to mitigate further depletion of the limited mOPV2 supply. Repeatedly, cases have occurred in border districts (in Nigeria, close to Benin, in DR Congo close to Angola, in Somalia, close to Ethiopia, and in Mozambique, close to Malawi).<br/><br/>The cVDPV1 outbreaks in PNG and Indonesia and cVDPV3 in Somalia highlight the gaps in population immunity due to pockets of persistently low routine immunization coverage in many parts of the world. However, these outbreaks seem to pose a lesser risk of international spread, as bOPV vaccine is already available in the country, and available for traveler vaccination, and global population immunity is far higher than for type 2. It appears likely there has been missed transmission of cVDPV1 in Indonesia although no evidence so far that the virus has spread beyond Papua. Large inaccessible areas of Somalia are a significant constraint on achieving interruption of transmission, exacerbated by large nomadic population movements.<br/><br/>The committee noted that in all infected countries, routine immunization was weak, and coverage remains very poor in many areas of these countries.  <br/><br/>Inaccessibility is a major risk to interruption of transmission in Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Afghanistan, and conflict in these countries and DR Congo makes control of these outbreaks even more challenging.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</p><ul><li><strong>Rising risk of WPV1 international spread: </strong>The progress made in recent years appears to be reversing, with the committee’s assessed risk of international spread the highest since 2014 when the PHEIC was declared. This risk assessment is based on the following:\r\n    <ul><li>the first WPV1 exportation outside of the single epidemiological block of Afghanistan and Pakistan since 2014;</li><li>rising number of WPV1 cases in Pakistan; o rising proportion of environmental samples that are positive for WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan;</li><li>widespread detection of WPV1 in Pakistan in environmental samples; o clusters of cases in areas not considered high risk such as Lahore;</li><li>the fact that all of these observations have been made during the part of the year normally considered as low transmission season;</li><li>Increasing community and individual resistance to the polio program.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Rising risk of cVDPV spread:</strong> The newly emerged strains of cVDPV2 in Nigeria and DR Congo, and the increased number of infected states / provinces in these two countries, together with evidence of missed transmission in Nigeria, Somalia and Indonesia also suggests the risk of international spread of cVDPV, especially type 2, is rising.</li><li><strong>Falling PV2 immunity:</strong> Global population immunity to type 2 polioviruses (PV2) continues to fall, as the cohort of children born after OPV2 withdrawal grows, exacerbated by poor coverage with IPV particularly in some of the cVDPV infected countries. Protracted outbreaks: The difficulty in rapidly controlling cVDPV outbreaks in Nigeria and DR Congo is another risk.</li><li><strong>Weak routine immunization: </strong>Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.</li><li><strong>Surveillance gaps:</strong> The appearance of highly diverged VDPVs in Somalia and Indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance, heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries. Similar gaps exist in Lake Chad countries and around the Horn of Africa.</li><li><strong>Lack of access:</strong> Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Papua, Indonesia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.</li><li><strong>Population movement:</strong> The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks. A regional approach and strong cross-border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.</li></ul><h2>Risk categories </h2><p>The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows: </p><ul><li>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread. </li><li>States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread. </li><li>States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.</li></ul><p>Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:</p><ul><li><strong>Poliovirus Case:</strong> 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.</li><li><strong>Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): </strong>12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period.</li><li>These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (e.g. Borno).</li></ul><p>Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months. After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report.</p><h2>Temporary recommendations</h2><h3><strong>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread </strong></h3><p><strong>WPV1 </strong></p><p>Afghanistan                          (most recent detection 3 April 2019) </p><p>Pakistan                               (most recent detection 26 April 2019) </p><p>Nigeria                                  (most recent detection 27 Sept 2016) </p><p><strong>cVDPV1 </strong></p><p>Papua New Guinea             (most recent detection 7 November 2018) </p><p>Indonesia                             (most recent detection 13 February 2019) </p><p><strong>cVDPV3 </strong></p><p>Somalia                                (most recent detection 7 Sept 2018) </p><p> </p><p>These countries should:</p><ul><li>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.</li><li>Ensure that all residents and long-term visitors (i.e. &gt; four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.</li><li>Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers.</li><li>Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.</li><li>Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination.

</li></ul><p><em>*For the Lake Chad countries, this will be linked to when Nigeria is considered no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV2.</em></p><h2>Additional considerations </h2><p>The committee suggested a thorough analysis of the situation in Pakistan be urgently undertaken, to understand what factors have led to the recent but most serious deterioration in polio eradication seen since 2014. Government, program and community factors need to be all included in such a review. Similarly, in Afghanistan there needs to be an analysis of why anti-government elements have withdrawn cooperation with the polio program. These analyses should be used to tailor programmatic responses to the current situation, as current methods appear to be failing. The committee felt that due to the serious risk of failure of eradication, the GPEI leadership including the Director-General of WHO should engage at the level of head of State in polio affected countries, to advocate for greater levels of government ownership of eradication. Noting the environmental detection of WPV1 in Iran, the committee recommended that Iran review its surveillance and immunisation coverage in the affected region, and further requested Iran and Pakistan to consider whether further measures are required on their borders to prevent exportation. </p><p>Recognizing the limited tools available to prevent cVDPV2 exportation through traveler vaccination with respect to these outbreaks, the committee urged that all countries neighboring cVDPV2 infected countries urgently review surveillance and immunity indicators, particularly in border zones and other high risk population groups. Early detection of importation events is essential in the current situation, and every effort is needed to avoid missed transmission. Countries at highest risk currently are Benin, Ethiopia, Malawi, and Angola. Other countries in the vicinity must also act quickly to enhance surveillance and preparedness level to be ready to mount effective and timely response in case of any evidence of geographic expansion of outbreak transmission. Ongoing efforts are needed also in Lake Chad basin countries and the Central African Republic.</p><p>The heightened risk of international spread of polioviruses should be communicated clearly, including engaging infected and high risk countries at the upcoming WHA. </p><p>The situation in Iran needs to be closely monitored, and the committee be updated at the next meeting, or alerted sooner if the situation suggests transmission is occurring there. </p><p>Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by Afghanistan, DR Congo, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Somalia, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 21 May 2019 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 21 May 2019.</p></p>",

          "The Committee is gravely concerned by the significant further increase in WPV1 cases globally in 2019, particularly in Pakistan where 15 cases have already been reported. In Pakistan transmission continues to be widespread, as indicated by the number of positive environmental isolates in many areas of the country, and the proportion of samples that detect WPV1 is rising. The recent cluster of cases in Lahore also indicates that vulnerabilities still exist outside the high-risk corridors. Notably, the increased rate of infection during what is usually the low season may herald even higher rates of infection in the coming high season unless urgent remedial steps are taken. The committee was very concerned about attacks on vaccinators and on the police protecting them. The increasing refusal by individuals and communities to accept vaccination also needs to be actively addressed. While the committee understood that the recent elections and political transition may have adversely affected delivery of the polio program, it is now essential that the new government renews its efforts, noting that the eradication program in the country is no longer on-track.",
          "Highlighting these concerns, the committee noted the recent detection of WPV1 in sewage in Iran in an area close to the international border with Pakistan. Based on genetic sequencing, the virus is most closely linked to viruses found recently in Karachi, Pakistan. While there is no evidence currently that transmission has occurred in Iran and routine immunization coverage is high there, this finding together with the resumption of WPV1 international spread between Pakistan and Afghanistan suggests that rising transmission in Pakistan correlates with increasing risk of WPV1 exportation beyond the single epidemiological block formed by the two countries. The Iran event is the first such exportation detected since 2014 and signals that the hard fought gains of recent years can easily be reversed.",
          "In Afghanistan, the critical issue of access is seriously hampering progress towards global eradication and needs to be resolved. Inaccessible and missed children particularly in the Southern Region mean there is a large cohort of susceptible children in this part of Afghanistan. Environmental surveillance has found an increased proportion of positive samples in 2019. The security situation and access will need to significantly improve for eradication efforts to progress.",
          "The Committee noted the continued high degree of cooperation and coordination between Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border and welcomed the all age vaccination now being taken at key border points between the two countries.\r\nIn Nigeria, there has been no WPV1 detected for over two and a half years, and it is possible that the African Region may be certified WPV free in early 2020. However, this will require careful assessment of the risk of missed transmission in inaccessible areas of Borno, and in other countries in the region where confidence in surveillance is lacking. The Committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity, and noted that the inaccessible target population was now down to around 60 000 children, scattered across Borno State in smaller pockets. The committee noted the delays between case investigation and final laboratory results in Nigeria and suggested an analysis be undertaken to understand the reasons for this."

          "The multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks on the continent of Africa are as concerning as the WPV1 situation in Asia. The emergence of new strains of cVDPV2 in areas where mOPV2 has been used, the recent spread of cVDPV2 into southern Nigeria, including the densely populated Lagos region, and evidence of missed transmission in Nigeria and Somalia suggests that the situation continues to deteriorate. Insufficient coverage with IPV exacerbates the growing vulnerability on the continent to cVDPV2 transmission. Early detection of any international spread from the five currently infected countries and prioritized use of mOPV2 is essential to mitigate further depletion of the limited mOPV2 supply. Repeatedly, cases have occurred in border districts (in Nigeria, close to Benin, in DR Congo close to Angola, in Somalia, close to Ethiopia, and in Mozambique, close to Malawi). The cVDPV1 outbreaks in PNG and Indonesia and cVDPV3 in Somalia highlight the gaps in population immunity due to pockets of persistently low routine immunization coverage in many parts of the world. However, these outbreaks seem to pose a lesser risk of international spread, as bOPV vaccine is already available in the country, and available for traveler vaccination, and global population immunity is far higher than for type 2. It appears likely there has been missed transmission of cVDPV1 in Indonesia although no evidence so far that the virus has spread beyond Papua. Large inaccessible areas of Somalia are a significant constraint on achieving interruption of transmission, exacerbated by large nomadic population movements. The committee noted that in all infected countries, routine immunization was weak, and coverage remains very poor in many areas of these countries. Inaccessibility is a major risk to interruption of transmission in Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Afghanistan, and conflict in these countries and DR Congo makes control of these outbreaks even more challenging."

          "The committee suggested a thorough analysis of the situation in Pakistan be urgently undertaken, to understand what factors have led to the recent but most serious deterioration in polio eradication seen since 2014. Government, program and community factors need to be all included in such a review. Similarly, in Afghanistan there needs to be an analysis of why anti-government elements have withdrawn cooperation with the polio program. These analyses should be used to tailor programmatic responses to the current situation, as current methods appear to be failing. The committee felt that due to the serious risk of failure of eradication, the GPEI leadership including the Director-General of WHO should engage at the level of head of State in polio affected countries, to advocate for greater levels of government ownership of eradication. Noting the environmental detection of WPV1 in Iran, the committee recommended that Iran review its surveillance and immunisation coverage in the affected region, and further requested Iran and Pakistan to consider whether further measures are required on their borders to prevent exportation.",
          "Recognizing the limited tools available to prevent cVDPV2 exportation through traveler vaccination with respect to these outbreaks, the committee urged that all countries neighboring cVDPV2 infected countries urgently review surveillance and immunity indicators, particularly in border zones and other high risk population groups. Early detection of importation events is essential in the current situation, and every effort is needed to avoid missed transmission. Countries at highest risk currently are Benin, Ethiopia, Malawi, and Angola. Other countries in the vicinity must also act quickly to enhance surveillance and preparedness level to be ready to mount effective and timely response in case of any evidence of geographic expansion of outbreak transmission. Ongoing efforts are needed also in Lake Chad basin countries and the Central African Republic.",
          "The heightened risk of international spread of polioviruses should be communicated clearly, including engaging infected and high risk countries at the upcoming WHA.",
          "The situation in Iran needs to be closely monitored, and the committee be updated at the next meeting, or alerted sooner if the situation suggests transmission is occurring there.",
          "Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by Afghanistan, DR Congo, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Somalia, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 21 May 2019 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 21 May 2019."

      "Rising risk of WPV1 international spread: The progress made in recent years appears to be reversing, with the committee’s assessed risk of international spread the highest since 2014 when the PHEIC was declared. This risk assessment is based on the following: the first WPV1 exportation outside of the single epidemiological block of Afghanistan and Pakistan since 2014; rising number of WPV1 cases in Pakistan; o rising proportion of environmental samples that are positive for WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan; widespread detection of WPV1 in Pakistan in environmental samples; o clusters of cases in areas not considered high risk such as Lahore; the fact that all of these observations have been made during the part of the year normally considered as low transmission season; Increasing community and individual resistance to the polio program.",

      "Increasing community and individual resistance to the polio program.",
      "Rising risk of cVDPV spread: The newly emerged strains of cVDPV2 in Nigeria and DR Congo, and the increased number of infected states / provinces in these two countries, together with evidence of missed transmission in Nigeria, Somalia and Indonesia also suggests the risk of international spread of cVDPV, especially type 2, is rising.",
      "Falling PV2 immunity: Global population immunity to type 2 polioviruses (PV2) continues to fall, as the cohort of children born after OPV2 withdrawal grows, exacerbated by poor coverage with IPV particularly in some of the cVDPV infected countries. Protracted outbreaks: The difficulty in rapidly controlling cVDPV outbreaks in Nigeria and DR Congo is another risk.",
      "Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.",
      "Surveillance gaps: The appearance of highly diverged VDPVs in Somalia and Indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance, heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries. Similar gaps exist in Lake Chad countries and around the Horn of Africa.",
      "Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Papua, Indonesia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.",
      "Population movement: The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks. A regional approach and strong cross-border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.",

      "description": "Amman, Jordan, 28 May 2019 – The Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region has declared that measles and rubella have been eliminated from both Bahrain and Oman, and that Islamic Republic of Iran has eliminated rubella and is about to eliminate measles.The RVC met in Amman, Jordan, on 15–16 May 2019 to review the reports submitted by Bahrain, Islamic Republic of Iran and Oman, and decide on the status of elimination of measles and rubella in the three countries. The Commission’s decision was based on a review of the reports and discussion with representatives from the three countries during the meeting.Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, congratulated Bahrain, Islamic Republic of Iran and Oman on their achievement.“We acknowledge the great efforts exerted by the health sector in the three countries that have led to the achievement of this goal and the elimination of these serious diseases. This gives us great hope and confidence that all countries in the Region can do the same and that we will be able announce that the Eastern Mediterranean Region is a measles and rubella free Region”, he said.The RVC was nominated by the Regional Director in January 2018 to verify the elimination of the two diseases.

    "content_html": "<h2>Health, environment and climate change</h2>\n<p>Member States agreed a new global strategy on health, environment and climate change: the transformation needed to improve lives and well-being sustainably through healthy environments. The strategy provides a vision and way forward on how the world and its health community need to respond to environmental health risks and challenges until 2030.</p>\n<p>Risks include environmental physical, chemical, biological and work-related factors. </p>\n<p>They also agreed a plan of action on climate change and health in small island developing States. The plan has four strategic lines of action: empowerment (supporting health leadership in small island developing States); evidence (building the business case for investment); implementation (preparedness for climate risks, adaptation and health-promoting mitigation policies); resources (facilitating access to climate and health finance). </p>\n<h2>Noncommunicable diseases</h2>\n<p>Member States agreed a decision to accelerate and scale up action to prevent and treat noncommunicable diseases, primarily cancer, diabetes, and heart and lung diseases, and to meet global targets to reduce the number of people dying too young from these diseases. </p>\n<p>NCDs are the leading cause of premature death: WHO estimates that 15.2 million people died in 2016, aged between 30 and 70 years, from one of these conditions. </p>\n<p>The Health Assembly heard that for the first time since the initial United Nations General Assembly High-level Meeting on NCDs in 2011, there are promising signs that health outcomes are improving thanks to action on NCDs. These include a downward trend in prevalence of tobacco smoking, heavy episodic drinking of alcoholic beverages and raised blood pressure.  </p>\n<p>Treatment interventions, including for hypertension, have also progressed through strengthening primary health care services. There has also been an increase in the number of countries with national standards for managing major NCDs through a primary care approach.</p>\n<p>Later this year, WHO will publish a technical note setting out indicators for countries to annually measure progress on the commitments they made at the UN General Assembly to address NCDs and include in reports to the United Nations Secretary General.  </p>\n<h2>World Chagas Day and Year of the Nurse and Midwife</h2>\n<p>Today Member States also agreed to establish World Chagas Day, to be celebrated each year on 14 April. Chagas, a neglected tropical disease, currently affects between 6 and 7 million people, mostly in Latin America. They also declared 2020 the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife.</p>\n<h2>Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework</h2>\n<p>Further to requests made by the World Health Assembly in 2017 and 2018, today delegates considered the final text of WHO’s analysis of the issues raised by the 2016 PIP Framework Review Group’s recommendations concerning seasonal influenza and genetic sequence data.

They focus on: primary healthcare, the role of community health workers, and the September UN General Assembly high-level meeting on UHC.</p>\n<h2>Primary health care towards universal health coverage</h2>\n<p>The first resolution urges Member States to take measures to implement the Declaration of Astana, adopted at the 2018 Global Conference on Primary Health Care.</p>\n<p>It recognizes the key role strong primary health care plays in ensuring countries can provide the full range of health services a person needs throughout their life – be it disease prevention or treatment,  rehabilitation or palliative care. Primary health care means countries must have quality, integrated health systems, empowered individuals and communities, and that they must involve a wide range of sectors in addressing social, economic, and environmental determinants of health.<u1:p></u1:p></p>\n<p>The resolution calls on the WHO secretariat to increase its support to Member States in this area. WHO is also required to finalize its Primary Health Care Operational Framework in time for next year’s World Health Assembly.  WHO and other stakeholders are tasked with supporting countries in implementing the Declaration of Astana and mobilizing resources to build strong and sustainable primary health care.</p>\n<h2>Community health workers delivering primary health care</h2>\n<p>The second resolution recognizes the contribution made by community health workers to achieving universal health coverage, responding to health emergencies, and promoting healthier populations.

The certification is granted when a country proves that it has interrupted indigenous transmission of the disease for at least 3 consecutive years.</p><p>Contracted through the bite of an infected mosquito, malaria remains one of the world’s leading killers, with an estimated 219 million cases and over 400 000 malaria-related deaths in 2017. Approximately 60% of fatalities are among children aged\r\nunder 5 years.</p><p>Algeria is the second country in the WHO African Region to be officially recognized as malaria-free, after Mauritius, which was certified in 1973. Argentina is the second country in the WHO Region of the Americas to be certified in 45 years, after Paraguay\r\nin June 2018.</p><p>Algeria and Argentina reported their last cases of indigenous malaria in 2013 and 2010 respectively. </p><h3>An ‘unwavering commitment’ </h3><p>For both Algeria and Argentina, malaria has a history that spans hundreds of years, and the battle against the disease has been hard-fought. Over the last decade, improved surveillance allowed for every last case of malaria to be rapidly identified and\r\ntreated. Importantly, both countries provided free diagnosis and treatment within their borders, ensuring no one was left behind in getting the services they needed to prevent, detect and cure the disease.<br/><br/>“Algeria and Argentina have\r\neliminated malaria thanks to the unwavering commitment and perseverance of the people and leaders of both countries,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Their success serves as a model for other countries working\r\nto end this disease once and for all.”</p><h3>Stamping out malaria in Algeria</h3><p>French physician Dr Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran discovered the malaria parasite in Algeria in 1880.

      "description": "Six countries restricted industrially produced trans fat since 2018, and another 24 countries, including the European Union, recently adopted trans fat regulations that will come into effect over the next two years. Yet, more than 110 countries still have no regulations against this harmful compound, meaning five billion people are at risk for industrially produced trans fat exposure in the foods they eat every day, according to the first annual global progress report on trans fat elimination issued today by WHO.Trans fat causes estimated half a million deaths each year, despite data that show an immediate and long-lasting health benefits when industrially-produced trans fat is removed from the food supply.The new report summarizes country actions to ban industrially produced trans fat and makes recommendations for action to achieve the 2023 goal for global elimination. WHO also released detailed step-by-step implementation modules in the   REPLACE action package, which gives countries exact guidance on how to cut industrially-produced trans fat from their foods and save lives.“Momentum is growing for the global elimination of industrially-produced trans fat, with nearly one third of the world’s population in 28 countries now protected from its harms,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “But more than two-thirds of the world’s population lacks protection from industrial trans fat in their food. WHO stands ready to support elimination efforts in the remaining countries. We welcome industry commitments to reformulate and remove trans fat from their products.”A few highlights from the annual report include:Thailand implemented best practice regulations to eliminate industrially-produced trans fat in January 2019The European Union adopted in 2018 best practice regulations to eliminate industrially-produced trans fat in foods. The regulations will come into effect by 2021.India released draft regulations in December 2018 to further lower limits for industrially-produced trans fat to 2%Turkey released draft best practice regulations in January 2019 against trans fatMore than 40 countries began activities to limit trans fat“Eliminating artificial trans fat is one of the simplest and most effective ways to save lives and create a healthier food supply,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, President and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies. “Progress eliminating trans fat has been uneven. The new REPLACE modules provide detailed guidance on cutting trans fat from the food supply. There’s no excuse to delay taking action to eliminate trans fat.”The inaugural progress report also shows most of the policy action against trans fat has been in high-income countries. No low-income country and only three lower-middle-income countries (India, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan) have trans fat policies. This new map shows where actions have, and have not, been taken (1).Building on the lessons and recommendations in the annual progress report, the  REPLACE modules help countries take action. The modules provide practical and evidence-based guidance on how to implement best practice policies.Recently, food companies of the International Food and Beverage Alliance have committed to eliminate industrial trans fats from all their products globally by 2023.WHO urges action against industrially-produced trans fat from countries, regional bodies and industry. When industrially-produced trans fat is finally cut from the global food supply, it will save millions of lives, be the first risk factor for a noncommunicable disease ever eliminated, and prove that substantial progress against noncommunicable diseases is possible.",

Those low birthweight babies who survive have a greater risk of stunting, and developmental and physical ill health later in life, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. </p><p>“Low birthweight is a complex clinical entity composed of intrauterine growth restriction and preterm birth,” says co-author Dr Mercedes de Onis from the Department of Nutrition at WHO.</p><p>“This is why reducing low birthweight requires an understanding of the underlying causes in a given country. For example, in Southern Asia a large proportion of low birthweight babies are born at term but with intrauterine growth restriction, which is associated with maternal undernutrition, including maternal stunting. </p><p>“Conversely, preterm birth is the major contributor to low birthweight in settings with many adolescent pregnancies, high prevalence of infection, or where pregnancy is associated with high levels of fertility treatment and caesarean sections (like in USA and Brazil). Understanding and tackling these underlying causes in high-burden countries should be a priority.”</p><p>Although close to three-quarters were born in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the problem remains substantial in high-income countries in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. High-income countries have seen virtually no progress. </p><h3>What is being done to tackle this major public health problem</h3><h3><strong></strong></h3><p>Reducing the incidence of low birth weight requires a comprehensive global strategy, which must include improving maternal nutritional status; treating pregnancy-associated conditions such as pre-eclampsia (hypertensive disease of pregnancy); and providing adequate maternal care, perinatal clinical services and social support.</p><p>Affordable, accessible and appropriate health-care is critical for preventing and treating low birthweight. Reductions in death, illness and disability in newborn babies will only be achieved if pregnancy care is fully integrated with appropriate care for low birthweight babies.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",

It provides a searchable database of profiles for health products needed to tackle pressing health issues in global health including those prioritized by WHO. The summary of the published profiles outlines 8-10 key characteristics (such as target population, measures of efficacy and dosage) for the development of health products, including medicines, vaccines and diagnostics. Building in these characteristics at an early stage of the development process is essential to ensure that the final products will be accessible to the populations that need them.The Ebola outbreak of 2014-15 and other recent pandemics have highlighted the urgent need for centralized information to guide and improve coordination of efforts to develop new health products for neglected diseases and populations. Until now, less than 10% of new products that have been submitted for regulatory review have referenced product profiles in the R&D process. This absence of a standard way to describe the health products that are priorities for global health has contributed to uncoordinated and ineffective research and development in these areas.WHO Chief Scientist invites global health R&D community to contribute to the Directory“As the first global public good launched by WHO’s new Science Division, the Health Product Profile Directory exemplifies our effort to shape the global health research agenda to achieve health for all,” said WHO Chief Scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan. “While the Directory is launched with a focus on infectious diseases, we will update and grow the content, so I invite submissions of product profiles on other priority areas such as non-communicable diseases and antimicrobial resistance.”Currently, the Directory contains 196 product profiles developed by 24 agencies, of which 191 describe a product with an infectious disease as the target. The top four diseases with product profiles are tuberculosis, malaria, HIV and Chagas. The Directory contains only 5 product profiles for conditions other than infectious diseases (one vaccine for breast cancer and four contraception technologies).“DNDi welcomes the release of this new resource that will help to better understand the priorities of the global health product R&D landscape,” said Graeme Bilbe, Research & Development Director, Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi). “At DNDi, we recognize the importance of product profiles as an essential tool to guide our research strategy and ensure that the products we develop are able to be used by the vulnerable populations we are developing them for. We are pleased to have contributed some of the product profiles used in this valuable new directory and we look forward to using it.”“In an R&D landscape which is increasingly complicated to navigate, Medicines for Malaria Venture welcomes this new Directory, which will help us ensure that new malaria products that are developed are able to be accessed and used by the populations that need them,” said David Reddy, Chief Executive Officer of Medicines for Malaria Venture.Links are provided to access full product profile documents that are publicly available.  The Directory includes profiles developed by WHO and other agencies and can also be accessed throughthe WHO Global Observatory on health R&D, where other key resources to analyze R&D can be found.Profiles for products prioritized for global action by WHO are clearly marked as authored by WHO.  Other product profiles authored by Product Development Partnerships, commercial companies and other organizations that meet theinclusion criteriaare also included.  For non-WHO authored profiles, inclusion in the directory does not imply endorsement by WHO but may help inform research prioritization decisions.

          "Today, WHO’s new Science Division launched an online resource to guide the development of new health products for which there are limited markets or incentives for research and development. An essential tool for realizing universal health coverage, the Health Product Profile Directory aims to promote  research and development for products to combat neglected diseases and threats to global health, including antimicrobial resistance and diseases with pandemic potential. The Health Product Profile Directory is a free-to-use online resource created and developed by TDR , the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, on behalf of WHO as a global public good. It provides a searchable database of profiles for health products needed to tackle pressing health issues in global health including those prioritized by WHO. The summary of the published profiles outlines 8-10 key characteristics (such as target population, measures of efficacy and dosage) for the development of health products, including medicines, vaccines and diagnostics. Building in these characteristics at an early stage of the development process is essential to ensure that the final products will be accessible to the populations that need them. The Ebola outbreak of 2014-15 and other recent pandemics have highlighted the urgent need for centralized information to guide and improve coordination of efforts to develop new health products for neglected diseases and populations. Until now, less than 10% of new products that have been submitted for regulatory review have referenced product profiles in the R&D process. This absence of a standard way to describe the health products that are priorities for global health has contributed to uncoordinated and ineffective research and development in these areas. WHO Chief Scientist invites global health R&D community to contribute to the Directory “As the first global public good launched by WHO’s new Science Division, the Health Product Profile Directory exemplifies our effort to shape the global health research agenda to achieve health for all,” said WHO Chief Scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan. “While the Directory is launched with a focus on infectious diseases, we will update and grow the content, so I invite submissions of product profiles on other priority areas such as non-communicable diseases and antimicrobial resistance.” Currently, the Directory contains 196 product profiles developed by 24 agencies, of which 191 describe a product with an infectious disease as the target. The top four diseases with product profiles are tuberculosis, malaria, HIV and Chagas. The Directory contains only 5 product profiles for conditions other than infectious diseases (one vaccine for breast cancer and four contraception technologies). “DNDi welcomes the release of this new resource that will help to better understand the priorities of the global health product R&D landscape,” said Graeme Bilbe, Research & Development Director, Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi). “At DNDi, we recognize the importance of product profiles as an essential tool to guide our research strategy and ensure that the products we develop are able to be used by the vulnerable populations we are developing them for. We are pleased to have contributed some of the product profiles used in this valuable new directory and we look forward to using it.” “In an R&D landscape which is increasingly complicated to navigate, Medicines for Malaria Venture welcomes this new Directory, which will help us ensure that new malaria products that are developed are able to be accessed and used by the populations that need them,” said David Reddy, Chief Executive Officer of Medicines for Malaria Venture. Links are provided to access full product profile documents that are publicly available.  The Directory includes profiles developed by WHO and other agencies and can also be accessed through the WHO Global Observatory on health R&D , where other key resources to analyze R&D can be found. Profiles for products prioritized for global action by WHO are clearly marked as authored by WHO.  Other product profiles authored by Product Development Partnerships, commercial companies and other organizations that meet the inclusion criteria are also included.  For non-WHO authored profiles, inclusion in the directory does not imply endorsement by WHO but may help inform research prioritization decisions. Organizations outside WHO stand to benefit from submitting profiles to the Directory by gaining an understanding of the landscape of related profiles and seeing where gaps lie. Health Product Profiles are already making an impact As an example of the impact product profiles can make, profiles published by WHO in response to the Ebola outbreak have been used by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (CEPI) to inform its R&D funding strategy. This covers diseases identified by WHO as having the potential to cause global outbreaks. To date, CEPI has distributed more than $350 million to develop new vaccines to combat these diseases.

Some of those experts will be selected to be part of a technical advisory group, and others may be called on the be part of specific subgroups.  Members of the technical advisory group will have an understanding and experience working in digital health, national or large scale digital health programs and policy, artificial intelligence and health, virtual and augmented reality in healthcare,\r\n        biomedical innovation, robotic surgery, wearable technologies and health and wellness, traceability (e.g. block chain) and health,  ethics, governance and security in healthcare ecosystem with focus on digital health, health economics with\r\n        focus on digital health and health law with focus on digital health technologies. Individuals interested in applying to participate in this group will find details on the application process here. WHO will publish the membership of\r\n    the advisory group once we receive responses and assess conflicts of interest.",

This is in line with the WHO’s objective and recommendations of its REPLACE action package, which was developed and launched in 2018.\r\n“Eliminating industrially-produced trans fat is one of the simplest and most effective ways to save lives and create a healthier food supply,” added Dr Tedros. \r\nIn line with the REPLACE initiative, WHO has called on all food producers and oil and fat manufacturers, not only IFBA members, to commit to elimination of industrial trans fat from the global food supply.\r\nTrans fat intake is responsible for over 500,000 deaths from coronary heart disease each year globally.",

They assessed the effects on young children of inadequate sleep, and time spent sitting watching screens or restrained in chairs and prams. They also reviewed evidence around the benefits of increased activity levels. </p><p>“Improving physical activity, reducing sedentary time and ensuring quality sleep in young children will improve their physical, mental health and wellbeing, and help prevent childhood obesity and associated diseases later in life,” says Dr Fiona Bull, programme manager for surveillance and population-based prevention of noncommunicable diseases, at WHO. </p><p>Failure to meet current physical activity recommendations is responsible for more than 5 million deaths globally each year across all age groups.  Currently, over 23% of adults and 80% of adolescents are not sufficiently physically active. If <a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" name=\"_Hlk6945847\">h</a>ealthy physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep habits are established early in life, this helps shape habits through childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.</p><p>“What we really need to do is bring back play for children,” says Dr Juana Willumsen, WHO focal point for childhood obesity and physical activity. “This is about making the shift from sedentary time to playtime, while protecting sleep. “</p><p>The pattern of overall 24-hour activity is key: replacing prolonged restrained or sedentary screen time with more active play, while making sure young children get enough good-quality sleep. Quality sedentary time spent in interactive non-screen-based activities with a caregiver, such as reading, storytelling, singing and puzzles, is very important for child development.</p><p>The important interactions between physical activity, sedentary behaviour and adequate sleep time, and their impact on physical and mental health and wellbeing, were recognized by the <a

    "content_html": "<div>\n<p>WHO welcomes the Government of Malawi’s launch of the world’s first malaria vaccine today in a landmark pilot programme. The country is the first of three in Africa in which the vaccine, known as RTS,S, will be made available to children up to 2 years of age; Ghana and Kenya will introduce the vaccine in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Malaria remains one of the world’s leading killers, claiming the life of one child every two minutes. Most of these deaths are in Africa, where more than 250 000 children die from the disease every year. Children under 5 are at greatest risk of its life-threatening complications. Worldwide, malaria kills 435 000 people a year, most of them children.</p>\n<p>“We have seen tremendous gains from bed nets and other measures to control malaria in the last 15 years, but progress has stalled and even reversed in some areas. We need new solutions to get the malaria response back on track, and this vaccine gives us a promising tool to get there,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “The malaria vaccine has the potential to save tens of thousands of children’s lives.”</p>\n<h2>An innovation milestone, three decades in development</h2>\n<p>Thirty years in the making, RTS,S is the first, and to date the only, vaccine that has demonstrated it can significantly reduce malaria in children. In clinical trials, the vaccine was found to prevent approximately 4 in 10 malaria cases, including 3 in 10 cases of life-threatening severe malaria</p>\n<p>“Malaria is a constant threat in the African communities where this vaccine will be given. The poorest children suffer the most and are at highest risk of death,” said<strong> </strong>Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “We know the power of vaccines to prevent killer diseases and reach children, including those who may not have immediate access to the doctors, nurses and health facilities they need to save them when severe illness comes.”</p>\n<p>“This is a day to celebrate as we begin to learn more about what this tool can do to change the trajectory of malaria through childhood vaccination,” she added.</p>\n<p>The pilot programme is designed to generate evidence and experience to inform WHO policy recommendations on the broader use of the RTS,S malaria vaccine. It will look at reductions in child deaths; vaccine uptake, including whether parents bring their children on time for the four required doses; and vaccine safety in the context of routine use.</p>\n<p>The vaccine is a complementary malaria control tool – to be added to the core package of WHO-recommended measures for malaria prevention, including the routine use of insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor spraying with insecticides, and the timely use of malaria testing and treatment.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>A model public-private partnership</h2>\n<p>The WHO-coordinated pilot programme is a collaborative effort with ministries of health in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi and a range of in-country and international partners, including PATH, a non-profit organization, and GSK, the vaccine developer and manufacturer, which is donating up to 10 million vaccine doses for this pilot.</p>\n<p>“We salute WHO and Malawi for their leadership in realizing this historic milestone,” said Steve Davis, President and CEO of PATH, “and we look forward to the start of vaccination in Ghana, and then Kenya later this year. A vaccine for malaria is among many innovations needed to bring an end to this disease, and we proudly stand with all countries and our many partners in progressing towards a malaria-free world.”</p>\n<p>The malaria vaccine pilot aims to reach about 360,000 children per year across the three countries. Ministries of health will determine where the vaccine will be given; they will focus on areas with moderate-to-high malaria transmission, where the vaccine can have the greatest impact. </p>\n<p>“Delivering the world’s first malaria vaccine will help reduce the burden of one of the most pressing health challenges globally. This novel tool is the result of GSK employees collaborating with their partners, applying the latest in vaccine science to contribute to the fight against malaria,” said Dr Thomas Breuer, Chief Medical Officer of GSK Vaccines. “We look forward to seeing the results of the pilot, and in parallel, are working with WHO and PATH to secure the vaccine’s sustained global health impact in the future.”</p>\n<h2>Financing and support</h2>\n<p>Financing for the pilot programme has been mobilized through an unprecedented collaboration among three key global health funding bodies: Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and Unitaid. Additionally, WHO, PATH and GSK are providing in-kind contributions.</p>\n<h2>Partner quotes</h2>\n<p><strong>Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi</strong></p>\n<p> “Malaria is still one of the biggest killers of children worldwide, taking the lives of over 200,000 children every year. These pilots will be crucial to determine the part this vaccine could play in reducing the burden this disease continues to place on the world’s poorest countries.”<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lelio Marmora, Executive Director of Unitaid</strong><br/>\r\n“The malaria vaccine is an exciting innovation that complements the global health community's efforts to end the malaria epidemic.

A vaccine for malaria is among many innovations needed to bring an end to this disease, and we proudly stand with all countries and our many partners in progressing towards a malaria-free world.”\r\nThe malaria vaccine pilot aims to reach about 360,000 children per year across the three countries. Ministries of health will determine where the vaccine will be given; they will focus on areas with moderate-to-high malaria transmission, where the vaccine can have the greatest impact. \r\n“Delivering the world’s first malaria vaccine will help reduce the burden of one of the most pressing health challenges globally. This novel tool is the result of GSK employees collaborating with their partners, applying the latest in vaccine science to contribute to the fight against malaria,” said Dr Thomas Breuer, Chief Medical Officer of GSK Vaccines. “We look forward to seeing the results of the pilot, and in parallel, are working with WHO and PATH to secure the vaccine’s sustained global health impact in the future.”\r\nFinancing and support\r\nFinancing for the pilot programme has been mobilized through an unprecedented collaboration among three key global health funding bodies: Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and Unitaid. Additionally, WHO, PATH and GSK are providing in-kind contributions.\r\nPartner quotes\r\nDr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi\r\n “Malaria is still one of the biggest killers of children worldwide, taking the lives of over 200,000 children every year. These pilots will be crucial to determine the part this vaccine could play in reducing the burden this disease continues to place on the world’s poorest countries.”\r\n\r\nLelio Marmora, Executive Director of Unitaid\r\n“The malaria vaccine is an exciting innovation that complements the global health community's efforts to end the malaria epidemic. It is also a shining example of the kind of inter-agency coordination that we need. We look forward to learning how the vaccine can be integrated for greatest impact into our work.”\r\n\r\nPeter Sands, Executive Director of the Global Fund\r\n“To step up the fight against malaria, we need every available tool. If this pilot shows that RTS,S is a cost-effective tool against malaria, it will help us save more children’s lives.”\r\n\r\nNotes to the editors:\r\n\r\n    Pilot countries: Following a request by WHO for expressions of interest, the pilot countries were selected from among 10 African countries. Key criteria for selection included well-functioning malaria and immunization programmes, and areas with moderate to high malaria transmission. \r\n    Proven results: In Phase 3 trials conducted in Africa, between 2009 and 2014, children receiving 4 doses of RTS,S experienced significant reductions in malaria and malaria-related complications, in comparison to those who did not receive RTS,S. The vaccine prevented 4 in 10 cases of clinical malaria; 3 in 10 cases of severe malaria; and 6 in 10 cases of severe malaria anaemia, the most common reason children die from malaria. Significant reductions were also seen in overall hospital admissions and the need for blood transfusions, which are required to treat severe malaria anaemia. These and other benefits were in addition to those already seen through the use of insecticide-treated nets (bed nets); prompt diagnosis; and effective antimalarial treatment.\r\n    Child vaccination schedule: In selected areas in the three countries, the vaccine will be given in 4 doses: 3 doses between 5 and 9 months of age and the fourth dose provided around the 2nd birthday.",

    "content_html": "<p>WHO today released new recommendations on 10 ways that countries can use digital health technology, accessible via mobile phones, tablets and computers, to improve people’s health and essential services. </p><p>“Harnessing the power of digital technologies is essential for achieving universal health coverage,” says WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Ultimately, digital technologies are not ends in themselves; they are vital tools to promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable.”</p><p>Over the past two years, WHO systematically reviewed evidence on digital technologies and consulted with experts from around the world to produce recommendations on some key ways such tools may be used for maximum impact on health systems and people’s health.</p><p>One digital intervention already having positive effects in some areas is sending reminders to pregnant women to attend antenatal care appointments and having children return for vaccinations. Other digital approaches reviewed include decision-support tools to guide health workers as they provide care; and enabling individuals and health workers to communicate and consult on health issues from across different locations. </p><p>“The use of digital technologies offers new opportunities to improve people’s health,” says Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist at WHO. “But the evidence also highlights challenges in the impact of some interventions.”</p><p>She adds: “If digital technologies are to be sustained and integrated into health systems, they must be able to demonstrate long-term improvements over the traditional ways of delivering health services.”</p><p>For example, the guideline points to the potential to improve stock management. Digital technologies enable health workers to communicate more efficiently on the status of commodity stocks and gaps. However, notification alone is not enough to improve commodity management; health systems also must respond and take action in a timely manner for replenishing needed commodities.  </p><p>“Digital interventions, depend heavily on the context and ensuring appropriate design,” warns Dr Garrett Mehl, WHO scientist in digital innovations and research. “This includes structural issues in the settings where they are being used, available infrastructure, the health needs they are trying to address, and the ease of use of the technology itself.”</p><h2>Digital health interventions are not sufficient on their own</h2><p>The guideline demonstrates that health systems need to respond to the increased visibility and availability of information. People also must be assured that their own data is safe and that they are not being put at risk because they have accessed information on sensitive health topics, such as sexual and reproductive health issues. </p><p>Health workers need adequate training to boost their motivation to transition to this new way of working and need to use the technology easily. The guideline stresses the importance of providing supportive environments for training, dealing with unstable infrastructure, as well as policies to protect privacy of individuals, and governance and coordination to ensure these tools are not fragmented across the health system.</p><p>The guideline encourages policy-makers and implementers to review and adapt to these conditions if they want digital tools to drive tangible changes and provides guidance on taking privacy considerations on access to patient data.</p><p>“Digital health is not a silver bullet,” says Bernardo Mariano, WHO’s Chief Information Officer. “WHO is working to make sure it’s used as effectively as possible. This means ensuring that it adds value to the health workers and individuals using these technologies, takes into account the infrastructural limitations, and that there is proper coordination.” </p><p>The guideline also makes recommendations about telemedicine, which allows people living in remote locations to obtain health services by using mobile phones, web portals, or other digital tools. WHO points out that this is a valuable complement to face-to-face-interactions, but it cannot replace them entirely. It is also important that consultations are conducted by qualified health workers and that the privacy of individuals’ health information is maintained. </p><p>The guideline emphasizes the importance of reaching vulnerable populations, and ensuring that digital health does not endanger them in any way. </p><h2>WHO’s work on digital health</h2><p>This guideline represents the first of many explorations into the use of digital technologies and has only covered a fraction of the many aspects of digital health. </p><p>In 2018, governments unanimously adopted a World Health Assembly resolution calling on WHO to develop a global strategy on digital health to support national efforts to achieve universal health coverage. That strategy is scheduled to be considered at the World Health Assembly in 2020.</p><p>Although WHO is expanding its focus on digital health, the Organization has been working in this area for years, for example, through the development of the eHealth Strategy Toolkit in 2012, published in collaboration with International Telecommunications Union (ITU). </p><p>To support governments in monitoring and coordination of digital investments in their country, WHO has developed the Digital Health Atlas, an online global repository where implementers can register their digital health activities.

      "description": "WHO today released new recommendations on 10 ways that countries can use digital health technology, accessible via mobile phones, tablets and computers, to improve people’s health and essential services. “Harnessing the power of digital technologies is essential for achieving universal health coverage,” says WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Ultimately, digital technologies are not ends in themselves; they are vital tools to promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable.”Over the past two years, WHO systematically reviewed evidence on digital technologies and consulted with experts from around the world to produce recommendations on some key ways such tools may be used for maximum impact on health systems and people’s health.One digital intervention already having positive effects in some areas is sending reminders to pregnant women to attend antenatal care appointments and having children return for vaccinations. Other digital approaches reviewed include decision-support tools to guide health workers as they provide care; and enabling individuals and health workers to communicate and consult on health issues from across different locations. “The use of digital technologies offers new opportunities to improve people’s health,” says Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist at WHO. “But the evidence also highlights challenges in the impact of some interventions.”She adds: “If digital technologies are to be sustained and integrated into health systems, they must be able to demonstrate long-term improvements over the traditional ways of delivering health services.”For example, the guideline points to the potential to improve stock management. Digital technologies enable health workers to communicate more efficiently on the status of commodity stocks and gaps. However, notification alone is not enough to improve commodity management; health systems also must respond and take action in a timely manner for replenishing needed commodities.  “Digital interventions, depend heavily on the context and ensuring appropriate design,” warns Dr Garrett Mehl, WHO scientist in digital innovations and research. “This includes structural issues in the settings where they are being used, available infrastructure, the health needs they are trying to address, and the ease of use of the technology itself.”Digital health interventions are not sufficient on their ownThe guideline demonstrates that health systems need to respond to the increased visibility and availability of information. People also must be assured that their own data is safe and that they are not being put at risk because they have accessed information on sensitive health topics, such as sexual and reproductive health issues. Health workers need adequate training to boost their motivation to transition to this new way of working and need to use the technology easily. The guideline stresses the importance of providing supportive environments for training, dealing with unstable infrastructure, as well as policies to protect privacy of individuals, and governance and coordination to ensure these tools are not fragmented across the health system.The guideline encourages policy-makers and implementers to review and adapt to these conditions if they want digital tools to drive tangible changes and provides guidance on taking privacy considerations on access to patient data.“Digital health is not a silver bullet,” says Bernardo Mariano, WHO’s Chief Information Officer. “WHO is working to make sure it’s used as effectively as possible. This means ensuring that it adds value to the health workers and individuals using these technologies, takes into account the infrastructural limitations, and that there is proper coordination.” The guideline also makes recommendations about telemedicine, which allows people living in remote locations to obtain health services by using mobile phones, web portals, or other digital tools. WHO points out that this is a valuable complement to face-to-face-interactions, but it cannot replace them entirely. It is also important that consultations are conducted by qualified health workers and that the privacy of individuals’ health information is maintained. The guideline emphasizes the importance of reaching vulnerable populations, and ensuring that digital health does not endanger them in any way. WHO’s work on digital healthThis guideline represents the first of many explorations into the use of digital technologies and has only covered a fraction of the many aspects of digital health. In 2018, governments unanimously adopted a World Health Assembly resolution calling on WHO to develop a global strategy on digital health to support national efforts to achieve universal health coverage. That strategy is scheduled to be considered at the World Health Assembly in 2020.Although WHO is expanding its focus on digital health, the Organization has been working in this area for years, for example, through the development of the eHealth Strategy Toolkit in 2012, published in collaboration with International Telecommunications Union (ITU). To support governments in monitoring and coordination of digital investments in their country, WHO has developed the Digital Health Atlas, an online global repository where implementers can register their digital health activities. WHO has also established innovative partnerships with the ITU, such as the BeHe@lthy, BeMobile initiative for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, as well as efforts for building digital health capacity through the WHO Regional Office for Africa.  Over the years, WHO has released a number of resources to strengthen digital health research and implementation, including the mHealth Assessment and Planning for Scale (MAPS) toolkit, a handbook for Monitoring and Evaluation of Digital Health, and mechanisms to harness digital health to end TB.On 6 March 2019, Dr Tedros announced the creation of the Department of Digital Health to enhance WHO’s role in assessing digital technologies and support Member States in prioritizing, integrating and regulating them.",

      "description": "The meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) regarding Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo took place on Friday, 12th April, 2019, from 13:00 to 17:20 Geneva time (CET).Key Findings:It was the view of the Committee the ongoing Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo does not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). However, the Committee wished to express their deep concern about the recent increase in transmission in specific areas, and therefore the potential risk of spread to neighbouring countries.The Committee also wishes to commend the efforts of responders from the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the World Health Organization and partners to contain the outbreak in a complex and difficult setting. Additionally, the Committee has provided the following public health advice:  The committee advises to redouble efforts to detect cases as early as possible, identify and follow up all contacts, ensure the highest level of coverage vaccination of all contacts and contacts of contacts.Sustained efforts must be made to prevent nosocomial transmission and to shorten time between onset of disease and access to high standards of care and therapeutics at Ebola treatment units. Special emphasis should be placed on addressing the rise in case numbers in the remaining epicentres, notably Butembo, Katwa, Vuhovi, and Mandima. The Committee advises WHO and all partners to identify, target, and scale up community dialogue and participation, engagement of traditional healers, and other community engagement tactics to strengthen and broaden community acceptance. The Committee also noted the need to follow the recommendations of SAGE with regards to the vaccination strategy provided at its latest meeting.The safety of responders should be prioritized, while avoiding the securitization of the response.Because there is a very high risk of regional spread, neighbouring countries should continue to accelerate current preparedness and surveillance efforts, including vaccination of health care workers and front-line workers in surrounding countries.Cross-border collaboration should continue to be strengthened, including timely sharing of data and alerts, cross-border community engagement and awareness raising. In addition, work should be done to better map population movements and understand social networks bridging national boundaries. The Committee maintains its previous advice that it is particularly important that no international travel or trade restrictions should be applied. Exit screening, including at airports, ports, and land crossings, is of great importance; however, entry screening, particularly in distant airports, is not considered to be of any public health or cost-benefit value. The committee strongly emphasized the critical need to strengthen currents efforts in both preparedness and response. This will require substantial, immediate and sustained additional financial support. While there is no added benefit to declaring a PHEIC at this stage, there was concern about current levels of transmission requiring close attention to the evolving situation. The committee advised the WHO Director General to continue to monitor the situation closely and reconvene the Emergency Committee as needed.Proceedings of the meetingMembers and advisors of the Emergency Committee met by teleconference. Presentations were made by representatives of the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the epidemiological situation, the response strategies, and recent adaptations, including a shift in strategy to improve engagement of the community in the response.A representative of the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (MONUSCO) reported on the work of MONUSCO, including its logistics and security activities to support the response. The WHO Secretariat gave an update on the current situation and provided detail of the response to the current Ebola outbreak and preparedness activities in neighbouring countries.The Committee’s role was to provide to the Director-General its views and perspectives on: Whether the event constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)If the event constitutes a PHEIC, what Temporary Recommendations should be made.Based on the above advice, the reports made by the affected State Party, and the currently available information, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 12 April 2019 did not declare the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In light of the advice of the Emergency Committee, WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions. The Director-General thanked the Committee Members and Advisors for their advice.",

The <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/324835/9789241565707-eng.pdf\">World Health Statistics 2019</a> – disaggregated by sex for the first time – explains why.</p>\n<p>“Breaking down data by age, sex and income group is vital for understanding who is being left behind and why,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. </p>\n<p>“Behind every number in the World Health Statistics is a person, a family, a community or a nation. Our task is to use these data to make evidence-based policy decisions that move us closer to a healthier, safer, fairer world for everyone.”</p>\n<p>The gap between men’s and women’s life expectancy is narrowest where women lack access to health services. In low-income countries, where services are scarcer, 1 in 41 women dies from a maternal cause, compared with 1 in 3300 in high-income countries. In more than 90 per cent of low-income countries, there are fewer than 4 nursing and midwifery personnel per 1000 people.</p>\n<p>Attitudes to healthcare differ. Where men and women face the same disease, men often seek health care less than women.  In countries with generalized HIV epidemics, for example, men are less likely than women to take an HIV test, less likely to access antiretroviral therapy and more likely to die of AIDS-related illnesses than women. Similarly, male TB patients appear to be less likely to seek care than female TB patients.</p>\n<p>The report also highlights the difference in causes of death between men and women – some biological, some influenced by environmental and societal factors, and some impacted by availability of and uptake of health services.</p>\n<p>Of the 40 leading causes of death, 33 causes contribute more to reduced life expectancy in men than in women. In 2016, the probability of a 30-year-old dying from a noncommunicable disease before 70 years of age was 44% higher in men than women. </p>\n<p>Global suicide mortality rates were 75% higher in men than in women in 2016. Death rates from road injury are more than twice as high in men than in women from age 15, and mortality rates due to homicide are 4 times higher in men than in women.</p>\n<p>Published to coincide with World Health Day on 7 April, which this year focuses on primary health care as the foundation of universal health coverage, the new WHO statistics highlight the need to improve access to primary health care worldwide and to increase uptake. </p>\n<p>“One of WHO’s triple billion goals is for 1 billion more people to have universal health coverage by 2023,” said Dr. Tedros. “This means improving access to services, especially at community level, and making sure those services are accessible, affordable, and effective for everyone – regardless of their gender.”</p>\n<p>“These statistics underscore the need to prioritize primary health care urgently to effectively manage noncommunicable diseases, and to curb risk factors.” said Dr. Samira Asma, WHO Assistant Director General for Data, Analytics and Delivery. “For example, something as simple as controlling blood pressure is just not happening on the scale needed and tobacco use remains a leading cause of premature death.”</p>\n<h2>Life expectancy has improved since 2000</h2>\n<p>Between 2000 and 2016, global life-expectancy at birth increased by 5.5 years, from 66.5 to 72.0 years.  Healthy life expectancy at birth - the number of years one can expect to live in full health- increased from 58.5 years in 2000 to 63.3 years in 2016. </p>\n<p>Life expectancy remains strongly affected by income. In low-income countries, life expectancy is 18.1 years lower than in high-income countries. One child in every 14 born in a low-income country will die before their fifth birthday. </p>\n<p>For the first time, this year, WHO’s Global Health Statistics have been disaggregated by sex. This new analysis has provided insights into the health and needs of people around the world. But many countries still struggle to provide gender disaggregated information.</p>\n<p>“Closing data gaps will accelerate and is important to closing the gender gap,” said Dr. Richard Cibulskis, the report’s main author. “Collecting, analyzing, and using good quality, disaggregated data is central to improving people’s health and wellbeing. Health policy and practice must be underpinned by robust and reliable data, generated in countries.”</p>",

The goal of the strategy is to prevent seasonal influenza, control the spread of influenza from animals to humans, and prepare for the next influenza pandemic.</p>\n<p>“The threat of pandemic influenza is ever-present.” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “The on-going risk of a new influenza virus transmitting from animals to humans and potentially causing a pandemic is real.   The question is not if we will have another pandemic, but when.  We must be vigilant and prepared – the cost of a major influenza outbreak will far outweigh the price of prevention.”</p>\n<p>Influenza remains one of the world’s greatest public health challenges. Every year across the globe, there are an estimated 1 billion cases, of which 3 to 5 million are severe cases, resulting in 290 000 to 650 000 influenza-related respiratory deaths. WHO recommends annual influenza vaccination as the most effective way to prevent influenza. Vaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of serious influenza complications and for health care workers.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe new strategy is the most comprehensive and far-reaching that WHO has ever developed for influenza.  It outlines a path to protect populations every year and helps prepare for a pandemic through strengthening routine programmes. It has two overarching goals:<br/>\n </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Build stronger country capacities for disease surveillance and response, prevention and control, and preparedness. To achieve this, it calls for <em>every</em> country to have a tailored influenza programme that contributes to national and global preparedness and health security.</li>\n<li>Develop better tools to prevent, detect, control and treat influenza, such as more effective vaccines, antivirals and treatments, with the goal of making these accessible for <em>all</em> countries.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n“With the partnerships and country-specific work we have been doing over the years, the world is better prepared than ever before for the next big outbreak, but we are still not prepared enough,” said Dr Tedros. “This strategy aims to get us to that point. Fundamentally, it is about preparing health systems to manage shocks, and this only happens when health systems are strong and healthy themselves.”</p>\n<p>To successfully implement this strategy, effective partnerships are essential.  WHO will expand partnerships to increase research, innovation and availability of new and improved global influenza tools to benefit all countries.  At the same time WHO will work closely with countries to improve their capacities to prevent and control influenza.</p>\n<p>The new influenza strategy builds on and benefits from successful WHO programmes.  For more than 65 years, the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), comprised   of WHO Collaborating Centres and national influenza centres, have worked together to monitor seasonal trends and potentially pandemic viruses. This system serves as the backbone of the global alert system for influenza. </p>\n<p>Important to the strategy is the on-going success of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework, a unique access and benefit sharing system that supports the sharing of potentially pandemic viruses, provides access to life saving vaccines and treatments in the event of a pandemic and supports the building of pandemic preparedness capacities in countries through partnership contributions from industry.</p>\n<p>The strategy meets one of WHO’s mandates to improve core capacities for public health, and increase global preparedness and was developed through a consultative process with input from Member States, academia, civil society, industry, and internal and external experts.</p>\n<p>Supporting countries to strengthen their influenza capacity will have collateral benefits in detecting infection in general, since countries will be able to better identify other infectious diseases like Ebola or Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV).</p>\n<p>Through the implementation of the new WHO global influenza strategy, the world will be closer to reducing the impact of influenza every year and be more prepared for an influenza pandemic and other public health emergencies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/311184\">Read the Global Influenza Strategy </a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.who.int/influenza\">More about influenza</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>",

They do not deserve to suffer in their homes while infecting their loved ones, they do not deserve to suffer in inadequately resourced health centers while infecting health workers,” he added.",
          "WHO has requested and received further support from UN and local police forces to protect the treatment centres. To conquer Ebola, we must strike a delicate balance between providing accessible care, maintaining the neutrality of the response, and protecting patients and staff from attacks by armed groups. These are the dilemmas we face in conflict zones around the world.  We are committed to ending the outbreak, and we are committed to improving the health of the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” he concluded."

    "content_html": "<div>\n<p>The twentieth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director General on 19 February 2019 at WHO headquarters with members, advisers and invited Member States attending via teleconference, supported by the WHO secretariat. </p>\n<p>The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV).  The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations.  The following IHR States Parties provided an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 27 November 2018: Afghanistan, Indonesia, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea (PNG). </p>\n<p>The committee commended all countries that presented on the quality of information provided, and the attention by the health authorities to ensuring timely and adequate responses in the field.</p>\n<h2>Wild poliovirus</h2>\n<p>Worldwide there are three remaining endemic countries, with Afghanistan and Pakistan being the only two countries where wild poliovirus transmission is continuing to be reported.  The Committee noted the continued high degree of cooperation and coordination between Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border.  The committee noted that it is more than four years since there has been international spread outside of these two epidemiologically linked countries.</p>\n<p>However, the Committee was very concerned by the increase in WPV1 cases globally in 2018, with more cases in the two countries than in 2017.  This trend appears to be continuing in 2019, with six cases already compared to two for the same period in 2018.  Furthermore, international spread between the two countries has continued, after an earlier 10-month period of no international spread between the two neighbors.  The committee welcomed that expansion of the target age group for vaccination at the international land border was being implemented on a trial basis in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>In Pakistan transmission continues to be widespread, as indicated by the number of positive environmental isolates in many areas of the country.  The recent case in Lahore also indicated vulnerabilities still exist outside the high-risk corridors.</p>\n<p>In Afghanistan, the worsened security and accessibility since early 2018 continues, and there are persistent pockets of refusals and missed children.  Environmental surveillance is also finding an increased proportion of positive samples.  The security situation and access would need to significantly improve for eradication efforts to progress. The recent visit of the Director General of WHO to both countries, meeting with their Heads of State, was a very positive step.</p>\n<p>It is now more than two years since the last WPV1 was detected in Nigeria, and four years since there has been any international spread of WPV1 from the country.  The Committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity, and noted that the inaccessible target population was now down to around 70,000 children, scattered across Borno State in smaller pockets. </p>\n<h2>Vaccine derived poliovirus</h2>\n<p>There are now eight countries in four WHO Regions responding to outbreaks of cVDPV, an unprecedented number of outbreaks in recent years.  The new outbreak of cVDPV1 in Indonesia exemplifies the gaps in population immunity in many parts of the world considered polio free.  It appears likely that there has been missed transmission of this virus for several years although there is no evidence so far that this has occurred outside of Papua province.  However, surveillance within Indonesia urgently needs to improve, not just in Papua and West Papua provinces.  PNG continues to mount a very effective response, and the committee noted that both Indonesia and PNG had been pro-active in ensuring effective coordination on both sides of the border.</p>\n<p>The new outbreak of cVDPV2 in Mozambique is a serious concern, as it may be linked to inadequate controls placed upon unused vials mOPV2 during the earlier event there in 2017.  The committee noted that the case occurred close to the border with Malawi, prompting concern about the opportunity for international spread. </p>\n<p>The cVDPV2 outbreaks in Nigeria highlight the vulnerability to poliovirus infection in many parts of the country, with the virus spreading to areas not previously considered at high risk of polio, such as Kwara.  Although no international spread of WPV1 has been observed from Nigeria since 2014, the recent cases of importation of cVDPV2 into Niger is concerning, given that cVDPVs have rarely spread across borders in the past.  The committee was concerned by the lack of progress in controlling this outbreak, and the proximity of a recent case to the Republic of Benin.  The committee noted the delays between case investigation and final laboratory results and suggested an analysis be undertaken to understand the reasons for this.</p>\n<p>Repeated importations from Nigeria into Niger indicates that while strong efforts had been made to respond to risks posed by high risk populations such as cattle herders and other nomads, IDP’s and refugees, more needs to be done to prevent future international spread between Nigeria and Niger.  Surveillance gaps in nearby vulnerable countries in the Lake Chad area raises concerns about missed transmission in these countries.</p>\n<p>The outbreak of cVDPV2 in Somalia and Kenya is another infrequent example of international spread of cVDPV across borders.  The absence of transmission in recent months in Somalia and Kenya was welcomed, however, large inaccessible areas of Somalia are a significant constraint on achieving interruption of transmission, exacerbated by large population movements escaping conflict or driven by economic and security factors.  Countries neighboring Somalia, such as South Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti, have areas of weak surveillance which poses a risk that international spread may go undetected.</p>\n<p>Although there are indications that transmission may be slowing in DR Congo, the protracted duration of the outbreak, ongoing conflict, insecurity and population movements within and outside the country represent a significant risk of spread. </p>\n<p>The committee noted that in all infected countries, routine immunization was weak, and coverage remains very poor in many areas of these countries.</p>\n<p>Inaccessibility is a major risk to interruption of transmission in Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Afghanistan.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rising number of WPV1 cases:</strong>  Although the declaration of the PHEIC and issuance of Temporary Recommendations has reduced the risk of international spread of WPV, progress is fragile, and should international spread now occur, the impact on WPV eradication would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and prolonging requirements for dedicated human and financial resources in support of the eradication effort.  The increasing cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan with associated cross border spread of WPV1 continuing between the two countries as well as the widespread geographic detection through environmental sampling of the virus in Pakistan heighten concerns, especially as cases have increased during the current low season</li>\n<li><strong>Complacency:</strong> There is a risk of global complacency as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and a concern that removal of the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency. </li>\n<li><strong>Rising number of cVDPV outbreaks:</strong> Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation.  Gaps in population immunity in several key high-risk areas is evidenced by the current number of cVDPV outbreaks of all serotypes, which only emerge and circulate when polio population immunity is low as a result of deficient routine immunization programs.  Currently four WHO Regions are managing polio outbreaks.</li>\n<li><strong>International spread of cVDPV:</strong> The international spread of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, and Nigeria and Niger, are other examples of the current heightened risk of international spread of polioviruses.  Waning population immunity to type 2 polioviruses in the face of the limited IPV supply and weak routine immunization in many countries means that significant numbers of countries neighboring these outbreaks may be at high risk of importation of cVDPV2.</li>\n<li><strong>Weak routine immunization:</strong> Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.</li>\n<li><strong>Surveillance gaps:</strong> The appearance of highly diverged VDPVs in Somalia and Indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance, heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries.  Similar gaps exist in Lake Chad countries and around the Horn of Africa.</li>\n<li><strong>Protracted outbreaks:</strong> The difficulty in rapidly controlling VDPV outbreaks in Nigeria and DR Congo was another risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of access:</strong> Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.</li>\n<li><strong>Population movement:</strong> The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks.  A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Risk categories</h2>\n<p>The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread.</li>\n<li>States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread.</li>\n<li>States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Poliovirus Case:</strong> 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.</li>\n<li><strong>Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case):</strong> 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period</li>\n<li>These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (e.g. Borno)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report.</p>\n<h2>Temporary recommendations</h2>\n<h3>States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>WPV1                                                                     </h4>\n<p>Afghanistan                         (most recent detection 26 January 2019)    </p>\n<p>Pakistan                                        (most recent detection 28 January 2019)</p>\n<p>Nigeria                                (most recent detection 27 Sept 2016)           </p>\n<h4>cVDPV1</h4>\n<p>Papua New Guinea                        (most recent detection 7 November 2018)</p>\n<p>Indonesia                                           (most recent detection 25 January 2019)</p>\n<h4>cVDPV3</h4>\n<p>Somalia                                               (most recent detection 7 Sept 2018)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These countries should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.</li>\n<li>Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. &gt; four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.</li>\n<li>Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers.</li>\n<li>Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.</li>\n<li>Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea).</li>\n<li>Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations.

          "Worldwide there are three remaining endemic countries, with Afghanistan and Pakistan being the only two countries where wild poliovirus transmission is continuing to be reported.  The Committee noted the continued high degree of cooperation and coordination between Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border.  The committee noted that it is more than four years since there has been international spread outside of these two epidemiologically linked countries.",
          "However, the Committee was very concerned by the increase in WPV1 cases globally in 2018, with more cases in the two countries than in 2017.  This trend appears to be continuing in 2019, with six cases already compared to two for the same period in 2018.  Furthermore, international spread between the two countries has continued, after an earlier 10-month period of no international spread between the two neighbors.  The committee welcomed that expansion of the target age group for vaccination at the international land border was being implemented on a trial basis in Afghanistan.",
          "In Pakistan transmission continues to be widespread, as indicated by the number of positive environmental isolates in many areas of the country.  The recent case in Lahore also indicated vulnerabilities still exist outside the high-risk corridors.",
          "In Afghanistan, the worsened security and accessibility since early 2018 continues, and there are persistent pockets of refusals and missed children.  Environmental surveillance is also finding an increased proportion of positive samples.  The security situation and access would need to significantly improve for eradication efforts to progress. The recent visit of the Director General of WHO to both countries, meeting with their Heads of State, was a very positive step.",
          "It is now more than two years since the last WPV1 was detected in Nigeria, and four years since there has been any international spread of WPV1 from the country.  The Committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity, and noted that the inaccessible target population was now down to around 70,000 children, scattered across Borno State in smaller pockets."

          "There are now eight countries in four WHO Regions responding to outbreaks of cVDPV, an unprecedented number of outbreaks in recent years.  The new outbreak of cVDPV1 in Indonesia exemplifies the gaps in population immunity in many parts of the world considered polio free.  It appears likely that there has been missed transmission of this virus for several years although there is no evidence so far that this has occurred outside of Papua province.  However, surveillance within Indonesia urgently needs to improve, not just in Papua and West Papua provinces.  PNG continues to mount a very effective response, and the committee noted that both Indonesia and PNG had been pro-active in ensuring effective coordination on both sides of the border.",
          "The new outbreak of cVDPV2 in Mozambique is a serious concern, as it may be linked to inadequate controls placed upon unused vials mOPV2 during the earlier event there in 2017.  The committee noted that the case occurred close to the border with Malawi, prompting concern about the opportunity for international spread.",
          "The cVDPV2 outbreaks in Nigeria highlight the vulnerability to poliovirus infection in many parts of the country, with the virus spreading to areas not previously considered at high risk of polio, such as Kwara.  Although no international spread of WPV1 has been observed from Nigeria since 2014, the recent cases of importation of cVDPV2 into Niger is concerning, given that cVDPVs have rarely spread across borders in the past.  The committee was concerned by the lack of progress in controlling this outbreak, and the proximity of a recent case to the Republic of Benin.  The committee noted the delays between case investigation and final laboratory results and suggested an analysis be undertaken to understand the reasons for this.",
          "Repeated importations from Nigeria into Niger indicates that while strong efforts had been made to respond to risks posed by high risk populations such as cattle herders and other nomads, IDP’s and refugees, more needs to be done to prevent future international spread between Nigeria and Niger.  Surveillance gaps in nearby vulnerable countries in the Lake Chad area raises concerns about missed transmission in these countries.",
          "The outbreak of cVDPV2 in Somalia and Kenya is another infrequent example of international spread of cVDPV across borders.  The absence of transmission in recent months in Somalia and Kenya was welcomed, however, large inaccessible areas of Somalia are a significant constraint on achieving interruption of transmission, exacerbated by large population movements escaping conflict or driven by economic and security factors.  Countries neighboring Somalia, such as South Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti, have areas of weak surveillance which poses a risk that international spread may go undetected.",
          "Although there are indications that transmission may be slowing in DR Congo, the protracted duration of the outbreak, ongoing conflict, insecurity and population movements within and outside the country represent a significant risk of spread.",
          "The committee noted that in all infected countries, routine immunization was weak, and coverage remains very poor in many areas of these countries.",
          "Inaccessibility is a major risk to interruption of transmission in Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Afghanistan."

          "The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:"
        ],
        "bullets": [
          "Rising number of WPV1 cases: Although the declaration of the PHEIC and issuance of Temporary Recommendations has reduced the risk of international spread of WPV, progress is fragile, and should international spread now occur, the impact on WPV eradication would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and prolonging requirements for dedicated human and financial resources in support of the eradication effort.  The increasing cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan with associated cross border spread of WPV1 continuing between the two countries as well as the widespread geographic detection through environmental sampling of the virus in Pakistan heighten concerns, especially as cases have increased during the current low season",
          "Complacency: There is a risk of global complacency as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and a concern that removal of the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency.",
          "Rising number of cVDPV outbreaks: Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation.  Gaps in population immunity in several key high-risk areas is evidenced by the current number of cVDPV outbreaks of all serotypes, which only emerge and circulate when polio population immunity is low as a result of deficient routine immunization programs.  Currently four WHO Regions are managing polio outbreaks.",
          "International spread of cVDPV: The international spread of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, and Nigeria and Niger, are other examples of the current heightened risk of international spread of polioviruses.  Waning population immunity to type 2 polioviruses in the face of the limited IPV supply and weak routine immunization in many countries means that significant numbers of countries neighboring these outbreaks may be at high risk of importation of cVDPV2.",
          "Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.",
          "Surveillance gaps: The appearance of highly diverged VDPVs in Somalia and Indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance, heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries.  Similar gaps exist in Lake Chad countries and around the Horn of Africa.",
          "Protracted outbreaks: The difficulty in rapidly controlling VDPV outbreaks in Nigeria and DR Congo was another risk.",
          "Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.",
          "Population movement: The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks.  A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders."

      "description": "The twentieth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the Director General on 19 February 2019 at WHO headquarters with members, advisers and invited Member States attending via teleconference, supported by the WHO secretariat. \r\nThe Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV).  The Secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR States Parties subject to Temporary Recommendations.  The following IHR States Parties provided an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 27 November 2018: Afghanistan, Indonesia, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea (PNG). \r\nThe committee commended all countries that presented on the quality of information provided, and the attention by the health authorities to ensuring timely and adequate responses in the field.\r\nWild poliovirus\r\nWorldwide there are three remaining endemic countries, with Afghanistan and Pakistan being the only two countries where wild poliovirus transmission is continuing to be reported.  The Committee noted the continued high degree of cooperation and coordination between Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border.  The committee noted that it is more than four years since there has been international spread outside of these two epidemiologically linked countries.\r\nHowever, the Committee was very concerned by the increase in WPV1 cases globally in 2018, with more cases in the two countries than in 2017.  This trend appears to be continuing in 2019, with six cases already compared to two for the same period in 2018.  Furthermore, international spread between the two countries has continued, after an earlier 10-month period of no international spread between the two neighbors.  The committee welcomed that expansion of the target age group for vaccination at the international land border was being implemented on a trial basis in Afghanistan.\r\nIn Pakistan transmission continues to be widespread, as indicated by the number of positive environmental isolates in many areas of the country.  The recent case in Lahore also indicated vulnerabilities still exist outside the high-risk corridors.\r\nIn Afghanistan, the worsened security and accessibility since early 2018 continues, and there are persistent pockets of refusals and missed children.  Environmental surveillance is also finding an increased proportion of positive samples.  The security situation and access would need to significantly improve for eradication efforts to progress. The recent visit of the Director General of WHO to both countries, meeting with their Heads of State, was a very positive step.\r\nIt is now more than two years since the last WPV1 was detected in Nigeria, and four years since there has been any international spread of WPV1 from the country.  The Committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity, and noted that the inaccessible target population was now down to around 70,000 children, scattered across Borno State in smaller pockets. \r\nVaccine derived poliovirus\r\nThere are now eight countries in four WHO Regions responding to outbreaks of cVDPV, an unprecedented number of outbreaks in recent years.  The new outbreak of cVDPV1 in Indonesia exemplifies the gaps in population immunity in many parts of the world considered polio free.  It appears likely that there has been missed transmission of this virus for several years although there is no evidence so far that this has occurred outside of Papua province.  However, surveillance within Indonesia urgently needs to improve, not just in Papua and West Papua provinces.  PNG continues to mount a very effective response, and the committee noted that both Indonesia and PNG had been pro-active in ensuring effective coordination on both sides of the border.\r\nThe new outbreak of cVDPV2 in Mozambique is a serious concern, as it may be linked to inadequate controls placed upon unused vials mOPV2 during the earlier event there in 2017.  The committee noted that the case occurred close to the border with Malawi, prompting concern about the opportunity for international spread. \r\nThe cVDPV2 outbreaks in Nigeria highlight the vulnerability to poliovirus infection in many parts of the country, with the virus spreading to areas not previously considered at high risk of polio, such as Kwara.  Although no international spread of WPV1 has been observed from Nigeria since 2014, the recent cases of importation of cVDPV2 into Niger is concerning, given that cVDPVs have rarely spread across borders in the past.  The committee was concerned by the lack of progress in controlling this outbreak, and the proximity of a recent case to the Republic of Benin.  The committee noted the delays between case investigation and final laboratory results and suggested an analysis be undertaken to understand the reasons for this.\r\nRepeated importations from Nigeria into Niger indicates that while strong efforts had been made to respond to risks posed by high risk populations such as cattle herders and other nomads, IDP’s and refugees, more needs to be done to prevent future international spread between Nigeria and Niger.  Surveillance gaps in nearby vulnerable countries in the Lake Chad area raises concerns about missed transmission in these countries.\r\nThe outbreak of cVDPV2 in Somalia and Kenya is another infrequent example of international spread of cVDPV across borders.  The absence of transmission in recent months in Somalia and Kenya was welcomed, however, large inaccessible areas of Somalia are a significant constraint on achieving interruption of transmission, exacerbated by large population movements escaping conflict or driven by economic and security factors.  Countries neighboring Somalia, such as South Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti, have areas of weak surveillance which poses a risk that international spread may go undetected.\r\nAlthough there are indications that transmission may be slowing in DR Congo, the protracted duration of the outbreak, ongoing conflict, insecurity and population movements within and outside the country represent a significant risk of spread. \r\nThe committee noted that in all infected countries, routine immunization was weak, and coverage remains very poor in many areas of these countries.\r\nInaccessibility is a major risk to interruption of transmission in Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Afghanistan.\r\nConclusion\r\nThe Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:\r\n \r\n\r\n    Rising number of WPV1 cases:  Although the declaration of the PHEIC and issuance of Temporary Recommendations has reduced the risk of international spread of WPV, progress is fragile, and should international spread now occur, the impact on WPV eradication would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and prolonging requirements for dedicated human and financial resources in support of the eradication effort.  The increasing cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan with associated cross border spread of WPV1 continuing between the two countries as well as the widespread geographic detection through environmental sampling of the virus in Pakistan heighten concerns, especially as cases have increased during the current low season\r\n    Complacency: There is a risk of global complacency as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and a concern that removal of the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency. \r\n    Rising number of cVDPV outbreaks: Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation.  Gaps in population immunity in several key high-risk areas is evidenced by the current number of cVDPV outbreaks of all serotypes, which only emerge and circulate when polio population immunity is low as a result of deficient routine immunization programs.  Currently four WHO Regions are managing polio outbreaks.\r\n    International spread of cVDPV: The international spread of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, and Nigeria and Niger, are other examples of the current heightened risk of international spread of polioviruses.  Waning population immunity to type 2 polioviruses in the face of the limited IPV supply and weak routine immunization in many countries means that significant numbers of countries neighboring these outbreaks may be at high risk of importation of cVDPV2.\r\n    Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.\r\n    Surveillance gaps: The appearance of highly diverged VDPVs in Somalia and Indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance, heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries.  Similar gaps exist in Lake Chad countries and around the Horn of Africa.\r\n    Protracted outbreaks: The difficulty in rapidly controlling VDPV outbreaks in Nigeria and DR Congo was another risk.\r\n    Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.\r\n    Population movement: The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks.  A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.\r\n\r\nRisk categories\r\nThe Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:\r\n \r\n\r\n    States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread.\r\n    States infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread.\r\n    States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.\r\n\r\nCriteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV:\r\n\r\n    Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer.\r\n    Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period\r\n    These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps (e.g. Borno)\r\n\r\nOnce a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report.\r\nTemporary recommendations\r\nStates infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread\r\n \r\nWPV1                                                                     \r\nAfghanistan                         (most recent detection 26 January 2019)    \r\nPakistan                                        (most recent detection 28 January 2019)\r\nNigeria                                (most recent detection 27 Sept 2016)           \r\ncVDPV1\r\nPapua New Guinea                        (most recent detection 7 November 2018)\r\nIndonesia                                           (most recent detection 25 January 2019)\r\ncVDPV3\r\nSomalia                                               (most recent detection 7 Sept 2018)\r\n \r\nThese countries should:\r\n\r\n    Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required.\r\n    Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. > four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel.\r\n    Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers.\r\n    Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination.\r\n    Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea).\r\n    Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border.\r\n    Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication.\r\n    Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected.\r\n    Provide to the Director-General a regular report on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel.\r\n\r\nStates infected with cVDPV2s, with potential risk of international spread\r\n\r\n\r\n    DR Congo         (most recent detection 7 October 2018)\r\n    Kenya                (most recent detection 21 March 2018)\r\n    Mozambique  (most recent detection 17 December 2018)\r\n    Niger                  (most recent detection 5 December 2018)\r\n    Nigeria                              (most recent detection 15 January 2019)\r\n    Somalia                             (most recent detection 11 October 2018)\r\n\r\nThese countries should:\r\n\r\n    Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained.\r\n    Noting the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections, consider requesting vaccines from the global mOPV2 stockpile based on the recommendations of the Advisory Group on mOPV2.\r\n    Encourage residents and long­term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel; those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure.\r\n    Ensure that travelers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status.\r\n    Intensify regional cooperation and cross­border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus, and vaccinate refugees, travelers and cross­border populations, according to the advice of the Advisory Group.\r\n    Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication.\r\n    Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without the detection of circulation of VDPV2 in the country from any source, and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the criteria of a ‘state no longer infected’.\r\n    At the end of 12 months without evidence of transmission, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.\r\n\r\nStates no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV\r\nWPV1\r\n\r\n    Cameroon                                                   (last case 9 Jul 2014)\r\n    Central African Republic                        (last case 8 Dec 2011)\r\n    Chad                                                              (last case 14 Jun 2012)\r\n    CVDPV\r\n    \r\n    Syria                                                              (last case 21 Sept 2017)\r\n\r\nThese countries should:\r\n\r\n    Urgently strengthen routine immunization to boost population immunity.\r\n    Enhance surveillance quality, including considering introducing supplementary methods such as environmental surveillance, to reduce the risk of undetected WPV1 and cVDPV transmission, particularly among high risk mobile and vulnerable populations.\r\n    Intensify efforts to ensure vaccination of mobile and cross­border populations, Internally Displaced Persons, refugees and other vulnerable groups.\r\n    Enhance regional cooperation and cross border coordination to ensure prompt detection of WPV1 and cVDPV, and vaccination of high risk population groups.\r\n    Maintain these measures with documentation of full application of high quality surveillance and vaccination activities.\r\n    At the end of 12 months* without evidence of reintroduction of WPV1 or new emergence and circulation of cVDPV, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations.\r\n\r\n*For the Lake Chad countries, this will be linked to when Nigeria is considered no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV2. \r\nAdditional considerations\r\nThe world is at a critical point in polio eradication. Failure to boost population immunity through strengthening routine immunization, and failure to prevent outbreaks through implementation of high quality SIAs in areas of known high risk, could jeopardize or severely delay polio eradication.  The current situation calls for unabated efforts and use of every tool available, to achieve the goal in these most challenging countries.  Particularly in the three remaining endemic countries, further engagement with senior levels of government and other key stakeholders is needed to advocate for polio eradication, and ensure all levels of government maintain a strong commitment until the job is done.\r\nNoting the spread of polioviruses in several areas close to international borders, the committee strongly urges that surveillance, population immunity assessments and outbreak preparedness activities intensify in all neighboring countries, particularly in Benin, Malawi, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Djibouti, Lake Chad basin countries and the Central African Republic.  There needs to be a renewed urgency to addressing these gaps wherever they exist. \r\nCountries using mOPV2 should take great care in accounting for all vials of the vaccine, to avoid unauthorized and inappropriate use outside a globally agreed SIA campaign.\r\nBased on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by Afghanistan, Indonesia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Niger, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 28 February 2019 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 28 February 2019.",

          "WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus today called on donors to continue funding the response to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or risk backsliding. There is an urgent need for US $148 million for all partners involved in the response to continue their work. So far, under US $10 million has been pledged.",
          "The call comes a week ahead of Dr Tedros’ next mission to DRC. He is scheduled to meet President Tshisekedi in Kinshasa before travelling to the Ebola-stricken areas of Butembo and Katwa.",
          "“The situation is unprecedented: there has never been  an Ebola outbreak in these conditions, with such a highly mobile population and  with many gaps in the health system.” said Dr Tedros.",
          "“The security context is another major concern. I am deeply saddened by reports that a health facility run by Médecins Sans Frontières in Katwa was attacked on Sunday night. Nevertheless, together with partners and with the Democratic Republic of the Congo government in the lead, we have made major gains. Hundreds of deaths have been averted, maybe even thousands. But the outbreak is not over and we urgently need additional funding to see it through.”",
          "Over 80,000 people have been vaccinated and over 400 have received treatment.

    "content_html": "<p>Greater international cooperation is needed to prevent unsafe food from causing ill health and hampering progress towards sustainable development, world leaders said at today’s opening session of the First International Food Safety Conference, in Addis Ababa, organized by the African Union (AU), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).</p>\n<p>A follow-up event, the International Forum on Food Safety and Trade, which will focus on interlinkages between food safety and trade, is scheduled to be hosted by WTO in Geneva (23-24 April). The two meetings are expected to galvanize support and lead to actions in the key areas that are strategic for the future of food safety.<br/>\nFood contaminated with bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins or chemicals causes more than 600 million people to fall ill and 420 000 to die worldwide every year. Illness linked to unsafe food overloads healthcare systems and damages economies, trade and tourism. The impact of unsafe food costs low- and middle-income economies around $95 billion in lost productivity each year. Because of these threats, food safety must be a paramount goal at every stage of the food chain, from production to harvest, processing, storage, distribution, preparation and consumption, conference participants stressed.</p>\n<p>“The partnership between the African Union and the United Nations has been longstanding and strategic,” said African Union Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat. “This food safety conference is a demonstration of this partnership. Without safe foods, it is not possible to achieve food security,” he said.</p>\n<p>“There is no food security without food safety,” agreed FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva during his remarks. “This conference is a great opportunity for the international community to strengthen political commitments and engage in key actions. Safeguarding our food is a shared responsibility. We must all play our part. We must work together to scale up food safety in national and international political agendas,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Food should be a source of nourishment and enjoyment, not a cause of disease or death,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “Unsafe food is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths every year, but has not received the political attention it deserves. Ensuring people have access to safe food takes sustained investment in stronger regulations, laboratories, surveillance and monitoring. In our globalized world, food safety is everyone’s issue.”</p>\n<p>“Food safety is a central element of public health and will be crucial in achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals,” WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo said. “Trade is an important force to lift people out of poverty… when we reconvene in Geneva in April we will consider these issues in more depth,” he added.</p>\n<p> Around 130 countries are participating in the two-day conference, including ministers of agriculture, health, and trade. Leading scientific experts, partner agencies and representatives of consumers, food producers, civil society organizations and the private sector are also taking part.</p>\n<p> The aim of the conference is to identify key actions that will ensure the availability of, and access to, safe food now and in the future. This will require a strengthened commitment at the highest political level to scale up food safety in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Changing food systems</h2>\n<p> Technological advances, digitalization, novel foods and processing methods provide a wealth of opportunities to simultaneously enhance food safety, and improve nutrition, livelihoods and trade.  At the same time, climate change and the globalization of food production, coupled with a growing global population and increasing urbanization, pose new challenges to food safety.  Food systems are becoming even more complex and interlinked, blurring lines of regulatory responsibility.  Solutions to these potential problems require intersectoral and concerted international action.</p>\n<h2> Strengthened collaboration </h2>\n<p>A central theme of the conference is that food safety systems need to keep pace with the way food is produced and consumed.  This requires a sustained investment and coordinated, multi-sectoral approaches for regulatory legislation, suitable laboratory capacities, and adequate disease surveillance and food monitoring programmes, all of which need to be supported by information technologies, shared information, training and education.</p>",

WHO’s senior management team is now one of the most diverse and gender-balanced of any United Nations agency. All regions\nof the world are represented and almost two-thirds are women. WHO is working consistently to increase geographical diversity and improve gender balance at all levels as part of its ongoing transformation process.</p>\n<p>WHO has established mechanisms by which anyone inside or outside the organization can report concerns about any form of suspected misconduct by WHO personnel. WHO has recently strengthened the capacity of its internal oversight mechanisms\nand has proven processes for reporting and dealing with allegations of misconduct.</p>\n<p>These include an independently-run integrity hotline which anyone can use to report concerns confidentially and anonymously. We regularly report the outcome of substantiated allegations arising from independent investigations to Member States\nin our reports to Governing Bodies. All these reports are posted on our public website.</p>\n<p>WHO listens to all feedback so we can learn and improve and provide the best possible advice and assistance to countries.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>",
