          "The World Health Organization, with the support of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and its COVID-19 Vaccines Working Group, continues to review the emerging evidence on the need for and\r\n    timing of a booster dose for the currently available COVID-19 vaccines which have received Emergency Use Listing (EUL). This statement reflects the current understanding of vaccine performance and supply as presented to SAGE on 7 December\r\n    2021.  It summarizes and contextualizes current evidence on booster vaccination. In recent weeks the SARS-CoV2 Omicron variant has emerged.  Data are currently insufficient to assess the impact of this new variant of concern on vaccine effectiveness,\r\n    in particular against severe disease. The statements and conclusions in this document will therefore be updated as data become available."

The objective of a booster dose is to restore vaccine effectiveness from that deemed no longer sufficient.",
              "Additional doses of a vaccine may be needed as part of an extended primary series for target populations where the immune response rate following the standard primary series is deemed insufficient. The objective of an additional\r\n        dose in the primary series is to enhance the immune response to establish a sufficient level of effectiveness against disease. In particular, immunocompromised individuals often fail to mount a protective immune response after a standard primary\r\n        series, but also older adults may respond poorly to a standard primary series with some vaccines (1)."

          "The Director-General of WHO has called for a moratorium on booster vaccination for healthy adults until the end of 2021 to counter the persisting and profound inequity in global vaccine access (2) .  While many countries are far from reaching\r\n    the 40% coverage target by the end of 2021, other countries have vaccinated well beyond this threshold, already reaching children and implementing  extensive booster vaccination programmes.  At the time of release of this statement, globally\r\n    about 20% of COVID-19 vaccine doses, daily, are used for booster or additional dose vaccination.",
          "Vaccine booster dose policy decisions should be based on evidence of individual and public health benefit and obligations to secure global equity in vaccine access as a means to minimize health impacts and transmission, and thereby reduce the risk of\r\n    variants and prolongation of the pandemic. While vaccine supply is growing, it is not evenly distributed. Lower income countries have had far less access, and face unpredictable and irregular supply. Within countries, equity considerations support\r\n    improving coverage of the primary vaccination series in high risk populations as the top priority use of vaccine doses (3)."

Among those, the primary global goal for the acute phase of the pandemic is to reduce deaths and severe disease due to COVID-19 and to protect the health\r\n    system. The level of population vaccination coverage needed to achieve this goal may differ between countries.",
          "Subsequent public health goals include the reduction of COVID-19 disease burden and of viral transmission, to restore social and economic life, as described in WHO’s Strategy to Achieve Global COVID-19 Vaccination by mid-2022 . These goals\r\n    and vaccine use cases should be pursued only when priority risk groups have full access to vaccines in order to achieve the primary objective of substantial reduction in severe disease and mortality."

        "content": [
          "The vast majority of current infections and COVID-19 cases are observed in unvaccinated people. If breakthroughs occur in vaccinated persons, in most cases events are less severe than those in unvaccinated persons. However, emerging data consistently\r\n    show a decline in vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV2 infection and COVID-19 with time since vaccination, and more significant decline in older adults. This evidence is mostly based on observational studies that may be subject to confounding factors (5) .",
          "Based on a recent systematic review and meta-regression analysis (6) , across the four WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines with the most data (i.e., BNT162b2, mRNA 1273, Ad26.COV2.S and ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] vaccine), vaccine effectiveness against severe\r\n    COVID-19 decreased by about 8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4-15%) over a period of 6 months in all age groups.  In adults above 50 years, vaccine effectiveness against severe disease decreased by about 10% (95% CI: 6 – 15%) over the\r\n    same period.  Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease decreased by 32% (95% CI: 11 – 69%) for those above 50 years of age.",
          "For some inactivated vaccines (CoronaVac and COVID-19 vaccine BIBP), WHO has already issued the recommendation for the administration of an additional dose to those aged 60 years or older as part of the primary series to make initial immunity\r\n    more robust (7, 8) .",
          "The degree of waning of immunity differs between vaccine products and target populations. Circulating viruses - in particular variants of concern; the extent of prior infection within a community at the time of primary vaccination; the primary vaccination\r\n    schedule used (i.e. dose interval) and intensity of exposure are all likely to play a role in the findings on waning of protection but cannot be systematically assessed from current studies."

          "In several jurisdictions, booster vaccination has been authorized by regulatory authorities and added to the product labels of BNT162b2, mRNA 1273 and Ad26.COV2.S.  In addition, for ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] and CoronaVac, COVID-19 vaccine BIBP, BBV152\r\n    and NVX-CoV2373 vaccines, clinical trial data of booster doses are available. All studies to date show a strong anamnestic immunological response achieving or improving upon the peak antibody levels following the primary immunization series, but with\r\n    insufficient data and too little follow-up to assess the kinetics and duration of the response.  Both homologous and heterologous booster regimens are immunologically effective (9) .",
          "Because no correlate of protection has yet been defined, it is not possible to predict with high confidence vaccine performance of these heterologous schedules based on the immune response. Vaccine effectiveness data for a booster dose are being published\r\n    from an increasing number of countries, but remain limited in follow-up time. All studies demonstrate an improvement in protection against infection; milder disease; as well as severe disease and death (10-14) .",
          "Safety and reactogenicity studies are based on small-scale clinical trials and post-licensure data with limited follow-up. Overall, they show a similar safety profile to that observed after the second dose in the primary series. Regulatory authorities\r\n    and advisory bodies have thus assessed a favourable benefit risk ratio of booster vaccination at an individual level."

          "Current situation in countries",
          "At least 126 countries worldwide have already issued recommendations on booster or additional vaccination and more than 120 have started programmatic implementation. The majority of these countries are classified as high-income, or upper middle-income.\r\n    No low-income country has yet introduced a booster vaccination programme. The most commonly prioritized target populations for booster doses are older adults, health workers and immunocompromised individuals (in immunocompromised individuals the booster\r\n    dose is considered as an additional primary series vaccination dose by WHO).  The degree of primary vaccination coverage in the eligible adult population varies.  In several of these countries which are administering booster doses the coverage\r\n    rates for complete primary vaccination are below 30%.",
          "Global equity and supply",
          "In view of the continued supply uncertainties in global vaccine access and equity, individual country vaccine booster dose policy decisions need to balance the public health benefits to their population with support for global equity in vaccine access\r\n    necessary to address the virus evolution and pandemic impact.",
          "Of concern are broad-based booster programmes, including the booster vaccination of population sub-groups at lower risk of severe disease. Global supply is increasing significantly and is projected to be sufficient for vaccination of the entire adult\r\n    population globally, and boosters of high risk populations (as defined in the roadmap, in particular older adults and immunocompromised persons), by the first quarter of  2022. However, projections show that only later in 2022 supply will be\r\n    sufficient for extensive use of boosters in all adults, and beyond, should they be broadly needed.",
          "Even as supply has continued to ramp up, hurdles in access and distribution have led to the prevailing inequities that can only be resolved by high coverage and supply and through countries’ commitment to global vaccine goals and targets, and to\r\n    assisting other countries in need.",
          "Public health use case and optimization of vaccine impact",
          "In accordance with the Roadmap and WHO’s Strategy to Achieve Global COVID-19 Vaccination by mid-2022, the first priority of a vaccination programme is to reduce mortality and severe disease and to protect health systems. The most important measure\r\n    to achieve this goal is to maximize coverage among those most likely to become seriously ill and those most likely to become infected especially those who are critical for health system functioning.  In order to do this, primary series coverage\r\n    and selective booster options must be weighed and prioritized carefully. This priority also contributes to socioeconomic recovery, as the severity of COVID-19 and its potential to overwhelm health systems constitute a primary rationale for public\r\n    health and social measures that restrict social and economic activity. To use vaccines first for those at lower risk of severe disease before achieving high primary series coverage and sustained protection through selective booster doses for those\r\n    most likely to become seriously ill will reduce the impact that could be secured with the ongoing limited vaccine supply, and runs counter to the National Equity and Equal Respect principles of the Values Framework (15) .",
          "These use case principles are also supported by mathematical modeling on the optimization of public health impact of a limited vaccine supply.  This modeling shows that greater reductions in mortality may be achieved by administering booster doses\r\n    to high-risk populations than using those same doses for primary immunization of lower risk populations. As supply increases and vaccination is expanded to lower priority age groups, trade-offs may need to be considered as to prioritizing booster\r\n    vaccination to high-risk populations over expanding primary immunization coverage to younger populations. WHO is currently not recommending the general vaccination of children and adolescents as the burden of severe disease in these age groups is\r\n    low and high coverage has not yet been achieved in all countries among those groups who are at highest risk of severe disease (16) ."

          "The focus of COVID-19 immunization efforts must remain on decreasing death and severe disease, and the protection of the health care system. Public health and social measures continue to be an essential component of the COVID-19 prevention strategy, especially\r\n    in light of the Omicron variant. In the context of ongoing global vaccine supply constraints and inequities, broad-based administration of booster doses risks exacerbating vaccine access by driving up demand in countries with substantial\r\n    vaccine coverage and diverting supply while priority populations in some countries, or in subnational settings, have not yet received a primary vaccination series.",
          "Introducing booster doses should be firmly evidence-driven and targeted to the population groups at highest risk of serious disease and those necessary to protect the health system.  To date, the evidence indicates a minimal to modest reduction\r\n    of vaccine protection against severe disease over the 6 months after the primary series. Waning of effectiveness against all clinical disease and infection is more pronounced. Duration of protection against the Omicron variant may be altered and is\r\n    under active investigation. Evidence on waning vaccine effectiveness, in particular a decline in protection against severe disease in high-risk populations, calls for the development of vaccination strategies optimized for prevention of severe\r\n    disease, including the targeted use of booster vaccination.",
          "More data will be needed to understand the potential impact of booster vaccination on the duration of protection against severe disease, but also against mild disease, infection, and transmission, particularly in the context of emerging variants. Over\r\n    time, as vaccination programmes effectively protect populations from severe disease and death, the protection against milder disease and the reduction of transmission become important additional considerations.",
          "SAGE has deliberated on the evidence for booster doses and the optimization of vaccination programmes during its Extraordinary SAGE meeting on 7 December 2021, which is reflected in this interim statement. SAGE will further discuss policies to optimize\r\n    the use of vaccines including the consideration of booster vaccination at its forthcoming meeting on 19 January 2022.",

          "The heads of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank Group, World Health Organization and World Trade Organization held high-level consultations with Gavi and UNICEF on 17 December, 2021 aimed at increasing the use of COVID-19 vaccines and other critical medical countermeasures in low-income (LIC) and lower middle-income (LMIC) countries and supporting countries to be better prepared, resourced, and ready to roll out vaccines.",
          "We agreed on the urgency to accelerate vaccinations in LICs, where under 5% of the population is fully vaccinated, as well as in LMICs, where around 30% of the population is fully vaccinated. We agreed to work with countries to support and strengthen their national vaccination goals consistent with the global target to vaccinate 70% of the populations in all countries by mid-2022. The emergence of the Omicron variant underscores the vital need for fair and broad access to vaccines as well as testing, sequencing, and treatments to end the pandemic.",
          "Addressing vaccine inequity, particularly in LICs, requires increasing the supplies of vaccines to COVAX and AVAT, encouraging LICs and LMICs to purchase additional vaccine doses, and enhancing country readiness to deploy vaccines. Furthermore, to facilitate trade flows to support the manufacturing and distribution of vaccines and other COVID tools, export restrictions must be rolled back and trade-facilitating measures must be put in place. Fully funding the ACT-A Accelerator’s Financing Framework would play an important role in narrowing these gaps and reaching the global target.",
          "Some LICs and LMICs are facing serious challenges in vaccine deployment. Constraints related to storage, cold chain capacity, and trained vaccinators are exacerbated in some cases by doses arriving with short shelf lives and without adequate lead time and shortages in ancillary supplies (such as syringes, safety boxes, and dilutants), with challenges to plan and finance vaccination campaigns in a timely manner. As in wealthier countries, vaccine hesitancy is also an issue in some LICs and LMICs.",

            ]
          },
          "We call for better coordination among vaccine manufacturers, dose donating countries, COVAX, AVAT, and other partners to improve visibility on vaccine supply schedules and quality of supply for LICs and LMICs, to support country-level planning and preparedness for turning vaccines into vaccinations. Visibility on schedules along with adequate lead times and shelf lives of vaccines are critical for both equitable distribution as well as for recipient countries and their partners to prepare for in-country deployment.",
          "Growing volumes of COVID-19 vaccines are forecast to arrive in LICs and LMICs in the coming months. Close coordination amongst all stakeholders will be crucial to help provide countries with the assistance and necessary resources to increase their capacity to administer those doses. In this regard, we welcome the recent appointment by UNICEF and WHO, in partnership with Gavi, of the Global Lead Coordinator for COVID Vaccine Country Readiness and Delivery, who will play an important key role in strengthening in-country vaccine deployment."

          "Today, the World Health Organization issued an emergency use listing (EUL) for NVX-CoV2373, expanding the basket of WHO-validated vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The vaccine, named Covovax TM , is produced by the Serum Institute of India under licence from Novavax and is part of the COVAX facility portfolio, giving a much-needed boost to ongoing efforts to vaccinate more people in lower-income countries.",
          "WHO’s EUL procedure assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and is a prerequisite for COVAX vaccine supply. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.",
          "“Even with new variants emerging, vaccines remain one of the most effective tools to protect people against serious illness and death from SARS-COV-2,” said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. ‘This listing aims to increase access particularly in lower-income countries, 41 of which have still not been able to vaccinate 10% of their populations, while 98 countries have not reached 40%.”",
          "Covovax TM was assessed under the WHO EUL procedure based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, a risk management plan, programmatic suitability, and manufacturing site inspections carried out by the Drugs Controller General of India. The Technical Advisory Group for Emergency Use Listing (TAG-EUL), convened by WHO and made up of experts from around the world, has determined that the vaccine meets WHO standards for protection against COVID-19, that the benefit of the vaccine far outweighs any risks, and that the vaccine can be used globally.",
          "Covovax TM is a subunit of the vaccine developed by Novavax and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). It requires two doses and is stable at 2 to 8 °C refrigerated temperatures. The vaccine uses a novel platform and is produced by creating an engineered baculovirus containing a gene for a modified SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.",
          "The originator product produced by Novavax, named Nuvaxovid TM , is currently under assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). WHO will complete its own assessment of this vaccine once the EMA has issued its recommendation.",
          "A meeting of WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) this week also reviewed the vaccine. SAGE formulates specific policies and recommendations for vaccines’ use in populations (i.e. recommended age groups, intervals between doses, specific groups such as pregnant and lactating women) and will issue recommendations for Nuvaxovid TM /Covovax TM in the coming days.",
          "WHO emergency use listing",
          "The emergency use listing (EUL) procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies. The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency while adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks.",
          "The EUL pathway involves a rigorous assessment of late phase II and phase III clinical trial data, as well as substantial additional data on safety, efficacy, quality and a risk management plan. These data are reviewed by independent experts and WHO teams who consider the current body of evidence on the vaccine under consideration, the plans for monitoring its use, and plans for further studies.",
          "As part of the EUL process, the company producing the vaccine must commit to continue to generate data to enable full licensure and WHO prequalification of the vaccine. The WHO prequalification process will assess additional clinical data generated from vaccine trials and deployment on a rolling basis to ensure the vaccine meets the necessary standards of quality, safety and efficacy for broader availability.",

          "In her capacity as Special Envoy, Dr Alakija will help lead the collective advocacy for the ACT-Accelerator, mobilizing support and resources so it can deliver against its new Strategic Plan and Budget that was launched on 28 October 2021, and ensuring that the response is characterised by accountability, inclusion, and solidarity.",
          "Dr Alakija will also support the leaders of the ACT-Accelerator’s three product pillars (vaccines, tests, treatments) and cross cutting ‘connector’; consult widely on the work of the ACT-Accelerator; advise the Director-General, ACT-Accelerator principals and stakeholders on emerging issues; and represent the ACT-Accelerator in key national and international fora.",
          "Dr Alakija joins the ACT-Accelerator at a critical moment in the global COVID-19 response, where the emergence of new variants of concern and missed global coverage targets leave large swathes of the world’s population unvaccinated, untested and untreated. The need for equitable access to vaccines, testing, treatments and personal protective equipment (PPE) remains vitally important to bringing an end to the acute phase of the pandemic.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator partnership, a coalition of leading public health organizations, is the only global initiative offering an integrated, end-to-end solution to expedite the end of the pandemic through the accelerated development and equitable distribution of vaccines, tests and treatments.",
          "Dr Alakija is a medical doctor with a Masters degree from The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in Public Health and Epidemiology. She is a global health leader and activist who has deployed diplomacy to bring together the global north and south together in coordinated responses to the pandemic. In her previous role as Chief Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria, she led the Oslo Humanitarian Conference for Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, working with governments and multilateral institutions to mobilise responses to some of the most under-recognized humanitarian crises in the world. While based in Fiji, she worked closely with the WHO and UNICEF to design, coordinate, and implement National Health and Behavioural Surveys across the Pacific region.",
          "In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, she has been a leading voice calling for the urgent reimagining of how the globe should respond more consciously to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr Alakija is also the co-Chair of the African Union’s African Vaccine Delivery Alliance and founder of the Emergency Coordination Centre in Nigeria, building on her work with over 100 nations around the globe.",
          "“Dr Alakija brings a tremendous track record in advocating for equitable access to vaccines, tests and treatments, especially for Africa,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “She joins us at a critical juncture in the fight against COVID-19, with the Omicron variant threatening to further constrain equitable access to vaccines, just as the pace of supply was improving. We are very much looking forward to working with her to advocate for the full financing of the ACT Accelerator, and to meeting the global targets for COVID-19 vaccination, testing and treatment.”",
          "Dr Alakija said: “This moment in time calls for a powerful, inclusive and accountable shift in the way we have thus far responded to COVID-19 and the devastation it has caused and continues to inflict on us. This is a pivotal opportunity for that shift to happen. The collective voices, energy and resources of communities, researchers, scientists, private sector and political leadership must be galvanised and deployed with courage to ensure that we vaccinate the world, strengthen our public health systems, reimagine pandemic preparedness and ensure that we stop the current injustice and ongoing waves of death in its tracks. This is within reach, but only if a life in Mumbai matters as much as a life in Brussels, if a life in Sao Paulo matters as much as a life in Geneva, and if a life in Harare matters as much as a life in Washington DC. I come to this role to serve and to be part of a team that will ensure that the fruits of our collective work bring meaningful access and dignity in health in this pandemic that is felt in every village, town and city.”",

          "The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator is a global coalition of organizations focused on developing and deploying the diagnostics, treatments and vaccines needed to end the acute phase of the pandemic.",
          "Pooling the expertise of its partners, the ACT-Accelerator has quickly ushered in rapid, affordable tests and effective medicines for low and middle-income countries and established the COVAX facility for the equitable procurement and distribution of vaccines in low- and lower-middle-income countries.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator’s impact so far includes delivering more than 680 million vaccine doses to 144 countries and territories through COVAX; halving the cost of COVID-19 rapid tests, transferring technology to low and middle-income countries, and delivering more than 137 million tests through the Diagnostics Consortium; increasing essential oxygen, personal protective equipment (PPE) and treatment supplies, including through the advance purchase of nearly 3 million doses of dexamethasone and more than US$4 billion worth of support from the Global Fund’s COVID-19 Response Mechanism (C19RM).",
          "The ACT Accelerator partnership was formed at the onset of the pandemic in response to a call from G20 leaders, and was launched by WHO, the European Commission, France, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in April 2020.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator partner agencies are: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, CEPI, FIND, Gavi, the Global Fund, UNICEF, Unitaid, Wellcome, the WHO and the World Bank."

          "Today, more people than ever live in a country other than the one in which they were born. More than 1 billion are on the move. While many individuals migrate out of choice, many others migrate out of necessity. 1 in 30 people is a migrant [1] , and 1 in 95 is forcibly displaced [2] . These numbers are expected to grow due to poverty, lack of human security, lack of access to basic services, conflict, environmental degradation and natural disasters.",
          "“While facing similar health risks to their host communities, refugees and migrants may have specific health needs and are often vulnerable to adverse health outcomes due to their mobility, living and working conditions,” said Dr Santino Severoni, Director of the WHO Health and Migration Programme.",
          "“Refugees and migrants face obstacles in accessing people-centred and culturally sensitive health services in both countries of transit and destination. These can include language and cultural differences, institutional discrimination, and restricted use of health services, all of which shape their interactions with the host country’s health system and health workforce.”",
          "Inclusive health systems put people at their centre. The development of the Standards and their adaptation to country contexts will allow health workers to improve practices in culturally sensitive care, leading to better health outcomes for refugees and migrants across the world.",
          "The health workforce has a vital role in providing health services that are inclusive and respectful of a person’s cultural, religious, and linguistic needs. With the right training, health workers can develop the competencies to adapt and provide services appropriate for each person’s culture and needs. As these competencies are integrated into health care approaches the resilience of health systems to respond to the health care needs of refugees and migrants is strengthened.",
          "Launched for International Migrants Day 2021 , the document is accompanied by a Knowledge Guide and Curriculum Guide to support its operationalization.",
          "Health workers providing health services to migrants and refugees are invited to integrate the Standards into their daily healthcare activities. The competencies described can be tailored to the various environments that health workers operate in and take into consideration the requirements and constraints of local health systems as well as the characteristics of the diverse refugee and migrant populations.",
          "This is the first set of Competency Standards to be developed for health workers who provide health services to refugees and migrants as well as for educational institutions to incorporate these standards and foundational knowledge and skills into health worker training.",
          "“2021 is the International Year of Health and Care Workers, which recognizes the unwavering dedication of millions of workers at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic response, and thanks them for their vital role in ensuring our health and wellbeing,” stated Jim Campbell, Director of WHO’s Health Workforce Department. “The same workers must be supported with a competency-based education, as outlined in the Standards and accompanying Guides and for which there is compelling evidence of impact, to take us a step closer towards universal health coverage for all populations, including for refugees and migrants.”",

The 10 th Global Conference on Health Promotion on 13-15 December 2021 marked the start of a global movement on the concept of well-being in societies. A focus on well-being encourages different sectors to work together to address global challenges and help people take control over their health and lives.",
          "Over 5000 participants of the Global Conference, who met virtually and in Geneva, Switzerland, agreed on a Geneva Charter for Well-being. The Charter builds on the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion and the legacy of nine global conferences on health promotion. It highlights the need for global commitments to achieve equitable health and social outcomes now and for future generations, without destroying the health of our planet.

It begins in our homes and communities, with the food we eat and the water we drink, the air we breathe, in our schools and our workplaces,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General. “We have to fundamentally change the way that leaders in politics, the private sector, and international institutions think about and value health, and to promote growth that is based on health and well-being for people and the planet, for countries in all income levels.”",

          "To change the global development landscape, both the well-being of people and the planet must become central to defining humanity’s progress. This Charter calls upon nongovernmental and civic organizations, academia, business, governments, international organizations and all concerned to work in society-wide partnerships for decisive implementation of strategies for health and well-being. These will drive the transformation towards well-being societies in all countries, centering around the most marginalized populations.",

Universal health coverage, based on strong primary health care, must be at the core of all our efforts, as the cornerstone of social, economic and political stability. And the narrative around health should be reframed, not as a cost, but as an investment in our common future."

          "A\r\nnew WHO report shows that close to 7 million  deaths could be prevented by 2030 if\r\nlow- and lower-middle-income countries were to make an additional investment of\r\nless than a dollar per person per year in the prevention and treatment of\r\nnoncommunicable diseases (NCDs).",
          "NCDs\r\n– including heart disease, diabetes, cancer and respiratory disease –\r\ncurrently cause 7out of every 10 deaths around the world.",
          "Yet\r\ntheir impact on lower income countries is often underestimated, despite the\r\nfact that 85% of premature deaths (between\r\nages 30–69) from NCDs occur in low- and middle-income\r\ncountries, making them a huge health and socioeconomic burden.",
          "The\r\nvast majority of those deaths can be prevented using WHO’s tried and tested NCD Best Buy interventions. These include cost effective measures to reduce\r\ntobacco use and harmful use of alcohol, improve diets, increase physical\r\nactivity, reduce risks from cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and prevent\r\ncervical cancer.",
          "Keeping\r\npeople healthy reduces health costs, increases productivity and leads to longer\r\nand healthier lives.",
          "Saving\r\nlives, spending less: the case for investing in noncommunicable diseases focuses on 76 low- and\r\nlower-middle-income countries. The report explains the NCD Best Buys and shows\r\nhow every dollar invested in scaling up Best Buy actions in these countries\r\ncould generate a return of up to US$  7 – potentially US$  230 billion by 2030.",
          "“With\r\nthe right strategic investments, countries that bear a significant amount of\r\nthe NCD burden can change their disease trajectory and deliver significant\r\nhealth and economic gains for their citizens,” says WHO Director-General Dr\r\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “In a world filled with uncertainty, one thing we\r\ncan be certain of is that without action, NCDs will continue to be a\r\nsignificant threat to global health. Investing in these evidence-based policies\r\nis an investment in a healthy future.”",
          "The\r\nreport emphasizes the urgency of investing in NCD prevention and management\r\ngiven that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how many of these diseases can\r\nworsen outcomes for COVID-19.",
          "By\r\ninvesting in the 16 recommended Best Buy policies, countries will not only protect people from\r\nNCDs, but also reduce the impact of infectious diseases like COVID-19 in the\r\nfuture.",
          "“Noncommunicable\r\ndiseases take a terrible health and economic toll, especially on countries that\r\ncan least afford it,” says WHO Global Ambassador for NCDs and Injuries Michael\r\nR. Bloomberg. “We know the prevention measures that work best, and hopefully\r\nthis new report leads more governments to take the smart, cost-effective\r\nactions that can help save millions of lives around the world.”",
          "Best\r\nBuy actions include increasing health taxes, restrictions on marketing and\r\nsales of harmful products, information and education, and vaccination. They\r\nalso include actions connected to\r\nmanaging metabolic risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, in order to\r\nprevent more severe disease or complications.",
          "The\r\ninterventions are all relatively inexpensive and require little capital\r\ninvestment but could help avoid much of the high cost of treatment in future.\r\nThe report also indicates that while each of the interventions can be\r\nimplemented individually, the effects are stronger and produce a greater return\r\non investment when introduced together. With marginalized groups often at\r\ngreater risk from the physical and financial impact of NCDs, the interventions\r\nmay also help to reduce health and economic inequalities.",
          "The\r\ninterventions have already been used successfully in many countries around the\r\nworld, with some of the success stories highlighted in the report.\r\nInternational donors have also begun to use the arguments to catalyse\r\ninvestment in this area: in 2019 the Norwegian Government launched the first\r\never international development strategy on NCDs.",
          "“Saving lives, spending\r\nless: the case for investing in noncommunicable diseases sets\r\nout a path on which countries can follow to deliver the next generation a\r\nbetter and healthier world. The impact of COVID-19 on people living\r\nwith cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and lung\r\ndiseases shows that it’s more important than ever to prioritize the\r\ninvestment of prevention and management of NCDs,” says Dr Bente Mikkelsen,\r\nDirector for NCDs at WHO. “We call on all our partners to follow examples like\r\nNorway, who have stepped up funding and action. In a world where financial\r\nresources are increasingly constrained, this report shows where the best\r\ninvestments can be made and where millions of lives can be saved.”"

          "New evidence compiled by the World Health Organization and the World Bank shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to halt two decades of global progress towards Universal Health Coverage. The organizations also reveal that already before the pandemic more than half a billion people were pushed or further pushed into extreme poverty because they have to pay for health services out of their own pockets, and that the pandemic is likely to make the situation worse.",
          "The findings are contained in two complementary reports, launched on Universal Health Coverage Day, highlighting the devastating impact of COVID-19 on people’s ability to obtain health care and pay for it.",
          "In 2020, the pandemic disrupted health services and stretched countries’ health systems beyond their limits as they struggled to deal with the impact of COVID-19. As a result, for example, immunization coverage dropped for the first time in ten years, and deaths from TB and malaria increased.",
          "The pandemic also triggered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it increasingly difficult for people to pay for care. Even before the pandemic, half a billion people were being pushed (or pushed still further) into extreme poverty because of payments they made for health care. The organizations expect that that number is now considerably higher.",
          "“There is no time to spare,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “All governments must immediately resume and accelerate efforts to ensure every one of their citizens can access health services without fear of the financial consequences. This means strengthening public spending on health and social support, and increasing their focus on primary health care systems that can provide essential care close to home.”",
          "He added: “Prior to the pandemic, many countries had made progress. But it was not robust enough. This time we must build health systems that are strong enough to withstand shocks, such as the next pandemic and stay on course towards universal health coverage.”",
          "The new WHO/World Bank reports also warn that financial hardship is likely to become more intense as poverty grows, incomes fall, and governments face tighter fiscal constraints.",
          "“Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, almost 1 billion people were spending more than 10 per cent of their household budget on health,” said Juan Pablo Uribe, Global Director for Health, Nutrition and Population, World Bank. “This is not acceptable, especially since the poorest people are hit hardest. Within a constrained fiscal space, governments will have to make tough choices to protect and increase health budgets,” he added.",
          "In the first two decades of this century, many governments had made progress on service coverage. In 2019, prior to the pandemic, 68 per cent of the world’s population was covered by essential health services, such as pre-and post-natal care and reproductive health services; immunization services; treatment for diseases like HIV, TB and malaria; and services to diagnose and treat noncommunicable diseases like cancer, heart conditions, and diabetes.",
          "But they had not made such advances in ensuring affordability. As a result, the poorest groups and those living in rural areas are the least able to obtain health services, and the least likely to be able to cope with the consequences of paying for them. Up to 90 percent of all households incurring impoverishing out-of-pocket health spending are already at or below the poverty line - underscoring the need to exempt poor people from out-of-pocket health spending, backing such measures with health financing policies that enable good intentions to be realized in practice.",
          "Besides the prioritizing of services for poor and vulnerable populations, supported through targeted public spending and policies that protect individuals from financial hardship, it will also be crucial to improve the collection, timeliness and disaggregation of data on access, service coverage, out-of-pocket health spending and total expenditure. Only when countries have an accurate picture of the way that their health system is performing, can they effectively target action to improve the way it meets the needs of all people.",
          "Together, these two new reports offer both a warning and guideposts to all countries as they strive to build back better from COVID-19 and keep their populations safe, healthy, and financially secure.",
          "World Bank Group Response to COVID-19",
          "Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank Group has deployed over $157 billion to fight the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic, the fastest and largest crisis response in its history. The financing is helping more than 100 countries strengthen pandemic preparedness, protect the poor and jobs, and jump start a climate-friendly recovery. The Bank is also supporting over 60 low- and middle-income countries , more than half of which are in Africa, with the purchase and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, and is making available $20 billion in financing for this purpose until the end of 2022."

          "Inequities have been widely acknowledged as barriers to achieving global and national goals and targets in HIV, TB and malaria programs. However, the magnitude and extent of underlying health inequalities have remained poorly documented and understood.",
          "Until those inequalities are better identified, and their consequences better understood, it will be hard for programmes to meet people’s real health needs. Now, for the first time, a new report from the World Health Organization and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, systematically assesses the global State of inequality: HIV, tuberculosis and malaria .",
          "The report represents an important step forward in understanding how inequalities are hindering the fight against the three diseases. Using the latest available global data for 32 health indicators up to 186 countries, it shows that while national averages of HIV, TB and malaria indicators have generally improved in the past decade, the poorest, least educated and rural subgroups tend to remain at a disadvantage across most HIV, TB and malaria indicators.",
          "“Although great strides have been made to expand health services and prevention efforts, we must focus more on reaching the poor, rural and least educated populations who bear the brunt of these diseases,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.",
          "The report shows, for example, that available data on HIV testing among men reveals a gap of at least 20 percentage points between the poorest and richest households in 27 out of 48 countries with the gap having increased over time. Many families affected by tuberculosis spend a substantial amount of their income on expenses related to the disease – especially if the household is poor. Data from 21 countries show that 20-92% of households spend at least a fifth of their income on TB-related costs. For malaria, the poorest, the least educated and rural groups reported lower levels of timely care-seeking for children under age 5 running a fever.",
          "High sex-related inequalities are also quantified in the report. For HIV, in more than half of the countries, males reported higher condom use than females. HIV testing was substantially higher in women than men in a fifth of countries.",
          "“Pandemics thrive on inequalities and exacerbate inequities: we have learned this with HIV, TB and malaria, and we have seen it again with COVID-19,” said Peter Sands, Executive Director of the Global Fund. “To tackle the inequities, we must go beyond simple notions of equal access or one-size-fits-all and deliberately create ‘compensating inequalities’ in service provision to focus resources on the most vulnerable. Our new Strategy turbocharges that approach by placing people and communities front and center of the fight against HIV, TB, and malaria and by putting an even greater focus on removing human rights-related barriers to health services.”",
          "Despite the challenges, the report shows cases where inequalities are low, or where the gaps are narrowing through faster improvements in intervention coverage among disadvantaged population subgroups. Encouragingly, some countries reported higher insecticide-treated bednet ownership among the poorest households, demonstrating that malaria prevention efforts are targeting and benefiting disadvantaged groups.",
          "The report also illustrates the impact of eliminating inequalities in improving national averages across HIV, TB and malaria. For example, if countries improved the level of HIV testing of all pregnant women to that of the richest subgroup, the overall level of testing would increase from 40% to 64%. The percentage of families facing catastrophic costs due to TB would decrease by at least 50% in half of countries (from a current weighted average of 61% to a potential average of 38%). In the case of malaria, families seeking care for children under 5 years with fever, eliminating economic-related inequalities would mean a 26% improvement in the weighted average across 28 countries.",
          "The report calls for the compilation of more and better data on inequalities. The WHO 2020 global assessment of country data and health information systems found that only half of the 133 study countries included data disaggregation in their published national health statistical reports.",
          "It also calls for regular and dedicated monitoring of inequalities in the fight against HIV, TB and malaria, which should be complemented by other quantitative and qualitative studies. WHO has developed a package of tools and resources on inequality monitoring and continues to support countries to develop their capacities in this area.",
          "Since 2002, the Global Fund has disbursed more than US$50 billion across more than 155 countries to help communities most in need. Through its Breaking Down Barriers initiative , the Global Fund has over the last years scaled up programs that remove human-rights related barriers to services – discrimination, gender inequality and violence, criminalization and socioeconomic marginalization. This work, coupled with increased investments in health services for the most under-served, will benefit the national average, bringing countries closer to achieving goals and targets.",

This decision was made following feedback during the agency’s review that current data are unlikely to support USA approval at this time, given the current HIV epidemiology and the prevention landscape for women in the United States\r\n    of America.",
          "The DVR is a long-acting, women-controlled vaginal ring that slowly releases a antiretroviral (ARV) drug, dapivirine, locally in the vagina over one month. Two Phase III clinical trials – the Ring Study (IPM-027) and ASPIRE (MTN-020) – found\r\n    that the DVR reduced women’s risk of HIV infection by about 30% with few adverse events and no safety concerns with long-term use (1,2) . Two subsequent open-label extension (OLE) studies – DREAM and HOPE – showed increased\r\n    ring use compared to the Phase III trials and suggested greater risk reduction by over 50% across both OLEs (3,4) . Further exploratory analyses suggest even higher protection may be possible with consistent use of the ring (5) , and\r\n    the REACH study (MTN-034) found that high adherence can be achieved among adolescents and young women aged 16–21 (6) .",
          "In 2020, the dapivirine ring received a positive scientific opinion from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) under Article 58, or EU medicines for all (7) , for its use among women at high risk for HIV who are unable to use daily oral PrEP (8) .\r\n Under Article 58, the EMA can provide a scientific opinion on high priority human medicines that are intended for markets outside of the European Union (EU). This aims to facilitate access to essential medicines in low- and middle-income countries,\r\n    including new or improved therapies for unmet medical needs, to prevent or treat diseases of major public health interest (9) .",
          "In January 2021, WHO made a conditional recommendation to offer the DVR as a safe and effective additional prevention choice for women at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of combination prevention approaches .  As a result,\r\n    WHO was able to include the DVR in the WHO list of prequalified medicines under the EMA Article 58 label using the alternative listing procedure.",

          "Today, one third of all people around the world are affected by at least one form of malnutrition. Over 40% of all men and women (2.2 billion people) are now overweight or obese. While unhealthy diets are linked to at least 8 million deaths per year.",
          "“Malnutrition in all its forms is one of the world’s leading causes of death and illness,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “WHO is committed to supporting all countries to progressively expand access to essential nutrition services as part of their journey towards universal health coverage, and to strengthening sustainable food systems to support healthy diets for all people, everywhere.\"",
          "Despite incremental improvements across all forms of malnutrition over the past decade, this progress has digressed with growing rates of inequity, climate crisis, conflict, and global health insecurities. The multiple burden of malnutrition, like stunting, wasting, micronutrient deficiencies, obesity and diet related noncommunicable diseases, are increasingly co-existing within the same community, household, and even within the same individual.  With current trends projecting that one in two people will be malnourished by 2025, and an estimated 40 million children will suffer from obesity or overweight in the next decade. In marginalized communities, child malnutrition and food insecurity are on the rise. Last year, 149 million children had stunted growth due to poor diets, lack of access to clean water and health services, and other accessibility issues. Among forty-five percent of children under 5 years of age that die, undernutrition was the underlying cause of death. While there are positive signs of progress, such as the world being on track to hit the global target to increase exclusive breastfeeding by 2025, the COVID-19 pandemic fueled the nutrition crisis. This has particularly affected women and children, and brought unprecedented challenges and diversion of resources away from the global systems for nutrition, including health, food, social protection and humanitarian assistance infrastructure.",
          "“Today, less than 1% of global development assistance focuses on nutrition,” said Dr Francesco Branca, Director of WHO’s Department of Nutrition and Food safety. “There needs to be accelerated action to end unhealthy diets and malnutrition, and WHO’s new commitments to the Nutrition for Growth Summit reflects this. The Nutrition for Growth Summit is a tremendous opportunity to accelerate action during the 2016-2025 Decade of Action on Nutrition.” WHO continues to work within the three important Nutrition for Growth focus areas (health, food and resilience) by strengthening the normative guidance and supporting countries in their use; by monitoring and ensuring access to nutrition data; by providing support to governments and decision makers to integrate nutrition and food systems interventions into national universal health coverage plans, multisectoral systems and fiscal policies; and by ongoing work in emergencies settings."

In the past year, many countries were challenged with limited resources caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, restricting policy-making efforts to eliminate trans fat. To date, 42 high-income and upper-middle-income countries successfully passed best-practice TFA policies, but only four lower-middle-income countries and no low-income countries have done so.

          "Trials for severe and critical patients should continue WHO has updated its living guideline on COVID-19 therapeutics to include convalescent plasma. For non-severe COVID-19 patients, WHO recommends against its use, while it should only be used within clinical trials for severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Convalescent plasma is a transfusion of blood plasma from someone who has recovered from COVID-19. Current evidence shows that convalescent plasma does not improve survival or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, while it has significant costs. An independent panel of experts, the guidelines development group, looked at pooled data from 16 randomized controlled trials, including 16 236 patients with non-severe, severe, and critical covid-19 infection. While the evidence that convalescent plasma has no benefit in non-severe patients was certain, it was less so in the case of severe and critically ill patients. So, randomized clinical trials for these subgroups should continue. This is the 7 th update of WHO’s living guidelines on COVID-19 therapeutics .

          "WHO welcomes the historic decision by the Gavi Alliance Board to invest in the first malaria vaccine programme. The decision secures investment in the long-awaited malaria vaccine and assures that many more children at risk will benefit from this life-saving vaccine and additional malaria prevention. The Gavi Board approved an investment to support the malaria vaccine introduction, procurement and delivery for Gavi-eligible countries in sub-Saharan Africa in 2022-2025. An initial investment of US$ 155.7 million for 2022-2025 will initiate the implementation of this additional tool to “help drive down child mortality in Africa,” according to Gavi. In response to the decision, Minister of Health of Ghana and Gavi Board member Hon. Kwaku Agyeman-Manu said in the announcement : “Ghana, together with several countries on the continent, is proud to have been involved in the pilot program and the development of the first approved malaria vaccine, and today we welcome the decision made by the Gavi board to invest in the malaria vaccine programme. We must now work together to ensure children across the continent can benefit from this additional malaria intervention.” “This global investment is another milestone for the first malaria vaccine, which will boost child survival and extend the reach of malaria prevention through the existing platform of childhood vaccination,” said Dr Kate O’Brien, Director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. “This international financing of malaria vaccine doses for country implementation is a concrete step forward to increase access to the RTS,S malaria vaccine.” The WHO recommendation for the RTS,S malaria vaccine and this follow-on decision was achieved through the support and contributions of WHO across many departments and all levels of the Organization, the Ministries of Health in the pilot countries of Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, African-based evaluation partners, UNICEF, PATH, GSK, the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) funders (Gavi, the Global Fund and Unitaid) and other international and country-level public and private partners. Interest in the malaria vaccine in endemic countries is high and demand for the vaccine is expected to outpace the currently limited supply. Current vaccine production estimates are for up to 15 million doses per year; however, demand is estimated at more than 80 million doses annually. “The significance of these two announcements – first, the WHO recommendation, and second, Gavi’s decision to open a funding window for the vaccine – is truly historic,” said Dr Pedro Alonso, Director of the Global Malaria Programme. “We need new tools to reach our global malaria targets. And now, for the first time, we have a malaria vaccine that we estimate can save an additional 40 000 to 80 000 lives of African children each year. This represents a scientific and public health breakthrough.\" WHO and partners are committed to finding approaches and taking actions to accelerate vaccine availability to increase vaccine access and reduce child illness and deaths."

          "Worst-case scenario averted, but urgent action needed to meet global malaria targets",
          "New data from the World Health Organization reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted malaria services, leading to a marked increase in cases and deaths.",
          "According to WHO’s latest World malaria report , there were an estimated 241 million malaria cases and 627 000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2020. This represents about 14 million more cases in 2020 compared to 2019, and 69 000 more deaths.\r\n    Approximately two-thirds of these additional deaths (47 000) were linked to disruptions in the provision of malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment during the pandemic.",
          "However, the situation could have been far worse. In the early days of pandemic, WHO had projected that – with severe service disruptions – malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could potentially double in 2020. But many countries took urgent action to shore up their malaria programmes, averting this worst-case scenario.",
          "Sub-Saharan Africa continues to carry the heaviest malaria burden, accounting for about 95% of all malaria cases and 96% of all deaths in 2020. About 80% of deaths in the region are among children under 5 years of age.",
          "The pandemic struck at a point when global progress against malaria had already plateaued. By around 2017, there were signs that the phenomenal gains made since 2000—including a 27% reduction in global malaria case incidence and a nearly 51% reduction in the malaria mortality rate—were stalling.",
          "“Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, global gains against malaria had levelled off,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.  “Thanks to the hard work of public health agencies in malaria-affected countries, the worst projections of COVID's impact have not come to pass. Now, we need to harness that same energy and commitment to reverse the setbacks caused by the pandemic and step up the pace of progress against this disease.”",
          "Since 2015, the baseline date for WHO’s global malaria strategy, 24 countries have registered increases in malaria deaths. In the 11 countries that carry the highest burden of malaria worldwide, cases increased from 150 million in 2015 to 163 million cases in 2020, and malaria deaths increased from 390 000 to 444 600 over that same period.",
          "To get back on track, WHO and its partners recognize the need to ensure better and more equitable access to all health services – including malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment – by strengthening primary health care and stepping up both domestic and international investments.",
          "Innovation in new tools is also a critical strategy for accelerating progress.  One important new prevention tool is RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S), the first vaccine ever to be recommended by WHO against a human parasite. In October 2021, WHO recommended RTS,S for children living in sub-Saharan Africa and in other regions with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission.",
          "Delivering malaria services against the odds",
          "Despite the challenges imposed by COVID-19, about three-quarters (72%) of insecticide-treated mosquito nets had been distributed in malaria-endemic countries as planned by the end of 2020.  Thirteen countries in Africa’s Sahel subregion reached\r\n    11.8 million more children with preventive antimalarial medicines during the high-transmission rainy season in 2020 compared to 2019.",
          "Some countries, particularly with a low burden of malaria and relatively strong health systems, even registered gains against malaria during the pandemic. China and El Salvador were certified by WHO as malaria-free in 2021, and the Islamic Republic of Iran attained 3 consecutive years of zero indigenous cases in 2020.",
          "The six countries of the Greater Mekong subregion continue to achieve impressive declines in their malaria caseload.  By the end of 2020, there were approximately 82 000 cases of malaria in the subregion, down from a peak of 650 000 cases in 2012 and about 100 000 cases in 2019.",
          "Despite these achievements, the WHO African Region saw a 12% increase in malaria deaths in 2020 over the previous year, highlighting the consequences of even moderate service disruptions in a population at risk of malaria.",
          "“While African countries rallied to the challenge and averted the worst predictions of fallout from COVID-19, the pandemic’s knock-on effect still translates to thousands of lives lost to malaria,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “African governments and their partners need to intensify their efforts so that we do not lose even more ground to this preventable disease.”",
          "According to the report, 15 countries with a high burden of malaria reported reductions in malaria testing of more than 20% in April-June 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. National Malaria Programmes distributed about 48 million fewer courses of treatment in 2020 compared to the previous year. And, of the world’s 11 highest burden countries, only India registered progress against malaria. The 10 other countries, all in Africa, reported increases in cases and deaths.",
          "Meeting global targets",
          "According to the report, progress towards the 2020 milestones of the WHO global malaria strategy was substantially off track.  In 2020, the global malaria case incidence rate was 59 cases per 1000 people at risk against a target of 35 — putting\r\n    it off track by 40%.  The global mortality rate was 15.3 deaths per 100 000 people at risk against a target of 8.9 — putting it off track by 42%.",
          "Reaching the 2030 goals of the WHO malaria strategy, including a 90% reduction in global malaria incidence and mortality rates by 2030, will require new approaches, new tools and the better implementation of existing ones.",
          "WHO’s malaria strategy emphasizes the need to carefully tailor existing approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment to local contexts, and to strengthen health systems overall, with a view to achieving universal health coverage.",
          "Meeting global targets will also require robust funding. According to the report, current funding levels (estimated at US$3.3 billion in 2020) will need to more than triple, reaching US$ 10.3 billion per year by 2030.",
          "Applying a new methodology",
          "This year’s report applied a new WHO-wide statistical method to estimate the cause of death among children under five years of age for all major diseases, including malaria. The methodology was applied to 32 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that shoulder about 93% of all malaria deaths globally. Doing so revealed higher numbers of estimated deaths among young children every year since 2000.",
          "Even after applying the new methodology, the malaria death rate maintained an overall downward trend since 2000; globally, the malaria mortality rate (deaths per 100 000 population at risk) fell by 49% between 2000 and 2020. Between 2019 and 2020, the death rate increased for the first time since 2000 as a result of disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

          {
            "text": "WHO’s work on malaria is guided by the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030 (GTS) , approved by the World Health Assembly in May 2015, and updated in 2021 to reflect the lessons learned in the global malaria response during the period 2016 to 2020. This year, the number of countries that achieved the strategy’s 2020 milestones was derived from official burden estimates, rather than using projections as was done in the World malaria report 2020 . Despite the considerable progress made since 2000, the GTS 2020 milestones for morbidity and mortality were not achieved globally.",

            ]
          },
          "Methodology changes",
          "In this year’s report, there are two new and noteworthy considerations in the estimation of malaria cases and deaths. First, a new cause of death fraction for malaria was applied, affecting 32 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The new methodology resulted in higher point estimates for malaria deaths in children under 5 years of age across the entire period 2000–2020, compared with previous analyses. For example, the new methodology found that there were 558 000 global malaria deaths in 2019, compared to the prior estimate of 409 000 deaths. More information on the WHO-wide methodology can be found in a paper recently published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health .",
          "Second, the estimates for both cases and deaths reflect the impact of disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to an increase in malaria burden in 2020 compared with 2019 in most moderate and high transmission countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2020, the change in methodology accounted for 32% of the additional deaths (22 000 deaths) compared to 2019. However, 68% of the increase (47 000 deaths) was linked to disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "WHO African Region",
          "Between 2019 and 2020, the estimated number of malaria cases increased from 213 million to 228 million, and deaths from 534 000 to 602 000. The WHO African Region accounted for about 95% of cases and 96% of deaths globally. About 80% of all malaria deaths in the African Region are among children under the age of 5. Since 2015, the rate of progress in both cases and deaths has stalled in many countries with moderate or high malaria transmission; the situation was made worse, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, by disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic and other humanitarian emergencies.",
          "Malaria elimination",
          "Between 2000 and 2020, 23 countries achieved 3 consecutive years of zero indigenous malaria cases. Twelve of these countries have been certified malaria free by WHO (including 2 certifications in 2021): United Arab Emirates (2007), Morocco (2010), Turkmenistan (2010), Armenia (2011), Kyrgyzstan (2016), Sri Lanka (2016), Uzbekistan (2018), Paraguay (2018), Argentina (2019) and Algeria (2019), China (2021), and El Salvador (2021). El Salvador was the first country in Central America to receive the WHO malaria-free certification. China was the first country in the WHO Western Pacific Region to be certified malaria free in more than 30 years. Azerbaijan and Tajikistan have officially a requested a malaria-free certification from WHO, and the process is under way. In April 2021, WHO launched the E-2025 initiative to support 25 countries with the potential to halt malaria transmission by 2025."

Health comes first, and through football, we can reinforce the message that high infection and death rates will persist worldwide as long as there is inequitable access to tools to fight the pandemic. Teamwork is key to that and that’s why we are standing together with the WHO, the Qatar Ministry of Public Health and the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy and call for everyone to #ACTogether and lay the foundations for a healthy FIFA World Cup in 2022.”",

While the pandemic remains managed in Qatar, the threat of the pandemic is still present around the world, and unfortunately access to the tools to defeat the virus remain limited for many countries.”",
          "Her Excellency noted that just as the players in the FIFA Arab Cup will experience a level playing field on the pitch in Qatar, the world needs to ensure a level playing field exists for getting vaccines, treatments and tests where they are needed most. She called on members of the public to continue to follow hygiene, social distancing and other preventive measures, and expressed her delight to have the chance to promote this vital message at the Arab Cup.",

          "“The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a light on the many flaws in the global system to protect people from pandemics: the most vulnerable people going without vaccines; health workers without needed equipment to perform their life-saving work; and ‘me-first’ approaches that stymie the global solidarity needed to deal with a global threat,” Dr Tedros said.",
          "“But at the same time, we have seen inspiring demonstrations of scientific and political collaboration, from the rapid development of vaccines, to today’s commitment by countries to negotiate a global accord that will help to keep future generations safer from the impacts of pandemics.”",
          "The Health Assembly met in a Special Session, the second-ever since WHO’s founding in 1948, and adopted a sole decision titled: “The World Together.” The decision by the Assembly establishes an intergovernmental negotiating body (INB) to draft and negotiate a WHO convention, agreement, or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, with a view to adoption under Article 19 of the WHO Constitution, or other provisions of the Constitution as may be deemed appropriate by the INB.",
          "Article 19 of the WHO Constitution provides the World Health Assembly with the authority to adopt conventions or agreements on any matter within WHO’s competence. The sole instrument established under Article 19 to date is the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which has made a significant and rapid contribution to protecting people from tobacco since its entry into force in 2005.",
          "Under the decision adopted today, the INB will hold its first meeting by 1 March 2022 (to agree on ways of working and timelines) and its second by 1 August 2022 (to discuss progress on a working draft). It will also hold public hearings to inform its deliberations; deliver a progress report to the Seventy-sixth World Health Assembly in 2023; and submit its outcome for consideration by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly in 2024.",
          "Through the decision, the World Health Assembly also requested the WHO Director-General to convene the INB meetings and support its work, including by facilitating the participation of other United Nations system bodies, non-state actors, and other relevant stakeholders in the process to the extent decided by the INB."

          "On 26 November 2021, WHO designated the variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern, named Omicron, on the advice of WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE).  This decision was based on the evidence presented to the TAG-VE that Omicron has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves, for example, on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes. Here is a summary of what is currently known.",
          "Current knowledge about Omicron",
          "Researchers in South Africa and around the world are conducting studies to better understand many aspects of Omicron and will continue to share the findings of these studies as they become available.",
          "Transmissibility : It is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible (e.g., more easily spread from person to person) compared to other variants, including Delta. The number of people testing positive has risen in areas of South Africa affected by this variant, but epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of Omicron or other factors.",
          "Severity of disease : It is not yet clear whether infection with Omicron causes more severe disease compared to infections with other variants, including Delta.  Preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron.  There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants.  Initial reported infections were among university students—younger individuals who tend to have more mild disease—but understanding the level of severity of the Omicron variant will take days to several weeks.  All variants of COVID-19, including the Delta variant that is dominant worldwide, can cause severe disease or death, in particular for the most vulnerable people, and thus prevention is always key.",
          "Effectiveness of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection",
          "Preliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron (ie, people who have previously had COVID-19 could become reinfected more easily with Omicron), as compared to other variants of concern, but information is limited. More information on this will become available in the coming days and weeks.",
          "Effectiveness of vaccines : WHO is working with technical partners to understand the potential impact of this variant on our existing countermeasures, including vaccines. Vaccines remain critical to reducing severe disease and death, including against the dominant circulating variant, Delta. Current vaccines remain effective against severe disease and death.",
          "Effectiveness of current tests : The widely used PCR tests continue to detect infection, including infection with Omicron, as we have seen with other variants as well. Studies are ongoing to determine whether there is any impact on other types of tests, including rapid antigen detection tests.",
          "Effectiveness of current treatments :   Corticosteroids and IL6 Receptor Blockers will still be effective for managing patients with severe COVID-19. Other treatments will be assessed to see if they are still as effective given the changes to parts of the virus in the Omicron variant.",
          "Studies underway",
          "At the present time, WHO is coordinating with a large number of researchers around the world to better understand Omicron. Studies currently underway or underway shortly include assessments of transmissibility, severity of infection (including symptoms), performance of vaccines and diagnostic tests, and effectiveness of treatments.",
          "WHO encourages countries to contribute the collection and sharing of hospitalized patient data through the WHO COVID-19 Clinical Data Platform to rapidly describe clinical characteristics and patient outcomes.",
          "More information will emerge in the coming days and weeks. WHO’s TAG-VE will continue to monitor and evaluate the data as it becomes available and assess how mutations in Omicron alter the behaviour of the virus.",
          "Recommended actions for countries",
          "As Omicron has been designated a Variant of Concern, there are several actions WHO recommends countries to undertake, including enhancing surveillance and sequencing of cases;  sharing genome sequences on publicly available databases, such as GISAID; reporting initial cases or clusters to WHO; performing field investigations and laboratory assessments to better understand if Omicron has different transmission or disease characteristics, or impacts effectiveness of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics or public health and social measures.  More detail in the announcement from 26 November.",
          "Countries should continue to implement the effective public health measures to reduce COVID-19 circulation overall, using a risk analysis and science-based approach . They should increase some public health and medical capacities to manage an increase in cases.  WHO is providing countries with support and guidance for both readiness and response.",
          "In addition, it is vitally important that inequities in access to COVID-19 vaccines are urgently addressed to ensure that vulnerable groups everywhere, including health workers and older persons, receive their first and second doses, alongside equitable access to treatment and diagnostics.",
          "Recommended actions for people",
          "The most effective steps individuals can take to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus is to keep a physical distance of at least 1 metre from others; wear a well-fitting mask; open windows to improve ventilation; avoid poorly ventilated or crowded spaces; keep hands clean; cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or tissue; and get vaccinated when it’s their turn.",
          "WHO will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available, including following meetings of the TAG-VE. In addition, information will be available on WHO’s digital and social media platforms."

The TAG-VE was convened on 26 November 2021 to assess the SARS-CoV-2 variant: B.1.1.529.",
          "The B.1.1.529 variant was first reported to WHO from South Africa on 24 November 2021. The epidemiological situation in South Africa has been characterized by three distinct peaks in reported cases, the latest of which was predominantly the Delta variant. In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant. The first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021.",
          "This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs. The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa. Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant. Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation. Using this approach, this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage.",

The campaign kicks off on today’s International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and will run until Human Rights Day on Friday 10 December.",
          "“Violence is never the answer, especially at home, which should be a safe environment for everyone, and particularly for women and children,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “It is FIFA’s statutory obligation to respect all internationally recognized human rights and as an organization, FIFA shall strive to promote the protection of these rights. The #SafeHome campaign is now in its second year, and FIFA will continue to make football’s voice heard to amplify this message until these acts are no longer part of our society.”",

WHO is pleased to team up with FIFA and football stars around the world to help prevent violence against women, and children, support survivors, and make our societies safer and healthier for all.”",
          "Violence against women remains devastatingly pervasive and starts alarmingly young, according to data from  WHO. Across their lifetime, 1 in 3 women aged 15 and over, around 736 million, are subjected to physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate\r\n    partner or sexual violence from a non-partner – a number that has remained largely unchanged over the past decade.",
          "This violence starts early: 1 in 4 young women (aged 15-24 years) who have been in a relationship will have already experienced violence by an intimate partner by the time they reach their mid-twenties. Data suggests women’s exposure to violence\r\n    has likely increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to lockdowns and disruptions to vital support services.",
          "Violence – in all its forms – can impact a person’s health and well-being throughout their life. It is associated with increased risk of injuries, depression, anxiety disorders, unplanned pregnancies, sexually-transmitted infections\r\n    including HIV and many other health problems, and comes with tremendous costs to households, communities and societies as a whole.",
          "The five-part #SafeHome video campaign, which supports the WHO’s message to end violence against women and children, is being published in seven languages during the next 16 days. The campaign raises awareness of the risks and highlights actions that can be taken to prevent and mitigate these risks through survivor advice and support. There is also content that addresses perpetrator risk and calls for additional governmental effort to support those who are in a vulnerable situation.",

          "These players will publish their #SafeHome contribution on their channels, while the campaign will also feature on various FIFA and WHO digital platforms. Graphical toolkits are also being provided to the 211 FIFA member associations to further amplify messages in their territories.",
          "“Once again, we call upon FIFA member associations to pro-actively publish details of national or local helplines and support services that can help anyone who feels threatened by violence,” added the FIFA President. “In this regard, we also call upon our members to review their own safeguarding measures using the FIFA Guardians toolkit, to ensure that football is fun and safe for everyone in our game, especially the youngest members of the football community. This is what FIFA stands for, and it is what all of football has to stand for.”",
          "The World Health Organization (WHO) and FIFA signed a four-year collaboration in 2019 to promote healthy lifestyles through football globally. More information on the WHO-FIFA memorandum of understanding can be found here , while previous campaigns include #ReachOut prior\r\n to World Mental Health Day, Pass the message to kick out coronavirus and #BeActive on\r\n the UN International Day of Sport for Development and Peace."

Some countries have given emergency use authorization for mRNA vaccines for use in the adolescent age group (aged 12-17 years): BNT162b2 developed by Pfizer, and mRNA 1273 developed by Moderna. In November 2021, one stringent regulatory authority approved the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 for the use in children aged 5-11. Trials in children as young as age 3 years were completed for two inactivated vaccines (Sinovac-CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV) and these products were approved by Chinese authorities for the age indication of 3-17 years; although these vaccine products have received EUL for adults, they have not yet received WHO EUL for children. Covaxin, an adjuvanted inactivated vaccine developed by Bharat, was approved in India for the age indication of 12-17 years; but not yet received WHO EUL for this age indication. The Indian regulatory authorities have given approval to ZycovD, a novel DNA vaccine, for ages 12-17 years; however, this vaccine has not yet received WHO EUL. Several COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing trials in younger age groups (including as young as 6 months of age), but results have not yet been published.",

The WHO global vaccination strategy targets remain: 40% of each country’s population by end of 2021, and 70% by mid-2022(2). These coverage targets were set to ensure an equitable pace of global vaccine rollout & prioritization of those at highest risk. To date, these targets have not yet been achieved.",

Older children and younger adolescents (5 to 14 years) account for 7% (7 058 748) of reported global cases and 0.1% (1 328) of reported global deaths while older adolescents and young adults (15 to 24 years) represent 15% (14 819 320) of reported global cases and 0.4% (7 023) of reported global deaths. Deaths for all ages less than 25 years represented less than 0.5% of reported global deaths.",
          "Children and adolescents usually demonstrate fewer and milder symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adults and are less likely than adults to experience severe COVID-19(4). Milder symptoms and asymptomatic presentations may mean less frequent care seeking in these groups, thus children and adolescents tend to be tested less and cases may go unreported. An age-dependent risk of severe disease with those under one year of age experiencing more severe disease has been suggested(5, 6), although several reviews show that neonates (infants in the first 28 days of life) have mild disease when compared with other paediatric patients(7, 8). It is important to note that children under the age of five years have a higher risk of other diseases with clinical presentations that overlap with COVID-19, such as pneumonia and other viral upper respiratory tract infections, which may lead to misclassification. Additionally, age disaggregation has not been systematically provided in the literature, and the results of these studies are context-specific depending on factors such as timing within the pandemic and an emphasis on hospitalized patients(6).",
          "Children and adolescents can experience prolonged clinical symptoms (known as “long COVID-19”, post COVID-19 condition(9), or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection), however, the frequency and characteristics of these conditions are still under investigation. Additionally, a hyperinflammatory syndrome, referred to as  paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in Europe and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in the United States, although rare, has been reported to occur world-wide and complicate recovery from COVID-19(10).",
          "Several risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children have been reported recently, including older age, obesity, and preexisting conditions. The preexisting conditions associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 include type 2 diabetes, asthma, heart and pulmonary diseases, and neurologic, neurodevelopmental (in particular, Down Syndrome) and neuromuscular conditions(11).",
          "The preponderance of evidence on the risk for severe COVID-19 and death in children and adolescents comes from studies in high resource settings, so the applicability of the following observations to lower resource settings remains to be determined. One systematic review suggests that there may be larger impact of paediatric COVID-19 related fatality in low to middle income countries versus high income countries (12)."

          "Multiple population-based SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and viral shedding studies have investigated whether children and adolescents are infected at the same rate as adults, but the results have been mixed, possibly because of the studies being conducted at different time points in the pandemic when populations were subjected to different public health and social measures (PHSM)(13). A serosurvey done in India during June-July 2021 after the second wave (Delta variant) showed that seropositivity in children 6-18 years was similar to that in older age groups - except in those older than 60 years in whom the immunization rate was high. Overall, it appeared that whether schools were open or closed, infection rates in children and adults were similar.  Thus, it appears that children of all ages can become infected and can spread the virus to others.",
          "Outbreaks of COVID-19 have been identified in secondary schools, summer camps and day care centres, particularly when neither physical distancing nor masks were used to reduce infection transmission risk. There is some preliminary evidence that younger children may be less infectious, as measured by secondary attack rates, than adolescents and adults(14). Data on the global incidence of COVID-19 suggest adolescents test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a higher proportion than younger children, however seroprevalence surveys are required to provide more conclusive information on infection rates.",
          "Children who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 shed the virus in their respiratory tract and also in their faeces(15). Amongst individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2 who were tested at the same time point after symptom onset, levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA shedding in the respiratory tract appeared similar in children, adolescents, and adults(16).",
          "The relationship between age, viral load, and transmission across the full symptom spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been comprehensively investigated because people with no, or mild symptoms are seldom tested systematically. The relative transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 at different ages remains uncertain, largely due to the challenges involved in disentangling the influences of biological, host, virus, variants of concern, and environmental factors(17)."

          "Despite their lower risk of severe COVID-19 disease, children and adolescents have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 control measures. The most important indirect effects are related to school closures which have disrupted the provision of educational services and increased emotional distress and mental health problems. When unable to attend school and in social isolation, children are more prone to maltreatment and sexual violence, adolescent pregnancy, and child marriage, all of which increase the probability of missing further education and of poor pregnancy outcomes. A range of follow-on effects of school closures occur. These include disruption in physical activity and routines and loss of access to a wide range of school-provided services such as school meals, health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and services targeted to children with special needs such as learning support, speech therapy and social skills training. Children not attending school face enhanced risks of cyberbullying from other children, and the potential for predatory behavior from adults related to spending more time online. Longer-term, prolonged school closures lead to education loss and exacerbation of pre-existing inequalities and marginalization of learning. It is estimated that 24 million children are at risk of not returning to school owing to the pandemic(18); those affected have been estimated to incur a US$10 trillion loss in lifetime earnings (19). At societal level, economic devastation wrought by COVID-19 may take years to overcome, exacerbating economic inequalities, poverty, unemployment, household financial insecurity, food insecurity, and malnutrition, all of which negatively impact children, often disproportionately. Routine immunization services have also been negatively affected as a result of the pandemic response, thereby exacerbating the potential resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, tetanus, yellow fever, HPV, and others(20)."

          "In Phase 2/3 trials for both mRNA vaccines, efficacy and immunogenicity were similar or higher compared to adults; safety and reactogenicity profiles in adolescents were similar to young adults. A very rare signal of myocarditis/pericarditis has been reported with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines as some countries have started to use these vaccines in their COVID-19 programmes. These cases occurred more often in younger men (16-24 years of age) and after the second dose of the vaccine, typically within a few days after vaccination. As the mRNA vaccines are just being rolled out in adolescents in some countries, the risk of myocarditis in that age group has not yet been fully determined. Available data suggest that the cases of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination are generally mild and respond to conservative treatment, and are less severe with better outcomes than classical myocarditis or COVID-19. The risk of myocarditis/pericarditis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher than the risk after vaccination(21). In October 2021, the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) concluded that in all age groups the benefits of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in reducing hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 outweigh the risks. The risk of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) following adenoviral-vector vaccines, although overall low, was higher in younger adults compared to older adults, but no data are available on the risk below the age of 18 years."

          "In the context of ongoing global COVID-19 vaccine supply constraints, the focus of immunization programs must remain on protecting sub-populations at highest risk of hospitalizations and deaths, according to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap. There is now overwhelming evidence that immunisation of all adults with COVID-19 vaccines provides important health returns on investment. Adult immunisation is feasible in all countries with the right investments and is being actively pursued in almost all countries. However, the benefits of vaccinating children to reduce the risk of severe disease and death are much less than those associated with vaccinating older adults. Countries with few or no vaccine supply constraints should consider the issues of  global equity  when making policy decisions about vaccinating children and adolescents. Any guidance on vaccine use prioritization, including booster dose policy, cannot ignore the current, on-going profound inequities in global vaccine access. While higher-income countries expand their vaccination programmes to adolescents, children, and, in some countries, booster doses to a large proportion of their populations, many lower-income countries still lack sufficient vaccine supply to offer a primary vaccination series to their highest priority-use groups, including older adults and health care workers who comprise only a small proportion of their populations."

          "Although benefit-risk assessments clearly underpin the benefit of vaccinating all age groups, including children and adolescents, the direct health benefit of vaccinating children and adolescents is lower compared with vaccinating older adults due to the lower incidence of severe COVID-19 and deaths in younger persons. Safety signals identified after widespread roll-out, such as myocarditis, albeit rare, are reported more frequently in young persons aged 16-24 years, particularly males; the risk of myocarditis in adolescents and/or children has not yet been determined.",
          "Reducing intergenerational transmission is an important additional public health objective when vaccinating children and adolescents. Prior to the emergence of the delta variant, it was reported that the risk of symptomatic cases in household contacts of vaccinated cases was about 50% lower than that among household contacts of unvaccinated cases(22). However, the impact of vaccination on reducing transmission in the context of the more transmissible delta variant appears to be lower(23). Teachers, family members, and other adult contacts of children and adolescents should all be vaccinated.",
          "Vaccinating children and adolescents may also help advance other highly valued societal goals. Maintaining education for all school-aged children should be an important priority during this pandemic. School attendance is critical to the well-being and life prospects of children and to parental participation in the economy. Vaccinating school-aged children may help minimize school disruptions by reducing the number of infections at school and the number of children required to miss school because of quarantine requirements.",
          "The benefit of vaccinating children and adolescents may be lower in settings with high seropositivity rates in that age group, however, more evidence is needed on seroprevalence of school-aged children."

        "heading": "Conclusions",
        "content": [
          "Countries should consider the individual and population benefits of immunising children and adolescents in their specific epidemiological and social context when developing their COVID-19 immunisation policies and programs.  As children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults, unless they are in a group at higher risk of severe COVID-19, it is less urgent to vaccinate them than older people, those with chronic health conditions and health workers.",
          "There are benefits of vaccinating children and adolescents that go beyond the direct health benefits. Vaccination that decreases COVID transmission in this age group may reduce transmission from children and adolescents to older adults, and may help reduce the need for mitigation measures in schools. Minimizing disruptions to education for children and maintenance of their overall well-being, health and safety are important considerations.  Countries’ strategies related to COVID-19 control should facilitate children’s participation in education and other aspects of social life, and minimize school closures, even without vaccinating children and adolescents (24). UNICEF and WHO have developed guidance on how to minimize transmission in schools and keep schools open, regardless of vaccination of school-aged children(25).",
          "Aligned and coordinated action is needed to achieve the global COVID-19 vaccination targets. Given current global inequity in vaccine access, the decision to vaccinate adolescents and children must account for prioritization to fully protect the highest risk subgroups through primary vaccination series, and as vaccine effectiveness declines with time since vaccination, through booster doses. As such, before considering implementing primary vaccination series in adolescents and children, attaining high coverage of primary series - and booster doses as needed based on evidence of waning and optimizing vaccination impact - in highest risk subgroups, such as older adults, must be considered(26).",
          "As a matter of global equity, as long as many parts of the world are facing extreme vaccine shortages, countries that have achieved high vaccine coverage in their high-risk populations should prioritize global sharing of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility before proceeding to vaccination of children and adolescents who are at low risk for severe disease.",
          "It is of utmost importance for children to continue to receive the recommended childhood vaccines for other infectious diseases."

The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV). Technical updates were received about the situation in the following\r\n    State Parties: Afghanistan, China, Guinea Bissau, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal and Ukraine."

          "WPV1 transmission has fallen to low levels, with no new case since January 2021 when two WPV1 cases occurred, one each from Pakistan and Afghanistan, compared to 129 WPV1 cases during the same time period in 2020. From environmental surveillance, the\r\n    overall proportion of specimens that are positive in Pakistan is 10% compared to 56% in 2020 and there have been only seven positive samples since April 2021, meaning the proportion of positives for the last six months is 2.2%. During last three months,\r\n    only one environmental sample has tested positive for WPV1 from the 163 assessed samples (from DI Khan in August). September 2021 was the first month since environmental surveillance started in Pakistan in which all of the assessed environmental samples\r\n    tested negative for WPV1. From the samples processed to date in October, no sample has been found positive. The committee also noted the completion of the surveillance review in Pakistan which found a high likelihood that the current WPV1 detection\r\n    is valid.",
          "The key challenge in Pakistan remains the ‘persistently missed children’ in the core reservoirs regarding which progress is being made through innovative approaches such as deploying evening vaccination teams, health camps, tracking of missed\r\n    and not available children after the SIA is completed, dealing with refusals before the campaign starts and using pro-vaccination influencers. The key challenge in Afghanistan remains the cumulative backlog of unvaccinated children due to extended\r\n    inaccessibility for insecurity reasons, and the current instability and humanitarian situation causing uncertainty about programme implementation. The planned NIDs in November and December using a house to house campaign strategy are a key opportunity\r\n    to address this large pool of unvaccinated children. Based on the progress achieved to date, the Committee noted the cautious optimism of the polio program and that the coming few months would be critical ones in interrupting polio transmission in\r\n    the two remaining endemic countries. There is no room for complacency, close monitoring will be required to ensure that each and every child is vaccinated."

The number of cVDPV2 cases in\r\n    2021 totals 420, of which 266 have occurred in Nigeria. The three newly infected countries were all the result of international spread of cVDPV2, namely Guinea Bissau, Mauritania and Ukraine. Based on analysis of genetic linkages between viruses,\r\n    cross border spread remains common with 10 documented importations into 10 countries in the second quarter of 2021. Despite the ongoing decline in the number of cases and lineages circulating, the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 remains high,\r\n    with experience in Egypt and Iran showing that even countries with high IPV coverage are at risk of established cVDPV2 transmission following importation.",

          "The committee was very concerned about the situation in Senegal where there has been an almost 12 month delay since the initial detection with no outbreak response yet conducted which had resulted in further cross border spread. The committee urged Senegal\r\n    to declare a national public health emergency as a means of invigorating response efforts and to take proactive steps to expedite its outbreak response.",
          "The committee was concerned by the reports of lengthy stockouts of vaccines including polio vaccine in Guinea Bissau and urged the country to take steps to rectify this and avoid repeat occurrences in the future. The committee recommended that routine\r\n    immunization be reviewed as stockouts may be a symptom of a wider problem.",
          "In Ukraine, steps need to be undertaken quickly to undertake an immunization response using whichever OPV2 is available, in addition to identifying groups and local areas where there are pockets of missed children. The committee noted also the GPEI guidance\r\n    on polio vaccination in an emergency situation which offers guidance on vaccinating refugees and could be applied to any mobile population.",
          "The committee noted the convincing efforts by China to rule out further transmission and accepted that nine months after the last detection of cVDPV3, China was no longer infected.",
          "The Committee welcomed the further progress achieved with the introduction and delivery of nOPV2 but was concerned to hear of significant delays in outbreak response timelines as countries opted to delay response in order to use nOPV2. Polio outbreaks\r\n    should continue to be met with an aggressive and timely response with the immediately available type-2 vaccine.",
          "The Committee warned of the ongoing effects of COVID-19 particularly on essential immunization and possible future disruptions of supply and delivery of vaccines. Zero-dose children and communities were missed before the advent of the pandemic and it\r\n    is critical that these children and communities are prioritized as essential immunization services are restored. COVID-19 is likely to continue to have adverse effects on all health programs and systems for some time to come so the polio programme\r\n    must continue to manage its response to overcome the remaining hurdles.",
          "Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 5 November 2021 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues\r\n    to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international\r\n    spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary\r\n    Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 5 November 2021."

In 2020, just 13% of girls aged 9–14 years globally were vaccinated against HPV – the virus that causes almost all cases of cervical cancer. Around 80 countries –\r\n    home to nearly two thirds of the global cervical cancer burden – are yet to introduce this lifesaving vaccine.",
          "During this special day, WHO’s Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, together with celebrities, first ladies, cancer survivors and health and community organizations, will help raise awareness and mobilize action – one year after WHO launched\r\n    its landmark global initiative to eliminate cervical cancer.",
          "WHO is also highlighting important new breakthroughs to prevent and treat the disease, including the prequalification of a fourth vaccine (Cecolin from a third manufacturer, Innovax) for HPV, which is expected to increase and diversify vital vaccination\r\n    supply.",
          "“Cervical cancer causes immense suffering, but it’s almost completely preventable and, if diagnosed early enough, one of the most successfully treatable cancers,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “We have\r\n    the tools to make cervical cancer history, but only if we make those tools available to everyone who needs them. Together with our partners in the WHO cervical cancer elimination initiative, that’s what we aim to do.”",

Others expanded the use of self-sampling  – endorsed in recently published WHO guidelines – to allow women to collect\r\n    their own cervical swab. This option can reduce stigma for women, provides access to those living far from health facilities, and helps congested health centres maintain safe services while respecting COVID-19 safety measures. The self-collected sample\r\n    can be run on the same laboratory platforms that countries have been investing in to support PCR testing for COVID-19.",

We encourage all countries to make better use of the many effective tools available for helping people to quit, and saving lives.”",

          "While reported measles cases have fallen compared to previous years, progress toward measles elimination continues to decline and the risk of outbreaks is mounting, according to a new report from the World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . During 2020, more than 22 million infants missed their first dose of measles vaccine - 3 million more than in 2019, marking the largest increase in two decades and creating dangerous conditions for outbreaks to occur.",
          "Compared with the previous year, reported measles cases decreased by more than 80 percent in 2020.",
          "However, measles surveillance also deteriorated with the lowest number of specimens sent for laboratory testing in over a decade. Weak measles monitoring, testing and reporting for measles jeopardize countries’ ability to prevent outbreaks of this highly infectious disease. Major measles outbreaks occurred in 26 countries and accounted for 84 percent of all reported cases in 2020.",
          "“Large numbers of unvaccinated children, outbreaks of measles, and disease detection and diagnostics diverted to support COVID-19 responses are factors that increase the likelihood of measles-related deaths and serious complications in children,” said Kevin Cain, MD, CDC’s Global Immunization Director .  “We must act now to strengthen disease surveillance systems and close immunity gaps, before travel and trade return to pre-pandemic levels, to prevent­­ deadly measles outbreaks and mitigate the risk of other vaccine-preventable diseases.”",
          "Lower reported measles cases in 2020 must not mask the growing risk of measles to children worldwide",
          "The ability of countries to ensure children receive both recommended doses of measles vaccine is a key indicator of global progress toward measles elimination and capacity to prevent the spread of the virus.  First-dose coverage fell in 2020, and only 70 percent of children received their second dose measles vaccine, well below the 95 percent coverage needed to protect communities from the spread of the measles virus.",
          "Adding to the worsening of immunity gaps worldwide, 24 measles vaccination campaigns in 23 countries, originally planned for 2020, were postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic - leaving more than 93 million people at risk for the disease. These supplemental campaigns are needed where people have missed out on measles-containing vaccines through routine immunization programs.",
          "“While reported measles cases dropped in 2020, evidence suggests we are likely seeing the calm before the storm as the risk of outbreaks continues to grow around the world,” said Dr Kate O’Brien, Director of WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals . “It’s critical that countries vaccinate as quickly as possible against COVID-19, but this requires new resources so that it does not come at the cost of essential immunization programs. Routine immunization must be protected and strengthened; otherwise, we risk trading one deadly disease for another.”",
          "Immunization and surveillance systems must be strengthened to reduce growing measles risks",
          "The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to immunization services and changes in health-seeking behaviors in many parts of the world. While the measures used to mitigate COVID-19 – masking, handwashing, distancing - also reduce the spread of the measles virus, countries and global health partners must prioritize finding and vaccinating children against measles to reduce the risk of explosive outbreaks and preventable deaths from this disease.",
          "Measles is one of the world’s most contagious human viruses but is almost entirely preventable through vaccination.  In the last 20 years, the measles vaccine is estimated to have averted more than 30 million deaths globally. Estimated deaths from measles dropped from around 1,070,000 in 2000 to 60,700 in 2020.  The estimated number of measles cases in 2020 was 7.5 million globally.  Measles transmission within communities is not only a clear indicator of poor measles vaccination coverage, but also a known marker, or ‘tracer,’ that vital health services are not reaching populations most at risk.",
          "The Measles & Rubella Initiative",
          "The Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI) is a partnership among the American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation, the U.S. CDC, UNICEF and WHO. Working with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and other stakeholders, the Initiative is committed to achieving and maintaining a world without measles, rubella and congenital rubella syndrome. Since 2000, M&RI has helped deliver measles vaccine to children worldwide and saved over 31.7 million lives globally by increasing vaccination coverage, responding to outbreaks, monitoring and evaluation, and supporting confidence and demand for vaccination.",
          "By the end of 2020, 81 countries (42 percent) had succeeded in sustaining their measles elimination status despite the pandemic, but no new countries were verified as having achieved measles elimination.  There are still 15 countries that have not introduced the measles second dose into their national immunization schedules, leaving children and adolescents in these countries especially vulnerable to measles outbreaks.",
          "Additional Quotes",
          "“For over two decades, Red Cross volunteers have reached members of their communities in need of life-saving vaccines. Volunteers provide critical health information to families through encouragement and a familiar face. This has helped shift minds and hearts to vaccinate millions of children within these communities,” says Koby Langley, Senior Vice President of the American Red Cross International Services and Service to the Armed Forces Department . “With the continuing global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, this work is vital. Now more than ever, we need to reach children who are unprotected against deadly disease and prevent further outbreaks.”",
          "“The pandemic is having a huge impact on countries’ ability to deliver essential health services such as routine immunization, placing millions of people, mainly children, at risk of highly infectious diseases such as measles. Our priority at Gavi is to help countries mitigate this risk and prevent disease outbreaks by closing the growing immunity gaps through strengthening routine immunization, and conducting well-planned, targeted catch-up campaigns,” said Anuradha Gupta, Deputy CEO, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance . “We must urgently address the critical measles immunity gaps with a particular focus on reaching zero-dose children who are most at risk of devastating measles outbreaks.”",
          "“Even before the pandemic, we were seeing how even small pockets of low measles immunization coverage could fuel unprecedented outbreaks, including in countries where the disease had been considered eradicated. And now, COVID-19 is creating widening gaps in coverage at a pace we haven’t seen in decades,” said Ephrem Tekle Lemango, UNICEF Associate Director for Immunization . “While we have not seen an increase in cases yet, measles is simply too contagious. If we do not act, gaps will become outbreaks, and many children will be exposed to a preventable but potentially deadly disease,” he added.",
          "“The decline of reported cases in measles means we have to redouble our efforts to protect the millions of endangered kids from dying of a fully preventable disease,” says Lori Sloate, Senior Director of Global Health at the UN Foundation . “The straightest path is to work together to leverage scarce resources that invest in local health system strengthening efforts to address both covid and basic immunization. One cannot come at the expense of the other.”"

Participating artists include soprano and arts and health advocate Renée Fleming ; American singer, actress, and founding member of Black Theatre United, Vanessa Williams ; and Syrian-American artist and architect Mohamad Hafez. Also participating are Aduke Gomez , Chairperson for Art4Health in the Ministry for Health in Lagos, Nigeria; Patrick J. Kennedy , former congressman and mental health advocate; Sunil Iyengar, Director of the Office of Research & Analysis at the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA); and Emmeline Edwards , Director of the Division of Extramural Research of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH).",
          "Christopher Bailey, Arts & Health Lead, World Health Organization, comments, “With a growing body of evidence that embedding the arts into systems and places of healing can improve health outcomes , lower costs and support recovery from illness and injury , now is the time for a ‘healing arts revolution’ that improves the wellbeing of millions of people worldwide.”",
          "The program will shine a special light on arts and health interventions on the ground, and highlight projects on the “frontline” of the pandemic where the crisis has exacerbated pre-existing threats to the environment, equity and access, economy, public health, political stability, and human rights.",
          "The Healing Arts Symposium marks the culmination of Healing Arts New York, the last of a series of 2021 city activations, produced by CULTURUNNERS, to convene global arts and health researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. As the world emerges from the greatest health crisis in a generation, Healing Arts aims to affirm what artists have always known and research is now proving—that the arts can heal.",
          "This program is made possible, in part, by donors to The Met’s Education Department in honor of the Museum’s 150th anniversary.",

          "The objective of the meeting was to identify how to ensure more equitable distribution of vaccines and all those participating pledged to continue working together to gain greater clarity on donations, vaccine swaps and delivery schedules so that distribution of the life-saving vaccines can be more effectively targeted towards those countries most in need.",
          "The meeting of the Multilateral Leaders Task Force on COVID-19 built on technical work undertaken by multidisciplinary teams during the months of September and October.",

          "The outlook for 2022 was also discussed, focusing on diversification of manufacturing across regions, as well as strengthening collaboration to achieve the global target of vaccinating 70% of the populations of all countries by the middle of the year. The group acknowledged progress in diversifying manufacturing, with new partnerships in multiple developing country regions, and stressed the need to continue to strengthen such manufacturing collaboration.",
          "The heads of the organizations encouraged all G20 governments to join the effort to meet the vaccination target of 40% by end-2021 by allowing manufacturers to prioritize COVAX and African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVAT) contracts; streamlining donations to COVAX and pledging more doses; exploring possibilities for effective vaccine swaps with COVAX and the AVAT; and eliminating export restrictions to vaccines and their inputs."

          "A group of 50 countries have committed to develop climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), in response to growing evidence of the impact of climate change on people’s health.",
          "The governments of these 50 countries, which include some of those most vulnerable to the health harms caused by climate change as well as some of the world’s biggest carbon emitters, have committed to take concrete steps towards creating climate-resilient\r\n    health systems.",
          "Forty-five of these countries have also committed to transform their health systems to be more sustainable and low-carbon. Fourteen have set a target date to reach net zero carbon emissions on or before 2050.",
          "The commitments were made as part of the COP26 Health Programme , a partnership between\r\n    the UK government, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Climate Champions and health groups, such as Health Care Without Harm.",
          "“The future of health must be built on health systems that are resilient to the impacts of epidemics, pandemics and other emergencies, but also to the impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events and the increasing burden of various\r\n    diseases related to air pollution and our warming planet,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.",
          "“Health systems must also be part of the solution, by reducing carbon emissions. We applaud those countries that have committed to building climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems, and we hope to see many others following their lead in the\r\n    near future.”",
          "Countries that have committed to achieving low-carbon, sustainable health systems include Argentina, Fiji, Malawi, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, the United States of America and 39 others. Countries that have committed to enhance the climate resilience\r\n    of their health systems include Bangladesh, Ethiopia, the Maldives, the Netherlands, and 45 others.",
          "The government of Fiji, for example, is responding to the increase in cyclones, flash floods, and rising sea levels causing lack of drinking water due to saltwater intrusion, by building more climate-resilient health infrastructure, strengthening the\r\n    health workforce, and providing health care facilities with sustainable energy services.",
          "“The message from WHO and health professionals around the globe is clear: climate change is a huge health challenge and we need to act now. I’m really pleased to see so many countries prioritising this issue through the COP26 Health Programme\r\n    and their level of ambition. Strong leadership from the health sector is vital to make sure we protect our populations from the impacts of climate change by enhancing the climate resilience of health systems, and by reducing emissions from the health\r\n    sector,” said Wendy Morton, Minister for Europe and Americas, in the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.",
          "The country commitments come off the back of a WHO survey , launched this week, which shows that the majority of countries now include health in their national climate plans to the Paris Agreement, but that plans often still lack detailed health actions or support mechanisms.",
          "“These government commitments exemplify the growing global health movement for climate action. Around the world doctors, nurses, hospitals, health systems and ministries of health are reducing their climate footprint, becoming more resilient and\r\n    advocating for a just transition that puts health at the centre of a decarbonized civilization,” said Josh Karliner, International Director of Program and Strategy of Health Care Without Harm.",
          "In addition to the national commitments, 54 institutions from 21 countries representing more than 14 000 hospitals and health centres have joined the UNFCCC Race to Zero and committed to achieving net zero emissions.",
          "A record number of health leaders are participating at the COP26 UN climate conference, and more than 45 million health professionals, representing two thirds of the world’s health workforce, have signed a letter urging governments to take stronger\r\n    action, noting that “hospitals, clinics and communities around the world have already been responding to the health harms caused by climate change”.",

Countries report that a lack of funding; the impact of COVID-19; and insufficient human resource capacity are major barriers to progress.",
          "The 2021 WHO health and climate change global survey report finds, however, that over three quarters of surveyed countries have developed or are currently developing national health and climate change plans or strategies.",
          "Some 85% of countries now have a designated focal point responsible for health and climate change in their ministries of health, while in 54% of countries, the ministry of health has established a stakeholder mechanism (such as a task force or committee) on health and climate change.",
          "About two-thirds of surveyed countries have conducted a climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessment or are currently undertaking one, while virtually all (94%) countries incorporate health considerations in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement.",

We are here at COP 26 to urge the world to better support countries in need, and to ensure that together we do a better job of protecting people from the biggest threat to human health we face today,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director of Environment, Climate Change and Health.",
          "Countries’ inability to protect health from climate change is most harmful for their most disadvantaged groups, including ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants and displaced people, older people and many women and children.",
          "“The health arguments for increased climate action are very clear. For example, almost 80% of deaths caused by air pollution could be avoided if current air pollution levels were reduced to the WHO Air Quality guidelines,” said Dr Neira.",
          "The WHO survey finds that insufficient finance continues to be the top stumbling block to fully implementing national health and climate change plans, cited by 70% of countries (up from 56% in 2019). Human resource constraints are the second biggest barrier, whilst about one third of countries identified a lack of intersectoral collaboration as a key barrier.",
          "About half of the countries report that the COVID-19 emergency has slowed progress on addressing climate change by diverting health personnel and resources, and continues to threaten national health authorities’ abilities to plan and prepare for climate-related health stresses and shocks.",
          "The report also notes a potential missed opportunity to identify and optimize the health benefits of adaptation and mitigation efforts in other sectors, which could have fed into a clean, healthy recovery from COVID-19: structural and social determinants of health, such as education, equity, gender, urban planning, housing, energy and transportation systems was represented in fewer than half of the established multisectoral mechanisms.",

Just one-third (33%) of country respondents have taken the opportunity to include climate change and health considerations in their plans for recovery from COVID-19 .",
              "There is progress in developing intersectoral collaboration on policies and programmes related to health and climate change. Most of these collaborations (>75% of country reported mechanisms) include representation from stakeholders or sectors addressing the environmental determinants of health such as safe water, sanitation and hygiene services (WASH), clean air and meteorological services. Representation of stakeholders or sectors focused on the structural and social determinants of health, such as education, urban planning, housing, energy and transportation systems is less common (40-50% of country reported mechanisms).",
              "Less than 40% of countries include weather and climate information in their health surveillance systems for climate-sensitive diseases. Most commonly countries have climate-informed health surveillance systems for vector-borne, waterborne, airborne or respiratory diseases.",
              "Only one-third of surveyed countries have climate-informed health early warning systems for heat-related illness (33%) or injury and mortality from extreme weather events (30%) despite strong evidence that these risks are increasing around the world.",
              "The health workforce is increasingly informed and trained on the connection between climate change and health (some level of training conducted in 42% of countries), but further efforts are needed to ensure capacity building covers a comprehensive set of relevant skills and is routinely integrated into health workforce development.",
              "A growing number of countries (27%) have conducted assessments of the climate resilience of their health care facilities .",

Access to international funds, including multilateral climate funds, needs to be substantially scaled up to reach the levels required to protect health from climate change.",

Almost all (94%) of 142 new or updated NDCs published in 2020-2021 mention health compared to 70% of 184 NDCs in 2019.

          "Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued an emergency use listing (EUL) for COVAXIN ® (developed by Bharat Biotech), adding to a growing portfolio of vaccines validated by WHO for the prevention of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.",
          "WHO’s EUL procedure assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and is a prerequisite for COVAX vaccine supply. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.",
          "“This emergency use listing expands the availability of vaccines, the most effective medical tools we have to end the pandemic,” said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products.\r\n    ‘But we must keep up the pressure to meet the needs of all populations, giving priority to the at-risk groups who are still waiting for their first dose, before we can start declaring victory.”",
          "COVAXIN ® was assessed under the WHO EUL procedure based on the review of data on quality, safety, efficacy, a risk management plan and programmatic suitability. The Technical Advisory Group (TAG), convened by WHO and made up of regulatory\r\n    experts from around the world, has determined that the vaccine meets WHO standards for protection against COVID-19, that the benefit of the vaccine far outweighs risks and the vaccine can be used globally.",
          "The vaccine is formulated from an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigen and is presented in single dose vials and multidose vials of 5, 10 and 20 doses.",
          "COVAXIN ® was also reviewed on 5 October by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), which formulates vaccine specific policies and recommendations for vaccines’ use in populations (i.e. recommended age\r\n    groups, intervals between doses, specific groups such as pregnant and lactating women).",
          "The SAGE recommended use of the vaccine in two doses, with a dose interval of four weeks, in all age groups 18 and above. COVAXIN ® was found to have 78% efficacy against COVID-19 of any severity, 14 or more days after the second dose, and\r\n    is extremely suitable for low- and middle-income countries due to easy storage requirements.",
          "Available data from clinical trials on vaccination of pregnant women are insufficient to assess vaccine safety or efficacy in pregnancy; however, initial studies were reassuring. The vaccine has been given to over 120 000 pregnant women in India, with no short-term adverse effects noted.  Further studies in pregnant women are planned.",
          "WHO emergency use listing",
          "The emergency use listing (EUL) procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies. The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency while\r\n    adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks.",
          "The EUL pathway involves a rigorous assessment of late phase II and phase III clinical trial data, as well as substantial additional data on safety, efficacy, quality and a risk management plan. These data are reviewed by independent experts and\r\n    WHO teams who consider the current body of evidence on the vaccine under consideration, the plans for monitoring its use, and plans for further studies.",
          "As part of the EUL process, the company producing the vaccine must commit to continue to generate data to enable full licensure and WHO prequalification of the vaccine. The WHO prequalification process will assess additional clinical data generated from\r\n    vaccine trials and deployment on a rolling basis to ensure the vaccine meets the necessary standards of quality, safety and efficacy for broader availability.",
          "See all EUL listings",
          "SAGE",
          "SAGE is the principal advisory group to WHO for vaccines and immunization. It is charged with advising WHO on overall global policies and strategies, ranging from vaccines and immunization technology, research and development, to delivery of immunization\r\n    and its linkages with other health interventions. SAGE is concerned not just with childhood vaccines and immunization, but all vaccine-preventable diseases.",
          "SAGE assesses evidence on safety, efficacy, effectiveness, impact and programmatic suitability, considering both individual and public health impact.  SAGE Interim recommendations for EUL products provide guidance for national vaccination policy\r\n    makers.  These recommendations are updated as additional evidence becomes available and as there are changes to the epidemiology of disease and the availability of additional vaccines and other disease control interventions.",

In focusing its energies on addressing the great equity gap for these tools, the ACT-Accelerator is bolstering its role as an ally for countries side-lined by market forces in securing life-saving interventions. Fully funding the ACT-Accelerator\r\n    is a global health security imperative for us all – the time to act is now.”",
          "The ACT-Accelerator’s plan to address inequities in access to COVID-19 vaccines, tests, and treatments will help avert more than 5 million potential deaths. It is also essential to the global economic recovery.

Nowhere is this inequity more apparent than on the African\r\n    continent, where just 8% of the population has received a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Every delay in fully funding the ACT-Accelerator will see the pandemic prolonged, more lives will be lost and more livelihoods will be devastated. We need equitable\r\n    access now to COVID-19 treatments, tests and vaccines, and this is a plan to achieve that.”",
          "Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre of Norway said: “While a new normal is emerging for people who have access to COVID-19 tools, this is still a distant prospect for the majority of the world’s population. Without access to COVID-19 tools,\r\n    we will not be able to achieve full economic and social recovery. The new ACT-Accelerator strategy is key to address inequities in access to COVID-19 tools. This is a collective effort. Now we must ensure inclusive and effective implementation.”",
          "The new strategic plan integrates key recommendations from an independent Strategic Review of the ACT-Accelerator that was published on 8 October 2021, including to extend the mandate of the ACT-Accelerator, enhance focus on delivery, and to further strengthen\r\n    engagement with low- and middle-income countries and civil society organisations to maximise impact.",

Through the COVAX pillar – led by Gavi, CEPI and WHO, alongside UNICEF as key delivery partner – and the Diagnostics pillar – led by FIND and the Global Fund – the ACT-Accelerator is working to address challenges of equitable access\r\n    and to help the world meet the global targets of 70% vaccination coverage by mid-2022 and minimum testing rates of at least 1 per 1000 people per day in 2022.",

          "Carl Bildt, WHO Special Envoy for the ACT-Accelerator, said : “Fully funding the ACT-Accelerator is the best way for the world to avert further economic losses caused by the pandemic. Vaccine inequity kills. Efforts on tests and\r\n    treatments are seriously underfunded, blinding and weakening us in fighting this virus. We have the tools to end this pandemic, but they will only succeed in doing so if every community in every country has access to them. Equitable pandemic policy\r\n    is also good economic policy and will help minimise the costs of this crisis. The time for warm words is over, the deadline to act is now.”",
          "Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI, said: “The pandemic is far from over so the ACT-Accelerator, as the only global initiative dedicated to equitable access, remains critical to global health security. However, the ACT-Accelerator\r\n    cannot deliver on its promises unless it receives dramatically more funding. The global community must step up and support our mission to get life-saving tools to people who need them, wherever they are in the world, so we can finally put an end to\r\n    this pandemic.”",
          "Dr Bill Rodriguez, CEO of FIND, said: “ The ACT-Accelerator has made critical updates to its strategy and plan to confront the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes acknowledge the reality of the two-track pandemic we are now fighting,\r\n    and the ongoing inequity of access to the tests, treatments, and vaccines that were so quick to be developed and so slow to reach billions of people. It is also clear that no single tool is a panacea – while the roll out of vaccines must continue,\r\n    it is equally important to hit the new testing targets so that we can track and defeat variants, break chains of transmission, and link people to new treatments and life-saving care.”",
          "Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said: “It is vitally important that governments, donors, industry and others support the ACT-Accelerator and its efforts to remedy the inequity in access to vaccines, diagnostics,\r\n    and treatments. In 2022, COVAX will be supporting countries’ vaccination objectives, focusing particularly on those that rely on it for access to safe and effective vaccines. We have seen the consequences of not having resources in place to\r\n    make deals for doses: with the race to secure doses for 2022 already underway, early funding will be essential to ensuring COVAX participants can achieve equitable coverage.”",
          "Peter Sands, Executive Director of the Global Fund, said: “ Inequity in access to COVID-19 tools remains unacceptably high while we face new variants, acute oxygen shortages and the urgent need to protect health workers in\r\n    low- and middle-income countries. Only by fully funding the ACT-Accelerator and working even more closely with the countries and communities can we fill those gaps and make vaccines, personal protective equipment, tests and treatments\r\n    accessible to everyone. As long as the poorest are left behind, the pandemic will not go away and any progress against COVID-19 will be at risk.\"",
          "Henrietta Fore, Executive Director of UNICEF, said: \"The pathway out of the pandemic is paved by equal access to vaccines, treatments and tests. Until we achieve this, we all remain at risk. UNICEF is delivering these vital supplies where\r\n    they are most needed, and helping countries prepare for their vaccination efforts. However, we cannot do this without the help and support of our donors and partners. Together, we can stop the pandemic from continuing to upend the lives of children\r\n    and their families everywhere.\"",
          "Dr Philippe Duneton, Executive Director of Unitaid, said: “To fight COVID-19 we need medicines such as oral antivirals, tests and vaccines. Unitaid, the co-lead of the ACT Accelerator’s therapeutics pillar, is committed to\r\n    rapidly bring state-of-the-art treatments to those in need, when approved by WHO. Getting new lifesaving medicines available to low- and middle-income countries at the same time as they come to wealthy countries, is not just key to speeding up an\r\n    end to the pandemic; it’s a moral imperative. For that we need to create a quality generic market.”",
          "Juan Pablo Uribe, Global Director for Health, Nutrition and Population, World Bank; Director for Global Financing Facility (GFF), said : “The World Bank is an active partner of ACT-A and we fully support the newly restructured Health\r\n    Systems & Response Connector (HSRC). While vaccines, tests and treatments are key to fight the pandemic, it is as important to help countries be able to effectively deploy these tools to the people who need them. That’s what the HSRC will\r\n    be focusing on.”"

          "On 9 July 2021, the COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) issued a statement regarding reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (1). Cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, although rare, have occurred more often in younger men (adolescents or young adults) and after the second dose, typically within a few days after vaccination with the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. As of June 2021, US VAERS surveillance data estimated crude reporting rates of 40.6 cases per million second doses among males and 4.2 cases per million among females aged 12-29 years (2). Current evidence suggests a likely causal association between myocarditis and the mRNA vaccines.",
          "In October 2021, some  public health organisations in the Nordic countries (e.g. Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland) either paused the use of the Moderna mRNA vaccine (Spikevax) or made preferential recommendations for the use of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty) rather than Spikevax in younger people and/or younger males. These recommendations were based on preliminary results of an unpublished Nordic study using population-based register data on myocarditis and pericarditis. As of October 2021, other countries (including the US and Australia) continue to recommend either of the two licensed COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in adolescents and young adults.",
          "The GACVS COVID-19 sub-committee has reviewed preliminary data from the Nordic study and notes that further analyses are ongoing to control for potential biases. The sub-committee has also reviewed data from Australia, Canada (3), Israel, and the US (4), and notes that, some, but not all data suggest a higher incidence of myocarditis after a second dose of the COVID19 vaccine from Moderna (Spikevax) than the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer (Comirnaty) in young males, although the overall risk is small. Further data are needed to understand the strengths/weaknesses of different epidemiological methodologies, sample sizes, and data sources, and their impact on these observations.",
          "The GACVS COVID-19 subcommittee notes that myocarditis can occur following SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease) and that mRNA vaccines have clear benefit in preventing hospitalisation and death from COVID-19.  Countries should continue to monitor reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination by age, sex, dose and vaccine brand. Countries should consider the individual and population benefits of immunisation relevant to their epidemiological and social context when developing their COVID-19 immunisation policies and programs.",
          "Available data suggest that the immediate course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with both vaccines is generally mild and responds to treatment. Follow-up is ongoing to determine long term outcomes. Vaccinated individuals should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as new onset and persisting chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. It is important to rule out other potential causes of myocarditis and pericarditis, including COVID-19 infection and other viral etiologies.",

It is currently being evaluated for inclusion into the\r\n    WHO living guideline on COVID-19 therapeutics and is pending authorization for its use from regulatory bodies. If approved, it will be the first oral medicine for non-hospitalized mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients.",
          "The MPP/MSD licensing agreement is a positive step towards creating broader access to the treatment as quickly as possible by allowing generic licensees from around the world to prepare supplies and create more affordable versions of the medicine, pending\r\n    WHO recommendations and other regulatory authorizations. This will shorten the time from approval of the medicine to its availability in the 105 low- and middle-income countries covered by the licence and where there is no patent infringement and\r\n    licensed know-how has not been used. We hope the company will include other key countries in the scope of the agreement in the near future.",

He highlighted the importance of the Committee’s work considering the ongoing challenges posed by the\r\n    COVID-19 pandemic. The Director-General emphasized that a tailored risk-based approach of vaccination in conjunction with appropriate public health and social measures (PHSM) is needed and reiterated the global call for action to scale up vaccination\r\n    to achieve 40% coverage for every country’s population by the end of 2021.",
          "Representatives of the Office of Legal Counsel (LEG) and the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics (CRE) briefed the members on their roles and responsibilities. The Ethics Officer from CRE provided the members and advisers with an overview\r\n    of the WHO Declaration of Interests process. The members and advisers were made aware of their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature\r\n    that may give rise to a perceived or direct conflict of interest. They were additionally reminded of their duty to maintain the confidentiality of the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee. Each member who was present was surveyed. Two\r\n    members reported changes in their professional responsibilities since the last meeting, but their new roles were assessed and not considered to generate a conflict of interest. One adviser has been appointed to WHO and will no longer participate in\r\n    the Committee in his former capacity. As such, no conflicts of interest were identified.",

The Committee urged for adequate resourcing, capacity building, and technical support for the Region and its Member States\r\n    to strengthen their surveillance and response efforts.",
          "The Committee thanked WHO for its leadership in coordinating the global COVID-19 pandemic response and for its continued effort and support to States Parties in reporting on implementation of the Temporary Recommendations. The Committee highlighted the\r\n    need for WHO Headquarters, Regional Offices, and Country Offices to continue supporting States Parties in implementing and reporting on Temporary Recommendations.",

Further research is needed on One Health aspects of SARS-CoV-2,\r\n    tools and medical devices (such as reusable masks and respirators), and next generation vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics for long-term control of the pandemic. In addition, research is needed to understand the attributable impact of individual\r\n    and combined PHSM in the evolving pandemic context, including aspects related to variants, host immunity from natural infection, and vaccine-derived immunity.",
          "The Committee underlined that, while progress has been made through increased uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, analysis of the present situation and forecasting models indicate that the pandemic is far from finished. The Committee emphasized\r\n    that there is a critical need for States Parties to continue using all available tools including PHSM, vaccination, diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective communications to control the pandemic and mitigate its negative impacts on health as well\r\n    as social-economic and educational contexts. In addition, the Committee recognized that the protracted nature of the COVID-19 pandemic poses an additional burden in the context of complex humanitarian emergencies, mass migration, population displacement,\r\n    and other crises. As such, the Committee suggested States Parties consider revising their preparedness and response plans and assistance policies to account for these interdependencies.",
          "The Committee unanimously agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic still constitutes an extraordinary event that continues to adversely affect the health of populations around the world, poses a risk of international spread and interference with international\r\n    traffic, and requires a coordinated international response. As such, the Committee concurred that the COVID-19 pandemic remains a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and offered its advice to the Director-General.",

              "MODIFIED: Continue to use evidence-informed Public Health and Social Measures (PHSM) and life-saving tools such as WHO recommended therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines for COVID-19. States Parties are advised to regularly\r\n        adjust their response strategies by monitoring their epidemiological situation, assessing their vulnerabilities including their health system capacity, as well as considering the adherence to and attributable impact of individual and combined\r\n        PHSM. The use of masks, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and improving ventilation of indoor spaces remain key to reducing transmission of SARS CoV-2. The use of established PHSM in response to individual cases or clusters of cases, including\r\n        contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, must continue to be adapted to the epidemiological and social context and enforced. Link to WHO guidance",
              "MODIFIED: Take a risk-based approach to mass gathering events by evaluating, mitigating, and communicating risks. Recognizing that there are different drivers and risk tolerance for mass gatherings and mass migrations, it is critical\r\n        to consider the epidemiological context (including the prevalence of variants of concern, the strength of transmission, as well as contact tracing and testing capacity) when conducting this risk assessment in line with WHO guidance. In particular,\r\n        fragile and vulnerable States Parties need additional support to address the challenges posed by conflicts, mass migration, or unplanned mass gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Link to WHO guidance",
              "MODIFIED: Achieve the WHO call to action to have at least 40% of all countries’ populations vaccinated by the end of 2021. Increased global solidarity and production capacity is needed to protect vulnerable populations from\r\n        the emergence and spread of SARS CoV-2 variants. States Parties are requested to share doses to increase global vaccine equity and to use a step-wise approach to vaccination, in accordance with advice from SAGE. Vaccination programmes should include\r\n        vulnerable populations, including sea farers and air crews. To enhance vaccine uptake, States Parties are encouraged to assess enablers and barriers to vaccination. Link to WHO SAGE Prioritization Roadmap and SAGE Interim Statement on Booster Doses for COVID-19 Vaccination",
              "MODIFIED: Enhance surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and continue to report to WHO to enable rapid identification, tracking, and evaluation of variants and continued monitoring of the pandemic’s evolution and its control. States Parties\r\n        are encouraged to strengthen their surveillance systems by implementing a dual-pronged approach for acute event and molecular surveillance strategies, including timely and representative genomic surveillance data. States Parties should leverage\r\n        existing national, regional, and global networks, such as the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.

              "EXTENDED: Maintain essential health services with sufficient funding, supplies, and human resources; strengthen health systems to cope with mental health impacts of the pandemic in adults and children, concurrent disease outbreaks,\r\n        and other emergencies. Link to WHO position paper",
              "EXTENDED: Continue a risk-based approach to facilitate international travel and share information with WHO on use of travel measures and their public health rationale. In accordance with the IHR, measures (e.g. masking, testing, isolation/quarantine,\r\n        and vaccination) should be based on risk assessments, consider local circumstances, and avoid placing the financial burden on international travellers in accordance with Article 40 of the IHR. Link to WHO guidance",
              "EXTENDED: Do NOT require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 for international travel as the only pathway or condition permitting international travel given limited global access and inequitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.\r\n        State Parties should consider a risk-based approach to the facilitation of international travel by lifting or modifying measures, such as testing and/or quarantine requirements, when appropriate, in accordance with the WHO guidance.

              "EXTENDED: Address community engagement and communications gaps at national and local levels to reduce COVID-19 transmission, counter misinformation, and improve COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, where applicable. This will require reinforcing\r\n        messages that a comprehensive public health response is needed. Link to WHO risk communications resources",

          "This announcement comes after the relevant regulatory authorities and ethics committees have granted approval for the study to progress.",
          "The national principal investigators and their research teams in Colombia, Mali, and the Philippines have begun recruiting volunteers joining the trial.",
          "The Solidarity Trial Vaccines is beginning with research teams in over 40 trial sites spread across the three countries. National research teams bring together experienced investigators well-versed in good clinical practice and the conduct of clinical trials.",
          "To date, the independent vaccine prioritization advisory group has reviewed the evidence of around 20 candidate vaccines. Following the recommendation of the working group, 2 candidate vaccines are now included in the Solidarity Trial Vaccines. These are a protein subunit vaccine from Medigen, and a DNA vaccine encoding the spike protein from Inovio.",
          "Two additional vaccines are expected to enter the Solidarity Trial Vaccines once additional evidence and documentation has been reviewed and accepted as satisfactory by the independent vaccine prioritization advisory group.",
          "It is expected that other candidate vaccines currently under consideration by the vaccine prioritization advisory group may be added to the trial in late 2021 and during 2022.",
          "The Solidarity Trial Vaccines aims to accelerate the evaluation of multiple promising candidate COVID-19 vaccines, contributing to the creation of a larger portfolio of vaccines needed to protect people from COVID-19 around the world. The trial has the additional potential to uncover second-generation vaccines with greater efficacy, conferring greater protection against variants of concern, offering longer duration of protection, and/or using needle-free routes of administration.",
          "Acknowledgments",
          "The WHO together with the Ministries of Health and Governments of Colombia, Mali and the Philippines are co-sponsoring the trial. Other countries will join the trial in coming weeks.",
          "Participating vaccine developers are donating the candidate vaccine used in the trial and technical support including training for local teams.",
          "The trial protocol and SOPs benefited from deliberations and inputs from hundreds of global experts participating in various WHO’s COVID-19 research and innovation collaborative platform [1] .",
          "The trial implementation benefits from the technical expertise of a global trial team composed of at least 50 international scientists and researchers from academia, research institutes, private sector and developing country research organizations. Under the auspices of this R&D Blueprint, the global team is providing the backbone end-to-end support to the Principal Investigators in each country on the resourcing, operationalization, and monitoring of the trial.",
          "WHO would like to further acknowledge the support of numerous organizations dedicated to the success of the Solidarity Trial Vaccines. The trial includes a partnership with Johnson & Johnson to implement the Vaccination Monitoring Platform – a digital tool that aims at improved participant identification and tracing, data management and two-way communication with participants to implement impactful clinical trials.",
          "Critical support is being provided by the Bern University (CTU), Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Castor EDC, Colsánitas, Colombia, Center for Vaccine Development Mali, Oxford University,  University of Florida, University of Liverpool, University of the Philippines, and the University of Washington. Numerous other partners are supporting the trial teams via contractual arrangements with WHO.",
          "Lastly WHO would like to thank the people in countries where the trial is being implemented for their participation, and all Principal Investigators and the field, laboratory, and data management staff who is working extremely hard and under difficult conditions to successfully implement this trial.",

          "The World Health Organization and partners [i] have issued an urgent call for concrete action to better protect health and care workers worldwide from COVID-19 and other health issues.",
          "The organizations are concerned that large numbers of health and care workers have died from COVID-19, but also that an increasing proportion of the workforce are suffering from burnout, stress, anxiety and fatigue.",
          "In a Joint Statement issued this week, WHO and partners are calling\r\n    on all Member State governments and stakeholders to strengthen the monitoring and reporting of COVID-19 infections, ill-health and deaths among health and care workers. They should also include disaggregation by age, gender and occupation as a standard\r\n    procedure, to enable decision makers and scientists to identify and implement mitigation measures that will further reduce the risk of infections and ill-health.",
          "The Statement also urges political leaders and policy makers to do all within their power to make regulatory, policy and investment decisions that ensure the protection of health and care workers. It highlights the opportunity to align this with a forthcoming\r\n    global health and care worker compact and the International Labour Organization’s call for a human-centered recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.",
          "Finally, the partners call upon leaders and policy makers to ensure equitable access to vaccines so that health and care workers are prioritized in the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations. Available data from 119 countries suggest that by September 2021,\r\n    2 in 5 health and care workers were fully vaccinated on average, with considerable difference across regions and economic groupings. Less than 1 in 10 have been fully vaccinated in the African region while 22 mostly high-income\r\n    countries reported that above 80% of their health and care workers are fully vaccinated. These rates only account for data reported to WHO through the standard mechanisms.",
          "“ We have a moral obligation to protect all health and care workers, ensure their rights and provide them with decent work in a safe and enabling practice environment. This must include access to vaccines” , said Jim Campbell, Director\r\n    of the WHO Health Workforce Department. “ Beyond vaccines , economic recovery  and all new investments in emergency preparedness and response must prioritize  the education and employment of health and care workers, linking to the UN  Secretary-General’s Global Accelerator for Jobs and Social Protection ,” he added.",
          "A new WHO working paper estimates\r\n that between 80 000 to 180 000 health and care workers could have died from COVID-19 in the period between January 2020 to May 2021, converging to a medium scenario of 115 500 deaths. These estimates are derived from the 3.45 million COVID-19 related\r\n    deaths reported to WHO as at May 2021; a number by itself considered to be much lower than the real death toll (60% or more than what is reported to WHO).",
          "“ This WHO working paper provides a stark number to stimulate greater action; we cannot afford to lose more health and care workers and our world will not recover from the pandemic without long-term, sustainable investments in the health workforce ,”\r\n said Catherine Duggan, Chief Executive Officer of the International Pharmaceutical Federation and one of several members of the World Health Professions Alliance allied with the Joint Statement.",
          "WHO is currently leading efforts to develop a global health and care worker compact, based on existing legal instruments, conventions and resolutions. The compact aims to provide Member States, stakeholders and institutions with comprehensive guidance\r\n    on their existing obligations to protect health and care workers, safeguard their rights, and to promote and ensure decent work, free from gender, racial and all other forms of discrimination. The guidance will be presented to the 75 th World Health Assembly in May 2022.",

          "WHO today published its Management Response Plan to address the findings of the Independent Commission (IC) on allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation (SEA) during the response to the 10 th Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) following the issuing of the IC’s report on 28 September.",
          "“I am committed to ensuring that the suffering of the survivors and their families is the catalyst for a profound transformation of WHO’s culture”, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This plan outlines the changes we will make as an organisation to make good on this commitment and to create a culture in which there is no opportunity for sexual exploitation and abuse to happen, no impunity if it does and no tolerance for inaction.”",
          "The plan outlines short-term actions focusing on the most urgent recommendations of the IC Report: supporting the survivors and their families; completing investigations; taking urgent managerial action and launching a series of internal reviews and audits; and reforming WHO structures and culture. The plan also describes the actions that WHO will undertake over the next 15 months to establish and operationalise a victim- and survivor-centered approach; ensure WHO personnel and leaders are accountable for prevention, detection and response to SEA; and initiate an overhaul of WHO’s policies, procedures and practices to increase safeguards against SEA in its programmes and operations.",
          "WHO is committed to providing livelihood support for victims and survivors of SEA, including more comprehensive medical and psycho-social support; support for learning a trade, and resources to start a small business; as well as supporting children born as a result of SEA, through educational grants and the covering of medical fees.",
          "Alleged managerial and potential misconduct will also continue to be investigated in respect to the failure to initiate investigation procedures as described in the IC report.",
          "WHO has also allocated an initial US$7.6 million to strengthen its capacity to prevent, detect and respond to sexual abuse allegations in ten countries with the highest risk profile: Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, DRC, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Venezuela and Yemen. In addition, WHO will ensure mandatory pre-deployment training and refresher training for any further deployments; reporting channels for alerts or complaints; prompt investigation of complaints; and monitoring.",
          "“WHO is already putting into action many of the recommendations of the Independent Commission”, said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “During the current Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, as part of our first wave of deployments we sent an expert in the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse to Beni. Together with UN partners she is giving an in-depth two- day training to staff and NGOs and is reaching out to community leaders to raise awareness.”",
          "In the past week, nearly 40 WHO and UN partner employees have received prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse training. Many of those trained will then cascade the training to other employees. Almost 30 members of local community-based associations have been briefed on how to protect the population from sexual abuse and report suspected cases.",
          "The response plan was developed with inputs from WHO staff across the organisation and from WHO Member states. It will be updated regularly to integrate the lessons learnt during implementation, and draw on the experience of UN agencies and humanitarian and development partners.",
          "The Prevention and Response to Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Harassment team in the Office of the Director-General will lead the global implementation of the plan.",
          "Note to Editors",
          "The Independent Commission was appointed by the WHO Director-General on 15 October 2020 to investigate allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse during the response to the 10 th Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC. It was co-chaired by Aïchatou Mindaoudou, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and of Social Development of Niger and Julienne Lusenge of the DRC, an internationally recognized human rights activist and advocate for survivors of sexual violence in conflict. It issued its final report on 28 September 2021."

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) and the State of Qatar today launched a new multiyear collaboration to make the 2022 FIFA World Cup, being held in Qatar, a beacon for physical and mental health promotion, and also a model for ensuring future mega sport events are healthy and safe.",
          "The three-year joint project, titled \"Healthy FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ - Creating Legacy for Sport and Health,\" was announced at a joint ceremony at WHO’s headquarters, in Geneva, by Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghrebreyesus, WHO Director-General; H.E. Dr Hanan Mohamed Al Kuwari, Qatar Minister of Public Health; H.E. Mr Hassan Al Thawadi, Secretary General of the Qatari Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy; FIFA President Mr Gianni Infantino; and Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean.",
          "WHO and Qatar, working closely with FIFA, will undertake joint activities to place the promotion of healthy lives, health security and physical and mental well-being at the heart of the world football’s pinnacle event, being held from 21 November-18 December next year.",
          "In addition, another critical goal of the project is to set and translate the best practices in health promotion, security and safety, as practiced at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, for use at major sporting events around the world.",
          "“I would like to thank Minister Al Kuwari and the State of Qatar for teaming up with WHO to make the 2022 FIFA World Cup a role model for healthy sporting events,” said Dr Tedros. “WHO is committed to working with Qatar and FIFA to leverage the global power of football to help people lead the healthiest and safest lives possible.”",
          "D Tedros added: “As the Qatar tournament will be the first FIFA World Cup held during the pandemic, the event offers a unique opportunity to show how sport can promote health now and provide a lasting legacy for organizing healthy sporting events as the world recovers from the pandemic.\"",
          "Dr Al Kuwari, Qatar’s Minister of Public Health, said: \"The State of Qatar is proud to be the first country from the Middle East to host the FIFA World Cup. But our goal is not just to hold a successful sporting event – it is also to hold the healthiest sporting event possible. It is for this reason we have teamed up with WHO.\"",
          "“We look forward to working closely with WHO, FIFA and other partners on this new project to deliver a fantastic, healthy World Cup and leave a legacy that supports the staging of healthy, sustainable and safe mega sporting events in the future.”",
          "The main themes the project will focus on are supporting people to practice healthy lifestyles, including through physical activity, healthy diets and tobacco cessation and control; promoting health security, with a focus on ensuring mass gatherings and events are safe; and advocacy and awareness-raising for health.",
          "Mr Gianni Infantino, President of FIFA, praised the new partnership between Qatar and WHO, and said it built on the successful partnership between FIFA and WHO signed in 2019 through a memorandum of understanding.",
          "“In these past two years, FIFA and WHO have doubled our efforts to promote the importance of physical and mental health to millions of people everywhere, especially in light of the global challenges from COVID-19. We are committed to working with the world of football, from elite players to grassroots teams, to advance the message of health for all. WHO’s new project with Qatar aligns perfectly with FIFA’s collaboration with both sides. Working together, we will harness the power of sports as a catalyst for a safer and healthier world.\"",
          "H.E. Hassan Al Thawadi, Secretary General for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy said: “Since being awarded the rights to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, we have carefully considered the importance of leaving sustainable and transformative social legacies that improve lives – in Qatar, within our region, and around the world.  With the experience of the pandemic, the importance of utilizing this platform to build awareness and improve public health has significantly increased.”",
          "“This partnership with WHO will serve to elevate and enhance our existing efforts and contribute to ensuring that our region’s first FIFA World Cup maximizes its potential for social impact and serves as a benchmark for future events of a similar nature.’ Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said the new partnership between WHO and Qatar would play a powerful role in spreading advice and messages throughout the Region on the benefits of sports for health. In addition, it will help promote the goal of achieving “Health for All By All,” which is at the heart of WHO’s strategic focus for the Region, Vision 2023. “Sport offers one of the most effective ways for people to lead healthy lives. WHO looks forward to working closely with Qatar to use the platform that sporting events offer to bring people together and foster solidarity, while at the same time promoting healthier habits, from diet to physical activity, for people of all ages, genders and cultures.” The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vital importance of physical activity for mental and physical health. According to the World Health Organization, up to 5 million deaths, a year could be averted if the global population was more active. WHO statistics show that one in four adults, and four out of five adolescents, do not get enough physical activity.  Globally this is estimated to cost US$54 billion in direct health care and another US$14 billion to lost productivity.",
          "At a time when the pandemic has deepened vulnerabilities and inequities, it is more than ever important to ensure everyone of all ages and abilities can have access to safe sports."

          "Football legend Didier Drogba was today announced as the World Health Organization's Goodwill Ambassador for Sport and Health. Drogba, from Côte d’Ivoire, will support WHO to promote the Organization’s guidance on the benefits of physical\r\n    activity and other healthy lifestyles, and highlight the value of sports, particularly for youth.",
          "Mr Drogba, well known for his football career at Chelsea and as a two-time African Footballer of the Year (2006 and 2009), has a long track record of participating in various health campaigns such as healthy lifestyles, anti-malaria and HIV prevention\r\n    and control.",
          "“I am honoured to team up with the World Health Organization and support its work to help people reach the highest level of health possible, especially young people in all countries,” said Mr Drogba during his ambassadorship announcement event\r\n    at WHO’s Geneva headquarters. “I have benefited first hand from the power of sports to lead a healthy life and I am committed to working with WHO to share such gains worldwide.”",
          "Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, hailed Mr Drogba as not only a football legend but a dedicated advocate for the health and sustainable development of communities, and added that his support for WHO can help curb the growing burden\r\n    of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) through the promotion of healthy lifestyles, including the benefits of physical activity and sports for all people.",
          "\"Didier is a proven champion and game changer both on and off the pitch,” said Dr Tedros. “We are pleased to have him playing on our team, and helping communities worldwide reach and score goals through sports for their physical and mental\r\n    health and well-being. He will also support the mobilization of the international community to promote sports as an essential means for improving the physical, mental health and social well-being of all people, including in helping COVID-19 recovery\r\n    efforts.”",
          "Current global estimates show four in five adolescents, and one in four adults, do not do enough physical activity. Increased physical inactivity also negatively impacts health systems, the environment, economic development, community well-being, and\r\n    quality of life. Regular physical activity, including through sports, helps lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and various types of cancer (including breast cancer and colon cancer).",
          "Mr Drogba’s announcement as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador was made during a ceremony to launch the \"Healthy 2022 World Cup – Creating Legacy for Sport and Health\" partnership between Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health and its Supreme Committee\r\n    for Delivery and Legacy, WHO and world football’s governing body, FIFA.",
          "Mr Drogba joins other WHO ambassadors including champion Brazilian footballer Alisson Becker;  Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and three-term Mayor of the City of New York; Cynthia Germanotta, President of the Born This Way\r\n    Foundation; and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown."

          "In 2020, more people died from TB, with far fewer people being diagnosed and treated or provided with TB preventive treatment compared with 2019, and overall spending on essential TB services falling.",
          "The first challenge is disruption in access to TB services and a reduction in resources. In many countries, human, financial and other resources have been reallocated from tackling TB to the COVID-19 response, limiting the availability of essential services.",
          "The second is that people have struggled to seek care in the context of lockdowns.",
          "“This report confirms our fears that the disruption of essential health services due to the pandemic could start to unravel years of progress against tuberculosis,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This is alarming\r\n    news that must serve as a global wake-up call to the urgent need for investments and innovation to close the gaps in diagnosis, treatment and care for the millions of people affected by this ancient but preventable and treatable disease.”",
          "TB services are among many others disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, but the impact on TB has been particularly severe.",
          "For example, approximately, 1.5 million people died from TB in 2020 (including 214 000 among HIV positive people).",
          "The increase in the number of TB deaths occurred mainly in the 30 countries with the highest burden of TB [1] . WHO modelling projections suggest the number of people\r\n    developing TB and dying from the disease could be much higher in 2021 and 2022.",
          "Challenges with providing and accessing essential TB services have meant that many people with TB were not diagnosed in 2020. The number of people newly diagnosed with TB and those reported to national governments fell from 7.1 million in 2019 to\r\n    5.8 million in 2020.",
          "WHO estimates that some 4.1 million people currently suffer from TB but have not been diagnosed with the disease or have not officially reported to national authorities. This figure is up from 2.9 million in 2019.",
          "The countries that contributed most to the global reduction in TB notifications between 2019 and 2020 were India (41%), Indonesia (14%), the Philippines (12%) and China (8%). These and 12 other countries accounted for 93% of the total global drop in notifications.",
          "There was also a reduction in provision of TB preventive treatment. Some 2.8 million people accessed this in 2020, a 21% reduction since 2019.  In addition, the number of people treated for drug-resistant TB fell by 15%, from 177 000 in 2019\r\n    to 150 000 in 2020, equivalent to only about 1 in 3 of those in need."

The WHO African Region came close to reaching\r\n    the milestone, with a reduction of 19%, which reflects impressive reductions of 4–10% per year in South Africa and  several other countries in southern Africa, following a peak in the HIV epidemic and the expansion of TB and HIV prevention\r\n    and care.",

The report provides important information and a strong reminder to countries to urgently fast-track their TB\r\n    responses and save lives,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Global TB Programme. “This will be crucial as preparations begin for the 2nd UN High Level Meeting on TB mandated for 2023.”",
          "The report calls on countries to put in place urgent measures to restore access to essential TB services. It further calls for a doubling of investments in TB research and innovation as well as concerted action across the health sector and others to address\r\n    the social, environmental and economic determinants of TB and its consequences.",

          "While she sought treatment, researchers took biopsies from Mrs Lacks’ body without her knowledge or consent.  Her cells became the first “immortal” cell line, and have allowed for incalculable scientific breakthroughs such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, the polio vaccine, drugs for HIV and cancers, and most recently, critical COVID-19 research.",
          "Shockingly, the global scientific community once hid Henrietta Lacks’ race and her real story, a historic wrong that today’s recognition seeks to heal.",
          "“In honouring Henrietta Lacks, WHO acknowledges the importance of reckoning with past scientific injustices, and advancing racial equity in health and science,” said Dr Tedros . “It’s also an opportunity to recognize women - particularly women of colour - who have made incredible but often unseen contributions to medical science.”",
          "The award was received at the WHO office in Geneva by Lawrence Lacks, Mrs. Lacks’ 87-year-old son.  He is one of the last living relatives who personally knew her.  Mr. Lacks was accompanied by several of Henrietta Lacks’ grandchildren, great-grand children, and other family members.",
          "“We are moved to receive this historic recognition of my mother, Henrietta Lacks – honouring who she was as a remarkable woman and the lasting impact of her HeLa cells. My mother’s contributions, once hidden, are now being rightfully honored for their global impact,” said Lawrence Lacks, Sr. , Henrietta Lacks’ eldest son. “My mother was a pioneer in life, giving back to her community, helping others live a better life and caring for others. In death she continues to help the world. Her legacy lives on in us and we thank you for saying her name – Henrietta Lacks .”"

Studies in various countries consistently document that Black women are dying of cervical cancer at several times the rate of white women, while 19 of the 20 countries with the highest cervical cancer burdens are in Africa.",
          "The family’s discussions with WHO especially focused on the Organization’s ambitious campaign to eliminate cervical cancer. The past year, which marked the 100 th anniversary of Henrietta Lacks’ birth, coincides with the inaugural year of WHO’s Global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer .  This historic campaign marks the first time ever that all WHO Member States have collectively resolved to eliminate a cancer.",
          "The family also joins WHO in advocating for equity in access to the HPV vaccine, which protects against a range of cancers, including cervical cancer.  Despite having been prequalified by WHO over 12 years ago, supply constraints and high prices still prevent adequate doses from reaching girls in low-and-middle income countries.",
          "As of 2020, less than 25% of low-income countries and less than 30% of lower-middle-income countries had access to the HPV vaccine through their national immunization programmes, compared with more than 85% of high-income countries.",
          "“It is unacceptable that access to the lifesaving HPV vaccine can be shaped by your race, ethnicity or where you happen to be born,” said Dr Princess Nothemba (Nono) Simelela, Assistant Director-General for Strategic Priorities and Special Advisor to the Director General . “The HPV vaccine was developed using Henrietta Lacks’ cells.  Although the cells were taken without her consent and without her knowledge, she has left behind a legacy that could potentially save millions of lives. We owe it to her and her family to achieve equitable access to this groundbreaking vaccine.”"

          "During treatment, researchers took samples of her tumour.  That “HeLa” cell line became a scientific breakthrough: the first immortal line of human cells to divide indefinitely in a laboratory.  The cells were mass produced, for profit, without recognition to her family. Over 50,000,000 metric tonnes of HeLa cells have been distributed around the world, the subjects of over 75,000 studies.",
          "In addition to the HPV vaccine, HeLa cells allowed for development of the polio vaccine; drugs for HIV/AIDS, haemophilia, leukaemia, and Parkinson’s disease; breakthroughs in reproductive health, including in vitro fertilization; research on chromosomal conditions, cancer, gene mapping, and precision medicine; and are used in studies responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "Following the presentation of the award, the family and WHO will proceed to the shores of Lake Geneva, to watch the city’s iconic Jet d’Eau illuminate in the colour teal – the colour for cervical cancer awareness – in honour of Henrietta Lacks’ legacy and in appreciation of the family’s support for the global campaign to eliminate the disease.  It is the first of several world monuments that will illuminate in teal between now and November 17th, marking the first anniversary of the launch of the global elimination campaign."

It is only fitting that as we commemorate the 70th anniversary of Henrietta Lacks’ HeLa cells and her untimely passing, we build upon her legacy by ensuring equitable access to advances in cancer prevention and treatment for all people.”",

I applaud the WHO for recognizing her, a vital step in acknowledging the incredible impact she’s had on science and honouring her legacy in advancing health justice for people around the world.”",
          "“The fight to eliminate cervical cancer is part of the larger fight for human rights,” said Dr Groesbeck Parham , who participated in the civil rights movement as a teenager in Birmingham, Alabama, and is now Clinical Expert for WHO’s cervical cancer elimination initiative and Co-Chair of the Director-General’s expert advisory group . “Through her immortal cells, Mrs. Henrietta Lacks speaks to us, also calling our attention to the millions of young women and mothers in low-income countries who still continue to die from cervical cancer because they cannot access and afford to purchase the life-saving medicines, technologies and medical procedures that are readily available in high-income countries. The questions being raised by the spirit and legacy of Mrs. Henrietta Lacks are: ‘why does this situation exist’, ‘what are the solutions’, and ‘when are you going to implement them.’”"

WHO calls on all countries to commit to decisive action at COP26 to limit global warming to 1.5°C – not just because it’s the right thing to do, but because it’s in our own interests. WHO’s new report highlights 10 priorities for safeguarding the health of people and the planet that sustains us.”",

          "“Wherever we deliver care, in our hospitals, clinics and communities around the world, we are already responding to the health harms caused by climate change,” the letter from health professionals reads. “We call on the leaders of every country and their representatives at COP26 to avert the impending health catastrophe by limiting global warming to 1.5°C, and to make human health and equity central to all climate change mitigation and adaptation actions.”",
          "The report and open letter come as unprecedented extreme weather events and other climate impacts are taking a rising toll on people’s lives and health. Increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, kill thousands and disrupt millions of lives, while threatening healthcare systems and facilities when they are needed most. Changes in weather and climate are threatening food security and driving up food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, while climate impacts are also negatively affecting mental health.",
          "The WHO report states: “The burning of fossil fuels is killing us. Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity. While no one is safe from the health impacts of climate change, they are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.”",
          "Meanwhile, air pollution, primarily the result of burning fossil fuels, which also drives climate change, causes 13 deaths per minute worldwide.",
          "The report concludes that protecting people’s health requires transformational action in every sector, including on energy, transport, nature, food systems and finance. And it states clearly that the public health benefits from implementing ambitious climate actions far outweigh the costs.",
          "“It has never been clearer that the climate crisis is one of the most urgent health emergencies we all face,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director of Environment, Climate Change and Health. “Bringing down air pollution to WHO guideline levels, for example, would reduce the total number of global deaths from air pollution by 80% while dramatically reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel climate change. A shift to more nutritious, plant-based diets in line with WHO recommendations, as another example, could reduce global emissions significantly, ensure more resilient food systems, and avoid up to 5.1 million diet-related deaths a year by 2050.”",
          "Achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement would save millions of lives every year due to improvements in air quality, diet, and physical activity, among other benefits. However, most climate decision-making processes currently do not account for these health co-benefits and their economic valuation.",

However, the percentage of government health budgets spent on mental health has scarcely changed during the last years, still hovering around 2%. Moreover, even when policies and plans included estimates of required human and financial resources, just 39% of responding countries indicated that the necessary human resources had been allocated and 34% that the required financial resources had been provided."

More than 70% of total government expenditure on mental health was allocated to mental hospitals in middle-income countries, compared with 35% in high-income countries.

This statement reflects the current understanding of vaccine performance and supply, as of the time of update.",
          "Definitions :",
          {
            "text": "The following definitions and terminology are used by WHO throughout its policy recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination. This note focuses only on booster doses .",
            "bullets": [
              "Booster doses are administered to a vaccinated population that has completed a primary vaccination series (currently one or two doses of COVID-19 vaccine depending on the product) when, with time, the immunity and clinical protection has fallen below a rate deemed sufficient in that population. The objective of a booster dose is to restore vaccine effectiveness from that deemed no longer sufficient.",
              "Additional doses of a vaccine may be needed as part of an extended primary series for target populations where the immune response rate following the standard primary series is deemed insufficient. The objective of an additional dose in the primary series is to optimize or enhance the immune response to establish a sufficient level of effectiveness against disease. In particular, immunocompromised individuals often fail to mount a protective immune response after a standard primary series, but also older adults may respond poorly to a standard primary series."
            ]
          },
          "Rationale for the administration of booster doses",
          "The current primary goal of immunization in the COVID-19 pandemic remains to protect against hospitalization, severe disease and death. Hence, booster doses may only be needed if there is evidence of insufficient protection against these disease outcomes over time.",
          "The degree of waning of immunity and need for booster doses of vaccine may differ between vaccine products, target populations, circulating SARS CoV-2 virus, in particular variants of concern (VoC), and intensity of exposure. For some vaccines, restricted booster indications have been included into the product label of some jurisdictions.",
          "In a period of continued global vaccine supply shortage equity considerations at country, regional and global level remain an essential consideration to assure vaccination of high priority groups in every country. Improving coverage of the primary vaccination series should be prioritized over booster vaccination.",
          "Factors to be considered",
          "1. Waning immunity",
          "Neither an immune correlate of protection nor of the duration of protection has been established to date. Studies suggest a correlation between the efficacy/effectiveness of different vaccines against symptomatic disease and mean neutralizing antibody titers induced by those vaccines in the short-term (1) , but it is unclear if declining titers over time since vaccination are indicative of declining vaccine effectiveness, especially against VoCs. While data on immunogenicity of some vaccines suggest that antibodies persist for at least 6 months (2) , waning of neutralizing antibodies has been reported (3) . Although there may be a loss of protection against infections by SARS-CoV-2, protection against severe disease is more durably retained due to anamnestic humoral and cell-mediated immunity (1) .",
          "2. Vaccine effectiveness",
          "Most studies on duration of protection are observational studies. Although often difficult to interpret due to confounding factors (4) , emerging data consistently show a decline in vaccine effectiveness against infection and milder forms of COVID-19 over time.  With respect to duration of protection against disease requiring hospitalization, current data show an overall continued high level of effectiveness, although data vary across age-groups, target populations, and products (5) . The vast majority of current infections are observed in unvaccinated populations, and if breakthrough infections occur in vaccinated persons, they are in most cases less severe than those seen in unvaccinated persons (6) .",
          "3. Global vaccine supply and global and national equity",
          "National vaccination programme policy decisions to add a booster dose should take into account the strength of evidence regarding the need for these doses, their safety and effectiveness, as well as the global availability of vaccines. Offering booster doses to a large proportion of a population when many have not yet received even a first dose undermines the principle of national and global equity. Prioritizing booster doses over speed and breadth in the initial dose coverage may also damage the prospects for global mitigation of the pandemic, with severe implications for the health, social and economic well-being of people globally.",
          "Data needs for policy",
          "The introduction of booster doses should be rigorously evidence driven. The duration of vaccine-induced protection is likely to depend on many variables, such as the vaccine product, the primary vaccination schedule, the age and/or underlying medical conditions of the vaccine recipient, risk of exposure, and circulation of specific variants. The decision to recommend a booster dose is complex and requires, beyond clinical and epidemiological data, a consideration of national strategic and programmatic aspects, and importantly an assessment of the prioritization of globally limited vaccine supply. In this context, prioritization should be given to the prevention of severe disease. Data needs can be grouped into the following categories:",

            ]
          },
          "Conclusions",
          "Introducing booster doses should be firmly evidence-driven and targeted to the population groups in greatest need. The rationale for implementing booster doses should be guided by evidence on waning vaccine effectiveness, in particular a decline in protection against severe disease in the general population and in high-risk populations, or due to a circulating VoC. To date, the evidence remains limited and still inconclusive on any widespread need for booster doses following a primary vaccination series.",
          "In the context of ongoing global vaccine supply constraints, broad-based administration of booster doses risks exacerbating inequities in vaccine access by driving up demand and diverting supply while priority populations in some countries, or in subnational settings, have not yet received a primary vaccination series.  The focus remains on urgently increasing global vaccination coverage with the primary series driven by the objective to protect against severe disease.",

          "WHO today published the new edition of its Model Lists of Essential Medicines and Essential Medicines for Children, which include new treatments for various cancers, insulin analogues and new oral medicines for diabetes, new medicines to assist people who want to stop smoking, and new antimicrobials to treat serious bacterial and fungal infections.",
          "The listings aim to address global health priorities, identifying the medicines that provide the greatest benefits, and which should be available and affordable for all. However, high prices for both new, patented medicines and older medicines, like insulin, continue to keep some essential medicines out of reach for many patients.",
          "“Diabetes is on the rise globally, and rising faster in low- and middle-income countries,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Too many people who need insulin encounter financial hardship in accessing it or go without it and lose their lives. Including insulin analogues in the Essential Medicines List, coupled with efforts to ensure affordable access to all insulin products and expand use of biosimilars, is a vital step towards ensuring everyone who needs this life-saving product can access it.”",
          "Medicines for diabetes",
          "Insulin was discovered as a treatment for diabetes 100 years ago and human insulin has been on WHO’s List of Essential Medicines since it was first published in 1977. Unfortunately, limited insulin supply and high prices in several low- and middle-income countries are currently a significant barrier to treatment. For example, in Ghana’s capital, Accra, the amount of insulin needed for a month would cost a worker the equivalent of 5.5 days of pay per month . Insulin production is concentrated in a small number of manufacturing facilities, and three manufacturers control most of the global market, with the lack of competition resulting in high prices that are prohibitive for many people and health systems.",
          "The move to list long-acting insulin analogues (insulin degludec, detemir and glargine) and their biosimilars, along with human insulin, is intended to increase access to diabetes treatment by expanding the choice of treatment. Inclusion in the List means that biosimilar insulin analogues can be eligible for WHO’s prequalification programme; WHO prequalification can result in more quality-assured biosimilars entering the international market, creating competition to bring prices down and giving countries a greater choice of products.",
          "Long-acting insulin analogues offer some extra clinical benefits for patients through their prolonged duration of action, which ensures that blood glucose levels can be controlled over longer periods of time without needing a booster dose. They offer particular benefit for patients who experience dangerously low blood glucose levels with human insulin. The greater flexibility in timing and dosing of insulin analogues has been shown to improve quality of life for patients living with diabetes. However, human insulin remains a staple in the treatment of diabetes and access to this life-saving medicine must continue to be supported through better availability and affordability.",
          "The list also includes Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin as second line therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes. These orally administered medicines have been shown to offer several benefits, including a lower risk of death, kidney failure and cardiovascular events. Because SGLT2 inhibitors are still patented and high-priced, their inclusion in the list comes with the recommendation that WHO work with the Medicines Patent Pool to promote access through potential licencing agreements with the patent-holders to allow generic manufacturing and supply in low- and middle-income countries.",

Other cancer medicines were not recommended for listing due to uncertain additional clinical benefit compared with already listed medicines, high price, and management issues in low-resource settings.

The Expert Committee considered 88 applications for medicines to be added to the 21 st WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) and the 7 th WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children (EMLc). WHO technical departments were involved and consulted with regard to applications relating to their disease areas.",
          "The updated Essential Medicines Lists include 20 new medicines for adults and 17 for children and specify new uses for 28 already-listed medicines. The changes recommended by the Expert Committee bring the number of medicines deemed essential to address key public health needs to 479 on the EML and 350 on the EMLc. While these numbers may seem high, they are only a small proportion of the total number of medicines available on the market.",
          "Governments and institutions around the world continue to use the WHO Model Lists to guide the development of their own essential medicines lists, because they know that every medicine listed has been vetted for efficacy and safety and delivers value for money for the health outcomes they produce.",
          "The Model Lists are updated every two years by an Expert Committee, made up of recognized specialists from academia, research and the medical and pharmaceutical professions. This year, the Committee underscored the urgent need to take action to promote equitable and affordable access to essential medicines through the list and complementary measures such as voluntary licensing mechanisms, pooled procurement, and price negotiation."

          "Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners launched the first ever global strategy to defeat meningitis - a debilitating disease that kills hundreds of thousands of people each year.",
          "By 2030, the goals are to eliminate epidemics of bacterial meningitis – the most deadly form of the disease – and to reduce deaths by 70% and halve the number of cases. The organizations estimate that in total, the strategy could save more\r\n    than 200,000 lives annually and significantly reduce disability caused by the disease.",
          "This strategy, the Global Roadmap to Defeat Meningitis by 2030, was launched by a broad coalition of partners involved in meningitis prevention and control at a virtual event, hosted by WHO in Geneva. Its focus is on preventing infections and improving\r\n    care and diagnosis for those affected.",
          "“Wherever it occurs, meningitis can be deadly and debilitating; it strikes quickly, has serious health, economic and social consequences, and causes devastating outbreaks,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General .\r\n “It is time to tackle meningitis globally once and for all –by urgently expanding access to existing tools like vaccines, spearheading new research and innovation to prevent, detecting and treating the various causes of the disease, and\r\n    improving rehabilitation for those affected.”",
          "Meningitis is a dangerous inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, predominantly caused by infection with bacteria and viruses.",
          "Meningitis that is caused by bacterial infection tends to be the most serious – leading to around 250,000 deaths a year - and can cause fast-spreading epidemics. It kills 1 in 10 of those infected – mostly children and young people - and leaves\r\n    1 in 5 with long-lasting disability, such as seizures, hearing and vision loss, neurological damage, and cognitive impairment.",
          "Over the last ten years, meningitis epidemics have occurred in all regions of the world, though most commonly in the ‘Meningitis Belt,’ which spans 26 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. These epidemics are unpredictable, can severely disrupt\r\n    health systems, and create poverty - generating catastrophic expenditures for households and communities.",
          "“More than half a billion Africans are at risk of seasonal meningitis outbreaks but the disease has been off the radar for too long,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa . “This shift away from\r\n    firefighting outbreaks to strategic response can’t come soon enough. This roadmap will help protect the health and lives of hundreds of thousands of families who every year fear this disease.”",
          "Several vaccines protect against meningitis, including meningococcal, Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal vaccines. However, not all communities have access to these lifesaving vaccines, and many countries are yet to introduce them\r\n    into their national programmes.",
          "While research is underway to develop vaccines for other causes of meningitis, such as Group B Strep bacteria, there remains an urgent need for innovation, funding and research to develop more meningitis-preventive vaccines. Efforts are also\r\n    needed to strengthen early diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation for all those who need it after contracting the disease.",
          "“This roadmap is the embodiment of the ambition of people and families affected around the world who have called for its creation. It's their experience and passion that has driven a whole community of interest to get this far,” said Vinny Smith, Chief Executive Officer of the Meningitis Research Foundation and the Confederation of Meningitis Organisations (CoMO) ,\r\n an international membership organization of patient advocacy groups for meningitis. “We celebrate together the common goal of defeating meningitis and will be led by their inspiration to make it happen.”",

          "Partner quotes",
          "“The Global Roadmap to Defeat Meningitis demonstrates what can be accomplished when a global need is met with global action,” said Nikolaj Gilbert, President and CEO of PATH. “Progress against meningitis has lagged for\r\n    too long; by working together, we can overcome the disease that has cost so many lives in countries around the world. PATH is proud to have been a part of the roadmap’s development and is committed to advancing affordable and equitable vaccine\r\n    solutions to defeat meningitis.”",
          "“We must be united in our efforts to end all preventable childhood diseases, including bacterial meningitis,” said Dr. Aboubacar Kampo, Director of Health Programmes at UNICEF . “UNICEF has been supporting governments\r\n    for decades, facilitating the delivery of life-saving meningitis vaccines. Still, far too many children are succumbing to this and other preventable diseases – and the situation is only worsening as a result of the pandemic. We need to act decisively\r\n    to strengthen primary health care and get routine immunization back on track, before more children face adverse health outcomes – or loss of life - inflicted by meningitis and other preventable infectious diseases.”",
          "“Although the main burden of meningitis is in poor countries, acute bacterial meningitis is a global problem with no country being spared its devastating impact,” said Professor Sir Brian Greenwood, Professor of Clinical Tropical Medicine at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and co-chair of the Task Force supporting the implementation of the roadmap. “Thus, containing this serious group of infections needs a global response. This is what the roadmap sets out to achieve, bringing together – under the umbrella\r\n    of WHO – health professionals from across the world to bring this condition under control by 2030.”",
          "“The Meningitis Roadmap provides a clear blueprint for defeating this devastating disease,” said Professor Robert Heyderman, Head of the Research Department of Infection at University College London . “Crucially it identifies\r\n    the gaps in our knowledge and the tools required. To achieve the Road Map’s ambitious goals, a team approach will bring together countries, global policymakers, civil society, funders, researchers, public health specialists, healthcare workers\r\n    and industry to generate and implement innovative new strategies.”",
          "Notes",
          "Today’s launch event was supported by a large network of organizations and individual experts involved in meningitis prevention and control, including the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the London School of Hygiene and\r\n    Tropical Medicine, Médecins Sans Frontières, Epicentre, the Meningitis Research Foundation, PATH, UNICEF, the Gates Foundation and CoMO. Additional acknowledgements go to all partners involved in the development of the Roadmap .",
          "The Roadmap is the result of the first ever resolution on meningitis, passed by the World Health Assembly and endorsed unanimously by WHO member states in 2020.",
          "As one of the first tangible outputs from this Roadmap, WHO and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine will be launching a global evidence-based report on November 3 rd about identifying and preventing deaths due to Group B strep,\r\n    also known as streptococcal bacteria, the major cause of neonatal and infant meningitis."

          "The quickening pace of scientific discovery and advancement of technology is making it more difficult for health workers, policy makers and other public health practitioners to keep up with evidence-based health practice and policy. As a result, it often takes more than a decade to put important life-saving guidelines into practice.",
          "This is a key reason why no country is currently on track to achieve all of the health targets of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted life-long learning systems, generating growing demand for digital learning.",
          "“The ambitions of the WHO Academy are not modest: to transform lifelong learning in health globally,” said Dr Tedros. “The COVID-19 pandemic is a powerful demonstration of the value of health workers, and why they need the most up-to-date information, competencies and tools to keep their communities healthy and safe.",
          "He added: “The WHO Academy is an investment in health, education, knowledge and technology, but ultimately it’s an investment in people, and in a healthier, safer, fairer future.”",
          "From its campus in Lyon, the Academy will provide millions of people around the world with rapid access to the highest quality life-long learning in health. It will offer multilingual, personalized learning programmes in digital, in-person and blended formats, deploying the latest evidence-based health guidance, state-of-the-art learning technologies and advancements in the science of adult learning.",
          "“The quality of the health workforce is the key to resilience during a health crisis”, said President Macron. “Investing in health systems is the best way to prepare for future pandemics. Success requires unprecedented coordination of all actors. WHO is, of course, a key player and its Academy will be an essential platform for disseminating learning”.",
          "The Academy aims to expand access to critical learning to health workers, managers, public health officials, educators, researchers, policy makers and people who provide care in their own homes and communities, as well as to WHO’s own workforce throughout the world. The vast majority will use online means to access the Academy’s programmes, which will be made available via desktop and mobile devices and in low-bandwidth settings, thereby ensuring an equitable, global and diverse cohort of learners.",

          "WHO has updated its recommendation on casirivimab-imdevimab since the publication of this statement. Please refer to Therapeutics and COVID-19: living guideline for the latest recommendations.",
          "The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomes the addition of another therapeutic to the world’s arsenal against COVID-19, but urges producing companies and governments to address the high price and limited production of the Regeneron antibody combination and ensure safe and appropriate\r\n    handling of the medicine.",
          "Given the high cost and low availability of the combination therapy, UNITAID is negotiating with Roche Pharmaceutical, which is currently manufacturing the drug for lower prices and equitable distribution across all regions, especially in low- and middle-income\r\n    countries. WHO is also in discussions with the company for a donation and distribution of the drug through UNICEF, following an allocation criteria set by WHO.",
          "In parallel, WHO has launched a call to manufacturers who may wish to submit their products for pre-qualification , which would allow for a ramping up of production and therefore greater availability of the treatment and expanded access. ACT-A partners are also working with WHO on an equitable access\r\n    framework for recommended COVID-19 therapeutics.",
          "WHO also calls for the sharing of technology to allow for the manufacturing of biosimilar versions so all patients who may need this treatment have access to it.",
          "In addition, there are feasibility challenges linked to the antibodies, such as in intravenous administration; based on the trials with non-severe and severe/critical patients. In the outpatient setting, this may be a challenge; and thus subcutaneous\r\n    administration may be an option at the lowest dose. Administration requires specialized clinics, and will need adequate amounts of the antibodies, as well as trained staff to ensure safe and effective administration of the drug.",
          "WHO cautions that in order not to exacerbate health inequity and limited availability of the therapy, patients who are non-severe and at higher risk for hospitalization be treated and those that are severe or critical with seronegative status (those who\r\n    have not developed natural antibodies against COVID-19 determined through accurate rapid tests) be treated; as these two patient groups are the patients that stand to benefit most from the treatment."

Sustained high-level commitment is needed if we are going to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The economic case could not be clearer. Research from the International Chamber of Commerce shows that vaccine nationalism could cost rich countries US$4.5 trillion.",

We saw significant commitments from global leaders towards the goals of the ACT-Accelerator and agreement on what needs to be done to defeat the pandemic. In the next month, we must see concrete progress towards the fulfilment of these ambitious goals.",
          "“Right now, 1.5 billion doses of vaccine are being produced every month, but most of the world doesn’t have access to any of them. Sick people need oxygen now. Doctors and nurses need PPE. Without widespread testing we risk being blindsided by the next variant. Manufacturers need to deliver their promised doses to COVAX and AVAT. Rich countries need to honour their promises to global access and make space at the front of the queue. All countries need to step up, because we cannot afford to go through the full Greek alphabet of variants .”",
          "The ACT-Accelerator is the only integrated, end-to-end solution to the pandemic everywhere. The partnership is committed to making sure that the targets agreed become a reality. In order to achieve this, the global response - estimated at $50bn by the IMF - needs to be fully funded. Compared to the trillions spent by G20 countries mitigating the consequences of the pandemic, and the trillions more that will be spent if it continues, that is an unbeatable return on investment."

        "content": [
          "New WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs) provide clear evidence of the damage air pollution inflicts on human health, at even lower concentrations than previously understood. The guidelines recommend new air quality levels to protect the health of populations, by reducing levels of key air pollutants, some of which also contribute to climate change.",
          "Since WHO’s last 2005 global update, there has been a marked increase of evidence that shows how air pollution affects different aspects of health. For that reason, and after a systematic review of the accumulated evidence, WHO has adjusted almost all the AQGs levels downwards, warning that   exceeding the new air quality guideline levels is associated with significant risks to health. At the same time, however, adhering to them could save millions of lives.",
          "Every year, exposure to air pollution is estimated to cause 7 million premature deaths and result in the loss of millions more healthy years of life. In children, this could include reduced lung growth and function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma. In adults, ischaemic heart disease and stroke are the most common causes of premature death attributable to outdoor air pollution, and evidence is also emerging of other effects such as diabetes and neurodegenerative conditions. This puts the burden of disease attributable to air pollution on a par with other major global health risks such as unhealthy diet and tobacco smoking.",
          "Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental threats to human health, alongside climate change. Improving air quality can enhance climate change mitigation efforts, while reducing emissions will in turn improve air quality. By striving to achieve these guideline levels, countries will be both protecting health as well as mitigating global climate change.",
          "WHO’s new guidelines recommend air quality levels for 6 pollutants, where evidence has advanced the most on health effects from exposure. When action is taken on these so-called classical pollutants – particulate matter (PM), ozone (O₃), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and carbon monoxide (CO), it also has an impact on other damaging pollutants.",
          "The health risks associated with particulate matter equal or smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns (µm) in diameter (PM₁₀ and PM₂ . ₅, respectively) are of particular public health relevance. Both PM₂ . ₅ and PM₁₀ are capable of penetrating deep into the lungs but PM₂ . ₅ can even enter the bloodstream, primarily resulting in cardiovascular and respiratory impacts, and also affecting other organs. PM is primarily generated by fuel combustion in different sectors, including transport, energy, households, industry, and from agriculture. In 2013, outdoor air pollution and particulate matter were classified as carcinogenic by WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).",
          "The guidelines also highlight good practices for the management of certain types of particulate matter (for example, black carbon/elemental carbon, ultrafine particles, particles originating from sand and dust storms) for which there is currently insufficient quantitative evidence to set air quality guideline levels. They are applicable to both outdoor and indoor environments globally, and cover all settings.",
          "“Air pollution is a threat to health in all countries, but it hits people in low- and middle-income countries the hardest,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “WHO’s new Air Quality Guidelines are an evidence-based and practical tool for improving the quality of the air on which all life depends. I urge all countries and all those fighting to protect our environment to put them to use to reduce suffering and save lives.”"

          "Disparities in air pollution exposure are increasing worldwide, particularly as low- and middle-income countries are experiencing growing levels of air pollution because of large-scale urbanization and economic development that has largely relied on the burning of fossil fuels.",
          "“Annually, WHO estimates that millions of deaths are caused by the effects of air pollution, mainly from noncommunicable diseases. Clean air should be a fundamental human right and a necessary condition for healthy and productive societies. However, despite some improvements in air quality over the past three decades, millions of people continue to die prematurely, often affecting the most vulnerable and marginalized populations,” said WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge. “We know the magnitude of the problem and we know how to solve it. These updated guidelines give policy-makers solid evidence and the necessary tool to tackle this long-term health burden.”",
          "Global assessments of ambient air pollution alone suggest hundreds of millions of healthy life years of life lost, with the greatest attributable disease burden seen in low and middle-income countries. The more exposed to air pollution they are, the greater the health impact, particularly on individuals with chronic conditions (such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart disease), as well as older people, children and pregnant women.",
          "In 2019, more than 90% of the global population lived in areas where concentrations exceeded the 2005 WHO air quality guideline for long term exposure to PM₂ . ₅. Countries with strong policy-driven improvements in air quality have often seen marked reduction in air pollution, whereas declines over the past 30 years were less noticeable in regions with already good air quality."

          "The goal of the guideline is for all countries to achieve recommended air quality levels. Conscious that this will be a difficult task for many countries and regions struggling with high air pollution levels, WHO has proposed interim targets to facilitate stepwise improvement in air quality and thus gradual, but meaningful, health benefits for the population.",
          "Almost 80% of deaths related to PM₂ . ₅ could be avoided in the world if the current air pollution levels were reduced to those proposed in the updated guideline, according to a rapid scenario analysis performed by WHO. At the same time, the achievement of interim targets would result in reducing the burden of disease, of which the greatest benefit would be observed in countries with high concentrations of fine particulates (PM₂ . ₅) and large populations."

Their development has adhered to a rigorously defined methodology, implemented by a guideline development group. It was based on evidence obtained from six systematic reviews that considered more than 500 papers. The development of these global AQGs was overseen by a steering group led by the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health."

Our visit allowed us to witness the immediate needs of the Afghan people firsthand and meet with stakeholders to define ways to urgently scale up our health response.",

Many of these facilities have now reduced operations or shut down, forcing health providers to make hard decisions on who to save and who to let die.",
          "Only 17% of all Sehatmandi health facilities are now fully functional. This breakdown in health services is having a rippling effect on the availability of basic and essential health care, as well as on emergency response, polio eradication, and COVID-19 vaccination efforts.",

Prior to August this year, 2.2 million people had been vaccinated against COVID-19.  In recent weeks, vaccination rates have decreased rapidly while 1.8 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in country remain unused. Swift action is needed to use these doses in the coming weeks and work towards reaching the goal of vaccinating at least 20% of the population by the end of the year based on national targets.",
          "Afghanistan is one of two countries in the world where polio remains endemic. With only one case of wild poliovirus reported so far this year, compared to 56 in 2020, there has never been a better time to eradicate polio. However, the polio programme will struggle to respond if the basic immunization infrastructure begins to collapse around it. Measles outbreaks are also spreading. With access to all communities no longer impeded, WHO and partners are ready to begin a country-wide house-to-house polio vaccination campaign and include measles and COVID vaccination in an integrated campaign.",
          "WHO particularly emphasizes the need for women to maintain access to education, health care, and to the health workforce. With fewer health facilities operational and less female health workers reporting to work, female patients are hesitant to seek care. We are committed to working with partners to invest in the health education of girls and women, as well as continue training female health workers.",

              "WHO’s targets are to vaccinate at least 10% of the population of every country by September, at least 40% by the end of the year, and 70% globally by the middle of next year. These are the critical milestones we must reach together to end\r\n        the pandemic.",
              "Almost 90% of high-income countries have now reached the 10% target, and more than 70% have reached the 40% target. Not a single low-income country has reached either target.",
              "Globally, 5.5 billion vaccine doses have been administered, but 80% have been administered in high- and upper-middle income countries.",
              "High-income countries have now administered almost 100 doses for every 100 people. Meanwhile, low-income countries have only been able to administer 1.5 doses for every 100 people, due to lack of supply.",
              "The world should spare no effort to increase vaccine supply for lower-income countries: this can be done by removing all the barriers to scaling up manufacturing including waiving IP, freeing up supply chains and technology transfer. As\r\n        part of these efforts, in June, WHO and COVAX partners announced the first COVID mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub, to be set up in South Africa.",
              "High-income countries have promised to donate more than 1 billion doses, but less than 15% of those doses have materialised and manufacturers have promised to prioritize COVAX and low-income countries.",
              "The supply through COVAX and other sources will increase substantially in the coming months of this year. Countries need to prepare for this ramp up of available doses, for example with microplanning, expanded cold chain equipment, logistics, funding,\r\n        and trained staff in place.",
              "COVAX has shipped more than 236.6 million doses to 139 participants as of 6 th September 2021. Some 41 participants started their first campaigns thanks to COVAX.",
              "Safe and effective vaccines alone cannot solve the pandemic: Robust surveillance supported by rapid diagnostics, early clinical care and life- saving therapeutics, provided by well-trained health workers who are able to work in safe conditions. Public\r\n        health and social measures are also vital to end the pandemic and accelerate global recovery."

          "Kathmandu - The Member countries of WHO South-East Asia Region resolved to work towards making ‘every school a health promoting school’, while also committing to safe school operations during the pandemic. “Schools have an important role in promoting healthy lifestyles, life-long healthy behaviors and to nurture human capital for sustainable development of any society. We need a whole-of-government approach to ensure children from all socio-economic background, including those with special needs, benefit from healthy schools,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region at the Regional Committee meeting. Adopting a resolution at the Regional Committee meeting to revitalize school health and health promoting schools, Member countries expressed concern over school closure during the ongoing pandemic, its impact on learning, growth and health of young children and adolescents. Member countries also deliberated on the need to ensure safe reopening and operationalization of schools during the ongoing pandemic. At the five-day meeting 6 – 10 September, the Member countries agreed to develop an integrated Regional Action Plan on viral hepatitis, HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, aligned with WHO’s global and 2030 SDGs targets. Other highlights of the Regional Committee meeting included a declaration signed by Member countries, at a ministerial round table, to take lessons from the pandemic and strengthen health system resilience to ensure health security and achieve universal health coverage and Sustainable Development Goals for health. Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee addressed the ministerial round table, emphasizing on the need to ensure quality of health care services. WHO and Member countries of South-East Asia Region discussed further strengthening of health emergency security systems to be better prepared for future health emergencies. The meeting also discussed enhancing routine immunization coverage along with continuing efforts to rapidly increase COVID-19 vaccination coverage. Accelerating efforts to prevent and control the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, action being taken for measles and rubella elimination and progress on universal health coverage, were some of the other Regional flagship priorities deliberated upon at the meeting. The annual governing body meeting, hosted by Nepal this year, was held virtually for the second consecutive year due to the pandemic.

          "Twelve months ago, the world came together to support COVAX, a multilateral initiative aimed at guaranteeing global access to life-saving COVID-19 vaccines.",
          "With the support of the international community, COVAX immediately began securing financing, entering into negotiations with vaccine developers and manufacturers and addressing the host of technical and operational challenges associated with rolling out the largest and most complex vaccination programme in history.",
          "COVAX has already achieved significant progress: more than US$10 billion has been raised; legally-binding commitments for up to 4.5 billion doses of vaccine; 240 million doses have been delivered to 139 countries in just six months.",
          "Yet the global picture of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable. Only 20% of people in low- and lower-middle-income countries have received a first dose of vaccine compared to 80% in high- and upper-middle income countries.",
          "In the critical months during which COVAX was created, signed on participants, pooled demand, and raised enough money to make advance purchases of vaccines, much of the early global supply had already been bought by wealthy nations. Today, COVAX’s ability to protect the most vulnerable people in the world continues to be hampered by export bans, the prioritisation of bilateral deals by manufacturers and countries, ongoing challenges in scaling up production by some key producers, and delays in filing for regulatory approval.",
          "According to its latest Supply Forecast , COVAX expects to have access to 1.425 billion doses of vaccine in 2021, in the most likely scenario and in the absence of urgent action by producers and high-coverage countries to prioritize COVAX. Of these doses, approximately 1.2 billion will be available for the lower income economies participating in the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC). This is enough to protect 20% of the population, or 40% of all adults, in all 92 AMC economies with the exception of India. Over 200 million doses will be allocated to self-financing participants. The key COVAX milestone of two billion doses released for delivery is now expected to be reached in the first quarter of 2022.",

              "Expand, accelerate, and systematize dose donations from countries that are already well advanced in their vaccination programmes. This includes ensuring doses are available in larger and more predictable volumes, with longer shelf lives – reducing the burden on countries trying to prepare for deliveries."

It is the only global initiative that is working\r\n    with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.",
          "CEPI’s role in COVAX",
          "CEPI is leading on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio , investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support\r\n    development of three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility\r\n    to a number of candidates, and made strategic investments in vaccine manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine. CEPI\r\n    is also investing in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.",
          "Gavi’s role in COVAX",
          "Gavi leads on procurement and delivery at scale for COVAX: designing and managing the COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX AMC and working with its traditional Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery. As part of this role, Gavi hosts the Office of the\r\n    COVAX Facility to coordinate the operation and governance of the mechanism as a whole, holds financial and legal relationships with 193 Facility participants, and manages the COVAX Facility deals portfolio : negotiating advance purchase agreements with manufacturers of promising vaccine candidates to secure doses on behalf of all COVAX Facility participants.\r\n    Gavi also coordinates design, operationalisation and fundraising for the Gavi COVAX AMC, the mechanism that provides access to donor-funded doses of vaccine to 92 lower-income economies. As part of this work, Gavi provides funding and oversight for\r\n    UNICEF procurement and delivery of vaccines to all AMC participants – operationalising the advance purchase agreements between Gavi and manufacturers – as well as support for partners’ and governments work on readiness and delivery.\r\n    This includes tailored support to governments, UNICEF, WHO and other partners for cold chain equipment, technical assistance, syringes, vehicles, and other aspects of the vastly complex logistical operation for delivery. Gavi also co-designed, raises\r\n    funds for and supports the operationalisation of the AMC’s no fault compensation mechanism as well as the COVAX Humanitarian Buffer .",
          "WHO’s role in COVAX",
          "WHO has multiple roles within COVAX : It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery. Its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts ( SAGE ) on Immunization develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations. Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL) / prequalification\r\n    programmes ensure harmonized review and authorization across member states. It provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D\r\n    technical coordination. WHO leads, together with UNICEF, the Country Readiness and Delivery workstream , which provides support to countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines. Along with Gavi and numerous other partners working at the global, regional, and country-level,\r\n    the CRD workstream provides tools, guidance, monitoring, and on the ground technical assistance for the planning and roll-out of the vaccines . Along with COVAX partners, WHO has developed a no-fault compensation scheme as\r\n part of the time-limited indemnification and liability commitments",
          "UNICEF’s role in COVAX",
          "UNICEF is leveraging its experience as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world and working with manufacturers and partners on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as freight, logistics and storage. UNICEF already procures more than\r\n    2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. In collaboration with the PAHO Revolving Fund ,\r\n UNICEF is leading efforts to procure and supply doses of COVID-19\r\n    vaccines for COVAX. In addition, UNICEF, Gavi and WHO are working with governments around the clock to ensure that countries are ready to receive the vaccines, with appropriate cold chain equipment in place and health workers trained to dispense them.\r\n    UNICEF is also playing a lead role in efforts to foster trust in vaccines, delivering vaccine confidence communications and tracking and addressing misinformation around the world.",
          "About ACT-Accelerator",
          "The Access to COVID-19 Tools ACT-Accelerator, is a new, ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. It was set up in response to a call from G20 leaders\r\n    in March and launched by the WHO, European Commission, France and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in April 2020.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator is not a decision-making body or a new organisation, but works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organisations to end the pandemic. It is a framework for collaboration that has been designed to bring key players around\r\n    the table with the goal of ending the pandemic as quickly as possible through the accelerated development, equitable allocation, and scaled up delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines, thereby protecting health systems and restoring societies and\r\n    economies in the near term. It draws on the experience of leading global health organisations which are tackling the world’s toughest health challenges, and who, by working together, are able to unlock new and more ambitious results against\r\n    COVID-19. Its members share a commitment to ensure all people have access to all the tools needed to defeat COVID-19 and to work with unprecedented levels of partnership to achieve it.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator has four areas of work: diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines and the health system connector. Cross-cutting all of these is the workstream on Access & Allocation."

          "Drawing on a recent WHO global review of National Deployment and Vaccination Plans (NDVPs) and experience from their implementation and the vaccine rollout worldwide plus literature reviews and existing WHO guidance and tools, on 31 August 2021 WHO published the Interim Guidance ‘ COVID-19 immunization in refugees and migrants: principles and key considerations ’ . The document provides information on key challenges and barriers to accessing vaccination services, such as stigma, exclusion and mistrust, resulting in low vaccine uptake and hesitancy; lack of financial means and information; fears regarding cost, safety and deportation or detention.",
          "From February to March 2021, WHO conducted a review of 104 NDVPs submitted to the COVAX Facility. The results indicate that 72% of these NDVPs did not explicitly include migrants and  53% of these NDVPs that have more than 500 refugees, explicitly included refugees and asylum seekers. Only 17% of 104 NDVPs explicitly included migrants in irregular situations.",
          "Significant positive development has been observed after the NDVPs review. Refugees and asylum seekers have begun to receive vaccinations in 101 of the 162 countries that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been monitoring.  However, coverage for migrants are far from universal, several countries reported the inclusion of regular migrants in their NDVPs and the vaccine roll out but migrants in irregular situations in many countries were not.",
          "The interim guidance presents good practices and highlights principles and key considerations derived from rights and policy and practices to ensure that refugees and migrants have equitable access to COVID-19 vaccination rollout and that barriers preventing them from accessing services are properly addressed. Principles and considerations include ensuring universal and equal access to the COVID-19 vaccine for refugees and migrants regardless of migration status, with access the same as for nationals; addressing barriers that prevent refugees and migrants from accessing COVID-19 vaccination services and international travel; promoting vaccine uptake and addressing vaccine hesitancy; engaging communities in COVID-19 vaccination planning and implementation and enhancing effective communication to build trust and counter misinformation; developing innovative approaches and vaccination strategies for refugees and migrants living in hard-to-reach areas.",
          "The document, which was developed by the WHO Health and Migration Programme in collaboration with the Departments of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals and Health Emergency Interventions and partners, targets national authorities, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, health cluster teams, WHO country offices and United Nations country teams that are responsible for managing and supporting deployment, implementation and monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines in refugees and migrants; and partners who provide support.",

Half of these countries are in WHO’s European Region, with the remainder split between the other Regions. Yet even in Europe, many plans are expiring or have already expired, indicating a need for renewed commitment from governments.",
          "At the same time, the number of people living with dementia is growing according to the report: WHO estimates that more than 55 million people (8.1 % of women and 5.4% of men over 65 years) are living with dementia. This number is estimated to rise to\r\n    78 million by 2030 and to 139 million by 2050.",
          "Dementia is caused by a variety of diseases and injuries that affect the brain, such as Alzheimer’s disease or stroke. It affects memory and other cognitive functions, as well as the ability to perform everyday tasks. The disability associated with\r\n    dementia is a key driver of costs related to the condition. In 2019, the global cost of dementia was estimated to be US$ 1.3 trillion. The cost is projected to increase to US$ 1.7 trillion by 2030, or US$ 2.8 trillion if corrected for increases in\r\n    care costs.",
          "“Dementia robs millions of people of their memories, independence and dignity, but it also robs the rest of us of the people we know and love,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “The\r\n    world is failing people with dementia, and that hurts all of us. Four years ago, governments agreed a clear set of targets to improve dementia care. But targets alone are not enough. We need concerted action to ensure that all people with dementia\r\n    are able to live with the support and dignity they deserve.”"

          "Care required for people with dementia includes primary health care, specialist care, community-based services, rehabilitation, long-term care, and palliative care. While most countries (89%) reporting to WHO’s Global Dementia Observatory say they\r\n    provide some community-based services for dementia, provision is higher in high-income countries than in low- and middle-income countries. Medication for dementia, hygiene products, assistive technologies and household adjustments are also more\r\n    accessible in high-income countries, with a greater level of reimbursement, than in lower-income countries.",
          "The type and level of services provided by the health and social care sectors also determines the level of informal care, which is primarily provided by family members. Informal care accounts for about half the global cost of dementia, while social care\r\n    costs make up over a third. In low- and middle-income countries, most dementia care costs are attributable to informal care (65%). In richer countries informal and social care costs each amount to approximately 40%.",
          "In 2019, carers spent on average five hours a day providing support for daily living to the person they were caring for with dementia; 70% of that care was provided by women. Given the financial, social and psychological stress faced by carers, access\r\n    to information, training and services, as well as social and financial support, is particularly important. Currently, 75% of countries report that they offer some level of support for carers, although again, these are primarily high-income countries."

The latter increased its annual investment in Alzheimer’s disease research from US$ 631 million in 2015 to an estimated US$ 2.8 billion in\r\n    2020.",

          "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for innovative health technologies that can help countries improve health outcomes by providing shortcuts to solutions despite lack of infrastructure and resources. However, many of the new technologies that have come to market are unaffordable or unsuitable for low- and middle-income countries.",
          "To ensure that all countries benefit from health innovation, WHO has compiled a compendium of 24 new technologies that can be used in low-resource settings.",
          "“Innovative technologies are accelerating access to healthcare everywhere, but we must ensure that they are readily available in all health facilities, fairly priced and quality-assured,” said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant Director General for Access to Health Products. “WHO will continue to work with governments, funders and manufacturers to promote sustainable supplies of these tools during and beyond the COVID emergency.”",
          "The compendium’s main objective was to select and assess technologies that can have an immediate and future impact on COVID-19 preparedness and response, potentially improve health outcomes and quality of life, and/or offer a solution to an unmet medical need. 15 of these technologies are already commercially available in countries, while the rest are still at the prototype stage.",
          "The compendium includes simple items ranging from a colourized bleach additive, which allows the naked eye to identify non-sterilized surfaces and objects, to  more complex though easy-to-use equipment such as a  portable respiratory monitoring system and  ventilators with an extended battery that can be used where electricity is not available or unstable. The list also includes a deployable health facility for emergencies decked out in a shipping container.",
          "Some of these technologies are already in use and have proven their value through pilot programmes. For example, the solar powered oxygen concentrator has been highly effective in treating pneumonia, which kills 900,000 children a year, in a regional children’s hospital in Somalia’s Galmudug state.",
          "Studies have demonstrated that reliable access to oxygen can reduce child deaths due to pneumonia by 35%. Given the shortage of oxygen in numerous countries, the concentrator is a critical tool in the treatment of hospitalized COVID patients.",
          "WHO has been assessing innovative technologies for the last 10 years, some of the selected products are now addressing priority health problems in low-resource settings. A critical example is a smartphone application that allows the user to instantly record accurate blood pressure measurements. According to a report released by WHO last week, the number of adults aged 30–79 years with hypertension has increased from 650 million to 1.28 billion in the last thirty years and almost half these people do not know they have hypertension.",
          "Smartphones are widely available, even in the most remote areas or low-resource settings. The software-based platform transforms existing smartphones into a medical device capable of measuring blood pressure accurately, with no need to add any other devices or accessories. The other advantage of the app is that even in the absence of a trained health worker, patients can self-test and better manage their blood pressure.",
          "The compendium provides a full assessment of the technologies, carried out by a group of international experts working with WHO technical teams, on the basis of: compliance with WHO specifications regarding performance, quality and safety; suitability in low-resource settings; affordability; ease of use; and regulatory approval status.  This information is vital to help governments, non-governmental organizations and funders decide which products to procure.",
          "Conclusions on the suitability of each technology is communicated through a simple traffic light scoring system, indicating whether the product is recommended (for use without any known limitations); recommended with caution (limitations may have been identified related to maintenance and need for trained staff); or not recommended (inappropriate, unsafe or unaffordable)."

          "The twenty-ninth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO Director-General on 4 August 2021 with committee members and advisers attending via video conference, supported by the WHO Secretariat.  The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV).  The following IHR States Parties provided an update at the video conference on the current situation in their respective countries: Afghanistan, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Madagascar, Nigeria, Pakistan and Uganda. Wild poliovirus WPV1 transmission continues to fall, with no new case since January 2021 when two WPV1 cases occurred, one each from Pakistan and Afghanistan, compared to 94 WPV1 cases during the same time period in 2020. Similarly from environmental surveillance, the overall proportion of specimens that are positive has reduced from almost 60% in 2020 to less than 15% in 2021 to date with no detection in Afghanistan since 23 February and only ten isolates in Pakistan since 31 March. The most recent detections in 2021 in Afghanistan were both the result of importation from Pakistan. While the Committee noted the commendable progress being made, there is no room for complacency. The Committee recognised significant ongoing challenges and threats to front line workers, including deaths of immunisation staff in Afghanistan and of supporting police officials in Pakistan.  Although surveillance is functioning well in most areas of the two endemic countries, recent isolation of long chain or orphan viruses in both countries indicates a possibility of missed transmission in the hard to reach and high-risk population groups.  The ongoing inaccessibility in many provinces of Afghanistan coupled with increasing military conflict remains a major risk.  Around three million children were persistently missed in 2020 and 2021 so far, with around one million children in Southern Afghanistan missing out on vaccination for almost three years. Hence, the cohort of missed children continues to grow.  Progress in conducting mosque based campaigns in non government controlled areas signals a hopeful path to addressing this gap. There has been inconsistent vaccination campaign quality in critical areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, including Karachi, Quetta Block and the Southern Region of Afghanistan.  The potential effects of COVID-19 including new variants in Afghanistan and Pakistan may cause interruption of polio eradication activities; mitigating this risk is the potential effect of lockdowns, travel restrictions and border closures on transmission rates of many infections including polio. Circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) The number of cases of cVDPV2 in 2021 so far is 170 compared to the total cases in 2020 of 1069. However, there have been no new emergences detected so far in 2021. In Afghanistan in 2021, all cVDPV2 cases occurred in inaccessible areas.  The total number of lineages detected in 2021 is 15 so far, compared to 36 in 2020, and 44 in 2019. This reduction may reflect refinement and modification of cVDPV2 outbreak management to lessen the risk of seeding new emergences. Both the newly infected countries since the last meeting (Gambia and Uganda) have resulted from international spread. Based on analysis of isolates by genomic analysis, in the three months from January to March 2021, there have been eight episodes of international spread of cVDPV2. China has reported an outbreak of cVDPV3 due to local emergence, bringing the total number of infected countries to 31. The roll-out of novel OPV2 vaccine continues with seven countries having now implemented vaccination response rounds.  Four additional countries are verified as ready to use it while another seven countries are close to being verified. Despite the ongoing decline in the number of cVDPV2 cases and the number of lineages circulating, the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 remains high as evidenced by recent infections in Gambia and Uganda following importation from a neighboring country. Experience in Egypt and Iran has demonstrated that countries with high RI and IPV coverage are also at risk of established cVDPV2 transmission, following importation. Conclusion Although heartened by the apparent progress, the Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months.  The Committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy duration of the polio PHEIC, but concludes that the current situation remains risky, with clear ongoing risk of international spread and ongoing need for coordinated international responses. The Committee also recognised that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on polio surveillance and on immunisation activities, as will the gradual withdrawal of polio funds from some of the affected countries. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion: Rising risk of WPV1 international spread: Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of WPV1 appears to continue: the actual exportation from Pakistan into Afghanistan in the first quarter of 2021, despite border vaccination well re-established after the 2020 pause; the ongoing inaccessibility in many provinces of Afghanistan leading increasingly to highly susceptible populations which might lead to higher transmission; over three million children were missed in the October and November NIDs, and the cohort of missed children continues to grow quickly; increasing civil war in Afghanistan with population movement increasing, including into Pakistan; ongoing vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan fueled by continued misinformation on social media regarding COVID-19 vaccines leading to higher numbers of missed children particularly in high risk districts. Rising risk of cVDPV2 international spread : Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 appears to remain high: the actual eight documented instances of cross border spread and two newly infected countries; the ever widening gap in population intestinal mucosal immunit y in young children since the withdrawal of OPV2 in 2016; the same factors regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as mentioned above; the population of inaccessible children in Afghanistan that appears to be driving transmission there. Other factors include Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies including COVID-19, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger, and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods. Risk categories The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows: States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3. States infected with cVDPV2, with or without evidence of local transmission: States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV. Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV: Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer. Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps. Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report. TEMPORARY RECOMMENDATIONS States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread WPV1 Afghanistan                       (most recent detection 23 Feb 2021) Pakistan                            (most recent detection 6 July 2021) cVDPV1 Madagascar                       (most recent detection 11 Jun 2021) Yemen                                (most recent detection 27 March 2021) cVDPV3 China                                  (most recent detection 25 Jan 2021) These countries should: Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required. Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. > four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel. Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers. Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination. Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea). Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border. Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication. Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected. Provide to the Director-General a regular report on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel. States infected with cVDPV2, with or without evidence of local transmission: Afghanistan              (most recent detection 9 Jul 2021) Benin                        (most recent detection 2 Apr 2021) Burkina Faso            (most recent detection 9 Jun 2021) Cameroon                 (most recent detection 29 Sept 2020) CAR                          (most recent detection 2 Oct 2020) Chad                         (most recent detection 25 Nov 2020) Rep Congo                (most recent detection 14 Apr 2021) DR Congo                 (most recent detection 30 Apr 2021) Côte d’Ivoire              (most recent detection 9 Oct 2020) Egypt                         (most recent detection 8 Jun 2021) Ethiopia                     (most recent detection 29 Apr 2021) Gambia                     (most recent detection 9 Jun 2021) Ghana                       (most recent detection 17 Sept 2020) Guinea                      (most recent detection 1 Apr 2021) Iran                           (most recent detection 20 Feb 2021) (Islamic Republic of) Kenya                      (most recent detection 25 Feb 2021) Liberia                     (most recent detection 28 Jun 2021) Mali                         (most recent detection 23 Dec 2020) Niger                       (most recent detection 8 Dec 2020) Nigeria                    (most recent detection 29 June 2021) Pakistan                 (most recent detection 18 May 2021) Senegal                 (most recent detection 14 Jun 2021) Sierra Leone          (most recent detection 1 Jun 2021 Somalia                 (most recent detection 23 May 2021) South Sudan         (most recent detection 10 Apr 2021) Sudan                   (most recent detection 3 Dec 2020) Tajikistan               (most recent detection 26 Jun 2021) Togo                      (most recent detection 9 Jul 2020) Uganda                 (most recent detection 1 Jun 2021) States that have had an importation of cVDPV2 but without evidence of local transmission should: Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the prevention or interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency Undertake urgent and intensive investigations to determine if there has been local transmission of the imported cVDPV2 Noting the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections, consider requesting vaccines from the global mOPV2 stockpile based on the recommendations of the Advisory Group on mOPV2. Further intensify efforts to increase IPV immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data. Intensify national and international surveillance regional cooperation and cross­border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus. States with local transmission of cVDPV2, with risk of international spread should i n addition to the above measures should: Encourage residents and long­term visitors to receive a dose of IPV four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel. Ensure that travelers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status. Intensify regional cooperation and cross­border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus, and vaccinate refugees, travelers and cross­border populations, according to the advice of the Advisory Group. For both sub-categories: Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without the detection of circulation of VDPV2 in the country from any source, and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the criteria of a ‘state no longer infected’. At the end of 12 months without evidence of transmission, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations. States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV WPV1 none                          (most recent detection 6 Aug 2020) cVDPV Myanmar                   (most recent cVDPV1 detection 9 August 2019) Zambia                      (most recent cVDPV2 detection 25 November 2019) Philippines                 (most recent detection 16 January 2020) Angola                       (most recent detection 9 February 2020) Malaysia                    (most recent detection 13 March 2020) These countries should: Urgently strengthen routine immunization to boost population immunity. Enhance surveillance quality, including considering introducing supplementary methods such as environmental surveillance, to reduce the risk of undetected WPV1 and cVDPV transmission, particularly among high risk mobile and vulnerable populations. Intensify efforts to ensure vaccination of mobile and cross­border populations, Internally Displaced Persons, refugees and other vulnerable groups. Enhance regional cooperation and cross border coordination to ensure prompt detection of WPV1 and cVDPV, and vaccination of high risk population groups. Maintain these measures with documentation of full application of high quality surveillance and vaccination activities. At the end of 12 months without evidence of reintroduction of WPV1 or new emergence and circulation of cVDPV, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations. Additional considerations The Committee welcomed the substantial progress that has been made but warned that the situation in Afghanistan risked a rapid reversal of progress.  The Committee urged the polio programme to continue to discuss with all parties involved to ensure every missed child in inaccessible areas be quickly brought up to date with vaccines to avoid a sudden surge in cases, particularly as the high season commences. The Committee also urged donors and partners to continue their support, noting the beneficial use of polio assets during the pandemic and that a critical juncture had been reached:  decreasing funding by governments, partly as a result of the pandemic, risked all the hard won gains being lost. The Committee also welcomed the roll-out of novel OPV2 but was concerned to hear of delays in outbreak response, in some cases as countries preferred to wait for novel OPV2.  Polio outbreaks should continue to be met with a suitable sense of urgency, and response time generally needed to be reduced.  The Committee requested the polio programme to continue to assist countries to mount an emergency response with whichever vaccine formulation was available. The Committee also warned of the ongoing effects of COVID-19, particularly on routine immunization, and possible future disruptions of supply and delivery of vaccines.  COVID-19 is likely to continue to have negative effects on all health programs and systems for some time to come, so the polio programme must continue to adjust its response on an ongoing basis to get over the remaining hurdles. Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 10 August 2021 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 10 August 2021."

The Committee also urged donors and partners to continue their support, noting the beneficial use of polio assets during the pandemic and that a critical juncture had been reached:  decreasing funding by governments, partly as a result of the pandemic, risked all the hard won gains being lost.",
          "The Committee also welcomed the roll-out of novel OPV2 but was concerned to hear of delays in outbreak response, in some cases as countries preferred to wait for novel OPV2.  Polio outbreaks should continue to be met with a suitable sense of urgency, and response time generally needed to be reduced.  The Committee requested the polio programme to continue to assist countries to mount an emergency response with whichever vaccine formulation was available.",
          "The Committee also warned of the ongoing effects of COVID-19, particularly on routine immunization, and possible future disruptions of supply and delivery of vaccines.  COVID-19 is likely to continue to have negative effects on all health programs and systems for some time to come, so the polio programme must continue to adjust its response on an ongoing basis to get over the remaining hurdles.",

          "At the start of 2021, half the population of Afghanistan – including more than 4 million women and nearly 10 million children – already needed humanitarian assistance. One third of the population was facing crisis and emergency levels of acute food insecurity and more than half of all children under 5 years of age were malnourished.",
          "Those needs have risen sharply because of conflict, drought and COVID-19. Since the end of May, the number of people internally displaced because of conflict and in need of immediate humanitarian aid more than doubled, reaching 550,000.",
          "We echo the UN Secretary-General’s call for all parties (including the Taliban) to cease all violence and comply with international humanitarian law and human rights. They must allow and facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded access for humanitarian workers – both male and female staff – so they can deliver aid to civilians in need wherever they are.",
          "The humanitarian operation will also depend on funding, movement within, to and from Afghanistan, and access to health facilities. The critical role of front-line humanitarian organizations must be supported.",
          "All parties must protect civilians and respect the rights and freedoms of all. Today we reiterate our commitment to promoting the rights of everyone in Afghanistan, including women and girls. Important gains made in recent years – including on gender equality and girls’ access to a quality education – must be preserved. And much more needs to be done to realize the rights of women and girls. We will continue to engage to make sure this happens. Civilians must also be allowed to seek safety and protection, including the right to seek asylum.",
          "We call on Governments to keep borders open to receive Afghan refugees fleeing from violence and persecution and refrain from deportations. This is not the time to abandon the Afghan people. Member States must provide all possible support to Afghan nationals at risk, including a moratorium on repatriations. We urge neighbouring countries to ensure the protection of Afghans displaced across their borders.",
          "We call on donors to remain steadfast in their support for humanitarian operations in Afghanistan and to support resilient livelihoods. The humanitarian community reached almost 8 million people in the first half of 2021 with aid. Timely funding saves lives, protects livelihoods, eases suffering and prevents further displacement. A total of US$1.3 billion is required to reach almost 16 million people with humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan; only 37 per cent of required funds have been received, leaving a shortfall of almost $800 million.",
          "The international community has spent decades working with the people of Afghanistan to make progress. Now the international community must continue to support the people of Afghanistan if those gains are not to be reversed. Humanitarian funding must be sustained.",
          "Now, as always, we remain committed to the people of Afghanistan and will do everything possible to stay and provide assistance, especially to the most vulnerable.",

          "Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO has been working with Member States and the scientific community to better understand how this pandemic began so that we can be better prepared for the next one.",
          "Following the publication of the WHO-China joint report of the phase one studies on the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in March 2021, WHO has outlined the next series of studies that need to be undertaken and continues to be in discussions with Member\r\n    States and experts on next steps.",
          "To move forward, WHO calls for all governments to depoliticize the situation and cooperate to accelerate the origins studies, and importantly to work together to develop a common framework for future emerging pathogens of pandemic potential.",
          "WHO’s priority is for scientists to build on the first phase of studies, implement the recommendations outlined in the March 2021 report and accelerate scientific efforts on all hypotheses. Searching for the origins of any novel pathogen is a difficult\r\n    process, which is based on science, and takes collaboration, dedication and time.",
          "WHO reiterates that the search for the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is not and should not be an exercise in attributing blame, finger-pointing or political point-scoring. It is vitally important to know how the COVID-19 pandemic began, to set an example for establishing\r\n    the origins of all future animal-human spillover events.",
          "Countries have a collective responsibility to work together in the true spirit of partnership and to ensure scientists and experts have the space they need to find the origins of the worst pandemic in a century. Building on what has already been learned,\r\n    the next series of studies would include a further examination of the raw data from the earliest cases and sera from potential early cases in 2019. Access to data is critically important for evolving our understanding of science and should not be\r\n    politicised in any way.",
          "WHO is working with a number of countries that have reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from stored biological specimens from 2019. For example, in Italy, WHO facilitated an independent evaluation by international laboratories of the findings\r\n    of one such study, which included the blind retesting of pre-pandemic blood samples. Sharing raw data and giving permission for the retesting of samples in labs outside of Italy reflects scientific solidarity at its best and is no different from what\r\n    we encourage all countries, including China, to support so that we can advance the studies of the origins quickly and effectively.",
          "The International Scientific Advisory Group for Origins of Novel Pathogens, or SAGO, is a new advisory group for WHO, which will be responsible for advising WHO on the development of a global framework to systematically study the emergence of future emerging\r\n    pathogens with pandemic potential. For SARS-CoV-2, it will support the rapid undertaking of recommended studies outlined in the March 2021 report.",
          "By issuing an open call for nominations to SAGO, WHO is providing a transparent foundation for the new scientific advisory group that we expect all Member States will engage with. WHO hopes for continuity from previous missions to China for SARS-CoV-2,\r\n    as well as other missions studying the origins of, for example, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, avian influenza, Lassa and Ebola.",
          "This open call aims to ensure that a broad range of scientific skills and expertise are identified to advise WHO on the studies needed to identify the origins of any future emerging or re-emerging pathogen of pandemic potential.",
          "China and a number of other Member States have written to WHO regarding the basis for further studies of the SARS-CoV-2 “lab hypothesis.” They have also suggested the origins study has been politicised, or that WHO has acted due to political\r\n    pressure.",
          "On review of the phase one study report, WHO determined that there was insufficient scientific evidence to rule any of the hypotheses out. Specifically, in order to address the “lab hypothesis,” it is important to have access to all data and\r\n    consider scientific best practice and look at the mechanisms WHO already has in place. WHO is only focused on science, providing solutions and building solidarity.",
          "Smallpox is the only human virus to have ever been eradicated. There are two countries in the world that keep stocks of smallpox in secure labs: Russia and the US. Inspections by the WHO biosafety team of VECTOR and CDC smallpox labs occur every two years, most recently in Jan-Feb 2019 (VECTOR) and May 2019 (CDC). A report is then provided to the World Health Assembly and the inspection reports are published on the WHO website.",
          "Analysing and improving lab safety and protocols in all laboratories around the world, including in China, is important for our collective biosafety and security.",
          "Searching for the origins of a novel virus is an immensely difficult scientific task that takes time. WHO is committed to following the science, and we call on all governments to put differences aside and work together to provide all data and access required\r\n    so that the next series of studies can be commenced as soon as possible."

        "content": [
          "WHO, with support of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and its COVID-19 Vaccines Working Group, is reviewing the emerging evidence on the need for and timing of an additional vaccine dose (booster dose 1)  for the currently available COVID-19 vaccines which have received Emergency Use Listing (EUL). SAGE is continuously reviewing the literature and has reached out to vaccine manufacturers, the research community and Member States to obtain the most complete and recent data on the issue.",
          "Rationale for booster doses",
          "There are several reasons why COVID-19 vaccine booster doses may be needed:  (i) waning protection against infection or disease, in particular severe disease, over time (i.e., waning immunity), (ii) reduced protection against variant(s) of concern (VOC), or (iii) inadequate protection from the currently recommended primary series for some risk groups for which evidence from the Phase 3 clinical trials may have been lacking.  The rationale for booster doses may differ by vaccine product, epidemiological setting, risk group, and vaccine coverage rates.",
          "Factors to consider",
          "1. Waning immunity",
          "Neither an immune correlate of protection nor an immune correlate for the duration of protection has been established to date. Studies suggest a correlation between the efficacy of different vaccines against symptomatic disease and mean neutralizing antibody titers induced by those vaccines (1) , but it is unclear if declining titers over time since vaccination are indicative of declining vaccine effectiveness, especially against VOCs. While data on immunogenicity of some vaccines suggest that antibodies persist for at least 6 months (2) , waning of neutralizing antibodies has been reported (3) .   Although there may be a loss of protection against infections by SARS-CoV-2 protection against severe disease is likely to be largely retained due to cell mediated immunity (1) .",
          "2. Vaccine effectiveness",
          "Data are currently insufficient to determine if there is a significant decline in vaccine effectiveness against any form of clinical illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond 6 months after vaccination. However, some reduction in vaccine effectiveness has been reported for some VOCs. Data from Israel suggest that around 40% of breakthrough infections are in immunocompromised individuals (4) .  While breakthrough infections are still expected, the vast majority are less severe than those seen in unvaccinated people (5) .",
          "3. Global vaccine supply and global and national equity",
          "National vaccination programme policy decisions to add a booster dose should take into account the strength of evidence regarding the need for these doses and global availability of vaccines. Offering booster doses to a large proportion of a population when many have not yet received even a first dose undermines the principle of national and global equity. Prioritizing booster doses over speed and breadth in the initial dose coverage may also damage the prospects for global mitigation of the pandemic, with severe implications for the health, social and economic well-being of people globally.",
          "Data needs for policy",
          "The introduction of booster doses should be evidence-driven. The duration of vaccine-induced protection is likely to depend on many variables, such as the vaccine product, the primary vaccination schedule, the age and/or underlying medical conditions of the vaccinee, risk of exposure, and circulation of specific variants. The decision to recommend a booster dose is complex and requires, beyond clinical and epidemiological data, a consideration of national strategic and programmatic aspects, and importantly an assessment of the prioritization of globally limited vaccine supply. In this context, prioritization should be given to the prevention of severe disease. Data needs can be grouped into the following categories:",

            ]
          },
          "Conclusions",
          "In the context of ongoing global vaccine supply constraints, administration of booster doses will exacerbate inequities by driving up demand and consuming scarce supply while priority populations in some countries, or subnational settings, have not yet received a primary vaccination series.  The focus for the time being remains on increasing global vaccination coverage with the primary series (either one or two doses for current EUL vaccines).",
          "Introducing booster doses should be firmly evidence-driven and targeted to the population groups in greatest need. The rationale for implementing booster doses should be guided by evidence on waning vaccine effectiveness, in particular a decline in protection against severe disease in the general population or in high risk populations, or due to a circulating VOC. To date, the evidence remains limited and inconclusive on any widespread need for booster doses following a primary vaccination series. WHO is carefully monitoring the situation and will continue to work closely with countries to obtain the data required for policy recommendations.",

        "content": [
          "WHO with support of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and its COVID-19 Vaccines Working Group is reviewing the emerging evidence on the use of heterologous priming schedules (also known as mix and match schedules). In a heterologous priming schedule, the second dose uses a different vaccine product than the first dose. By contrast, heterologous boosting refers to the administration of a vaccine from a different vaccine platform from the vaccine that was used to complete the primary vaccine series. The interim statement here pertains only to heterologous priming and not heterologous boosting.",
          "Rationale for Heterologous Priming",
          "The most common reason for considering a heterologous COVID-19 vaccine as second priming dose is lack of availability of the same vaccine in settings with limited vaccine supply or unpredictable supply. Interchangeability of vaccine products would therefore allow for added programmatic flexibility. There are other reasons to investigate the utility of heterologous priming such as reducing reactogenicity, increasing immunogenicity and enhancing vaccine effectiveness. Heterologous priming should only be instituted if supportive evidence is available.",
          "Current state of knowledge",
          "SAGE continuously reviews new data on heterologous priming vaccine schedules.  Guidance is available in some of the product specific interim recommendations (to date, for mRNA vaccines, i.e. BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] vaccines).",
          "In general, for COVID-19 vaccines listed for emergency use by WHO with a 2-dose primary series schedule, WHO recommends that the same vaccine product should be used for both doses. If different COVID-19 vaccine products are inadvertently administered in the two doses, no additional doses of either vaccine are recommended. At present, mix and match schedules constitute off-label use of respective vaccines and as such should only be used if benefits outweigh the risks such as in situations of interrupted vaccine supply.",
          "Studies to date of immune responses after a first dose of ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] products followed by an mRNA vaccine (i.e., BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) show higher neutralising antibody levels and higher T cell-mediated immune responses in comparison with two doses of ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] products and similar levels to those of two mRNA vaccines (1). The sequence of the first dose being ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] followed by the mRNA vaccine as second dose was more immunogenic than a first dose mRNA vaccine followed by ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] vaccine.",
          "While these studies are encouraging, they require cautious interpretation given the limited sample sizes and lack of follow up, especially related to safety data, and the uncertain relevance of immunological readouts in relation to clinical impact. The first results on short-term vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection following a heterologous schedule have become available from Denmark showing an effectiveness of 88% (95% CI 83-92%) when combining the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine, similar to the VE of two doses of an mRNA vaccine, in a population-wide register-based study when the Alpha variant was dominant (2). More observational data on safety and effectiveness will be forthcoming.",
          "While there are currently no data for heterologous priming with other vaccine products, a large number of clinical studies of various vaccine combinations and schedules are currently ongoing. SAGE will review these data as they become available and update the recommendations accordingly.",

          "WHO, with support of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and its COVID-19 Vaccines Working Group, is reviewing the role of fractionating doses as a dose-sparing strategy in light of global vaccine supply constraints. SAGE is continuously reviewing the literature and has reached out to vaccine manufacturers and the research community for available information.",
          "Evidence for fractionated doses",
          "All current COVID-19 vaccines have undergone dose-finding studies in their clinical development. The potential for dose-reduction may depend on the individual vaccine and its platform technology (e.g., mRNA, vectored or inactivated virus). Safety, immunogenicity and programmatic feasibility of fractionating doses has been shown and implemented for various, hitherto well characterized vaccines (e.g., polio, rabies, and yellow fever vaccines) (1, 2). Intradermal administration may enable reduction of dose volume, but intradermal application may also change the immunogenicity, safety and increase the reactogenicity profile of the vaccines. Scaling up intradermal administration at a global level would also have major programmatic challenges that would require substantial investments in training and logistics to address.",
          "Reducing the amount of vaccine given (e.g., 1/2, 1/3 or 1/5) could theoretically be considered with various options: fractionated doses for the priming schedule, or fractionated doses for any booster doses should booster doses prove to be needed in the future.",
          "However, policy recommendations for reducing doses should only be made after an extensive evidence review in terms of immunogenicity and safety. Emergency use listing for all COVID-19 vaccines for which SAGE has issued policy recommendations has been based on the evidence derived from Phase 3 trials using the full dose. Additional clinical studies would therefore be needed to inform policy.",
          "Vaccines for which limited evidence exists for fractionating doses",
          "For the Phase 3 trial of the ChAdOx-1 S (recombinant) vaccine one study arm received half of the currently recommended dose. An initial half dose showed a lower immune response than a full dose while a half dose followed by full dose gave similar post-second dose immune responses as two full doses.  However, immune responses were lower with two half doses, and also lower with a full dose followed by a half dose, than after two full doses.  Without a correlate of protection, the clinical significance of these findings remain uncertain.",
          "A Phase 2 trial for the mRNA-1273 vaccine compared 50 versus 100 μg: seroconversion rates were lower after the first vaccination with the 50 versus first dose 100 μg, but similarly high after two vaccinations for both doses; GMT titres were generally higher for the 100 μg versus 50 μg (4). The mRNA-1273 vaccine is currently undergoing studies using a half dose for booster doses and  data are awaited.",
          "SAGE is not aware of studies using reduced doses for either of the inactivated whole virus vaccines  Sinovac-CoronaVac and COVID-19 vaccine BIBP, the BNT162b2 vaccine, nor the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.",
          "Points for consideration",
          "To inform a possible dose reduction recommendation several questions need to be addressed: Do fractional doses result in non-inferior neutralising antibody levels, cell-mediated immunity, cross-protection against variants and duration of immune response? If fractional doses were to be used, what is the vaccine effectiveness against various clinical endpoints (deaths, severe disease, mild to moderate or, asymptomatic infections) and against different variants of concern? Are fractional doses non-inferior in certain subpopulations, in particular in persons with immune suppression, comorbidities or those with immunosenescence related to older age? How does the safety profile of fractionated doses compare to full dose schedules? There are also several programmatic considerations as currently licensed vaccine formulations may not be suitable for fractional dose administration because of the way they are currently presented or need to be administered. This may relate to small dose volumes, or for certain multi-dose vaccines, difficulties in adjusting the diluent volume, and other programmatic issues which may limit feasibility.",
          "Research",
          "SAGE encourages further research such as prospective randomised trials to assess the safety and immunologic non-inferiority of fractional versus full doses given for the priming schedule, and in particular as a single booster vaccination in primed and unprimed subjects. In addition, vaccine effectiveness and safety studies should be instituted as part of the follow-up.",
          "Conclusion",
          "While SAGE acknowledges the potential public health benefits of dose-sparing strategies to increase vaccine supply and accelerate population-level vaccination coverage, and possibly also a reduction in reactogenicity, SAGE considers there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of fractional doses. Any use of a fractional dose at this point in time constitutes an off-label use of the vaccine. SAGE encourages research in the area, with a particular emphasis on research into using fractionated doses as potential boosters and fractional doses in children and adolescents.  Programmatic and operational considerations should be considered from the start.",

          "The Task Force on COVID-19 Vaccines, Therapeutics and Diagnostics for Developing Countries, established by the heads of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank Group, World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization to identify and resolve finance and trade impediments to vaccine, diagnostics, therapeutic production and deliveries, has issued the following joint statement:",
          "“We reiterate the urgency of providing access to COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments to people throughout the developing world. In the area of vaccines, a key constraint is the acute and alarming shortage in the supply of doses to low and low-middle income countries, especially for the rest of 2021. We call on countries with advanced COVID-19 vaccination programs to release as soon as possible as much of their contracted vaccine doses and options as possible to COVAX, AVAT, and low and low-middle i ncome countries.",
          "We are concerned that vaccine delivery schedules and contracts for COVAX, AVAT, and low and low-middle income countries are delayed or too slow. Less than 5% of vaccine doses that were pre-purchased by or for low-income countries have been delivered. Our common target is for at least 40% of people in low and low-middle income countries to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. We estimate that less than 20% of the necessary vaccines is currently scheduled for delivery to these countries, whether through COVAX, AVAT, or bilateral deals and dose-sharing agreements.",
          "We urge COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers to redouble their efforts to scale up production of vaccines specifically for these countries, and to ensure that the supply of doses to COVAX and low and low-middle income countries takes precedence over the promotion of boosters and other activities. We call on governments to reduce or eliminate barriers to the export of vaccines and all materials involved in their production and deployment. We underscore the urgent need for all parties to address supply chain and trade bottlenecks for vaccines, testing, and therapeutics as well as all of the materials involved in their production and deployment.",
          "As per the IMF staff’s US$50 billion proposal to end the pandemic, and in line with the priorities set out by WHO, WTO, IMF and the World Bank Group, over $35 billion in grant are needed with only one third of this financed to date. We welcome the recent announcement by COVAX and the World Bank to accelerate vaccine supplies for developing countries through a new financing mechanism. We also welcome the partnership between the World Bank and AVAT, noting that World Bank financing is now available to support the purchase and deployment of doses secured by both AVAT and COVAX.",
          "It is critical to improve clarity and transparency around the evolving vaccine market, expected production volumes, delivery schedules, and pre-purchase options. We call on manufacturers to accelerate delivery to developing countries and we call on advanced economies to scale-up near-term deliveries to developing countries.”",
          "The Task Force also launched a new website that includes the first phase of a global database, and country dashboards on vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics to guide their work and advocacy.",
          "The database and dashboards, which also build on the IMF-WHO COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Tracker , seek to focus international attention and mobilize action by illuminating specific gaps, not just globally but also country-by-country."

          "Her Excellency Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former President of Liberia, and Rt Hon. Helen Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, today briefed Member States at the United Nations General Assembly on measures to respond to COVID-19 and prevent future pandemics. HE Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Rt Hon. Helen Clark were Co-Chairs of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response which reported to the World Health Assembly in May 2021 on lessons learnt from the international response to COVID-19.",
          "Based on a close analysis of steps taken and not taken in response to COVID-19, the Panel made a sweeping set of recommendations designed to ensure that no future disease outbreak is allowed to become a devastating pandemic. Recommended actions included that the United Nations General Assembly should adopt a political declaration setting out a road map to strengthen the international system, and that a Global Heath Threats Council be established at Head of State and Government level, with its membership endorsed by the General Assembly. The Panel also called for steps to strengthen and empower WHO, and backed proposals for a new pandemic framework convention.",
          "Given the ongoing pandemic crisis, the Panel also called for the reallocation of a billion COVID-19 vaccine doses from high-income countries with an adequate coverage pipeline to low- and middle-income countries by September, and of another billion by mid-next year, and for all countries to use the full range of public health tools to curb the pandemic.",
          "HE Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told the meeting that the current pandemic is an ongoing disaster which the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response believes could have been averted. “The General Assembly has a decisive role to play in backing the needed reforms, strengthening the multilateral infrastructure so that it can identify and respond more quickly to the next virus with pandemic potential”, she said. “While in some places, vaccines are blunting the worst of COVID-19’s impact, for too many countries, supplies are so limited, and prospects for access pushed so far into the future, that hope is turning to despair.”",
          "Helen Clark noted that the Panel had found that geopolitical tensions and nationalism had weakened the multilateral system which was designed to keep the world safe. “The pandemic is not only a health crisis; it is also a social economic, political, and peace and security crisis. The General Assembly has a crucial role to play in ensuring that the international system is coordinated and empowered to identify and act against future diseases with pandemic potential”, she said. She welcomed signs of progress on the Panel’s recommendation that WHO and the WTO bring together manufacturing countries and manufacturers to scale up vaccine manufacturing capacity rapidly. “An international pandemic financing facility is needed to distribute up to ten billion dollars a year for preparedness and disburse up to one hundred billion in the event of a crisis, allocated by the Global Health Threats Council”, she added.",
          "HE Ellen Johnson Sirleaf reflected on her experience as President of Liberia: “It fell on me to lead our population through the devastating experience of the Ebola epidemic and the hard-won recovery from it. I speak with conviction when I say that this current pandemic must be the last to cause devastation to human life, societies, and economies. As a world, we must do better”, she said.",
          "The informal plenary meeting of the Members and Observer States of the United Nations General Assembly was convened by the President of the General Assembly at the request of the Group of Friends of Solidarity for Global Health Security. The purpose was for the General Assembly to be briefed on the findings and recommendations of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, as contained in the Panel’s report: \" Covid-19: Make it the Last Pandemic \"."

          "Ellen Johnson Sirleaf",
          "We thank the President of the General Assembly for enabling this briefing session to be held, and we thank all representatives of Member States who are joining us today. We are very grateful for your time.",
          "We have come to you today because the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response has recommended that the UN General Assembly play a key role in ensuring that the international system is better able to act against future pandemic threats. But, first, let me comment on the context in which we meet, and then on the findings of the Panel and how they led to its recommendations.",
          "The daily news continues to bring us scenes of hospitals and health workers overwhelmed, and health systems stretched to breaking point, reminding us of the continuing socio-economic and human tragedy of this pandemic. As ever, where resources are least, people suffer most, but the impact of this pandemic also continues everywhere. In some places, vaccines are blunting the worst of the impact, but for too many countries, supplies are so limited and prospects for access are pushed so far into the future that hope is turning to despair.",
          "Globally, there have been nearly 190 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 4 million deaths reported to WHO, but these shocking figures are almost certainly an underestimate of the real toll of the disease.",
          "This pandemic is an ongoing disaster which the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response believes could have been averted if the countries of the world had heeded the many warnings and prepared their health and surveillance systems – and then, when the outbreak began, if they had moved together in mutual transparency and solidarity.",
          "In May 2020, the World Health Assembly passed a consensus resolution requesting that the WHO Director-General initiate an impartial, independent, and comprehensive review of the international health response to COVID-19. Dr Tedros then asked Prime Minister Clark and me to convene an Independent Panel for that purpose.  Prime Minister Clark is with me today from Auckland, New Zealand.",
          "Our main report was presented to the 74th World Health Assembly in May of this year. The wide attention paid to it suggests that the world may be prepared to change course and agree to take steps to prevent a future pandemic catastrophe. Our Panel believes that it is essential that it does.",
          "The Panel concluded that COVID-19 went from being a localised outbreak to a pandemic because of a myriad of failures and gaps in pandemic preparedness and response.  At the outset, there was a failure to learn from the past .",
          "There are reviews of previous health disasters that have gathered dust in basements of agencies and governments – this despite leaders in global health and development frequently warning of the risk of a global pandemic.",
          "I know all too well that after Ebola struck Liberia and our neighbours, sincere promises of ‘never again’ were made but it took years an effective prevention response leaving us vulnerable to the next devastating pandemic.",
          "So today there is a choice – to carry on with business as usual with the inevitability of a future pandemic catastrophe, or to make real and lasting change.",
          "That choice is clear: now we must act - this must be the last pandemic to cause devastation on the scale we are witnessing today. We need a stronger international system for pandemic preparedness and response that understands the threats, is alert, and is poised to take collective action. The job can’t be done by any single country working alone. It can’t even be done by a group of countries, no matter how willing, because we are only as strong as our weakest link. Therefore, the UN General Assembly has a decisive role to play in strengthening the multilateral infrastructure so that it can identify and respond more quickly to the next virus with pandemic potential .",
          "Helen Clark",
          "Greetings from New Zealand. I join President Sirleaf in thanking you all for joining us today.",
          "In today’s audience, there will be those representing countries with rapidly increasing vaccine coverage.  Yet, many others will be representing countries where COVID-19-related illnesses and deaths continue to be on the rise. Alas, the end of the pandemic is not in sight as we speak.",
          "Back in December 2019, clinicians in Wuhan recognised a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin. They collected samples and had them tested. When the results showed that this was potentially a new virus, the Wuhan health system issued local alerts. These in turn were quickly picked up by media, global epidemic surveillance networks, some countries, and by WHO.",
          "But, then, the systems designed to validate and respond to such an event were too slow to respond to a fast-moving respiratory pathogen. Our Panel concluded that WHO was constrained, not helped, by the International Health Regulations (IHR). The procedures under which it and the Emergency Committee of the IHR operate are not conducive to taking a precautionary approach. We believe, however, that even with the current systems, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern could have been declared by at least 22 January.",
          "Even so, following the declaration on the 30 th of January, the month of February 2020 was wasted by many countries. Far too few recognised that this health emergency could directly affect them. Many adopted, in effect, a wait and see approach, rather than activating preparedness and response systems.",
          "Then as the disease spread rapidly, many health systems began to become overwhelmed.  By then, time had run out for many to avert the full impact of COVID-19. The global, “winner takes all” scramble to secure personal protective equipment, therapeutics, and other supplies left many of those in the front lines unprotected.",
          "Too many countries, including some of the wealthiest, devalued science, denied the disease’s severity, and delayed responding. As a result, distrust was sowed amongst their citizens with deadly consequences. Global leadership and co-ordination were lacking, as was the capacity to help fill gaps in country responses.  Geopolitical tensions and nationalism had weakened the multilateral system which was designed to keep the world safe.",
          "Ellen Johnson Sirleaf",
          "There has long been underinvestment in pandemic preparedness. That failure to prepare, and then to use those preparations to respond in a timely manner, has resulted in a runaway pandemic which not only has taken millions of lives, but also is forecast to have a $22 trillion impact on the world economy by 2025.",
          "The lack of adequate social protection in many countries, which is especially needed in times of crisis, has served to widen inequalities. The most vulnerable in our societies are suffering the most from the pandemic. Tens of millions more people have been pushed into extreme poverty. Those in the informal sector have often had little choice over whether to risk infection - their families must be fed.",
          "Women and girls have suffered a disproportionate impact - the effects of the pandemic have been highly gendered. Sexual and reproductive health services have been disrupted, millions of girls whose education has been terminated were put at risk of early forced marriage; and there have been sharp increases in reported domestic violence around the world.",
          "Despite the bleakness of the world’s current predicament, the Panel did find reasons for hope.",
          "Frontline health workers have been magnificent during the pandemic, consistently going above and beyond the call of duty for their communities. The Panel listened to nurses, midwives, and community health workers who have taken on extra risk to try to save lives. At least 17,000 health workers were known to have died by March this year. All governments have a moral duty to keep the health workforce safe - now and in the future.",
          "Then, the speed at which the virus genome was sequenced, and vaccines were developed was unprecedented in human history. Science delivered when the world needed it most, but that science depended on the open sharing of data and knowledge. The benefits must now also be shared freely and openly.",
          "Across income levels and political systems, we have found example of countries that responded well in the first 90 days of the pandemic. The defining factor was competence, and not wealth.  Those that heeded the January 30 2020 PHEIC declaration, as well as the lessons of the past, prepared well, were guided by evidence, and engaged communities in the response through transparent communication tended to be more successful.",
          "The Panel’s recommendations flow directly from the findings of our review. If fully implemented, they can accelerate the end of the current pandemic, and they can put the world on course to ensure that this will be the last pandemic to cause devastation on the scale we are experiencing now .",
          "The package of recommendations is ambitious, and requires resolute action, but nothing less is needed if we are to make this the last pandemic crisis of this kind.",
          "The Panel’s recommendations are in two sets – one set is focused on preventing a future pandemic and global crisis; the other focuses on the urgent need to act decisively to end the current pandemic. The two-tier response which has developed to pandemic control - where high-income countries have the means to vaccinate all citizens and many low- and middle-income countries have been able to vaccinate few - is both ethically unacceptable and insufficient to end the pandemic. We are all in this together. No one is safe until everyone is safe.",
          "Prime Minister Clark will now outline our recommendations.",
          "Helen Clark",
          "Our Panel called on high-income countries with a vaccine pipeline for adequate coverage of their populations to commit immediately to providing vaccines to the 92 low- and middle-income countries covered by COVAX. The Panel set the target of at least one billion doses redistributed in that way no later than 1 September, and another one billion doses by mid next year. The world is far from meeting those targets. Some commitments have been made, but much more needs to be done, and it can be done urgently.",
          "Our Panel also called for ACT-A – the Access to COVID Tools Accelerator -- to be fully funded. Right now, vaccine demand outstrips supply. Even if all the existing vaccines were redistributed, the total amount available would be grossly insufficient. Clearly manufacturing of vaccines needs to be scaled up rapidly and WHO and partners have worked for the better part of a year to make this happen. We recommended that WHO and WTO together immediately convene manufacturing countries and manufacturers to push forward on that and are delighted that such a meeting has taken place recently.",
          "Vaccine inequity is a key factor in the wave of death we’re seeing across Africa, Asia and Latin America. It’s astonishing and self defeating that pharmaceutical manufacturers continue not to share the technology or know how which could help quickly scale manufacturing. Because of that, we see the temporary waiver of patents under the WTO’s TRIPS agreement as a key tool which should be at countries disposal and urge a swift resolution to the protracted discussion on that.",
          "We have called on all countries to utilise all the public health tools available to them to curb COVID-19 transmission - masking, physical distancing, testing and contact tracing, and isolation, to name but a few.",
          "Unfortunately, another dangerous pathogen could emerge at any time. The world was not prepared for this one. It must be ready for the next. That will require stronger international and national systems for pandemic preparedness and response.",
          "This pandemic has shown the importance of multilateralism, global leadership, and whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches.",
          "The international system needs to work as a coherent and effective system – and it must also work across sectors and silos. The pandemic is not only a health crisis; it is also a social economic, political, and peace and security crisis. That is why we have come to you – the UN General Assembly. Our Panel believes that the General Assembly has a crucial role to play in ensuring that the international system is co-ordinated and empowered to identify and act against future diseases with pandemic potential.",
          "We said earlier that our recommendations are a package. We propose that a negotiated political declaration be adopted by the UN General Assembly later this year, setting out the road map for a stronger international system for the future.",
          "That roadmap should set out the architecture required and the steps to be taken to create it. It should encompass support for a new high-level oversight council, a dedicated financing mechanism, a new pandemic convention, and a  redesigned, permanent mechanism replacing ACT-A based on a global public goods model.",
          "At the top of that system, our Panel recommends the creation of a Global Health Threats Council at the level of Heads of State and Government and including private sector and civil society representation. Pandemic preparedness must be led from the top, and it must be multisectoral.",
          "Indeed, that Council would be tasked with maintaining political commitment to pandemic preparedness and response. It would not be an operational body, but rather a body that monitors progress, draws attention to gaps, and holds actors accountable – all key functions that the Panel found were missing in the international system.",
          "WHO has an indispensable role in responding to global health emergencies and ensuring longer-term public health and health security through the strengthening of primary health systems in all countries. WHO is and should remain the lead agency for health in the international system. The quality, timing, and clarity of the technical advice and direction WHO provides to the world are of the utmost importance and Member States must adequately resource, empower, and further strengthen it. We welcome the initiative taken by the World Health Assembly to establish a Working Group on strengthening WHO.",
          "The Panel backs the calls for a new pandemic framework convention which should, among other things, fill gaps in the current legal system and clarify the responsibilities between States and international actors. This pandemic treaty or framework convention would give state parties the opportunity to commit to the principles of pandemic preparedness and response in the spirit of mutual obligation, and give a framework for the institutional architecture needed to prevent future pandemics. The Panel recommended that it be adopted using the powers under Article 19 of the WHO Constitution, and be complementary to the International Health Regulations.",
          "We propose the creation of an international pandemic financing facility . It must be able distribute up to ten billion dollars a year for preparedness and disburse up to one hundred billion in the event of a crisis. Ultimately, investing billions in preparedness now will save trillions in the future, as the current pandemic has so clearly illustrated. Funding for response to this pandemic generally was too little and came too late.",
          "The facility should raise resources on an ability-to-pay formula with all countries contributing and allocations being made to those requiring solidarity funding. This should be a sustainable core commitment - not subtracted from an already stretched development assistance envelope. The facility could be hosted by an existing institution which is representative of countries big and small, rich and poor – we have proposed that the Global Health Threats Council be the allocator of funds.",
          "The Panel considered that the current model of development and delivery of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics for pandemics is not fit for purpose. We believe there is a need to shift away from a market-based model to one based on global public goods. This can be achieved through a transformation of ACT-A.",
          "The Panel has recommended increasing the authority and independence of WHO, including by it having adequate, predictable, flexible and sustainable funding, and having its Director General and Regional Directors in future each serving a single term of seven years.",
          "A greatly improved system for disease surveillance and alert is needed. WHO must have the authority to investigate outbreaks of concern rapidly, and publish information rapidly on its own authority. Future declarations of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO Director-General should be based on the precautionary principle where warranted, as in the case of respiratory infections. PHEIC declarations should be based on clear, objective, and published criteria.",
          "The Panel recommended that WHO set measurable benchmarks for country preparedness and response capacities, and for countries to invest accordingly, with support coming from the dedicated financing mechanism for those with limited resources. WHO should formalise universal periodic peer reviews of country progress against the benchmarks it sets. We also brought the IMF into the picture – proposing that it incorporate assessments of preparedness as part of its Article Four consultations.",
          "Ultimately preparedness rests on national governments setting up the right structures, developing the needed capacities, and investing in vital assets such as health and other system resilience and social protection. Governments can listen and learn from the best practices we illustrate in our report.",
          "Ellen Johnson Sirleaf",
          "Thank you, once again, for joining us today. We believe that our report is clear on both its diagnosis of how the world ended up in its present predicament, and its recommendations on how to curb the current pandemic and prevent a future one.",
          "As President of my country, Liberia, it fell on me to lead our population through the devastating experience of the Ebola epidemic and the hard-won recovery from it. I speak with conviction when I say that this current pandemic must be the last to cause devastation to human life, societies, and economies. As a world, we must do better.",
          "This time we must act and not bury this analysis and these recommendations in the vault as has happen many times before.",
          "To implement a package of reforms like that which our Panel has developed will require the engagement of Heads of State and Government. Every Head of State and Government is currently focused on the problems created by the pandemic.",
          "It is vital now to mobilise the political will to make the changes required for a more effective and timely global response next time a pandemic threat emerges. We owe this to future generations.",
          "The General Assembly has the authority to convene at the highest level to endorse a negotiated political declaration which will drive reform. That is what our Panel has requested the General Assembly to do, and we hope that you will give this your most serious consideration."

          "28 July 2021 - Today, WHO joins the global community in celebrating World Hepatitis Day with the theme “Hepatitis can’t wait”, calling on all countries to work together to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. A hepatitis-free future is achievable with a united effort.",
          "Over 354 million people worldwide live with chronic hepatitis; over 8000 new infections of hepatitis B and C occur every day, and more than one million deaths from advanced liver disease and liver cancer occur every year.",
          "The 2021 Global report on HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections , took stock of the progress achieved in the last 5 years, the setbacks caused by the pandemic, and the lessons learned for the coming decade.  Although the extent of progress in the hepatitis response has differed drastically both across regions and across countries, there are some notable success stories including the impressive progress in the large-scale expansion of HCV treatment and the reduction of hepatitis B infections in children. The latter is one of the few Sustainable Development Goals health targets that is on track and a critical intervention to prevent liver cancer.",
          "WHO recently launched first-ever global guidance for countries seeking to validate elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection as a public health problem. WHO also, released first guidelines on hepatitis C virus self-testing, which  strongly recommend offering self-testing for hepatitis C virus (HCV) as an additional approach to HCV testing services.",
          "While progress has been made in the hepatitis response, there is still a long way to go. In far too many countries, priority interventions remain inaccessible to the populations most severely affected or at higher risk. The COVID-19 pandemic has impeded the development and delivery of core services that tackle viral hepatitis and other infectious diseases and NCDs. During this incredibly challenging year, we have witnessed the ability of health and community systems to adapt to continue to reach people in need. The lessons learned from the innovations developed during the pandemic response can inform core service delivery programming, as part of the overall effort to reduce persisting inequalities in access to health care and achieve universal health coverage.",
          "WHO will host a virtual event to commemorate the day, with the participation of senior WHO officials, ministers of health, global and regional partner organizations and communities affected by hepatitis.",

          "On 13 and 20 July 2021, the COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) met virtually to discuss rare reports of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) following vaccination with the Janssen and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines. Both vaccines use an adenovirus platform as their backbone.",
          "GBS is a rare immune system disorder that results in muscle weakness, pain or numbness, and, in more severe cases, paralysis. GBS could result from different causes, including infections, and occurs more frequently in males and persons over 50 years old. Cases may occur coincidentally following vaccination. For example, rare cases of GBS have been observed following seasonal influenza vaccines and vaccines to protect against shingles, but it is not known if the vaccines cause GBS (1, 2) . A systematic review and meta-analysis in 2011 estimated the background incidence for GBS as 0.8-1.9/100 000 in Europe and Northern America (3)",
          "For Vaxzevria (the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine manufactured in Europe), the European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) issued a statement on 9 July recommending the addition of a warning to raise awareness of GBS following vaccination, although they could not confirm nor rule out an association with the vaccine (4) . A total of 227 cases of GBS had been reported from the EU/EEA to EMA with Vaxzevria by 27 June 2021, while around 51.4 million doses of Vaxzevria had been given to people in the EU/EEA by 20 June 2021 (5) .",
          "For Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine, the US FDA announced on 13 July a revision to the vaccine recipient and vaccination provider fact sheets to include information pertaining to an observed increased risk of GBS following vaccination (6) . The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed the information at its meeting on 22 July and noted that as of 30 June, 100 cases of GBS had been reported in the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, the US nationwide passive surveillance system, with approximately 12.2 million of doses of the Janssen vaccine.",
          "Similarly, on 22 July the EMA issued a statement that GBS will be listed as a very rare side effect of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen and that a warning will be included in the product information to raise awareness among healthcare professionals and people taking the vaccine (7) .",
          "The GACVS sub-committee has reviewed the statements and measures put in place by the US FDA and the EMA. The sub-committee also reviewed preliminary data from Vigibase, the WHO global database of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR), which indicated 164 unconfirmed cases of GBS in countries outside the EEA and US for Astrazeneca (Vaxzevria and Covishield) vaccines, of which 14 unconfirmed GBS cases were reported (within 14 days) following 19.5 million doses of (different brands of) the Astrazeneca vaccines from Central and South American countries.",
          {
            "text": "Based on a careful scientific review of the available information, the GACVS subcommittee came to the following conclusions and recommendations:",
            "bullets": [
              "Rare cases of GBS have been reported following vaccinations with adenovirus vector COVID-19 vaccines.",
              "Increased reports of GBS have not been observed following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.",
              "More rigorous studies using alternative data sources and robust study designs, and comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations would be needed, to fully assess the significance of these events. The GACVS subcommittee will continue to monitor GBS and any other safety concerns and review further as more data become available.",
              "Healthcare professionals should monitor for and report all adverse events including GBS. Countries should continue to collate detailed data on cases. Ideally, data should be gathered through active surveillance within hospitals to provide a more thorough understanding of this safety issue. The WHO COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance manual provides guidance to countries on the safety monitoring and adverse events data sharing for COVID-19 vaccines (8) .",
              "Individuals receiving Janssen or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines should be alert to signs and symptoms of GBS and should seek immediate medical attention if they develop weakness/tingling and paralysis in the extremities that may progress to other parts of the body including the chest and face. Symptoms may include difficulty in walking; difficulty with facial movements; double vision or inability to move eyes; or difficulty controlling bladder or bowel functions. Healthcare professionals should be aware of these signs and symptoms to allow for early diagnosis and treatment. Most people fully recover from GBS.",
              "Though countries should always consider their individual pandemic circumstances and benefit-risk profiles, overall the subcommittee concludes that the potential benefits of both the Janssen and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh any potential risk of GBS, particularly given the increase in the more transmissible Delta (B.1.617.2) variant."
            ]
          },
          "The GACVS COVID-19 subcommittee will continue to review the safety data from all COVID-19 vaccines and will update any advice as necessary. Open, transparent, and evidence-based communication about the potential benefits and risks to recipients and the community is essential to maintain trust. WHO is carefully monitoring the rollout of all COVID-19 vaccines and will continue to work closely with countries to manage potential risks, and to use science and data to drive response and recommendations.",

          "One billion children experience violence and abuse every year. That shocking figure has risen even higher\r\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Violence prevention and response services have been disrupted for 1.8\r\nbillion children living in more than 100 countries. 1.5 billion young people affected by school closures lost the protection and support that schools often provide.",
          "Measures to contain the virus, along with economic hardship and family stress, have combined to create\r\n‘perfect storm’ conditions for children vulnerable to observing or experiencing physical, emotional and\r\nsexual abuse. Despite the benefits of digital connectivity, a life lived more online for learning, socialising and\r\ngaming has significantly increased children’s exposure to those who wish to harm them.",
          "Today, we stand at a critical moment for the world’s children. Unless we act now and with urgency, we risk\r\nlosing a generation of children to the long-term impacts of violence and abuse that will undermine child\r\nsafety, health, learning and development long after the pandemic subsides. We cannot let that happen.",

Now is the time to redouble our collective efforts and translate what we\r\nknow works into accelerated progress towards the goal of a world where every child grows-up safe, secure\r\nand in a nurturing environment.",
          "We must create a world: where every child can grow up and thrive with dignity; where violence and abuse of\r\nchildren is legally outlawed and socially unacceptable; where the relationship between parents and children\r\nprevents the intergenerational transmission of violence; where children in every community can safely take\r\nadvantage of the digital world for learning, playing and socialising; where girls and boys experience stronger\r\ndevelopmental and educational outcomes because schools and other learning environments are safe,\r\ngender-sensitive, inclusive and supportive; where sport is safe for children; where every effort is made to\r\nprotect the most vulnerable children from all forms of violence, exploitation and abuse, including those living\r\nin situations of conflict and fragility (including climate-related fragility); and where all children can access safe\r\nand child-friendly help when they need it.",
          "The moral imperative and economic case for action to end violence against children are compelling. Action\r\ntoday will not only prevent the devastating intergenerational social and economic impacts of violence on\r\nchildren, families and societies; it will also help to address the wider impacts of COVID-19 and support\r\nprogress towards multiple Sustainable Development Goals.",

This latest set of comprehensive worldwide childhood immunization\r\n    figures, the first official figures to reflect global service disruptions due to COVID-19, show a majority of countries last year experienced drops in childhood vaccination rates.",
          "Concerningly, most of these – up to 17 million children – likely did not receive a single vaccine during the year, widening already immense inequities in vaccine access. Most of these children live in communities affected by conflict, in under-served\r\n    remote places, or in informal or slum settings where they face multiple deprivations including limited access to basic health and key social services.",
          "“Even as countries clamour to get their hands on COVID-19 vaccines, we have gone backwards on other vaccinations, leaving children at risk from devastating but preventable diseases like measles, polio or meningitis,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General .\r\n “Multiple disease outbreaks would be catastrophic for communities and health systems already battling COVID-19, making it more urgent than ever to invest in childhood vaccination and ensure every child is reached.”",
          "In all regions, rising numbers of children miss vital first vaccine doses in 2020; millions more miss later vaccines",
          "Disruptions in immunization services were widespread in 2020, with the WHO Southeast Asian and Eastern Mediterranean Regions most affected.  As access to health services and immunization outreach were curtailed, the number of children not receiving\r\n    even their very first vaccinations increased in all regions. As compared with 2019, 3.5 million more children missed their first dose of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine (DTP-1) while 3 million more children missed their first measles dose.",
          "“This evidence should be a clear warning – the COVID-19 pandemic and related disruptions cost us valuable ground we cannot afford to lose – and the consequences will be paid in the lives and wellbeing of the most vulnerable,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director . “Even before the pandemic, there were worrying signs that we were beginning to lose ground in the fight to immunize children against preventable child illness, including with the widespread\r\n    measles outbreaks two years ago. The pandemic has made a bad situation worse. With the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines at the forefront of everyone’s minds, we must remember that vaccine distribution has always been inequitable,\r\n    but it does not have to be.”",

          "The data shows that middle-income countries now account for an increasing share of unprotected children – that is, children missing out on at least some vaccine doses. India is experiencing a particularly large drop, with DTP-3 coverage falling\r\n    from 91% to 85%.",
          "Fuelled by funding shortfalls, vaccine misinformation, instability and other factors, a troubling picture is also emerging in WHO’s Region of the Americas, where vaccination coverage continues to fall. Just 82% of children are fully vaccinated with\r\n    DTP, down from 91% in 2016.",

          "Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, global childhood vaccination rates against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles and polio had stalled for several years at around 86%. This rate is well below the 95% recommended by WHO to protect against measles\r\n    –often the first disease to resurge when children are not reached with vaccines - and insufficient to stop other vaccine-preventable diseases.",
          "With many resources and personnel diverted to support the COVID-19 response, there have been significant disruptions to immunization service provision in many parts of the world. In some countries, clinics have been closed or hours reduced, while people\r\n    may have been reluctant to seek healthcare because of fear of transmission or have experienced challenges reaching services due to lockdown measures and transportation disruptions.",
          "“These are alarming numbers, suggesting the pandemic is unravelling years of progress in routine immunization and exposing millions of children to deadly, preventable diseases”, said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance .\r\n “This is a wake-up call – we cannot allow a legacy of COVID-19 to be the resurgence of measles, polio and other killers. We all need to work together to help countries both defeat COVID-19, by ensuring global, equitable access to vaccines,\r\n    and get routine immunization programmes back on track. The future health and wellbeing of millions of children and their communities across the globe depends on it.”",
          "Concerns are not just for outbreak-prone diseases. Already at low rates, vaccinations against human papillomavirus (HPV) - which protect girls against cervical cancer later in life - have been highly affected by school closures. As a result, across countries\r\n    that have introduced HPV vaccine to date, approximately 1.6 million more girls missed out in 2020.

For 2020, data was provided from 160 countries.",

Vaccination rates for measles second dose were at 71% (from 70% in 2019).  To control measles, 95% uptake of two vaccine doses is required; countries that cannot reach that level rely on periodic nationwide vaccination campaigns\r\n    to fill the gap.",
          "In addition to routine immunization disruptions, there are currently 57 postponed mass vaccination campaigns in 44 countries*, for measles, polio, yellow fever and other diseases, affecting millions more people.",
          "New modelling also shows significant declines in DTP, measles vaccination coverage",
          "New modelling, also published today in The Lancet by researchers at the Washington-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), similarly shows that childhood vaccination declined globally in 2020 due to COVID-19 disruptions. The\r\n    IHME-led modelling is based on country-reported administrative data for DTP and measles vaccines, supplemented by reports on electronic medical records and human movement data captured through anonymized tracking of mobile phones.",
          "Both analyses show that countries and the broader health community must ensure that new waves of COVID-19 and the massive roll out of COVID 19 vaccines don’t derail routine immunization and that catch-up activities continue to be enhanced.",

Countries with advanced access to vaccines and well-resourced health systems are under pressure to fully reopen their societies and relax the PHSM. Countries with limited access to vaccines are experiencing new waves of infections, seeing erosion of public trust and growing resistance to PHSM, growing economic hardship, and, in some instances, increasing social unrest.",

Somatic gene therapies, which involve modifying a patient’s DNA to treat or cure a disease, have\r\n    been successfully used to address HIV, sickle-cell disease and transthyretin amyloidosis. The technique could also vastly improve treatment for a variety of cancers.",

          "On 26 May 2021, the COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) issued a statement reviewing initial reports of mild myocarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is an inflammation of the lining that surrounds the heart. While they can lead to serious illness, they are often mild and respond well to conservative treatment.",
          "More data have become available since the GACVS statement of 26 May 2021, with more countries reporting myocarditis and pericarditis in individuals who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. The reported cases have typically occurred within days of vaccination, more commonly among younger males and more often following the second dose the of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.",
          "A strong signal of myocarditis/pericarditis has been reported recently with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in the United States (US). However, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has concluded that the benefits of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis even among young people. According to the data in the US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), approximately 40.6 cases of myocarditis per million second doses among males and 4.2 cases per million among females have been reported as of 11 June 2021  in persons 12-29 years of age who received the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. For persons over 30 years of age, the reporting rates were 2.4 and 1.0 per million second doses, respectively, for males and females.",
          "The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) at its recent meeting on 5-8 July 2021 reviewed the latest data from Europe and has confirmed that there is a plausible causal relationship between myocarditis and the mRNA vaccines.",

              "Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. These cases occurred more often in younger men and after the second dose of the vaccine, typically within few days after vaccination. Current evidence suggests a likely causal association between myocarditis and the mRNA vaccines",
              "Available data suggest that the immediate course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is generally mild and responds to conservative treatment (e.g. rest, treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs etc).  Follow-up is ongoing to determine long term outcomes.",
              "More rigorous studies using alternative data sources and more robust study designs including comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations as well as investigations monitoring for longer term follow up are underway; the GACVS subcommittee will continue to review this signal as more data become available.",
              "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EMA have provided updates to the Product Information for the mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty and Spikevax). These and other agencies have issued advisories and various communication materials, to the public and healthcare professionals, with guidance or actions to take following vaccinations with mRNA vaccines.",
              "Vaccinated individuals should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as new onset and persisting chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination.",
              "Clinicians should be aware of the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis with mRNA vaccines and those most likely to be affected. They should be alert to presentations such as acute chest pain, shortness of breath and palpitations that may be suggestive of myocarditis after vaccination, especially in adolescent or young males. Coronary events are less likely to be the source of such symptoms among younger people.",
              "Where possible, suspected cases should be evaluated, provided guidance and be followed up with cardiologist consultation.",
              "It is important to rule out other potential causes of myocarditis and pericarditis, including COVID-19 infection and other viral etiologies. An infectious disease specialist and/or rheumatologist may need to be consulted to assist in this evaluation."
            ]
          },
          "While acknowledging the clear benefits of the mRNA vaccines in reducing deaths and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 infections, the subcommittee encourages all health professionals to report all events of myocarditis and other adverse events observed with these and other vaccines. The WHO COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance manual provides guidance to countries on the safety monitoring and adverse events data sharing for the new COVID-19 vaccines.",
          "The GACVS COVID-19 subcommittee will continue to review the safety data from all COVID-19 vaccines and update any advice as necessary. Open, transparent, and evidence-based communication about the potential benefits and risks to recipients and the community is essential to maintain trust. WHO is carefully monitoring the rollout of all COVID-19 vaccines and will continue to work closely with countries to manage potential risks, and to use science and data to drive response and recommendations.",

          "Patients severely or critically ill with COVID-19 often suffer from an overreaction of the immune system, which can be very harmful to the patient’s health. Interleukin-6 blocking drugs – tocilizumab and sarilumab – act to suppress this\r\n    overreaction.",
          "The prospective and living network meta-analyses showed that in severely or critically ill patients, administering these drugs reduce the odds of death by 13%, compared to standard care. This means that there will be 15 fewer deaths per thousand patients,\r\n    and as many as 28 fewer deaths for every thousand critically ill patients. The odds of mechanical ventilation among severe and critical patients are reduced by 28%, compared with standard care. This translates to 23 fewer patients out of a thousand\r\n    needing mechanical ventilation.",

          "COVAX was built on the principle of equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines to protect the health of people all across the globe. That means protecting their lives and livelihoods, including their ability to travel and conduct trade. As travel and other\r\n    possibilities begin to open up in some parts of the world, COVAX urges all regional, national and local government authorities to recognise as fully vaccinated all people who have received COVID-19 vaccines that have been deemed safe and effective\r\n    by the World Health Organization and/or one or more of the 11 Stringent Regulatory Authorities (SRAs) approved for COVID-19 vaccines,\r\n    when making decisions on who is able to travel or attend events.",
          "Any measure that only allows people protected by a subset of WHO-approved vaccines to benefit from the re-opening of travel into and with that region would effectively create a two-tier system, further widening the global vaccine divide and exacerbating\r\n    the inequities we have already seen in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. It would negatively impact the growth of economies that are already suffering the most.",
          "Such moves are already undermining confidence in life-saving vaccines that have already been shown to be safe and effective, affecting uptake of vaccines and potentially putting billions of people at risk. At a time when the world is trying to resume\r\n    trade, commerce and travel, this is counter-effective, both in spirit and outcome.",
          "COVAX commends countries that have already shown commitment to equity as well as safety by accepting travelers protected by all vaccines validated by WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) and/or one or more of the 11 Stringent Regulatory Authorities (SRAs) approved for COVID-19 vaccines. We call on other nations and regions to do the same.",
          "Notes to editors",
          "About COVAX",
          "COVAX , the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-convened by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance\r\n    Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others. It is the only global initiative that is working\r\n    with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.",
          "CEPI’s role in COVAX",
          "CEPI is leading on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio , investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support\r\n    development of three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility\r\n    to a number of candidates, and made strategic investments in vaccine manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine. CEPI\r\n    is also investing in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.",
          "Gavi’s role in COVAX",
          "Gavi leads on procurement and delivery at scale for COVAX: designing and managing the COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX AMC and working with its traditional Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery. As part of this role, Gavi hosts the Office of the\r\n    COVAX Facility to coordinate the operation and governance of the mechanism as a whole, holds financial and legal relationships with 193 Facility participants, and manages the COVAX Facility deals portfolio : negotiating advance purchase agreements with manufacturers of promising vaccine candidates to secure doses on behalf of all COVAX Facility participants.\r\n    Gavi also coordinates design, operationalisation and fundraising for the Gavi COVAX AMC, the mechanism that provides access to donor-funded doses of vaccine to 92 lower-income economies. As part of this work, Gavi provides funding and oversight for\r\n    UNICEF procurement and delivery of vaccines to all AMC participants – operationalising the advance purchase agreements between Gavi and manufacturers – as well as support for partners’ and governments work on readiness and delivery.\r\n    This includes tailored support to governments, UNICEF, WHO and other partners for cold chain equipment, technical assistance, syringes, vehicles, and other aspects of the vastly complex logistical operation for delivery. Gavi also co-designed, raises\r\n    funds for and supports the operationalisation of the AMC’s no fault compensation mechanism as well as the COVAX Humanitarian Buffer .",
          "WHO’s role in COVAX",
          "WHO has multiple roles within COVAX : It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery. Its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts ( SAGE ) on Immunization develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations. Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL) / prequalification\r\n    programmes ensure harmonized review and authorization across member states. It provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D\r\n    technical coordination. WHO leads, together with UNICEF, the Country Readiness and Delivery workstream , which provides support to countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines. Along with Gavi and numerous other partners working at the global, regional, and country-level,\r\n    the CRD workstream provides tools, guidance, monitoring, and on the ground technical assistance for the planning and roll-out of the vaccines . Along with COVAX partners, WHO has developed a no-fault compensation scheme as\r\n part of the time-limited indemnification and liability commitments",
          "UNICEF’s role in COVAX",
          "UNICEF is leveraging its experience as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world and working with manufacturers and partners on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as freight, logistics and storage. UNICEF already procures more than\r\n    2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. In collaboration with the PAHO Revolving Fund ,\r\n UNICEF is leading efforts to procure and supply doses of COVID-19\r\n    vaccines for COVAX. In addition, UNICEF, Gavi and WHO are working with governments around the clock to ensure that countries are ready to receive the vaccines, with appropriate cold chain equipment in place and health workers trained to dispense them.\r\n    UNICEF is also playing a lead role in efforts to foster trust in vaccines, delivering vaccine confidence communications and tracking and addressing misinformation around the world.",
          "About ACT-Accelerator",
          "The Access to COVID-19 Tools ACT-Accelerator, is a new, ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. It was set up in response to a call from G20 leaders\r\n    in March and launched by the WHO, European Commission, France and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in April 2020.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator is not a decision-making body or a new organisation, but works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organisations to end the pandemic. It is a framework for collaboration that has been designed to bring key players around\r\n    the table with the goal of ending the pandemic as quickly as possible through the accelerated development, equitable allocation, and scaled up delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines, thereby protecting health systems and restoring societies and\r\n    economies in the near term. It draws on the experience of leading global health organisations which are tackling the world’s toughest health challenges, and who, by working together, are able to unlock new and more ambitious results against\r\n    COVID-19. Its members share a commitment to ensure all people have access to all the tools needed to defeat COVID-19 and to work with unprecedented levels of partnership to achieve it.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator has four areas of work: diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines and the health system connector. Cross-cutting all of these is the workstream on Access & Allocation."

They issued the following joint statement:",
          "“As many countries are struggling with new variants and a third wave of COVID-19 infections, accelerating access to vaccines becomes even more critical to ending the pandemic everywhere and achieving broad-based growth. We are deeply concerned about the limited vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and support for deliveries available to developing countries. Urgent action is needed now to arrest the rising human toll due to the pandemic, and to halt further divergence in the economic recovery between advanced economies and the rest.",
          "We have formed a Task Force, as a “war room” to help track, coordinate and advance delivery of COVID-19 health tools to developing countries and to mobilize relevant stakeholders and national leaders to remove critical roadblocks—in support of the priorities set out by World Bank Group, IMF, WHO, and WTO including in the joint statements of June 1 and June 3 , and in the IMF staff’s $50 billion proposal .",
          "At today’s first meeting, we discussed the urgency of increasing supplies of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics for developing countries. We also looked at practical and effective ways to track, coordinate and advance delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries.",
          "As an urgent first step, we are calling on G20 countries to (1) embrace the target of at least 40 percent in every country by end-2021, and at least 60 percent by the first half of 2022, (2) share more vaccine doses now, including by ensuring at least  1 billion doses are shared with developing countries in 2021 starting immediately, (3) provide financing, including grants and concessional financing, to close the residual gaps, including for the ACT-Accelerator, and (4) remove all barriers to export of inputs and finished vaccines, and other barriers to supply chain operations.",
          "In addition, to enhance transparency we agreed to compile data on dose requests (by type and quantity), contracts, deliveries (including through donations), and deployments of COVID-19 vaccines to low and middle-income countries—and make it available as part of a shared country-level dashboard. We also agreed to take steps to address hesitancy, and to coordinate efforts to address gaps in readiness, so countries are positioned to receive, deploy and administer vaccines.”"

          "Following a 70-year effort, China has been awarded a malaria-free certification from WHO – a notable feat for a country that reported 30 million cases of the disease annually in the 1940s. “Today we congratulate the people\r\n        of China on ridding the country of malaria,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Their success was hard-earned and came only after decades of targeted and sustained action. With this announcement, China joins\r\n        the growing number of countries that are showing the world that a malaria-free future is a viable goal.”",
          "China is the first country in the WHO Western Pacific Region to be awarded a malaria-free certification in more than 3 decades. Other countries in the region that have achieved this status include Australia (1981), Singapore (1982) and Brunei Darussalam\r\n        (1987).",
          "“Congratulations to China on eliminating malaria,” said Dr Takeshi Kasai, Regional Director, WHO Western Pacific Regional Office. “China’s tireless effort to achieve this important milestone demonstrates how strong political\r\n        commitment and strengthening national health systems can result in eliminating a disease that once was a major public health problem. China’s achievement takes us one step closer towards the vision of a malaria-free Western Pacific Region.”",
          "Globally, 40 countries and territories have been granted a malaria-free certification from WHO – including, most recently, El Salvador (2021), Algeria (2019), Argentina (2019), Paraguay (2018) and Uzbekistan (2018)."

          "Beginning in the 1950s, health authorities in China worked to locate and stop the spread of malaria by providing preventive antimalarial medicines for people at risk of the disease as well as treatment for those who had fallen ill. The country also\r\n        made a major effort to reduce mosquito breeding grounds and stepped up the use of insecticide spraying in homes in some areas.",
          "In 1967, the Chinese Government launched the “523 Project” – a nation-wide research programme aimed at finding new treatments for malaria. This effort, involving more than 500 scientists from 60 institutions, led to the discovery\r\n        in the 1970s of artemisinin – the core compound of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), the most effective antimalarial drugs available today.",
          "“Over many decades, China’s ability to think outside the box served the country well in its own response to malaria, and also had a significant ripple effect globally,” notes Dr Pedro Alonso, Director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme.\r\n        “The Government and its people were always searching for new and innovative ways to accelerate the pace of progress towards elimination.”",
          "In the 1980s, China was one of the first countries in the world to extensively test the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for the prevention of malaria, well before nets were recommended by WHO for malaria control. By 1988, more than 2.4 million\r\n        nets had been distributed nation-wide. The use of such nets led to substantial reductions in malaria incidence in the areas where they were deployed.",
          "By the end of 1990, the number of malaria cases in China had plummeted to 117 000, and deaths were reduced by 95%. With support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, beginning in 2003, China stepped up training, staffing, laboratory\r\n        equipment, medicines and mosquito control, an effort that led to a further reduction in cases; within 10 years, the number of cases had fallen to about 5000 annually.",
          "In 2020, after reporting 4 consecutive years of zero indigenous cases, China applied for an official WHO certification of malaria elimination. Members of the independent Malaria Elimination Certification Panel travelled to China in May 2021 to verify\r\n        the country’s malaria-free status as well as its programme to prevent re-establishment of the disease."

The “1” signifies the one-day deadline for health facilities to report a malaria diagnosis;\r\n        by the end of day 3, health authorities are required to confirm a case and determine the risk of spread; and, within 7 days, appropriate measures must be taken to prevent further spread of the disease."

          "COVID-19 has caused and still causes enormous loss of health and economic values in all countries. Working people, comprising 50-70% of the total population, are at the centre of the COVID-19 crisis. Health workers, in-service occupations, construction, food industry, cleaning, transportation, police, customs, guard, schools, and social service workers, covering a total of over 2 billion people, are exposed to COVID-19 infection risk in their daily work. Many may transmit the risk to patients, clients, customers or pupils. Several vulnerable groups of workers in the informal sector, migrant workers, and many others are poorly protected and the management of COVID-19 risk is disorganized. Workability and return to work of the whole workforce is critical for rectifying the health, economic and social crisis. Despite the impressive and ongoing work by WHO in the management of the COVID-19 crisis and protection of health workers and the general population, the majority of the 3.4 billion working population, as well as the COVID-19 risk workers and vulnerable groups continue to lack the necessary protection from COVID-19 infection (the fourth and fifth billion). The management of the pandemic risk at work needs efficient and effective occupational health services, competent personnel, and the necessary facilities. Today, occupational health services cover less than 20% of the global workforce.",
          "For management of the COVID-19 crisis at work, ICOH proposes the following actions to WHO: 1. Together with ILO, organize the 14th session of the Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health. 2. As a part of the 13th General Programme of Work, to launch a new strategy for occupational health and ensure competent universal occupational health services for all workers. 3 Put efforts in place for preventing COVID-19 risk and protecting the health of high risk, service and vulnerable workers e.g., by urgent vaccination of all workers considered to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection. 4. WHO to support member States for better diagnosis and registration of work-related COVID-19 infections, and facilitate their compensation as occupational diseases."

          "The report, Ethics and governance of artificial intelligence for health, is the result of 2 years of consultations held by a panel of international experts appointed by WHO .",
          "“Like all new technology, artificial intelligence holds enormous potential for improving the health of millions of people around the world, but like all technology it can also be misused and cause harm,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This important new report provides a valuable guide for countries on how to maximize the benefits of AI, while minimizing its risks and avoiding its pitfalls.”",
          "Artificial intelligence can be, and in some wealthy countries is already being used to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and screening for diseases; to assist with clinical care; strengthen health research and drug development, and support diverse public health interventions, such as disease surveillance, outbreak response, and health systems management.",
          "AI could also empower patients to take greater control of their own health care and better understand their evolving needs. It could also enable resource-poor countries and rural communities, where patients often have restricted access to health-care workers or medical professionals, to bridge gaps in access to health services.",
          "However, WHO’s new report cautions against overestimating the benefits of AI for health, especially when this occurs at the expense of core investments and strategies required to achieve universal health coverage.",
          "I t also points out that opportunities are linked to challenges and risks, including unethical collection and use of health data; biases encoded in algorithms, and risks of AI to patient safety, cybersecurity, and the environment.",
          "For example, while private and public sector investment in the development and deployment of AI is critical, the unregulated use of AI could subordinate the rights and interests of patients and communities to the powerful commercial interests of technology companies or the interests of governments in surveillance and social control.",
          "The report also emphasizes that systems trained primarily on data collected from individuals in high-income countries may not perform well for individuals in low- and middle-income settings.",
          "AI systems should therefore be carefully designed to reflect the diversity of socio-economic and health-care settings. They should be accompanied by training in digital skills, community engagement and awareness-raising, especially for millions of healthcare workers who will require digital literacy or retraining if their roles and functions are automated, and who must contend with machines that could challenge the decision-making and autonomy of providers and patients.",
          "Ultimately, guided by existing laws and human rights obligations, and new laws and policies that enshrine ethical principles, governments, providers, and designers must work together to address ethics and human rights concerns at every stage of an AI technology’s design, development, and deployment."

The designers of AI technologies should satisfy regulatory requirements for safety, accuracy and efficacy for well-defined use cases or indications. Measures of quality control in practice and quality improvement in the use of AI must be available.",
          "Ensuring transparency, explainability and intelligibility. Transparency requires that sufficient information be published or documented before the design or deployment of an AI technology. Such information must be easily accessible and facilitate meaningful public consultation and debate on how the technology is designed and how it should or should not be used.",
          "Fostering responsibility and accountability. Although AI technologies perform specific tasks, it is the responsibility of stakeholders to ensure that they are used under appropriate conditions and by appropriately trained people. Effective mechanisms should be available for questioning and for redress for individuals and groups that are adversely affected by decisions based on algorithms.",
          "Ensuring inclusiveness and equity. Inclusiveness requires that AI for health be designed to encourage the widest possible equitable use and access, irrespective of age, sex, gender, income, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability or other characteristics protected under human rights codes.",
          "Promoting AI that is responsive and sustainable. Designers, developers and users should continuously and transparently assess AI applications during actual use to determine whether AI responds adequately and appropriately to expectations and requirements. AI systems should also be designed to minimize their environmental consequences and increase energy efficiency. Governments and companies should address anticipated disruptions in the workplace, including training for health-care workers to adapt to the use of AI systems, and potential job losses due to use of automated systems.",
          "These principles will guide future WHO work to support efforts to ensure that the full potential of AI for healthcare and public health will be used for the benefits of all."

          "Geneva/Johannesburg/Paris: The World Health Organization (WHO) and its COVAX partners are working with a South African consortium comprising Biovac, Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines, a network of universities and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish its first COVID mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub.",
          "The move follows WHO’s global call for Expression of Interest (EOI) on 16 April 2021 to establish COVID mRNA vaccine technology transfer hubs to scale up production and access to COVID vaccines. Over the coming weeks, the partners will negotiate details with the Government of South Africa and public and private partners inside the country and from around the world.",
          "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the full extent of the vaccine gap between developed and developing economies, and how that gap can severely undermine global health security. This landmark initiative is a major advance in the international effort to build vaccine development and manufacturing capacity that will put Africa on a path to self determination. South Africa welcomes the opportunity to host a vaccine technology transfer hub and to build on the capacity and expertise that already exists on the continent to contribute to this effort.”",
          "“This is great news, particularly for Africa, which has the least access to vaccines,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of local production to address health emergencies, strengthen regional health security and expand sustainable access to health products.”",
          "The announcement follows the recent visit to South Africa by the President of France, Mr Emmanuel Macron, who said his country was committed to supporting efforts in Africa to scale up local manufacturing capacity of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical solutions.",
          "“Today is a great day for Africa. It is also a great day for all those who work towards a more equitable access to health products. I am proud for Biovac and our South African partners to have been selected by WHO, as France has been supporting them for years,” said President Macron. “This initiative is the first of a long list to come, that we will keep supporting, with our partners, united in the belief that acting for global public goods is the fight of the century and that it cannot wait.”",
          "Technology transfer hubs are training facilities where the technology is established at industrial scale and clinical development performed. Interested manufacturers from low- and middle-income countries can receive training and any necessary licenses to the technology. WHO and partners will bring in the production know-how, quality control and necessary licenses to a single entity to facilitate a broad and rapid technology transfer to multiple recipients.",
          "The technology transfer hub will benefit from the Medicines Patent Pool’s (MPP’s) vast experience of intellectual property (IP) management and issuing of IP licenses. MPP is also assisting WHO to negotiate with technical partners and supporting in the governance of the hubs.",
          "Biovac is a bio-pharmaceutical company that is the result of a partnership formed with the South African government in 2003 to establish local vaccine manufacturing capability for the provision of vaccines for national health management and security.",
          "Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines is a biotechnology company focuses on product development, bulk adjuvant manufacturing and supply and distribution of key biologicals to address unmet healthcare needs.",
          "The organizations complement one another, and can each take on different roles within the proposed collaboration: Afrigen will act as developer, Biovac as manufacturer and a consortium of universities as academic supporters providing mRNA know-how, and Africa CDC for technical and regional support.",
          "The South African consortium benefits from having existing operating facilities that have spare capacity and because it has experience in technology transfers. It is also a global hub that can start training technology recipients immediately.",
          "Other hubs in the pipeline",
          "WHO’s April call for expressions of interest has so far generated 28 offers to either provide technology for mRNA vaccines or to host a technology hub or both. There have been 25 expressions of interest from low- and middle-income country respondents who could receive the technology to produce mRNA vaccines.",
          "Over the coming weeks, WHO will continue the rolling evaluation of other proposals and identify additional hubs, as needed, to contribute to health security and equity in all regions.",
          "Through the COVAX partnership, WHO will continue its assessment of potential mRNA technology donors and will launch subsequent calls for other technologies, such as viral vectors and proteins, in coming months.",
          "WHO is also hosting the Local production forum this week, to identify strategies to expand pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity in low- and middle-income countries for COVID-19 and other priority diseases."

The\r\nUnited Nations (UN) needs cross-border and cross-line access to reach those most in need. We call for the renewal of Security Council authorization for cross-border operations from\r\nTurkey to north-west Syria. A failure to do so would immediately stop UN delivery of food,\r\nCOVID-19 vaccines, critical medical supplies, shelter, protection, clean water and sanitation, and\r\nother life-saving assistance to 3.4 million people, including 1 million children. The UN continues engagement with all concerned parties to also allow cross-line convoys into\r\nthe north-west. They are critical for the expansion of the overall response, but even if deployed\r\nregularly they could not replicate the size and scope of the cross-border operation. There is\r\nsimply no alternative. A large-scale UN cross-border response for an additional 12 months remains essential to avert a\r\nhumanitarian catastrophe in north-west Syria.

          "Suicide remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, according to WHO’s latest estimates, published today in “Suicide worldwide in 2019”. Every year, more people die as a result of suicide than HIV, malaria or breast cancer ̶ or war and homicide. In 2019, more than 700 000 people died by suicide: one in every 100 deaths, prompting WHO to produce new guidance to help countries improve suicide prevention and care.",
          "“We cannot – and must not – ignore suicide,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “Each one is a tragedy. Our attention to suicide prevention is even more important now, after many months living with the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the risk factors for suicide   ̶   job loss, financial stress and social isolation – still very much present. The new guidance that WHO is releasing today provides a clear path for stepping up suicide prevention efforts.”",
          "Among young people aged 15-29, suicide was the fourth leading cause of death after road injury, tuberculosis and interpersonal violence.",
          "Rates vary, between countries, regions, and between males and females.",
          "More than twice as many males die due to suicide as females (12.6 per 100 000 males compared with 5.4 per 100 000 females). Suicide rates among men are generally higher in high-income countries (16.5 per 100 000). For females, the highest suicide rates are found in lower-middle-income countries (7.1 per 100 000).",
          "Suicide rates in the WHO African (11.2 per 100 000), European (10.5 per 100 000) and South-East Asia (10.2 per 100 000) regions were higher than the global average (9.0 per 100 000) in 2019. The lowest suicide rate was in the Eastern Mediterranean region (6.4 per 100 000).",
          "Globally, the suicide rate is decreasing; in the Americas it is going up",
          "Suicide rates fell in the 20 years between 2000 and 2019, with the global rate decreasing by 36%, with decreases ranging from 17% in the Eastern Mediterranean Region to 47% in the European Region and 49% in the Western Pacific.",
          "But in the Americas Region, rates increased by 17% in the same time period.",
          "Although some countries have placed suicide prevention high on their agendas, too many countries remain uncommitted. Currently only 38 countries are known to have a national suicide prevention strategy. A significant acceleration in the reduction of suicides is needed to meet the SDG target of a one-third reduction in the global suicide rate by 2030.",

          "Given that pesticide poisoning is estimated to cause 20% of all suicides, and national bans of acutely toxic, highly hazardous pesticides have shown to be cost-effective, such bans are recommended by WHO. Other measures include restricting access to firearms, reducing the size of medication packages, and installing barriers at jump sites.",
          "Responsible reporting by the media",
          "The guide highlights the role the media plays in relation to suicide. Media reports of suicide can lead to a rise in suicide due to imitation (or copycat suicides) – especially if the report is about a celebrity or describes the method of suicide.",
          "The new guide advises monitoring of the reporting of suicide and suggests that media counteract reports of suicide with stories of successful recovery from mental health challenges or suicidal thoughts. It also recommends working with social media companies to increase their awareness and improve their protocols for identifying and removing harmful content.",
          "Support for adolescents",
          "Adolescence (10-19 years of age) is a critical period for acquiring socio-emotional skills, particularly since half of mental health conditions appear before 14 years of age. The LIVE LIFE guidance encourages actions including mental health promotion and anti-bullying programmes, links to support services and clear protocols for people working in schools and universities when suicide risk is identified.",
          "Early identification and follow-up of people at risk",
          "Early identification, assessment, management and follow-up applies to people who have attempted suicide or are perceived to be at risk. A previous suicide attempt is one of the most important risk factors for a future suicide.",
          "Health-care workers should be trained in early identification, assessment, management and follow-up. Survivors’ groups of people bereaved by suicide can complement support provided by health services. Crisis services should also be available to provide immediate support to individuals in acute distress.",
          "The new guidance, which includes examples of suicide prevention interventions that have been implemented across the world, in countries such as Australia, Ghana, Guyana, India, Iraq, the Republic of Korea, Sweden and the USA, can be used by anyone who is in interested in implementing suicide prevention activities, whether at national or local level, and in the governmental and nongovernmental sectors alike.",
          "“While a comprehensive national suicide prevention strategy should be the ultimate goal for all governments,” said Dr Alexandra Fleischmann, suicide prevention expert at the World Health Organization, “starting suicide prevention with LIVE LIFE interventions can save lives and prevent the heartbreak that follows for those left behind.”"

          "“With mounting volumes of production and disposal, the world faces what one recent international forum described as a mounting “tsunami of e-waste”, putting lives and health at risk.” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"In the same way the world has rallied to protect the seas and their ecosystems from plastic and microplastic pollution, we need to rally to protect our most valuable resource –the health of our children – from the growing threat of e-waste.”",
          "As many as 12.9 million women are working in the informal waste sector, which potentially exposes them to toxic e-waste and puts them and their unborn children at risk.",
          "Meanwhile more than 18 million children and adolescents, some as young as 5 years of age, are actively engaged in the informal industrial sector, of which waste processing is a sub-sector. Children are often engaged by parents or caregivers in e-waste recycling because their small hands are more dexterous than those of adults. Other children live, go to school and play near e-waste recycling centres where high levels of toxic chemicals, mostly lead and mercury, can damage their intellectual abilities",
          "Children exposed to e-waste are particularly vulnerable to the toxic chemicals they contain due to their smaller size, less developed organs and rapid rate of growth and development. They absorb more pollutants relative to their size and are less able to metabolize or eradicate toxic substances from their bodies."

          "Globally, the majority of mental health care continues to be provided in psychiatric hospitals, and human rights abuses and coercive practices remain all too common. But providing community-based mental health care that is both respectful of human rights\r\n    and focused on recovery is proving successful and cost-effective, according to new guidance released today by the World Health Organization.",
          "Mental health care recommended in the new guidance should be located in the community and should not only encompass mental health care but also support for day-to-day living, such as facilitating access to accommodation and links with education and employment\r\n    services.",
          "WHO’s new “Guidance on community mental health services: promoting person-centred and rights-based approaches” further affirms that mental health care must be grounded in a human rights-based approach, as recommended by the WHO Comprehensive\r\n    Mental Health Action Plan 2020-2030 endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2021.",
          "Much faster transition to redesigned mental health services required",
          "“This comprehensive new guidance provides a strong argument for a much faster transition from mental health services that use coercion and focus almost exclusively on the use of medication to manage symptoms of mental health conditions, to a more\r\n    holistic approach that takes into account the specific circumstances and wishes of the individual and offers a variety of approaches for treatment and support,” said Dr Michelle Funk of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Use, who\r\n    led the development of the guidance.",
          "Since the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2006, an increasing number of countries have sought to reform their laws, policies and services related to mental health care. However, to date, few countries\r\n    have established the frameworks necessary to meet the far-reaching changes required by international human rights standards. Reports from around the world highlight that severe human rights abuses and coercive practices are still far too common in\r\n    countries of all income levels. Examples include forced admission and forced treatment; manual, physical and chemical restraint; unsanitary living conditions; and physical and verbal abuse.",
          "The majority of government mental health budgets still goes to psychiatric hospitals",
          "According to WHO’s latest estimates, governments spend less than 2% of their health budgets on mental health. Furthermore, the majority of reported expenditure on mental health is allocated to psychiatric hospitals, except in high-income countries\r\n    where the figure is around 43%.",
          "The new guidance, which is intended primarily for people with responsibility for organizing and managing mental health care, presents details of what is required in areas such as mental health law, policy and strategy, service delivery, financing, workforce\r\n    development and civil society participation in order for mental health services to be compliant with the CRPD.",
          "It includes examples from countries including Brazil, India, Kenya, Myanmar, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom of community-based mental health services that have demonstrated good practices in respect of non-coercive practices, community inclusion, and\r\n    respect of people’s legal capacity (i.e. the right to make decisions about their treatment and life).",
          "Services include crisis support, mental health services provided within general hospitals, outreach services, supported living approaches and support provided by peer groups. Information about financing and results of evaluations of the services presented\r\n    are included. Cost comparisons provided indicate that the community-based services showcased produce good outcomes, are preferred by service users and can be provided at comparable cost to mainstream mental health services.",
          "“Transformation of mental health service provision must, however, be accompanied by significant changes in the social sector,” said Gerard Quinn, UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. “Until that happens,\r\n    the discrimination that prevents people with mental health conditions from leading full and productive lives will continue.”"

          "Today, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) will launch the Polio Eradication Strategy 2022-2026: Delivering on a Promise at a virtual event,\r\n    to overcome the remaining challenges to ending polio, including setbacks caused by COVID-19. While polio cases have fallen 99.9% since 1988, polio remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and persistent barriers to reaching\r\n    every child with polio vaccines and the pandemic have contributed to an increase in polio cases. Last year, 1226 cases of all forms of polio were recorded compared to 138 in 2018.",
          "In 2020, the GPEI paused polio door-to-door campaigns for four months to protect communities from the spread of COVID-19 and contributed up to 30,000 programme staff and over $100 million in polio resources to support pandemic response in almost 50 countries.",
          "Leaders from the two countries yet to interrupt wild polio transmission—Pakistan and Afghanistan—called for renewed global solidarity and the continued resources necessary to eradicate this vaccine-preventable disease. They committed to strengthening\r\n    their partnership with GPEI to improve vaccination campaigns and engagement with communities at high risk of polio.",
          "Dr Faisal Sultan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister of Pakistan on Health , said, “We are already hard at work with our GPEI partners to address the final barriers to ending polio in Pakistan, particularly through strengthening\r\n    vaccination campaigns and our engagement with high-risk communities. Eradication remains a top health priority and Pakistan is committed to fully implementing the new GPEI strategy. We look forward to working with international partners to achieve\r\n    a polio-free world.”",

              "implementing innovative new tools , such as digital payments to frontline health workers, to further improve the impact and efficiency of polio campaigns."
            ]
          },
          "“With this new Strategy, the GPEI has clearly outlined how to overcome the final barriers to securing a polio-free world and improve the health and wellbeing of communities for generations to come,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization and\r\n member of the Polio Oversight Board. “But to succeed, we urgently need renewed political and financial commitments from governments and donors. Polio eradication is at a pivotal moment. It is important we capitalise on the momentum of the new\r\n    Strategy and make history together by ending this disease.”",
          "Dr Wahid Majrooh, Acting Minister of Public Health for Afghanistan , said, “Afghanistan is fully committed to implementing the new GPEI strategic plan and eradicating polio from its borders. Together we have come so far. Let us take\r\n    this final step together and make the dream of a polio-free world a reality.”",
          "In addition to eradicating wild polio, GPEI will strengthen efforts to stop outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) that continue to spread in under-immunized communities across Africa and Asia. This includes deploying proven tactics\r\n    used against wild polio, improving outbreak response and streamlining management through the launch of new global and regional rapid response teams and broadening the use of a promising new tool – novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) – to combat type 2 cVDPVs, the most prominent variant.",
          "H.E. Félix Tshisekedi, President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , said “As Chair of the African Union, I call on every government to increase their commitment to protecting the gains of our monumental efforts and\r\n    finishing the job against polio in Africa. Only then, we will be able to say we delivered on our promise of a safer, healthier future for all our children.”",
          "Select countries began using nOPV2 in March of this year after WHO issued an Emergency Use Listing recommendation for the vaccine last November. Clinical trials have shown that nOPV2 is safe and effective against type 2 polio, while having the potential\r\n    to stop cVDPV2 outbreaks in a more sustainable way compared to the existing type 2 oral polio vaccine.",
          "In addition to supporting the COVID-19 response, polio assets and infrastructure have historically helped tackle the emergence of health crises in several countries around the world, including the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria in 2014. Without the support\r\n    needed for the new GPEI Strategy, there is a risk not only that polio could resurge, but also that countries will be more vulnerable to future health threats.",
          "Additional quotes:",
          "Henrietta Fore, Executive Director, UNICEF: “ We will not allow the fight against one deadly disease to cause us to lose ground in the fight against polio and other childhood diseases. Renewed government and donor\r\n    support will enable us to reach and immunize over 400 million children against polio every year and ensure that no family has to live with the fear of their child being paralyzed by this deadly disease ever again.”",
          "Rochelle P. Walensky, MD, MPH, Director, CDC : “As the GPEI’s support for the COVID-19 response shows, polio infrastructure is vital to helping countries tackle emerging health threats. The U.S. CDC is committed\r\n    to achieving polio eradication and delivering, through the GPEI’s new strategy, on the promise we made to protect the world’s children. To improve health equity, we must ensure that polio assets are secured and that countries are increasing\r\n    their immunization coverage through integrated service delivery and demand for vaccines.”",
          "Seth Berkley, CEO, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance: “ Polio eradication is possible and essential. Through the increased integration of polio activities with essential immunization and health services, including our joint work to extend\r\n    the health system to reach “zero-dose” children and missed communities with all routine vaccines, we believe that we can better meet the needs of high-risk communities and secure a polio-free world together.”",
          "Mike McGovern, Chair, Rotary’s International PolioPlus Committee: “ More than 19 million people are walking today who would have otherwise been paralysed by polio, thanks to the incredible progress we’ve made in protecting\r\n    children with polio vaccines since 1988. When Rotary helped found the GPEI, we made a commitment to ensure that no child or family should live in fear of polio ever again. We are committed to delivering on this promise and urge governments and donors\r\n    to help us achieve a polio-free world.”",
          "Chris Elias, President, Global Development, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: “After setbacks in recent years, and indications that some donors may reduce funding to the GPEI, there has never been a more important moment than\r\n    right now in the history of polio eradication. With adequate support for the new strategy, we can secure a world where no child will be paralyzed by polio ever again and we urge all donors to stay committed and consign this disease to history.”",

          "On the occasion of World Environment Day 2021, WHO has joined the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration , a partnership aimed at preventing, halting and reversing the degradation of our ecosystems and the diversity of life they sustain. WHO has joined the partnership as a collaborating agency, along with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and a large number of partners. Ecosystem restoration can significantly contribute to supporting health and well-being by helping to regulate infectious diseases, supporting food and nutrition security, and contributing to climate mitigation and adaptation. Restoration also reduces the risk of disasters, while supporting livelihoods and healthy societies. Safeguarding and restoring ecosystems globally will contribute to long-term social wellbeing and ecological resilience, while boosting green recovery efforts from the pandemic. Last year, WHO launched a Manifesto for a Healthy and Green Recovery from COVID-19 , outlining six prescriptions essential to a healthier, greener and more equitable future. The first of these prescriptions recognizes that nature needs to be protected and preserved as the source of human health. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration is part of a series of collaborative efforts led by WHO that seek to strengthen cross-sectoral collaboration and engagement at the human, animal, plant and ecosystem interface, also known as One Health. Among other recent efforts, last week WHO also held its first inaugural meeting of the newly established Expert Working Group on Biodiversity, Climate, One Health and Nature-based Solutions (EWG), concurrently with the 74th World Health Assembly. The working group aims to develop policies and recommendations that promote a healthy recovery, help prevent future health risks associated with ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss and climate change, and chart a common path toward the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). WHO will host an online #GenerationRestoration event in July 2021, in collaboration with key partners and stakeholders. The event will provide insights in how to mainstream health in Nature-based Solutions, with a focus on the numerous co-benefits ecosystem restoration can provide in our journey toward a healthier, more sustainable future for all. For further details or to express your interest in joining the #GenerationRestoration event in July, please contact Cristina Romanelli .

          "“The world desperately needs multiple COVID-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,” said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products. “We urge manufacturers to participate in the COVAX Facility, share their knowhow and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control.”",
          "WHO’s Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply and international procurement. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.",
          "The EUL assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements. The assessment is performed by the product evaluation group, composed by regulatory experts from around the world and a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), in charge of performing the risk-benefit assessment for an independent recommendation on whether a vaccine can be listed for emergency use and, if so, under which conditions.",
          "In the case of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, the WHO assessment included on-site inspections of the production facility.",
          "The Sinovac-CoronaVac product is an inactivated vaccine. Its easy storage requirements make it very manageable and particularly suitable for low-resource settings.",
          "WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has also completed its review of the vaccine. On the basis of available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks. Vaccine efficacy results showed that the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of those vaccinated and prevented severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in 100% of the studied population.",
          "Few older adults (over 60 years) were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age group. Nevertheless, WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because data collected during subsequent use in multiple countries and supportive immunogenicity data suggest the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons. There is no reason to believe that the vaccine has a different safety profile in older and younger populations. WHO recommends that countries using the vaccine in older age groups conduct safety and effectiveness monitoring to verify the expected impact and contribute to making the recommendation more robust for all countries."

The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency, while adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks.",
          "The EUL pathway involves a rigorous assessment of late phase II and phase III clinical trial data as well as substantial additional data on safety, efficacy, quality and a risk management plan with a focus on low- and middle-income country needs. These data are reviewed by independent experts and WHO teams who consider the current body of evidence on the vaccine under consideration, the plans for monitoring its use, and plans for further studies.",
          "As part of the EUL process, the company producing the vaccine must commit to continue to generate data to enable full licensure and WHO prequalification of the vaccine. The WHO prequalification process will assess additional clinical data generated from vaccine trials and deployment on a rolling basis to ensure the vaccine meets the necessary standards of quality, safety and efficacy for broader availability."

SAGE is policy oriented, assessing safety, efficacy, public health impact, and programmatic feasibility. Policy recommendations for a vaccine are generally made only for those products that have been listed or authorized for use.",

          "Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have transformed malaria control, enabling better targeting of treatment and improved surveillance. Globally, 2.7 billion RDTs for malaria were sold between 2010–2019, the majority distributed in Sub-Saharan\r\n    Africa to diagnose P. falciparum (Pf) infection by targeting one of its antigens, histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2). This current cornerstone of P. falciparum diagnosis is under serious threat as a result of the emergence of parasites\r\n    not expressing the HRP2 protein due to mutations in the genes that encode it. Consequently, HPR2-based RDTs are unable to detect infections with such parasites, putting patients at risk of misdiagnosis, significant morbidity and potentially death.\r\n    These gene deletions were first reported a decade ago in Peru and were subsequently found in neighbouring countries. This lead to a reversion to microscopy as the primary diagnostic tool in this region. Over the past 6 years, an increasing number\r\n    of African and Asian countries where diagnosis is heavily reliant on HRP2-based RDTs have reported histidine-rich protein 2 and 3 gene ( pfhrp2/3 ) deletions, raising the threat to a new level.",
          "In response, WHO issued in 2017 information notes on: the implications for case management; the procedures for investigating suspected false-negative RDT results due to pfhrp2/3 gene deletions; the criteria for RDT change (see note); and subsequently\r\n    in 2019 released a response plan to pfhrp2 gene deletions; and has made available surveillance protocols . An interactive web-based interface for tracking all published reports of pfhrp2/3 deletions is available on WHO Malaria Threats Map .",
          "The Horn of Africa appears to be disproportionately affected, with high prevalence of pfhrp2/3 deletions reported in areas of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti and to a lesser extent in Sudan and South Sudan; the root cause of many false negative RDT\r\n    results are currently under investigation in Somalia. Recent surveys in the Horn of Africa region found that many (> 50%) P. falciparum cases are missed by HRP2 RDTs.  Failure to detect and treat infection can result in increased\r\n    disease, including severe disease and death.",
          "The Malaria Policy Advisory Group (MPAG) reviewed available information during its April 2021 meeting and called for urgent action in addressing the increased prevalence of pfhrp2 gene deletions in all endemic countries and most expeditiously\r\n    in the Horn of Africa. Although alternate diagnostic choices are limited , some non-HRP2 based rapid tests options, approved through the Global Fund Expert Review Panel for Diagnostics (see here ) are available. MPAG emphasized that it is imperative that all countries start\r\n    and maintain surveillance and respond when the prevalence of pfhrp2/3 gene deletions exceeds the WHO criteria for RDT replacement by changing to quality-assured non-HRP2 RDTs to prevent unnecessary morbidity and deaths and to safeguard inroads\r\n    that have been made towards malaria elimination particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.",

          "WHO recommends that a ≥  5% local prevalence of pfhrp2/3 deletions causing false-negative HRP2 RDTs warrants an immediate change in testing strategy  and preparation for nationwide change. This cut-off was selected because\r\n    it is at about that level that public health gains will be obtained in changing from HRP2 detecting RDTs to those targeting non-HRP2 antigens i.e. pLDH antigens. At this threshold the proportion of cases missed by less sensitive non-HRP2-based tests\r\n    are likely to be lower than those associated with continued use of HRP2-based tests. Based on modelling and repeat surveys for pfhrp2/3 deletions over time it is expected that strains carrying pfhrp2/3 deletion mutations will continue\r\n    to expand and spread."

          "The single most important priority of the global community is to stop the COVID-19 pandemic in its tracks, to halt its rapid transmission and reverse the trend of consequential global distress. We know that this goal is only achievable when everyone,\r\n        everywhere can access the health technologies they need for COVID-19 detection, prevention, treatment and response. This pandemic is far from over, socio-economic inequalities have dramatically increased and lives continue to be lost. Now more\r\n        than ever, international cooperation and solidarity are vital to restoring global security, today and for the future.",
          "The world has committed to ensuring universal and equitable access to safe, efficacious and affordable vaccines, medicines and diagnostics. We are witness to great strides in scientific progress yet a failure to mass produce and share these critical\r\n        tools will prolong the pandemic, laying the ground for dangerous new variants to emerge and undermine progress made. During such an unprecedented time, we must deploy and use every tool at our disposal to fight this pandemic and save lives. One\r\n        year ago, Costa Rica and the World Health Organization (WHO), with support from 41 Member States, launched the Solidarity Call to Action and the WHO COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) to improve equitable global access to COVID-19 health\r\n        technologies through voluntarily pooling knowledge, intellectual property and data to support technology transfer and rapidly expand manufacturing throughout the world in need.",
          "The Solidarity Call to Action calls on key stakeholders and the global community to commit to undertaking specific actions to advance the pooling of knowledge, intellectual property and data for key technologies for the detection, prevention and treatment\r\n        of COVID-19. We called on funders, researchers, governments, and holders of IP and knowledge to support the WHO COVID-19 Technology Access Pool initiative and its relevant implementing partner organizations, in particular through the sharing of\r\n        intellectual property in a transparent and non-exclusive manner and facilitating technology transfer to multiple quality assured manufacturers. C­TAP generates worldwide interest as a highly promising initiative; it works inside the patent\r\n        system and provides a win-win solution for all, beneficiaries and owners of knowledge. Yet, it remains an underutilized tool.",
          "As a global community we must leverage C-TAP's potential to accommodate different stakeholders\r\n        and provide timely, sustainable, and effective solutions to promote access and accelerate local production. That is why we call once again on all Member States to renew and expand our collective commitment in the Solidarity Call to Action and\r\n        to pro-actively engage with key stakeholders in their territories and encourage IP sharing and technology transfer through C-TAP. It is our responsibility to ensure a safer world for all, for this generation and for those to come.

          "It also recommends a shift from the traditional curative approach towards a preventive approach that includes promotion of oral health within the family, schools and workplaces, and includes timely, comprehensive and inclusive care within the primary health-care system. Delegates agreed that oral health should be firmly embedded within the noncommunicable disease agenda and that oral health-care interventions should be included in universal health coverage programmes.",

Most oral diseases have been linked with other noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, pneumonia, obesity and premature birth. One major problem is that oral health is not covered by many universal health coverage packages.",

An estimated 100 million people have moderate-to-severe\r\n    distance vision impairment or blindness that could be corrected through access to cataract surgery.",
          "These figures are expected to increase since presbyopia and cataract development are an inevitable part of ageing, while projected increases in myopia in the younger population will be driven largely by lifestyle factors such as reduced time spent outdoors\r\n    and greater time spent on intensive near vision activity.",

          "At no point in this pandemic have we seen such an acute need to look to the future challenges and not rest on the patchy achievements made so far.",
          "We are seeing the traumatic effects of the terrible surge of COVID-19 in South Asia – a surge which has also severely impacted global vaccine supplies.",
          "We are also witnessing why access to vaccines before a surge occurs is so important. For that reason, we must focus on ensuring countries who have not benefitted from these life-saving tools do so now, and with urgency.",
          "As the global mechanism for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, COVAX has proven it works. Designed and implemented in the midst of an unprecedented global public health crisis, it has delivered over 70 million doses to 126 countries and economies\r\n    around the world since February – from remote islands to conflict settings – managing the largest and most complex rollout of vaccines in history. Over 35 countries received their first COVID-19 vaccine doses thanks to COVAX.",
          "However, the terrible surge of the virus in India has had a severe impact on COVAX’s supply in the second quarter of this year, to the point where, by the end of June we will face a shortfall of 190 million doses.",
          "Even though COVAX will have larger volumes available later in the year through the deals it has already secured with several manufacturers, if we do not address the current, urgent shortfall the consequences could be catastrophic.",
          "But we can meet this challenge with concerted action and global leadership.",
          "Millions of dollars and doses were committed to COVAX on 21 May, bringing the total of doses pledged so far to more than 150 million. At the World Health Assembly, governments have been united in recognising the political and financial urgency of supporting\r\n    COVAX with doses and dollars. It is now imperative to build on this momentum to secure full funding for COVAX and more vaccines – right now – for lower income countries at the Advance Market\r\n    Commitment Summit on 2 June.",
          "If the world’s leaders rally together, the original COVAX objectives – delivery of 2 billion doses of vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.8 billion doses to 92 lower income economies by early 2022 are still well within reach.",
          "But it will require governments and the private sector to urgently unlock new sources of doses, with deliveries starting in June, and funding so we can deliver. COVAX has the infrastructure in place to facilitate and coordinate this complex global effort.",

Thanks to the generosity of its donors, the AMC has already secured 1.3 billion doses for delivery in 2021.\r\n        This is enough to protect the most at-risk population groups: health workers, the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. We need an additional $2 billion to lift coverage in AMC countries up to nearly 30%, and we need it by June 2 to lock in supplies now so that doses can be delivered through 2021, and into early 2022.",
              "Share doses, now. The pandemic has just taken a frightening new turn, as a deadly surge of cases rages across South Asia and other hotspots. Countries with the largest supplies should redirect doses to COVAX now, to have maximum impact. We are starting to see countries stepping forward with doses, with the United States and Europe collectively pledging to share 180 million doses. But we still need more, we need them to go through COVAX, and we need them to start moving in early\r\n            June. At least one billion doses could be shared by wealthy countries in 2021. COVAX’s need for doses is greatest right now. Countries with higher coverage rates, which are due to receive doses soon should swap their places in supply queues with COVAX so that doses can be equitably distributed as quickly as possible.",

By donating vaccines to COVAX alongside domestic vaccination programmes, the most at-risk populations can be protected globally, which is instrumental\r\n    to ending the acute phase of the pandemic, curbing the rise and threat of variants, and accelerating a return to normality.",
          "COVAX is hugely appreciative to France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden and the UAE for their initial commitments to donate doses through COVAX, and to Canada for funding to support the design and operationalization of\r\n    the COVAX dose sharing mechanism. We also welcome announcements by the USA, Norway, Croatia, Romania, Australia and Portugal to donate doses to countries in need and we put COVAX forward as the proven mechanism for global, rapid and\r\n    equitable distribution to facilitate this.",
          "Since COVAX was established in mid-2020, it has had the support and resources of 192 of the world’s economies. This tremendous vote of confidence has enabled us to demonstrate our ability to deliver an unprecedented global rollout. It’s time\r\n    to finish the job.",

As part of this work, Gavi supports\r\n    governments and partners on ensuring country readiness, providing funding and oversight of UNICEF procurement of vaccines as well as partners’ and governments work on readiness and delivery.

It provides\r\n    global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination. WHO leads, together with UNICEF, the Country Readiness and Delivery workstream , which provides support to countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines.\r\n    Along with Gavi and numerous other partners working at the global, regional, and country-level, the CRD workstream provides tools, guidance, monitoring, and on the ground technical assistance for the planning and roll-out of the vaccines . Along with COVAX partners, WHO has developed a no-fault compensation scheme as\r\n part of the time-limited indemnification and liability commitments",
          "UNICEF’s role in COVAX",
          "UNICEF is leveraging its experience as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world and working with manufacturers and partners on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as freight, logistics and storage. UNICEF already procures more than\r\n    2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. In collaboration with the PAHO Revolving Fund ,\r\n UNICEF is leading efforts to procure and supply doses of COVID-19\r\n    vaccines for COVAX. In addition, UNICEF, Gavi and WHO are working with governments around the clock to ensure that countries are ready to receive the vaccines, with appropriate cold chain equipment in place and health workers trained to dispense them.\r\n    UNICEF is also playing a lead role in efforts to foster trust in vaccines, delivering vaccine confidence communications and tracking and addressing misinformation around the world.",
          "About ACT-Accelerator",
          "The Access to COVID-19 Tools ACT-Accelerator, is a new, ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. It was set up in response to a call from G20 leaders\r\n    in March and launched by the WHO, European Commission, France and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in April 2020.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator is not a decision-making body or a new organisation, but works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organisations to end the pandemic. It is a framework for collaboration that has been designed to bring key players around\r\n    the table with the goal of ending the pandemic as quickly as possible through the accelerated development, equitable allocation, and scaled up delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines, thereby protecting health systems and restoring societies and\r\n    economies in the near term. It draws on the experience of leading global health organisations which are tackling the world’s toughest health challenges, and who, by working together, are able to unlock new and more ambitious results against\r\n    COVID-19. Its members share a commitment to ensure all people have access to all the tools needed to defeat COVID-19 and to work with unprecedented levels of partnership to achieve it.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator has four areas of work: diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines and the health system connector. Cross-cutting all of these is the workstream on Access & Allocation."

          "More than 3.5 billion people suffer from oral diseases. Untreated dental caries (tooth decay) in permanent teeth is the most common. Severe periodontal (gum) disease affects almost 10% of the global population and more than 530 million children suffer from dental caries of primary teeth. Oral diseases disproportionally affect the poor and socially-disadvantaged populations. Most oral diseases have been linked with other noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, pneumonia, obesity and premature birth.",
          "Most oral health conditions are largely preventable and can be treated in their early stages but  treatment is often not affordable as usually not part of universal health coverage packages. The use of fluoride, which can substantially reduce the risk of dental caries, remains inaccessible in many parts of the world.",
          "The World Health Assembly approved today a historic Resolution on oral health. The Resolution urges Member States to address key risk factors of oral diseases shared with other noncommunicable diseases  such as high intake of free sugars, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol, and to enhance the capacities of oral health professionals. It also recommends a shift from the traditional curative approach towards a preventive approach that includes promotion of oral health within the family, schools and workplaces, and includes timely, comprehensive and inclusive care within the primary health-care system. During the discussion, clear agreement emerged that oral health should be firmly embedded within the noncommunicable disease agenda and that oral health-care interventions should be included in universal health coverage programmes.",
          "The World Health Assembly delegates asked WHO: to develop, by 2022, a draft global strategy on tackling oral diseases for consideration by WHO governing bodies in 2022 and  by 2023; to translate the global strategy into an action plan for oral health; to develop “best buy” interventions on oral health; and to explore the inclusion of noma (a disease which is fatal for 90% of children affected) within the roadmap for neglected tropical diseases 2021-2030.",

          "More than 420 million people are living with diabetes, a number that is expected to rise to 578 million by 2030. One in two adults living with diabetes type 2 are undiagnosed. Globally, 100 years after the discovery of insulin, half of the people with type 2 diabetes who need insulin are not receiving it. Between 2000 and 2016, there was a 5% increase in premature mortality from diabetes. By contrast, during the same period, there was a decrease in premature mortality for all other main noncommunicable diseases. In addition, people living with diabetes have a higher risk of becoming severely ill and dying from COVID-19. The Resolution agreed by the World Health Assembly today urges Member States to raise the priority given to the prevention, diagnosis and control of diabetes as well as prevention and management of risk factors such as obesity. It recommends action in a number of areas including: the development of pathways for achieving targets for the prevention and control of diabetes, including access to insulin; the promotion of convergence and harmonization of regulatory requirements for insulin and other medicines and health products for the treatment of diabetes; and assessment of the feasibility and potential value of establishing a web-based tool to share information relevant to the transparency of markets for diabetes medicines and health products. Delegates at the Assembly requested WHO to develop recommendations and provide support for strengthening diabetes monitoring and surveillance within national noncommunicable disease programmes and to consider potential targets. WHO was also asked to make recommendations on the prevention and management of obesity. All recommendations are to be submitted to the World Health Assembly for consideration in 2022. WHO was requested to provide guidance to Member States on the design and implementation of policies for diabetes prevention and control and to develop recommendations for adequate, predictable and sustained financing of diabetes prevention and control. Delegates asked WHO to submit a report on the implementation of the Resolution to the Health Assembly through the Executive Board, on an annual basis and as a component on the report on noncommunicable diseases, from 2022 to 2031.

          "The COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) is reviewing reports of a small number of cases of myocarditis reported in individuals vaccinated with the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. The subcommittee noted that in most of the reported cases, the individuals have recovered. The subcommittee is soliciting and monitoring for additional information to assess for any relationship to COVID-19 vaccination.",
          "Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is an inflammation of the lining that surrounds the heart. While it can cause serious illness, it is frequently mild and responds well to conservative treatment.",
          "On May 17, the  US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group concluded that  there are few reports of myocarditis to date and that these cases  seem to occur predominantly in adolescents and young adults, more often in males than females, more often after the second dose of the vaccine, and typically within 4 days after vaccination [1] . Most cases appeared to be mild and follow up is ongoing.",
          "The GACVS subcommittee noted that most of the information received so far is based on spontaneous, passive reporting. More rigorous studies using alternative data sources and more robust study designs including comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations are needed to assess a potential causal association between the event and the vaccine. Some countries, such as Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States have embarked upon such studies. The GACVS subcommittee will review further as more data become available. The subcommittee also underscored the importance of having a harmonized case definition. A draft case definition for myocarditis has been developed recently by the Brighton Collaboration [2] .",
          "While acknowledging the clear benefits of the mRNA vaccines in reducing deaths and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 infections, the subcommittee encourages all health professionals to report all events of myocarditis and other adverse events observed with these and other vaccines. The WHO COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance manual provides guidance to countries on the safety monitoring and adverse events data sharing for the new COVID-19 vaccines [3] .",
          "The GACVS COVID-19 subcommittee will continue to review the safety data from all COVID-19 vaccines and update any advice as necessary. Open, transparent, and evidence-based communication about the potential benefits and risks to recipients and the community is essential to maintain trust. WHO is carefully monitoring the rollout of all COVID-19 vaccines and will continue to work closely with countries to manage potential risks, and to use science and data to drive response and recommendations.",

On behalf of the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee for the WHO Health Emergencies Programme - IOAC, I thank you for inviting us to present our report to this 74th session of the World Health Assembly. In presenting the report, we wish to pay tribute to all those working tirelessly across the world to bring the ongoing pandemic under control, and to those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19.",
          "2.\tSince the inception of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme (the “WHE Programme”) in 2016, IOAC has provided oversight and advised the Director-General, under the terms of its mandate. For the purposes of this, its ninth report to the governing bodies, IOAC has aligned its oversight of the Organization’s response to COVID-19, with the terms of resolution WHA73.1. The Committee concentrated its review on WHO’s leadership in the global response to COVID-19, on the Secretariat’s work to support country preparedness and response, and it also examined the WHE Programme’s role and responsibilities as the major component of the Organization’s response to COVID-19.",
          "3.\tIn keeping with the IOAC mandate to provide oversight on WHO’s work in outbreaks and emergencies, the Committee also assessed annual progress in WHO health emergency management, the transformation agenda and WHE programmatic areas, measuring it against the key performance indicators in our monitoring framework. An updated list of IOAC recommendations, and a summary of progress from May 2016 through to the end of April 2021, has been published on the IOAC website.",
          "Overall, the IOAC is satisfied with the achievements made, and impressed by the Secretariat’s continuous efforts to implement the IOAC recommendations. IOAC recognizes that Dr Tedros is committed to implementing our recommendations. Indeed, some of the recommendations issued in this report, are already being implemented as we speak.",
          "4.\tWith regards to WHO’s ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic, IOAC notes that the crisis has exposed failings in pandemic preparedness and response, and a shortfall in health security and equality across the world. But at the same time, there have been numerous examples of global solidarity and collaboration, together with remarkable progress in research and development. Despite the challenges faced, the report concludes that WHO has maintained, and indeed strengthened, its leadership position in the global response throughout the pandemic.",
          "5.\tIOAC considers the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator to be an example of an unprecedented level of global collaboration and coordination, but, also notes that its implementation has been hampered by insufficient political will and global solidarity, limited production capacity of vaccines, and inadequate funding. We reiterate that the political and financial commitment of Member States is fundamental to fully achieving the potential of the ACT-Accelerator. The Committee is also concerned about the lack of a global plan to operationalize the tools provided by the Accelerator, so as to maximize their scope and impact. Hence, our key recommendations include that: WHO should support Member States in developing a global strategy to roll out the ACT-Accelerator for operationalizing tools and maximizing impact with a public health approach, and should seek to ensure fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines; The WHO Secretariat should support Member States to fully implement all the public health measures, and strengthen surveillance, monitoring and testing efforts, in the light of the new variants of the virus; the international community should address supply chain constraints to ensure the equitable distribution of COVAX doses and should guarantee investment, with a view to reducing the socioeconomic impacts of the global pandemic.",
          "6.\tThe COVID-19 pandemic has revealed shortcomings in the International Health Regulations, 2005 and highlighted the primary role of Member States in preparing for, and responding to, outbreaks and emergencies. We had very useful meetings with the IHR Review Committee members before beginning our drafting, and our report endorses many of the IHR Review Committee’s recommendations. For example, the establishment of a national legal framework to ensure implementation of the IHR and public health control measures; the introduction of a mechanism to foster accountability of the whole of government; strengthening risk assessment; monitoring and data reporting and information sharing; empowering the role of national focal points; improving transparency; communication of temporary recommendations before a public health emergency of international concern is declared; and enhancing the WHO Secretariat’s ability to fulfil its role through sustainable financing.",
          "7.\tHowever, the IOAC continues to be concerned that the broad binary nature of the PHEIC mechanism does not provide a sufficient or actionable indication to Member States of the nature or severity of epidemic or pandemic risks. Whether through the PHEIC or some other related process, it is crucial that WHO work with Member States, to improve and clarify risk assessments, corresponding alerts, and empower IHR national focal points to take informed action. The IOAC further emphasizes that temporary recommendations issued by Emergency Committees must be tied to a set of concrete actions and response measures. Moreover, Member States should be held accountable, through an appropriate mechanism, for implementing recommendations in health crisis preparedness, readiness and response.",
          "8.\tWe reiterate our previous recommendation, that the Secretariat should further streamline the reporting process and review the existing tools and framework for national and international preparedness, including joint external evaluations, and national action plans.",
          "9.\tWith regards to travel advice, IOAC recommends that the role and impacts of travel restrictions and other border measures, as well as the international coordination of such measures, should be reviewed in preparation for the next pandemic.",
          "10.\tIOAC welcomes all efforts towards preparing for future pandemic threat, hence recognizes the call to establish a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response under the auspices of WHO. Noting that any decision regarding such a treaty is Member States’ prerogative, the Committee suggests that the treaty should support Member States to comply with the IHR; build national, regional and global resilience for pandemic responses; mobilize financial resources collectively; and ensure universal access to diagnostics, treatments and vaccines for future pandemics, based on the principles of solidarity, equity, accountability and transparency.",
          "11.\tWHO’s leadership role for health emergencies within the United Nations system has been strengthened through the COVID-19 pandemic, at both the global and field levels. IOAC notes that the role of WHO country offices has become increasingly important and recommends empowering WHO representatives to lead the public health response to COVID-19 at country level, as a part of the United Nations system.",
          "12.\tFindings from the IOAC survey with WHO representatives confirm that the establishment of the WHE Programme has resulted in increasing WHO country offices’ ability to manage health emergencies, but the HR capacity remains weak. The IOAC observes that the human resources planning for the WHE Programme has never been fully implemented, mainly due to insufficient funding. IOAC recommends that the WHE Programme country business model be revised and adjusted to country-specific requirements with priority on fragile states, in line with the regional human resources plan. IOAC reiterates the principle of the single human resources plan for the WHE Programme, which should be under the responsibility of the Programme’s Executive Director.",
          "13.\tThe WHE Programme has suffered from chronic financial and staffing constraints since its establishment. In response to the global pandemic, under the leadership of the Director-General, the WHO Secretariat has managed to surge capacity, by leveraging the whole Organization. IOAC recognizes that the Organization-wide response to COVID-19 is coordinated through the WHE Programme’s incident management team, which is overstretched. The Committee consequently recommends that WHO review the current structure of, and vision for, the Incident Management System to ensure it has adequate capacity, resilience and sustainability. The Committee observes that the core science and guidance related to COVID-19 is managed within the Incident Management Team by the WHE Programme technical teams, in close collaboration with partners. We therefore recommend that WHO further strengthen core technical expertise capacity, by ensuring adequate staffing within the WHE Programme at headquarters level, while further strengthening collaboration with expert groups and expanding partnerships.",
          "14.\tWHO’s external communications have significantly improved throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and important progress has been noted in risk communication. The WHO Secretariat is encouraged to build up momentum, accelerating the implementation of a corporate communication strategy, and making an increased and sustained investment in communications. While recognizing that WHO has become the most-followed United Nations agency on social media, IOAC is deeply concerned by the high level of toxicity and incivility on social media against WHO and its personnel. The Committee strongly condemns personal attacks against the Director-General and WHO staff members, and, recommends that WHO build capacity to deploy proactive countermeasures against misinformation and social media attacks, and further invests in risk communication as an essential component of epidemic management.",
          "15.\tIOAC observes that expectations of WHO’s role have increased hugely since 2016, as has the scope of the Organization’s work in both acute outbreaks and humanitarian crises. The WHE Programme has been at the heart of WHO’s response to COVID-19 whilst also leading front-line emergency operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Guinea in response to the Ebola virus disease outbreaks, and concurrently managing 65 graded emergencies over the 2020–2021 period.",
          "16.\tIOAC is pleased to see the important progress made over the past two years in updating the current version of the Emergency Response Framework (ERF). The ERF proposes a revised accountability for the grading process and Incident Management System, with clearer roles and responsibilities for the Director-General, the regional directors, the WHE Executive Director, the regional emergency directors, WHO representatives and incident managers in managing WHO graded emergencies.",
          "We also welcome the proposed integration of checklists for security, prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, vaccine-preventable diseases and Contingency Fund for Emergencies, and, a framework for protracted emergencies in the updated version of the ERF. We urge the Global Policy Group to institutionalize the implementation of the managerial authorities, accountabilities and processes that have already been agreed, and to adopt the updated version of the Emergency Response Framework.",
          "17.\tWhile the WHE Programme is not a stand-alone entity, and its success depends on operational support systems and other programmes, the IOAC reiterates that the WHE Programme’s managerial authority and autonomy must be protected. The Committee commends Dr Tedros for his commitment to ensuring the agility, flexibility and effectiveness of the WHE Programme by implementing the IOAC recommendation, to establish dedicated teams within the centralized functional divisions such as communications, HR, procurement, resource mobilization and security, to support emergencies, with a dual reporting line to the WHE Programme and respective division heads. The Committee is also pleased to report that a number of specific recommendations related to WHO security management, issued in this report are already being implemented and will come into effect shortly.",
          "18.\tAs WHO’s emergency operations have been increasing in remote field contexts, the inherent risks have significantly increased and diversified over the years. Regarding the disturbing allegations of sexual exploitation, connected to the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the IOAC expresses its concern at the slow progress of the fact-finding process. We urge WHO to immediately implement preventive and response measures in areas that are potentially high-risk for sexual exploitation and abuse. The IOAC recommends that WHO conduct a cross-Organization review of the current tools, structures, processes and coordination mechanisms to prevent, mitigate and manage all potential risks linked to emergency operations for both staff and communities.",
          "19.\tThe COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to questions regarding the adequacy of the WHE Programme budget and WHO financing. The IOAC welcomes Member States’ commitment to, and ongoing discussions on, WHO finance. IOAC commends Member States’ leadership for establishing a working group on sustainable financing. IOAC recommends that the predictability and sustainability of funding for the WHE Programme be improved through an increase in assessed contributions, non-specified multiyear funding arrangements for core voluntary contributions, and a wider donor base.",
          "20.\tIn its previous reports, the IOAC has repeatedly recommended, that an increased proportion of WHO core flexible funding should be allocated to the WHE Programme. We emphasize once again that WHO corporate core flexible funding is fundamental to build the Programme’s capacities, as such funding provides financial sustainability for staffing.",
          "21.\tThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in total or partial disruption of essential health services in fragile, conflict-affected and vulnerable settings. IOAC recommends increasing current investment in resilient health systems, and universal health coverage, as delivery of an essential package of health services with sustainable funding is a key priority.",
          "22.\tIn the longer term, the Committee believes that further discussions should take place among Member States, to review whether WHO has the strategic capacity to support country preparedness and response, and whether WHO’s funding is adequate for the WHE Programme to lead multidimensional and large-scale emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside the increasing number of graded emergencies that it routinely manages.",
          "23.\tHonorable ministers, excellencies, heads of delegations, distinguished colleagues, in concluding, we assess that WHO has maintained and strengthened its leadership position in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic considering the constraints derived from fundamental problems. Numerous evaluations, reviews and assessments have documented the gaps and weaknesses in pandemic preparedness and response. It is time to take the bold decisions required to strengthen WHO and build an overarching architecture for global health based on solidarity and equity. IOAC believes that WHO must be at the centre of that governance structure, linking together the network of its 194 Member States, who are each accountable for global health, and are able to implement recommendations collectively. The world looks to WHO for guidance but to serve that purpose, WHO must be equipped with the necessary authority and resources to coordinate pandemic prevention and response. IOAC will continue to hold WHO accountable but Member States and partners must play their part as well, to help the Organization fulfil its role in protecting the health of populations across the world. Global health is truly a shared responsibility.",

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Swiss Confederation today signed a Memorandum of Understanding to launch the first WHO BioHub Facility as part of the WHO BioHub System, which was announced in November 2020. This facility will enhance the rapid sharing of viruses and other pathogens between laboratories and partners globally.",
          "Based in Spiez, Switzerland, the facility will serve as a centre for the safe receipt, sequencing, storage and preparation of biological materials for distribution to other laboratories, in order to inform risk assessments, and sustain global preparedness against these pathogens.",
          "“Close international collaboration to ensure the timely sharing of epidemiological and clinical data as well as biological materials is of utmost importance. Switzerland supports the WHO BioHub initiative in its initial phase by providing the necessary infrastructure of a Swiss biosafety laboratory in Spiez. With this, we hope to contribute to the establishment of an international exchange system for SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pathogens,” said Swiss Federal Councillor Alain Berset.",
          "Currently, most pathogen sharing is done bilaterally between countries and on an ad hoc basis, which can be slow, and leave some countries without access to the benefits and tools. The BioHub will enable Member States to share biological materials with and via the BioHub under pre-agreed conditions, including biosafety, biosecurity, and other applicable regulations. This will ensure timeliness and predictability in response activities.",
          "“The COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks and epidemics have underscored the importance of rapidly sharing pathogens to help the global scientific community assess the risk and develop countermeasures such as diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “The BioHub System is an important step towards facilitating this flow of information. We thank the Swiss Government for its support in establishing the first  BioHub Facility.”",
          "In parallel, WHO will broaden its BioHub System for the use of biological materials by qualified entities – such as manufacturers – for the development of medical by-products for fair allocation to countries. WHO is currently running a pilot phase, using SARS-COV-2 and its variants, to test the feasibility and operational arrangements for sharing such materials with the facilities of the BioHub System .",
          "Following results from the pilot project, the BioHub will expand from SARS-COV-2 and its variants, to other pathogens, and connect partners with other repositories and laboratory networks in 2022."

          "In 1981, health officials from around the world gathered at the World Health Assembly to address aggressive marketing tactics by the infant and young child feeding industry, which was promoting formula feeding over breastfeeding and causing a dramatic\r\n    increase in infant morbidity and mortality. The result was the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (the Code), a landmark policy framework designed to stop commercial interests from damaging breastfeeding rates and endangering\r\n    the health and nutrition of the world’s youngest inhabitants.",
          "In the last four decades, there has been a 50 per cent increase in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding. As a result, an estimated 900 million infants globally have enjoyed the survival, growth and development benefits of exclusive breastfeeding\r\n    in infancy.",
          "Breastfeeding is vital to a child’s lifelong nutrition, health, and wellbeing. It reduces costs for families, health facilities, and governments. Breastfeeding protects children from infections and saves lives. It supports emotional bonding between\r\n    mothers and babies, along with other mental health benefits.",
          "Yet aggressive marketing of breastmilk substitutes continues to discourage women from breastfeeding, putting both children’s and women’s health at risk.",
          "The 40 th anniversary of the adoption the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes is an opportunity to mark the significant progress made in protecting and promoting the incomparable benefits of breastfeeding, but also a reminder\r\n    of the work still to be done.",
          "A majority of countries have enacted legislation to implement at least some provisions of the Code. But unfortunately, only 25 countries have implemented measures that are substantially aligned with the Code.",
          "The Code remains as relevant today as it was 40 years ago. Last year, some marketers of baby foods exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to promote their products by invoking unfounded fears that breastfeeding could transmit COVID-19. WHO and UNICEF guidance\r\n    is clear: mothers suspected or known to have COVID-19 should continue breastfeeding.",

          "The twenty-eighth meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO Director-General on 4 May 2021 with Committee members and advisers attending via video conference, supported by the WHO Secretariat.  The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV).  The following IHR States Parties provided an update at the video conference on the current situation in their respective countries: Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan, Senegal, South Sudan and Tajikistan.",
          "Wild poliovirus",
          "The Committee noted that the higher incidence of global WPV1 cases seen until about mid-2020 came to a plateau during the second half of 2020. The number of WPV1 cases and proportion of WPV1 positive environmental samples have decreased during the first quarter of 2021. Compared to 42 WPV1 cases as of 21 April 2020, two WPV1 cases have been reported from Pakistan and Afghanistan during the same period in 2021. On environmental surveillance, 14% of the samples collected in 2021 (until 21 April) were positive for WPV1 compared to 49% in 2020 for the same period. WPV1 transmission persists in the two cross-border polio reservoirs, the northern corridor comprising of Peshawar-Khyber region of Pakistan and East Region of Afghanistan and the southern corridor comprising of Quetta Block of Pakistan and South Region of Afghanistan. Transmission is also continuing in Karachi, one of the most persistent polio reservoirs in Pakistan. It is important to note that the current transmission level is particularly low in the northern cross-border corridor with no cases reported in 2021 so far and only 8% positive environmental samples (all from Peshawar, Pakistan) during the first quarter of 2021. The decline in WPV1 transmission intensity can possibly be attributed to several factors, including the intense transmission in 2019-20 leading to some natural population immunity, the ongoing low transmission season for polio and to some extent intensified efforts in Pakistan and accessible areas of Afghanistan. The COVID-19 related border closures and lockdowns coupled with social distancing and hand washing may also have had a role in slowing down the transmission. However, unless the issues of inaccessibility of under-immunized children in southern Afghanistan and barriers to reach missed children in the core reservoirs of Pakistan are addressed, the transmission levels are likely to resurge.",
          "The Committee noted that the current situation provides a good opportunity over the next six months to curb the WPV1 transmission by implementing high quality vaccination activities (supplementary and routine) and fast-track progress towards the global WPV1 eradication. The ongoing inaccessibility for vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan (particularly the South Region) and the vaccination quality gaps in key reservoirs of Pakistan (Karachi and Quetta Block in particular) constitute significant risk for the programme’s success in this epidemiological block.",
          "The Committee noted that based on results from sequencing of WPV1, there were further instances of international spread of viruses from Pakistan to Afghanistan. The ongoing frequency of WPV1 international spread between the two countries and the ongoing vulnerability of other countries where routine immunization and polio prevention activities have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic mean that the risk of international spread remains significant."

          "The Committee noted with concern that since its last meeting in February 2021, cVDPV2 spread to Senegal and Kenya has been confirmed and a new cVDPV1 outbreak has been reported in Madagascar. Despite an overall decreasing trend in the number of cVDPV2 cases in 2021 so far, a significant number of countries (11) remain infected in the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions during the first quarter of the year. Moreover, the most recent quarterly routine analysis (October to December 2020) performed by the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) indicates cVDPV2 exportation from:",
          "This routine analysis by the GPLN assists the polio programme to identify and track the wild and vaccine-derived polioviruses and their patterns of spread and thereby provide opportunities to limit or prevent the circulation. The Committee noted that Kenya and Tajikistan had not declared the new outbreaks as national emergency and requested the GPEI to have discussions with these countries about the importance of making such a declaration, notwithstanding the reported vigorous country responses. In addition to above, the two recent cVDPV2 outbreaks in Kenya and Senegal were also the result of international spread; the cVDPV2 detected in Kenya links to the transmission in Somalia while the one in Senegal is linked to the ongoing cVDPV2 transmission in other areas of West Africa. This is the first ever cVDPV2 outbreak detected in Senegal. During the first quarter of 2021, a total of 72 cVDPV2 cases have been reported from 34 provinces in 11 countries, compared to 154 cVDPV2 cases from 58 provinces in 19 countries during the first quarter of 2020. The Committee appreciated the intensified efforts to stop the cVDPV2 transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but noted with utmost concern the ongoing cross-border cVDPV2 transmission between the two countries as well as the spread of the outbreak to the inaccessible areas of southern Afghanistan where local bans have prevented vaccination campaigns. The Committee noted that as per the reported data from the country programme, more than one million children remained inaccessible in southern Afghanistan during the vaccination campaigns in 2020 and first quarter of 2021 ( https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Afghanistan_NEAP_2021.pdf ).",
          "The Committee noted that a total of 13 cVDPV2 emergences have been detected during the first quarter of 2021. This compares with 36 emergences detected during the year 2020 and 44 in 2019. This reduction may reflect refinement and modification of cVDPV2 outbreaks management aimed at lessening the risk of seeding new emergences.",
          "The Committee noted that the novel OPV2 (nOPV2), after receiving the interim recommendation for use under WHO’s Emergency Use Listing procedure (EUL), has been introduced and delivered in two countries (Nigeria and Liberia) with an additional four countries to implement nOPV2 campaigns by the end of May. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) has endorsed, in principle, nOPV2 to become the vaccine of choice for response to cVDPV2 outbreaks after review of the initial use period is completed and all requirements for use are met. Further, SAGE endorsed the prioritization framework for type 2 vaccines for cVDPV2 outbreak response and agreed with the phases of the framework [Phase A: Pre-EUL recommendation, preparing for nOPV2 use; Phase B: Initial nOPV2 use under interim EUL recommendation (current phase); Phase C: Wider use of nOPV2 under interim EUL recommendation; Phase D: nOPV2 licensed and pre-qualified]. SAGE will review the findings from the initial use period to issue further recommendations on its wider use once the data on safety and stability have been gathered.",
          "The Committee noted that there are currently 60 million doses of nOPV2 in the stockpile, and it is expected to have an additional 252 million nOPV2 doses by end of the year to support its wider use. In addition, trivalent OPV (tOPV) remains available on the advice of the OPV2 Advisory Group and approval by the WHO Director General for use in countries which have concurrent type 1 and type 2 poliovirus infections co-circulating and is being used in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. There are about 2.5 million doses of tOPV currently available in the stockpile and orders are in place for about 140 million additional doses by December 2021. Monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2) also remains available to be utilized to respond to the cVDPV2 outbreaks on the advice of the OPV2 Advisory Group and the approval of the WHO Director General. Currently, 149 mOPV2 doses are available in the stockpile and orders are in place for additional 175 million doses until December 2021.",
          "The Committee noted that the cVDPV1 outbreaks in Madagascar and Yemen have occurred in areas and population groups of known risk, largely due to persistent sub-optimal routine immunization coverage. The Committee recommended to maintain Malaysia in the list of infected countries (despite more than 13 months since the last cVDPV detection), given the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the implementation of outbreak response."

Additional considerations The Committee was encouraged by the decreasing number of WPV-1 and cVDPV2 cases, but strongly recommended that efforts in support of the polio eradication must continue, noting the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the programme. The current favorable epidemiological trends can be attributed to the natural immunity following the explosive WPV1 and cVDPV2 transmission in 2020, the ongoing poliovirus low transmission season and the general decreasing trends of infectious diseases due to the COVID-19 lock downs with reduced population movement. The polio programme has witnessed similar favorable trends in the past that have been reversed once circumstances change. The Committee urged that the current situation must not lead to any complacency and should be considered as an opportunity to fast-track progress towards the global polio eradication by implementing high quality vaccination activities. The Committee welcomed the reports from Pakistan and Afghanistan about the successful implementation of integrated services, but remained concerned about the low IPV coverage in children with cVDPV infection and encouraged an ongoing focus on routine immunization and SIAs. The Committee also encouraged renewed cross-border efforts which countries reported to be a critical component of the polio response. The Committee noted with appreciation the initiation of the use of nOPV2 following the issuance of WHO’s Emergency Use Listing recommendation in November 2020. Nigeria and Liberia are the countries that have implemented nOPV2 vaccination campaigns so far in 2021, targeting almost 10 million children aged less than five years. Additional 23 countries are in process of preparation to meet the global criteria for the nOPV2 use. The Committee urged the need to accelerate the preparedness for nOPV2 use under the EUL and recommended that GPEI provides all possible support to the countries in this regard. The Committee emphasized the importance of fast-tracking the review process of the nOPV2 ‘initial use period’ to enable wider use (Phase C) after follow-up review by the SAGE. The Committee requested that sufficient nOPV2 supplies be secured noting that more countries are soon expected to meet the preparedness criteria under the initial use programme, and other countries will commence wider use during the second half of 2021. The Committee expressed deep concern about the ongoing challenges that the infected and vulnerable countries face towards reaching the high-risk populations. The Committee was particularly concerned about the mobile populations including the undocumented migrants as well as persisting zero-dose communities due to programmatic issues and insecurity. The Committee strongly recommended to utilize innovative strategies like rapid establishment of transit vaccination points, use of GIS to improve micro-planning (where possible) and locally appropriate operational and communication strategies to reach the zero-dose children with vaccines. The Committee welcomed the reports on planning of multi-antigen vaccination campaigns in some countries and encouraged availing all opportunities to plan and implement such campaigns and other tailored PHC strategies (e.g. delivering vitamins, deworming medication, soap etc.) to reach additional children with polio vaccine as well as to address communities’ concerns and hesitancy. The Committee noted the ongoing political volatility in Afghanistan hampering access for vaccination campaigns, that is expected to persist over the coming months. The Committee recommended that contingency plans be established to be implemented in the event of further deterioration of the security situation with possible mass population displacement. The Committee noted with concern some anecdotal reports about the possibility of falsified vaccination cards used by the travelers through air and land routes. The Committee recommended to the countries to carefully investigate any such reports and put in place stringent mitigating measures. The Committee welcomed the progress being made in individual countries that were facing significant challenges with both polio and COVID-19.  COVID-19 is also likely to continue to have a significant adverse impact on stopping polio transmission throughout 2021, with diversion of resources, barriers to successful polio campaign implementation and the consequential growing immunity gap.  However, the Committee urged countries to look for where synergies can be built between polio and COVID -19 control, such as countering vaccine hesitancy, expanding and sharing testing resources, and vaccine management.  Countries also need to make sure that local lockdowns and border restrictions were implemented in such a way as to avoid hampering specimen shipment and testing. The Committee was concerned about the growing funding gap for the polio programme and its possible implications on critical programme activities, especially in the infected low-income and conflict affected countries. The Committee called upon all the international donors and partners to maintain funding for polio eradication activities, as the potential for reversal of progress appears high, with many years of work undone rapidly if WPV1 spreads outside the endemic countries. The Committee also recommended to the programme to ensure best possible prioritization and utilization of resources in the current fiscal constrained environment. Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment on 21 May 2021 and determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 21 May 2021."

          "With nine people losing their lives to COVID-19 every minute, and as the risk of even more transmissible and dangerous variants increases, the Global Health Summit comes at a critical juncture. The future of the pandemic is in the hands of the G20 leaders.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator was launched just over a year ago in response to the G20’s call for a global mechanism to accelerate the development of tests, treatments and vaccines and to ensure their equitable distribution. Hosted by the World Health Organization, the ACT-Accelerator offers the only end-to-end multilateral solution to speeding up an end to the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator welcomes the commitments made at the Global Health Summit and will work with countries to operationalize rapidly these pledges, both financial and – crucially – for over 100 million doses of scarce vaccine. Current financial commitments are reflected in the ACT-Accelerator interactive funding tracker . However, a significant funding gap remains.",
          "Speeding up an end to the pandemic through the ACT-Accelerator would cost less than 1% of what governments are spending on stimulus packages to treat the consequences of the pandemic. As the economic and social costs of the pandemic continue to escalate, the case for global solidarity, grows even stronger. The world now needs the G20 to ACT.",
          "The Rome Declaration , released at the end of the Summit, reaffirmed leaders’ support for the ACT-Accelerator and underlined the necessity to share the financial burden and close the funding gap, in order for the ACT Accelerator to fulfil its mandate for the equitable allocation and delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines to defeat the pandemic. Of vital importance, the group also emphasized its support for global sharing of vaccine doses approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO) and through COVAX.",

While some countries have moved beyond just words, by donating vaccines and pledging to fully finance the ACT-Accelerator, further action is needed from G20 and G7 leaders if we are to stop this virus from spreading and mutating further. We all have substantial work ahead of us.”",

First, we need to close the 18.5 billion US dollar funding gap for the ACT Accelerator. Second, we need countries to donate tens of millions of doses of vaccines immediately through COVAX – which is the agreed global mechanism for distributing vaccines. We welcome the generous announcements made today; in the coming weeks and months, we will need hundreds of millions more doses. We need companies to help make donations happen fast, and to give COVAX the first right of refusal on all uncommitted doses now, in 2021. Third, we must urgently and dramatically scale up production of all of these tools, through voluntary licensing, sharing technology and know-how, and waiving intellectual property rights.

It’s estimated that the Influenza pandemic of 1918 infected one-third of the Earth’s population,  and led to between 20 and 40 million deaths before it subsided in 1920. One million people around the world died in a 1957 influenza outbreak and another 1 to 3 million lives were lost to the same disease in 1968. In 2003, A(H5N1) or so-called Avian Influenza, highlighted how a novel virus could pass from animals to humans putting the world on high alert. The 2009  A(H1N1) pandemic spread to over 214 countries and territories or communities, resulting in tens of millions of cases and an estimated 151,700 to 575,400 deaths in just the first year [1] .  COVID-19 has been a stark reminder of the dangers of viral pandemics.",

          "Geneva, 20 May 2021 – WHO and 12 other signatory agencies to the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All (SDG3 GAP) have released their second progress report, Stronger collaboration for an equitable and resilient recovery towards the health-related SDGs. This report presents progress achieved, especially at country level, where SDG3 GAP is being implemented in 37 countries, with its long-term, forward-looking SDG focus and as a platform to support countries’ equitable and resilient recovery\r\n    from the COVID-19 pandemic. The report also identifies challenges encountered over the last year, acknowledging the important roles that countries, agencies’ boards and donors play in setting the right incentives for effective collaboration\r\n    among SDG3 GAP agencies.",
          "“The GAP partners have shown their unwavering commitment to countries during the pandemic,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"Collaboration is now more relevant than ever. The GAP provides the platform to improve collaboration\r\n    in the multilateral system to support countries to recover from the pandemic and drive progress towards the health-related SDGs, with a focus on equity and enabled by stronger primary health care.”",
          "The report highlights ways in the which SDG3 GAP agencies are integrating work at country level, reducing fragmentation through joint work in support of national priorities and plans, creating synergies and increasing alignment within the broader health\r\n    ecosystem – for example, incorporating parts of the Every Woman, Every Child agenda and working jointly with the Health Data Collaborative (HDC) in countries. Many countries are prioritizing primary health care (PHC) and sustainable financing\r\n    as well as data for improving equity to understand people’s lives and to know where investments need to be made to reach the most left behind.",
          "At a recent “PHC for UHC Mission to Pakistan”, SDG3 GAP agencies renewed their commitment to better align their support for the roll-out of a universal health coverage (UHC) benefit package. Dr Faisal Sultan, Minister of Health, Special Assistant\r\n    to the Prime Minister, expressed his appreciation of the mission's work, noting that “implementation of the UHC benefit package will facilitate the strengthening of PHC services and securing sustainable financing will further support us to achieve\r\n    UHC, ensuring no one is left behind.”",
          "Looking ahead, the agencies will support additional countries under the SDG3 GAP approach. The agencies are committed to reviewing progress and have recently developed a monitoring framework to enable continued learning and enhance shared accountability."

Today, in the 68 countries Gavi supports, nearly 10 million children still go without any basic, routine vaccines\r\n    every year. Equitable and resilient recovery will require us to work together to reach these zero-dose children, so that no one is left behind.”",
          "Dr Muhammad Pate, Director of the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents:",
          "Partnership is at the heart of the GFF's country-led model. COVID-19 has made it even clearer that collaboration is critical to fight the pandemic and achieve the health-related SDGs. Working together GAP agencies have accelerated their efforts for stronger\r\n    partner alignment, engagement and accountability behind country-led response and recovery efforts to reclaim the health gains and build a more inclusive and resilient recovery.”",

          "\"Today’s global health challenges call for an integrated approach and intensive collaboration between all partners. We are committed to working together to deliver more effective and efficient support to countries, build the path towards an equitable\r\n    and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerate progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3: health and well-being for all.\"",
          "Guy Ryder, Director-General of the International Labour Organization",
          "“The ILO welcomes the progress for 2020 and as a new member looks forward to engaging with all SDG3-GAP partners in 2021 and beyond. The COVID-19 crisis has clearly demonstrated the interaction between health, social factors and decent work. It has highlighted the critical need for investments in all three areas. This will foster recovery and lead to a more sustainable, equitable development path. Equally, investments in the health of workers and of care workforce are vital to make progress towards universal health coverage. If we are to achieve SDG3, increased cooperation is needed. By joining this partnership the ILO reaffirms its commitment to support countries during this pandemic and beyond, through a multilateral and coherent approach.”",
          "Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of UNAIDS:",
          "“We have seen with HIV and now with COVID-19 the critical role communities play in connecting key and vulnerable populations to essential health and social services, in ensuring gender equality, inclusion and rights-based approaches to health and\r\n    social care, and in reducing inequalities. Resilient health systems rely on communities, this is why they feature prominently as a key pillar in the Global Action Plan and why they must be fully engaged, supported and funded.\"",
          "Achim Steiner, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme:",
          "The COVID-19 pandemic affects everyone everywhere, but it is having a disproportionate impact on the world’s most vulnerable. By 2030, eight out of ten people pushed into poverty, as a result of COVID-19, will live in low and medium human development\r\n    countries. Greater cooperation is the only way to defeat COVID-19 and restore and accelerate progress on the SDGs and on the pledge to leave no one behind. The SDG 3 Global Action Plan (GAP) is enhancing collaboration to support countries with their\r\n    COVID-19 response and to lay the foundation for an equitable and sustainable recovery.”",

Let us seize this opportunity to \r\naim for universal coverage that upholds the fundamental rights, \r\nwell-being and dignity of all. With quality disaggregated data to \r\nunderstand who is being left behind and why, and with women and girls at\r\n the centre of our rebuilding efforts, we can identify the best \r\ninvestments for strong, equitable health systems and resilient \r\ncommunities.”",

UNICEF is proud to stand with \r\nour GAP partners as we help governments around the world design and \r\ndeliver scaled-up primary health care services that can reach every \r\nchild in every community.”",
          "Dr Philippe Duneton, Executive Director of Unitaid:",
          "\"If the past year has shown us anything, it's that global solidarity is imperative to address the critical health challenges that confront us all, but particularly the world's most vulnerable populations. Alongside work to defeat the pandemic, we must\r\n    not let progress against TB, malaria, HIV, other infectious diseases and women and children's health slip backwards, but rather double down on the goal of achieving the health-related SDGs. Equitable access to innovation has a vital role to play in\r\n    getting lifesaving health products to everyone, no matter where they live.\"",
          "Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women:",

It demands responses grounded in partnerships, such as the collaboration under the Global Action Plan,\r\n    that rebalance power, realize women’s rights to health, and recognize their leadership roles as active agents of change in their households, workplaces, and communities.\"",

          "New guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) sets essential standards to inform future research and development on genetically modified mosquitoes, particularly in addressing issues relating to ethics, safety, affordability and effectiveness.",
          "Malaria and other vector-borne diseases, including dengue and Zika, affect millions globally. More than 400 000 people a year die from malaria alone. If proven safe, effective and affordable, genetically modified vector mosquitoes could be a valuable\r\n    new tool to fight these diseases and eliminate their enormous health, social and economic burden.",
          "The guidance framework for testing genetically modified mosquitoes ,\r\n developed in partnership with TDR, the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, and the GeneConvene Global Collaborative, an initiative of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, describes best practices to ensure\r\n    that the study and evaluation of genetically modified mosquitoes as public health tools is safe, ethical and rigorous.",
          "Current strategies for limiting transmission of mosquito-borne diseases are only partially effective. New, complementary approaches are needed to close the gaps in current vector control interventions, such as effective control of outdoor biting, and\r\n    to provide alternatives to manage the increasing threat of insecticide resistance. Research suggests genetically modified mosquitoes could be a powerful and cost-effective tool to supplement existing interventions.",
          "“We urgently need innovative approaches to help control mosquito-borne diseases, which have a devastating impact around the world,” said Dr John Reeder, TDR Director. “Genetically modified mosquitoes is one such approach, but we want\r\n    to be sure it’s fully and responsibly evaluated, as outlined in a recent WHO position statement .”",
          "“Like any new public health intervention, genetically modified mosquitoes raise new questions for researchers, affected communities and other stakeholders,” said Dr Michael Santos, Director of the GeneConvene Global Collaborative. “The\r\n    updated guidance framework aims to answer these questions and help ensure that testing of genetically modified mosquitoes is as rigorous as it is for other public health products – and that it generates quality results to guide decisions about\r\n    if and how these technologies are used.”",
          "“Over the last 2 decades, we have achieved remarkable results with existing malaria control tools, averting more than 7 million deaths and 1.5 billion cases of the disease,” said Dr Pedro Alonso, Director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme.\r\n    “However, progress towards key targets of our global malaria strategy remains off course. Genetically modified mosquitoes are one of a number of promising new tools that could help speed the pace of progress against malaria and other vector-borne\r\n    diseases.”",
          "“The incidence of dengue continues to increase and affect people in over 129 countries, so we need more sustainable vector control tools to stem the tide of dengue and other arboviral diseases and a few novel tools offer the potential to control\r\n    these diseases,” said Dr Mwele Malecela, Director of the WHO Department for the Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases.",
          "“We welcome this new guidance from WHO which will help countries suffering from mosquito-borne diseases to evaluate a promising new intervention,” said Professor Aggrey Ambali, Senior Advisor at the African Union Development Agency-New\r\n    Partnership for Africa’s Development (AUDA-NEPAD), the development agency of the African Union.",
          "The new guidance addresses specific questions and challenges associated with research and development on genetically modified mosquitoes, including standards for decision-making about how and when testing should proceed. By establishing a common set of\r\n    expectations that is specific to genetically modified mosquitoes, the new resource will enable more informed and rigorous evaluation by researchers, developers, those responsible for regulatory and policy decisions and the people to whom these stakeholders\r\n    are accountable.",

          "As of 18 May 2021, there were 163,312,429 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 3,386,825 deaths , reported to WHO.  Vaccination remains a critical tool to help prevent further illness and death and to control the pandemic.",
          "The Johnson & Johnson (J&J)/Janssen vaccine was listed for emergency use by WHO on 12 March 2021.  The vaccine has been authorized for use in Europe, the United States and other countries, with the widest experience to date in the United States, where more than 8 million doses of the J&J vaccine had been administered as of 7 May.",
          "The GACVS COVID-19 subcommittee met virtually on 11 May 2021 to review available information and data on thromboembolic events (blood clots) and thrombocytopenia (low platelets) after vaccination with the adenoviral vectored J&J vaccine. This condition is referred to as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). Current evidence suggests a plausible causal association between the J&J COVID-19 vaccine and TTS. Clinically, the features of TTS following vaccination with this vaccine appear similar to those observed following another adenoviral vectored vaccine, the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. TTS does not appear to be associated with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The exact mechanism by which this rare condition occurs is not fully understood. (1) To date, the only possible risks factors identified are age and gender (with more cases reported in women).",
          "The subcommittee reviewed detailed surveillance data from the United States, which included stimulated passive surveillance and a small active surveillance cohort.",
          "Based on a careful scientific review of the available information, the subcommittee came to the following conclusions and recommendations:",
          "- The benefits of the J&J COVID-19 vaccine continue to outweigh the risks of TTS. As the only single dose COVID-19 vaccine approved for use to date, the vaccine may be an important tool for accessing difficult-to-reach populations, thus playing a key role in preventing infections and reducing deaths across the world.",
          "- Very rare thromboembolic events, in combination with thrombocytopenia, have been reported following vaccination with the J&J vaccine in the United States. As of 7 May 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reviewed 28 reports of TTS out of a total of more than 8 million vaccinations; TTS was reported in persons between 18-59 years of age (median age of 40 years) and occurring after 3-15 days (a median of 9 days). (2) To date, the US FDA and CDC have not identified any cases of TTS after use of over 240 million doses of mRNA vaccines.",
          "- Reports      of TTS following vaccination with the J&J vaccine have a similar      clinical picture to those reported following vaccination with the AstraZeneca      COVID-19 vaccine. On 16 April 2021 the GACVS      COVID-19 subcommittee issued an updated statement on blood coagulation      events and the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. (3)",
          "- Although most cases of TTS have typically involved thrombosis in unusual locations, including cerebral venous sinuses, portal vein, splenic vein and other rare venous and arterial thrombosis, cases including thrombosis in more common locations, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, have been identified in the United States.",
          "- When setting their immunization policies, the risk of TTS from use of the J&J vaccine should be assessed against the benefits. Countries should perform such a benefit-risk analysis taking into account local epidemiology (including incidence and mortality from COVID-19 disease), age groups targeted for vaccination, and the availability of alternative vaccines.",
          "- Adequate      education should be provided to health-care professionals and persons      being vaccinated to recognize the signs and symptoms of all serious      adverse events after vaccinations with all COVID-19 vaccines, so that      people may seek and receive prompt and relevant medical care and      treatment. Early identification of TTS is important in order to      initiate appropriate treatment.",
          "- Clinicians      should be alert to any new, severe, persistent headaches or other      significant symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain and shortness of      breath, with an onset between 4 to 20 days after adenovirus vectored      COVID-19 vaccination. At a minimum, countries should encourage clinicians      to measure platelet levels and conduct appropriate investigation of      thrombosis.  Clinicians should also      be aware that although heparin is generally used to treat blood clots,      administration of heparin in TTS may be dangerous and alternative      treatments such as immunoglobulins and non-heparin anticoagulants should      be considered.",
          "- The      GACVS subcommittee recommends that countries continue to monitor the      safety of all COVID-19 vaccines and promote reporting of suspected adverse      events. In particular, any blood clots following receipt of any COVID-19      vaccine should be reported.",
          "- The      GACVS subcommittee acknowledges that TTS has occurred with two adenoviral-vectored      vaccines.  Ongoing assessment for      and review of TTS cases, as well as related research, should include all      vaccines using adenoviral vector platforms.",
          "The GACVS COVID-19 subcommittee will continue to review the safety data from all COVID-19 vaccines and update any advice as necessary. Open, transparent, and evidence-based communication about the potential benefits and risks to recipients and the community is essential to maintain trust. WHO is carefully monitoring the rollout of all COVID-19 vaccines and will continue to work closely with countries to manage potential risks, and to use science and data to drive the response and update recommendations.",

          "The Sinopharm product is an inactivated vaccine called SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (Vero Cell). Its easy storage requirements make it highly suitable for low-resource settings. It is the also first vaccine that will carry a vaccine vial monitor, a small sticker\r\n    on the vaccine vials that change color as the vaccine is exposed to heat, letting health workers know whether the vaccine can be safely used.",
          "WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has also completed its review of the vaccine. On the basis of all available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing\r\n    of three to four weeks. Vaccine efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalized disease was estimated to be 79%, all age groups combined.",
          "Few older adults (over 60 years) were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age group.  Nevertheless, WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because preliminary data and supportive immunogenicity\r\n    data suggest the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons.  There is no theoretical reason to believe that the vaccine has a different safety profile in older and younger populations.  WHO therefore recommends that\r\n    countries using the vaccine in older age groups conduct safety and effectiveness monitoring to make the recommendation more robust.",
          "WHO emergency use listing",
          "The emergency use listing (EUL) procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies. The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency, while\r\n    adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks.",
          "The EUL pathway involves a rigorous assessment of late phase II and phase III clinical trial data as well as substantial additional data on safety, efficacy, quality and a risk management plan. These data are reviewed by independent experts and WHO\r\n    teams who consider the current body of evidence on the vaccine under consideration, the plans for monitoring its use, and plans for further studies.",
          "As part of the EUL process, the company producing the vaccine must commit to continue to generate data to enable full licensure and WHO prequalification of the vaccine. The WHO prequalification process will assess additional clinical data generated from\r\n    vaccine trials and deployment on a rolling basis to ensure the vaccine meets the necessary standards of quality, safety and efficacy for broader availability.",
          "WHO also listed the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use on 31 December 2020; two AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccines on 15 February 2021, produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India; and COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S\r\n    developed by Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) on 12 March 2021.",
          "Listings",
          "WHO has also listed the Pfizer/BioNTech , Astrazeneca-SK Bio , Serum Institute of India , Janssen and Moderna vaccines for emergency use.",
          "See EUL listings",
          "SAGE",
          "SAGE is the principal advisory group to WHO for vaccines and immunization. It is charged with advising WHO on overall global policies and strategies, ranging from vaccines and technology, research and development, to delivery of immunization and its linkages\r\n    with other health interventions. SAGE is concerned not just with childhood vaccines and immunization, but all vaccine-preventable diseases.",
          "SAGE has issued recommendations on Pfizer\r\n    (8 January 2021), Moderna (25 January 2021), AstraZeneca (21 April 2021), and Janssen COVID (17 March 2021) vaccines, as well as issued a framework for access and population prioritization roadmap.",
          "SAGE and EUL are complementary but independent processes. The EUL process is centered on determining if a manufactured product is quality-assured, safe and effective. SAGE is policy oriented. Policy recommendations for a vaccine are only of value\r\n    to a vaccination campaign when the product has been listed or authorized for use.",
          "In the context of COVID-19 and due the pressing need for vaccines, the Secretariat of SAGE and the EUL team have been working in parallel to allow WHO EUL and policy recommendations, based on the available evidence, to be issued in a synchronized manner.",

          "ICMRA 1 and WHO call on the pharmaceutical industry to provide wide access to clinical data for all new medicines and vaccines (whether full or conditional approval, under emergency use, or rejected). Clinical trial reports should be published without redaction of confidential information for reasons of overriding public health interest.",
          "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus the need for information and data to support academics, researchers and industry in developing vaccines and therapeutics; to support regulators and health authorities in their decision-making; to support healthcare professionals in their treatment decisions; and to support public confidence in the vaccines and therapeutics being deployed.",
          "While some initiatives have met with stakeholder support (e.g. WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, US NIH ClinicalTrials.gov database, Health Canada Clinical Information Portal, EMA Clinical Trials Register and Japan Registry of Clinical Trials), not all past efforts have been successful. Often this was because they were unsustainable due to reliance on goodwill or lack of appropriate resourcing. 2",
          "The common aim of these initiatives is to ensure that results of research are accessible to all those involved in health care decision-making. The priority should be for new innovative medicines and vaccines. This improves transparency and strengthens the validity and value of the scientific evidence base. To succeed, initiatives need multi-stakeholder engagement aimed at finding solutions that deliver benefits for public health.",
          "Regulators continue to spend considerable resources negotiating transparency with sponsors. Both positive and negative clinically relevant data should be made available, while only personal data and individual patient data should be redacted. In any case, aggregated data are unlikely to lead to re-identification of personal data and techniques of anonymisation can be used.",
          "The first benefit is public trust. Regulators are opening their decisions to public scrutiny demonstrating confidence in their work.",
          "Another benefit is the possible check of data integrity, a scientific necessity and an ethical must. Data must be robust, exhaustive and verifiable, through peer-review. Data integrity is priceless. Wrong regulatory decisions, made on selected or unreliable data, will affect the patients who receive that medicine.",
          "Lack of public access to negative trials has been identified as a source of bias, which weakens the conclusions of systematic reviews and provides a false sense of reassurance on the safety or efficacy of the medicine.",
          "Publication of data allows science to advance faster, by avoiding repetition of unnecessary trials and waste of resources (human and financial). This also brings benefits by improving the efficiency of development programmes and reducing both development costs and time. Publication of data also allows secondary analyses (and meta-analysis) which have a different or complementary focus.",
          "Many public bodies have made open access a requirement as data are a common good. Providing access to data is also owed to trial participants who contributed physically and took the potential research risks.",
          "Not all data are of high quality, and increased public scrutiny should eventually improve the overall quality of data. Resources however are needed for data sharing, and systems for such access need to be established. Standardisation of data will allow better analyses but is not a requirement.",
          "While there may be a small risk of misuse of data (piracy or data mining for unfair commercial purpose) and misinterpretation, trial data can be put in context when published with the regulatory review of such data.",
          "Data must be published at the time of finalisation of the regulatory review. It cannot be justified to keep confidential efficacy and safety data of a medicine available on the market, or which has been refused access to the market. Some regulators regularly publish the data that support positive approvals, but fewer do this for rejections, while this should avoid false expectations, misuse (accidental or not) and safety issues. Many completed trials on publication platforms only disclose protocols while results remain partial, outdated or unpublished.",
          "ICMRA and WHO are conscious of concerns that some stakeholders may have as regulators move to greater levels of transparency, but we remain confident of the overwhelming positive public health benefits of doing so.",
          "Providing systematic public access to data supporting approvals and rejections of medicines reviewed by regulators, is long overdue despite existing initiatives, such as those from the European Medicines Agency and Health Canada. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed how essential to public trust access to data is. ICMRA and WHO call on the pharmaceutical industry to commit, within short timelines, and without waiting for legal changes, to provide voluntary unrestricted access to trial results data for the benefit of public health. __________________________________________________________ 1 ICMRA is a voluntary coalition of leaders of medicines regulatory authorities that provides strategic directions for enhanced cooperation, improved communication and effective global crisis response mechanisms. 2 E.g. Past declarations and private initiatives abandoned or not followed through include: -- Walsh F (26 February 2013), \"Drug firm Roche pledges greater access to trials data\" -- Alltrials Campaign, https://www.alltrials.net/ (most recent data from March 2019) -- WHO and multi-party Joint statement on public disclosure of results from clinical trials, 18 May 2017 (accessed here, March 2021)."

          "“I am delighted that WHO is convening this talented and driven group of global experts as the WHO Council on the Economics of Health for All, which is Chaired by the distinguished economist Professor Mariana Mazzucato,” said Dr Tedros. “I established this Council precisely to gather leading experts in economics, policy development and health, and to benefit from their knowledge and skill. I urge them to advise on a new way forward that ensures health is at the heart of all government action and investment decisions. We must value and invest in health as our most important commodity. ”",

          "Prime Minister Marin said: “The pandemic has had a momentous impact on health, economies and societies around the world. At the same time, it has shown that, with the right approach, it is possible to protect the vulnerable, to safeguard both health and the economy. It has underlined the meaning of global solidarity and the importance of putting people at the centre of decision-making. The participation of women in the policy design and at the heart of response and recovery is essential.”",

Additional members may be appointed. Dr Vera Songwe will join as a special guest.",
          "“The COVID-19 pandemic has shone the brightest light ever on the great lack of capacity and alignment among essential sectors in society in how they respond to the interlinked health and economic challenges people face in their daily lives,” said Professor Mazzucato, Council Chair, Professor of the Economics of Innovation and Public Value and Founding Director in the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose at University College London. “Government capacities for protecting public health and, in turn, safeguarding and boosting economies require interlinked strategies, investment and political commitment. Health for all must be at the heart of government investment and innovation decisions—and it must be governed with the common good in mind. The Council will work to address these many challenges and offer the world a path forward.”",
          "The WHO Council aims to reframe health for all, as a global objective, and ensure that national and global economies and finance are structured in such a way to deliver on this ambitious goal. This includes advice on what can be done and practical tools in four important areas:  new ways to measure and value health for all, build up public sector capacity to drive transformative change and innovate towards achieving population health goals, and, to ensure financial systems invest in creating health.  This requires a transformation in financing for health,  not as a cost but a long-term investment for a “healthy society,” grounded in the fundamental truth that health and the economy are interdependent."

          "“This is a monumental moment in the fight against COVID-19. The commitment by the President of the United States Joe Biden and Ambassador Katherine Tai, the US Trade Representative, to support the waiver of IP protections on vaccines is a powerful example of American leadership to address global health challenges,” said Dr Tedros.",

Now let's all move together swiftly, in solidarity, building on the ingenuity and commitment of scientists who produced life-saving COVID-19 vaccines.”",
          "On Wednesday, Ambassador Tai issued a statement saying the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic required extraordinary measures to respond and that the waiving of intellectual property protections on vaccines was needed to help end the pandemic. The United States would, the statement continued, participate in World Trade Organization negotiations to support the temporary waiving of protections, and work with the private sector and other partners to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution.",

But I am not surprised by this announcement. This is what I expected from the Administration of President Biden.”",

          "Most people consume double the WHO-recommended 5g of daily salt intake, putting themselves at greater risk of the heart diseases and strokes that kill an estimated 3 million people each year.",
          "Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a new set of global benchmarks for sodium levels in more than 60 food categories that will help countries reduce sodium contents in foods to improve diets and save lives.",
          "“ WHO Global Sodium Benchmarks for Different Food Categories ” is a guide for countries and industry to reduce the sodium content in different categories of processed foods. Around the world, consumption of processed food is a rapidly increasing source of sodium.",
          "Confusingly, similar processed food products often contain different amounts of sodium in different countries. WHO’s harmonized global benchmarks will show countries how they can progressively lower their targets, based on their local food environments, and encourage industry to lower the sodium content in processed foods accordingly and advance toward the WHO goal of 30% reduction in global salt/sodium intake by 2025.",
          "“Most people don’t know how much sodium they consume, or the risks it poses,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “We need countries to establish policies to reduce salt intake and provide people with the information they need to make the right food choices. We also need the food and beverage industry to cut sodium levels in processed foods. WHO’s new benchmarks give countries and industry a starting point to review and establish policies to transform the food environment and save lives.”",
          "The WHO Global Sodium Benchmarks target a wide range of categories of processed and packaged food products that significantly contribute to overly salty diets. Processed and packaged bread, savoury snacks, meat products and cheese are among the categories of high-sodium food products identified for the new global benchmarks.",
          "Reducing sodium content by reformulating processed foods is a proven strategy to reduce population sodium intake, particularly in places where consumption of processed foods is high. It can also prevent processed foods from becoming a major source of sodium in countries where consumption of these manufactured foods may be rapidly increasing.",
          "In the United Kingdom, voluntary targets for food manfacturers to reformulate products decreased adult salt intake approximately 15% between 2003 and 2011, indicating that target-setting across multiple food categories can achieve meaningful reductions in sodium consumption.",
          "“Access to affordable, healthy foods is critically important for all people in every country,” said Dr Tom Frieden, President and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, an Initiative of Vital Strategies. “These global benchmarks are an important first step. As consumer tastes adjust and technology advances, country governments and the WHO can steadily reduce them over time until population sodium reduction goals have been met. When we reduce sodium gradually, our food will still taste great, and only our hearts will know the difference!”",
          "These new benchmarks are launching during a decisive year for food and nutrition policy. The United Nations Food Systems Summit in September and the Nutrition for Growth Summit in December will convene a wide range of stakeholders to transform food systems by providing opportunities for national, regional and global efforts to improve the food environment and make commitments including to limit the sodium content in processed foods.",

          "“Sweden’s announcement that it will share 1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines with COVAX is a superb gesture that must be replicated urgently, and repeatedly, by governments around the world to accelerate the equitable rollout of vaccines globally,” said Dr Tedros, who met today with Sweden’s Minister for Development Cooperation, Mr Per Olsson Fridh, during his visit to WHO’s headquarters in Geneva.",
          "COVAX urgently needs 20 million doses during the second quarter of 2021 to cover interruptions in supply triggered by increased demands for vaccines in India where COVAX’s main supplier of the AstraZeneca product is based.",
          "Dr Tedros added: “Such support will ensure that people in vulnerable countries, especially, in Africa, will be able to receive their second doses through the COVAX initiative. Sweden’s generous support is very timely as it comes at a time when the world needs it most.”",
          "WHO and its partners are advocating for countries to make contributions, like Sweden’s, to donate doses from their stocks to boost vaccine supplies to COVAX to deepen vaccination coverage in low income countries and to ensure populations in such places receive needed second doses. Several other countries have made similar commitments recently, including New Zealand and France."

          "“Today’s declaration of an end to the latest Ebola outbreak in the in Democratic Republic of the Congo is a testament to the professionalism, sacrifices, and collaboration by hundreds of true health heroes, in particular the Congolese responders,” said Dr Tedros. “The World Health Organization is committed to helping national and local authorities, and the people of North Kivu, prevent the return of this deadly virus and to promote the overall health and well-being of all at-risk communities.”",
          "This latest Ebola outbreak started in North Kivu in February, coming nine months after an earlier outbreak in the same province was declared over. It was the country’s fourth in under three years.",
          "Dr Tedros said the return earlier this year of the virus underscored the persistent health threats that people in North Kivu face, and the need for all involved in promoting and protecting public health to remain vigilant in the face of Ebola, as well as COVID-19, measles, cholera and other challenges confronting communities, all within a difficult climate marked by violence.",
          "In the latest outbreak, now declared over, 11 confirmed cases and one probable case, six deaths and six recoveries were recorded in four health zones since 7 February. Genome sequencing results found that the first case detected was linked to the earlier outbreak, but the infection’s source is yet to be determined.",
          "The response was coordinated by the Provincial Department of Health in collaboration with WHO and partners. WHO had nearly 60 experts on the ground and as soon as the outbreak was declared helped local workers to trace contacts, provide treatment, engage communities and vaccinate nearly 2000 people at high risk, including over 500 frontline workers.",
          "While this latest outbreak is over, there is a need for continued vigilance and maintaining a strong surveillance system as potential flare-ups are possible in coming months. It is equally important to keep improving infection prevention and control in health facilities to prevent all infectious diseases, and to keep supporting Ebola survivors through dedicated rehabilitation programmes. Such actions must be supported by dedicated efforts to improve the persistent challenges posed by insecurity and armed violence in the North Kivu region."

The SAGE recommended the vaccine for all age groups 18 and above in its i nterim recommendations dated 25 January 2021.",
          "The US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the Moderna vaccine on 18 December 2020 and a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union was granted by the European Medicines Agency on 6 January 2021.",
          "The WHO EUL process can be carried out quickly when vaccine developers submit the full data required by WHO in a timely manner. Once those data are submitted, WHO can rapidly assemble its evaluation team and regulators from around the world to assess the information and, when necessary, carry out inspections of manufacturing sites.",
          "The Moderna vaccine is an mNRA-based vaccine. It was found by the SAGE to have an efficacy of efficacy of 94.1%, based on a median follow-up of two months. Although the vaccine is provided as a frozen suspension at –25 ºC to –15 ºC in a multidose vial, vials can be stored refrigerated at 2–8 °C for up to 30 days prior to withdrawal of the first dose, meaning that ultra-cold chain equipment may not always be necessary to deploy the vaccine."

          "While immunization services have started to recover from disruptions caused by COVID-19, millions of children remain vulnerable to deadly diseases, the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance warned today during World Immunization Week , highlighting the urgent need for a renewed global commitment to improve vaccination access and uptake.",
          "“Vaccines will help us end the COVID-19 pandemic but only if we ensure fair access for all countries, and build strong systems to deliver them,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s Director-General . “And if we’re to avoid multiple outbreaks of life-threatening diseases like measles, yellow fever and diphtheria, we must ensure routine vaccination services are protected in every country in the world.”",
          "A WHO survey has found that, despite progress when compared to the situation in 2020, more than one third of respondent countries (37%) still report experiencing disruptions to their routine immunization services.",
          "Mass immunization campaigns are also disrupted. According to new data, 60 of these lifesaving campaigns are currently postponed in 50 countries, putting around 228 million people - mostly children - at risk for diseases such as measles, yellow fever and polio. Over half of the 50 affected countries are in Africa, highlighting protracted inequities in people’s access to critical immunization services.",
          "Campaigns to immunize against measles, which is one of the most contagious diseases and can result in large outbreaks wherever people are unvaccinated, are the most impacted. Measles campaigns account for 23 of the postponed campaigns, affecting an estimated 140 million people. Many have now been delayed for over a year.",
          "“Even before the pandemic, there were worrying signs that we were beginning to lose ground in the fight against preventable child illness, with 20 million children already missing out on critical vaccinations,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “The pandemic has made a bad situation worse, causing millions more children to go unimmunized. Now that vaccines are at the forefront of everyone’s minds, we must sustain this energy to help every child catch up on their measles, polio and other vaccines. We have no time to waste. Lost ground means lost lives.”",
          "As a result of gaps in vaccination coverage, serious measles outbreaks have recently been reported in countries including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Yemen, while likely to occur elsewhere as growing numbers of children miss out on lifesaving vaccines, the agencies warn. These outbreaks are happening in places already grappling with conflict situations as well as service disruptions due to ongoing response measures to COVID-19.",
          "The supply of vaccines and other equipment is also essential for child vaccinations. Due to disruptions at the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic, UNICEF delivered 2.01 billion vaccine doses in 2020, compared to 2.29 billion in 2019.",
          "“Millions of children across the world are likely to miss out on basic vaccines as the current pandemic threatens to unravel two decades of progress in routine immunization”, said Dr Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance . “To support the recovery from COVID-19 and to fight future pandemics, we will need to ensure routine immunization is prioritized as we also focus on reaching children who do not receive any routine vaccines, or zero-dose children. To do this, we need to work together – across development agencies, governments and civil society – to ensure that no child is left behind”.",
          "New global immunization strategy aims to save over 50 million lives",
          "To help tackle these challenges and support the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO UNICEF , Gavi and other partners today launched the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030), an ambitious new global strategy to maximize the lifesaving impact of vaccines through stronger immunization systems.",
          "The Agenda focuses on vaccination throughout life, from infancy through to adolescence and older age. If fully implemented, it will avert an estimated 50 million deaths, according to WHO - 75% of them in low- and lower-middle income countries.",

              "The pharmaceutical industry and scientists, working with governments and funders, should continue to accelerate vaccine R&D, ensure a continuous supply of affordable vaccines to meet global needs, and apply lessons from COVID-19 to other diseases ### Notes to editors Photos and b-roll are available for download here. World Immunization Week 2021 takes place in the last week of April (April 24th-30th) to celebrate the lifesaving benefits of vaccines. This year’s theme, ‘Vaccines bring us closer,’ aims to show how vaccination connects us to the people, goals and moments that matter, helping improve the health of everyone, everywhere throughout life. The World Health Organization provides global leadership in public health within the United Nations system. Founded in 1948, WHO works with 194 Member States, across six regions and from more than 150 offices, to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable. Our goal for 2019-2023 is to ensure that a billion more people have universal health coverage, to protect a billion more people from health emergencies, and provide a further billion people with better health and wellbeing. UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, to build a better world for everyone. For more information about UNICEF and its work for children, visit www.unicef.org .

          "The ACT-Accelerator marks its first anniversary today with a special report on the global alliance’s progress against the COVID-19 pandemic. The    “ ACT Now, ACT Together: 2021 Impact Report ” details the major scientific advances that have been made to confront the new disease, along with the history-making collaboration of global health organizations, governments, foundations, civil society, scientists and the private sector.",
          "The report, which was launched at an event hosted by Dr Tedros Adhanom, Director-General of WHO, with live remarks by Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, and Dag Inge Ulstein, Minister of International Development for Norway, also shows the challenges ahead, including major funding gaps that threaten to derail progress against the pandemic.",
          "“One year after the launch of the ACT Accelerator, world leaders face a choice: invest in saving lives by treating the cause of the pandemic everywhere, now, or continue to spend trillions on the consequences with no end in sight,” WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom said. “With a remaining funding gap of US$ 19 billion for 2021 and limited supply of products, we can only end the pandemic by funding, sharing, and scaling-up access to the tools we need to fight the disease. The time to ACT is now.”",
          "The ACT-Accelerator alliance was launched on 24 April 2020 by WHO, the European Commission, France, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and deliver tests, treatments and vaccines the world needs to fight COVID-19.",
          "A year ago, the world was in a very different place. Our collective understanding of COVID-19 was limited, and while we had polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing that could be done in laboratories, there were no rapid tests, no vaccines, and little was known about effective treatments. Today, rapid diagnostic tests, repurposed treatments, and vaccines exist. This scientific progress has been rapid, and unprecedented in scale and levels of collaboration.",
          "But COVID-19 continues to spread and new variants emerge because the progress on equitably distributing those tools has not been fast enough.",
          "COVID-19 has killed more than 3 million people worldwide, another wave is threatening many countries, and inequitable distribution of tests, treatments and vaccines is allowing the virus to accelerate and change – risking the efficacy of our current tools to fight the disease. Left to rage anywhere, the virus is a threat everywhere. A strengthened, globally coordinated effort to ensure all countries can access the tools they need is essential to help bring this virus under control and is why support for the ACT-Accelerator partnership is so important.",
          "“COVID-19 knows no borders,” ACT-A Special Envoy Carl Bildt said. “A new variant from anywhere could unravel progress everywhere, even in a country that has achieved 100% vaccination. The pandemic is still on the rise. Only a reinforced global effort to deliver tests, treatments, and vaccines to all people everywhere, based on need rather than ability to pay, will bring an end to this pandemic. Ahead of the Global Health Summit we call on the G20, G7, and all richer countries to step up and pay their fair share to fund the global response.”",

              "Therapeutics Pillar – co-convened by Unitaid and Wellcome : Tracked over 300 actionable trials, supported the identification of dexamethasone as the first life-saving therapy against COVID-19 and in less than 20 days after its identification, made 2.9m doses of dexamethasone available to LMICs. Formed the Covid-19 Oxygen Emergency Taskforce to meet the needs of more than half a million COVID-19 patients in LMICs who need oxygen treatment per day.",

          "Vaccinating at this scale and in this timeframe constitutes the largest and most complex vaccine rollout in history. There are significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering on such a scale and timeline, with severe supply constraints characterizing the market at present. Of the more than 950 million vaccinations that have been given – just 0.3% have been administered in low-income countries. Testing rates in high-income countries are about 70 times higher than those in low-income countries, leaving many countries blind with little information and current infection rates or the spread of new variants. People will continue to get COVID-19 and so we need to rapidly intensify research to expand the portfolio of effective treatments, and deliver the PPE and Oxygen needed to treat those in hospital – as demand for oxygen surges in many parts of the world.",
          "An unprecedented mobilization of public, private, and multilateral funders has galvanized USD 14.1 billion in commitments so far, but as of today, the ACT-Accelerator partnership needs another US $19 billion to develop and deliver the tests, treatments, and vaccines needed to bring COVID-19 under control, and is calling on governments around the world to work with the ACT-Accelerator partners to fund, share and scale up the tools the world needs to bring an end to the acute phase of the virus.",
          "The International Chamber of Commerce estimates that the global economy stands to lose as much as US$ 9.2 trillion if governments fail to ensure developing economy access to COVID-19 vaccines. Fully financing the ACT-Accelerator for 2021 would cost less than 1% of what governments are spending on stimulus packages to treat the consequences of COVID-19."

          "The second round of a World Health Organization “pulse survey“ reveals that over one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, substantial disruptions persist, with about 90% of countries still reporting one or more disruptions to essential health services, marking no substantial global change since the first survey conducted in the summer of 2020.",
          "Within countries, however, the magnitude and extent of disruptions has generally decreased. In 2020, countries reported that, on average, about half of essential health services were disrupted. In the first 3 months of 2021, however, they reported progress, with just over one third of services now being disrupted.",
          "Overcoming disruptions",
          "Countries have been working to mitigate disruptions. Many have now stepped up communications efforts to inform the public about changes to service delivery and provide advice about ways to safely seek health care. They are also triaging to identify and better meet the most urgent patient needs.",
          "More than half the countries consulted say they have recruited additional staff to boost the health workforce; redirected patients to other care facilities; and switched to alternative methods to delivering care, such as providing more home-based services, multi-month prescriptions for treatments, and increasing the use of telemedicine.",
          "In addition, WHO and its partners have been helping countries to adapt their processes so they can better respond to the challenges being placed on their health systems; strengthen primary health care, and advance universal health coverage.",
          "“It is encouraging to see that countries are beginning to build back their essential health services, but much remains to be done,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General, WHO. “The survey highlights the need to intensify efforts and take additional steps to close gaps and strengthen services. It will be especially important to monitor the situation in countries that were struggling to provide health services before the pandemic.“",
          "Persisting causes of disruptions",
          "Countries are still having to make important decisions when responding to COVID-19 that may negatively affect access to care for other health issues. Redeployment of staff to provide COVID-19 relief and temporary closures of health facilities and services continue.",
          "Although they may have taken on new staff, 66% of countries continue to report health workforce-related reasons as the most common causes of service disruptions. Supply chains are also still disrupted in nearly one third of countries, affecting the availability of essential medicines, diagnostics, and the PPE needed to safely and effectively provide care.",
          "Communications efforts need to be further scaled up: more than half of countries report service disruptions due to patients not seeking care and because of community mistrust and fears of becoming infected.",
          "Meanwhile, 43% of countries cite financial challenges as major causes for disruptions in service utilization.",
          "As a result, millions of people are still missing out on vital health care. In terms of services, the biggest impact reported by nearly half of countries is on provision of day-to-day primary care to prevent and manage some of the most common health problems. Long-term care for chronic conditions, rehabilitation, and palliative end-of-life care, is also still badly disrupted - severely affecting older people and people living with disabilities.",
          "Potentially life-saving emergency, critical and surgical care interventions are still disrupted in about 20% of countries, reflecting the most immediate indirect consequences of the pandemic. Two thirds of countries also report disruptions in elective surgeries, with accumulating consequences as the pandemic is prolonged.",
          "Among the most extensively affected health services (i.e. those for which more than 40% of countries are reporting disruptions) are those for mental, neurological and substance use disorders; neglected tropical diseases; tuberculosis; HIV and hepatitis B and C; cancer screening, and services for other noncommunicable diseases including hypertension and diabetes; family planning and contraception; urgent dental care; and malnutrition.",
          "Issued ahead of World Immunization Week (which starts 24 April) and World Malaria Day (25 April) the survey reveals that serious gaps also remain in addressing disruptions to services in both these areas.More than one third of countries are still reporting disruptions to immunization services, despite progress in countries reducing disruptions to immunization services in health facilities and “outreach” immunization services by about 20% and 30% respectively compared to 2020. This highlights the need for new and sustained approaches to improving immunization coverage and uptake.",
          "“The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose serious challenges to global health beyond the impact of the disease itself,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “For children, disruptions to immunization services have serious consequences. As we scale up delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, we have to ensure that this does not come at the cost of essential childhood vaccinations. We cannot allow today’s fight against COVID-19 to undermine our fight against measles, polio or other vaccine preventable illnesses. Prolonged immunization disruptions will have long-term consequences for children’s health. The time to catch up is now.”",
          "Meanwhile, nearly 40% of countries are also reporting disruptions to one or more malaria services. While progress compared to 2020 – with about 10% fewer countries reporting disruptions to malaria diagnosis and treatment and 25-33% fewer countries reporting disruptions to malaria prevention campaigns (including distribution of long-lasting insecticide impregnated bed nets, indoor spraying and seasonal malaria chemoprevention), the reported level of disruption is still significant and needs to be urgently addressed.",
          "WHO will continue to support countries so they can respond to increased strains on health systems and rapidly evolving priorities and needs throughout the course of the pandemic, and to ensure that COVID-19 control strategies are in balance strategies to tackle other health priorities and secure continued access to comprehensive care for everyone, including the most vulnerable.",
          "Key support mechanisms include the ACT-Accelerator, which works to speed up equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments, and the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, which guides actions taken at national, regional, and global levels to tackle COVID-19.",
          "The Organization also remains focused on the delivery of the work it has committed to before the COVID-19 pandemic started. Internally, through the “Boost initiative” and the UHC Partnership, which covers 115 countries, WHO has strengthened its capacity to provide additional support to countries so they can maintain essential health services during the pandemic, and advance progress towards universal health coverage.",
          "Note to editors",
          "This survey looks at 63 core health services across delivery platforms and health areas. It was sent to 216 countries and territories across the six WHO regions. 135 responses were received (63% response rate) from senior ministry of health officials predominantly between January and March 2021. The responses referred to the situation in the country during the 3 months prior to survey submission (in this case predominantly covering periods between October 2020-February 2021).",
          "The purpose of the survey was to gain insights and perspectives on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on essential health services and how countries are adapting strategies to maintain essential services. This survey round follows up WHOs previous pulse surveys on continuity of essential health services distributed throughout quarters 2 and 3 of 2020, including: Pulse survey on continuity of essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic ; Rapid assessment on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on noncommunicable disease resources and services ; Rapid assessment on the impact of COVID-19 on mental, neurological and substance use services ; and Round 1 and Round 2 pulse surveys on immunization.",
          "While pulse surveys have limitations such as possible reporting bias and representativeness, the strength of this effort is that it is comprehensive, and delivers information rapidly."

          "Of the 87 countries with malaria, 46 reported fewer than 10 000 cases of the disease in 2019 compared to 26 countries in 2000. By the end of 2020, 24 countries had reported interrupting malaria transmission for 3 years or more. Of these, 11 were certified malaria-free by WHO.",

          "Most countries that reach zero malaria have strong primary health care systems that ensure access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment services, without financial hardship, for everyone living within their borders – regardless of nationality or legal status.",
          "Robust data systems are also key to success, together with strong community engagement. Many countries that eliminate malaria have relied on dedicated networks of volunteer health workers to detect and treat the disease in remote and hard-to-reach areas."

Since the early days of the pandemic, WHO has urged countries to maintain essential health services, including for malaria, while ensuring that communities and health workers are protected from COVID-19 transmission.",
          "Heeding the call, many malaria-endemic countries mounted impressive responses to the pandemic, adapting the way they deliver malaria services to the COVID-19 restrictions imposed by governments. As a result of these efforts, the worst-case scenario of a WHO modelling analysis was likely averted. The analysis found that if access to nets and antimalarial medicines was severely curtailed, the number of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double in 2020 compared to 2018.",
          "However, more than one year into the pandemic, substantial disruptions to health services persist across the globe. According to the results of a new WHO survey, approximately one third of countries around the world reported disruptions in malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment services during the first quarter of 2021.",
          "In many countries, lockdowns and restrictions on the movement of people and goods have led to delays in the delivery of insecticide-treated mosquito nets or indoor insecticide spraying campaigns. Malaria diagnosis and treatment services were interrupted as many people were unable – or unwilling – to seek care in health facilities.",
          "WHO is calling on all people living in malaria affected countries to “beat the fear”: people with a fever should go to the nearest health facility to be tested for malaria and receive the care they need, within the context of national COVID-19 protocols.",
          "Note to the\r\neditor Malaria by\r\nnumbers: global and regional burden In 2019,\r\nthere were an estimated 229 million cases of malaria and 409 000\r\nmalaria-related deaths in 87 countries. Children under the age of 5 years in\r\nsub-Saharan Africa continued to account for approximately two thirds of global\r\ndeaths from malaria. The WHO\r\nAfrican Region shouldered 94% of all malaria cases and deaths worldwide in\r\n2019. About 3% per cent of malaria cases in 2019 were reported in the WHO\r\nSouth-East Asia Region and 2% in the WHO Region for the Eastern Mediterranean.\r\nThe WHO Western Pacific Region and the WHO Region of the Americas each\r\naccounted for fewer than 1% of all cases. Target: zero\r\nmalaria Although progress\r\nin the global response to malaria has stalled in recent years, a growing number\r\nof countries with a low burden of malaria are approaching, and achieving, the\r\ntarget of zero malaria transmission. Between 2000 and 2020, 24 countries\r\nreported zero indigenous cases of malaria for 3 or more years. These countries\r\ninclude: Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cabo Verde, China, Egypt, El\r\nSalvador, Georgia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,\r\nMalaysia, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Sri Lanka, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan,\r\nTurkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and the United Arab Emirates. W HO malaria-free certification Certification of malaria elimination is the official\r\nrecognition by WHO of a country’s malaria-free status. WHO grants the\r\ncertification when a country has proven that the chain of indigenous malaria\r\ntransmission has been interrupted nationwide for at least the past three\r\nconsecutive years. A country must also demonstrate the capacity to prevent the\r\nre-establishment of transmission. Globally, 39 countries and territories have achieved this milestone.

Countries that have been certified malaria-free must remain\r\nvigilant to prevent a return of the disease. Any imported cases of the disease\r\nmust be identified and treated rapidly. Countries should maintain up-to-date\r\nmalaria surveillance systems and ensure that health workers at all levels are\r\ncontinuously trained in how to prevent, detect and treat the disease."

          "From today, young people around the world will be able to apply for funding to support innovative Local Solutions to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of a new initiative called the Global Youth Mobilization .\r\n Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, climate change activist Greta Thunberg and youth representatives from the Global Youth Mobilization will launch the call for applications at a press conference on Monday 19 April 2021 at 1700 CEST.",
          "Led by the Big 6 Youth Organizations and backed by the WHO and United Nations Foundation, the Global Youth Mobilization is an initiative of young people and voluntary organizations taking action to improve their lives now and in a post-COVID-19\r\n    world.",
          "Hundreds of millions of young people have had to put their lives on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 90 per cent of young people have reported increased mental anxiety during the pandemic; more than one billion students in almost every country have\r\n    been impacted by school closures; 80 per cent of young women are worried about their future; and one in six young people worldwide have lost their jobs during the pandemic. [1]",
          "The Global Youth Mobilization Local Solutions funding will by-pass traditional funding and support streams to invest in young people and community grassroots organizations anywhere in the world. A world first at this scale and level of ambition, young\r\n    people and community organizations are able to apply for funding via one centralised platform, available in multiple languages. These local solutions will be judged and decided on by young people, for young people.",
          "Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said: “WHO is committed to ensuring the voices, energy and solutions offered by youth are at the centre of the world’s recovery from COVID-19. Our collaboration with the\r\n    Big 6 and the United Nations Foundation will fuel wide-ranging actions led by young people to address the challenges their own communities face, and will also provide global platforms for their wisdom and ideas to be heard and acted on.”",
          "From education disruption and job losses, to a decline in mental health and rising gender-based violence, the Global Youth Mobilization will support young people to overcome the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. An initial $2 million of funding\r\n    will be available in four tiers, from $500 through to $5,000 and an ‘accelerator’ program will scale and replicate the most promising solutions, with further funding lined up over the coming months.",
          "A Global Youth Summit, to be held virtually on 23- 25 April, marks the starting point for young people to get involved in the mobilization. Over the three days, thousands of young people, leaders, policy makers and changemakers will come\r\n    together in one space to discuss the issues facing young people across the world.",
          "The mobilization is being supported by Governments, UN agencies and Royal Families including, the Queen of Malaysia, the President of Kenya, President of Ghana, the Vice President of Nigeria, the Government of Fiji, the Prime Minister of Belgium, the\r\n    Government of Singapore as well as the European Commission, USAID, UNICEF and UN Population Fund. More details, and further Government support, will be announced at the Global Youth Summit.",
          "The Global Youth Mobilization and its supporters are calling on governments, businesses, and policy makers to back the initiative and commit to prioritising young people in their policies and investing in their futures.",
          "Funded by the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund , other supporting global partners include high-profile brands and advocates, including: Salesforce, FIFA, the Special Olympics, UNHCR,\r\n    Cambridge International, Peace First, Generation Unlimited and Influential.",
          "Dr Tedros will open the Global Youth Summit alongside Youth Representatives of the Global Youth Mobilization Board. It will feature youth activists from hundreds of countries, three plenary sessions with high-profile speakers, and over 60 interactive\r\n    breakout sessions involving a range of partners. The Summit will be available to anyone, via broadcast and in five core languages: English, French, Spanish, Arabic and Russian.",
          "Daisy Moran, Youth Board Representative, Global Youth Mobilization Board , said: “This is a pivotal moment for our generation. The Global Youth Mobilization provides\r\n    an opportunity for young people to take an active role in the immediate and long-term recovery from the impact of COVID-19. Our experiences, creativity and passions will inform policies and decisions affecting all our lives and I urge people to apply\r\n    for the funding available. Together, as campaigners, members of youth focused organisations, global health actors, and volunteers from around the world, we are calling for action now.”",

          "A very rare new type of adverse event called Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS), involving unusual and severe blood clotting events associated with low platelet counts, has been reported after vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccines Vaxzevria and Covishield. A specific case definition for TTS is being developed by the Brighton Collaboration 1 . This will assist in identifying and evaluating reported TTS events and aid in supporting causality assessments.",
          "The biological mechanism for this syndrome of TTS is still being investigated. At this stage, a ‘platform specific’ mechanism related to the adenovirus-vectored vaccines is not certain but cannot be excluded. Ongoing review of TTS cases and related research should include all vaccines using adenoviral vector platforms. The GACVS noted that an investigation has been initiated into the occurrence of TTS following the Johnson & Johnson vaccine administered in the United States. The TTS syndrome has not been linked to mRNA-based vaccines (such as Comirnaty or the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine).",
          "Based on latest available data, the risk of TTS with Vaxzevria and Covishield vaccines appears to be very low. Data from the UK suggest the risk is approximately four cases per million adults (1 case per 250 000) who receive the vaccine, while the rate is estimated to be approximately 1 per 100 000 in the European Union (EU). Countries assessing the risk of TTS following COVID-19 vaccination should perform a benefit-risk analysis that takes into account local epidemiology (including incidence and mortality from COVID-19 disease), age groups targeted for vaccination and the availability of alternative vaccines.",
          "Work is ongoing to understand risk factors for TTS. Some investigators have looked into rates of TTS by age 2 .  GACVS supports further research to understand age-related risk because while available data suggest an increased risk in younger adults, this requires further analysis. On the issue of sex-related risk, although more cases have been reported in females, it is important to underscore that more women have been vaccinated and that some TTS cases have also been reported in men. Therefore, further analysis is required to determine any sex-related risk. GACVS recommends further epidemiological, clinical and mechanistic studies to fully understand TTS.",
          "Thrombosis in specific sites (such as the brain and abdomen) appears to be a key feature of TTS. Clinicians should be alert to any new, severe, persistent headache or other significant symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain and shortness of breath, with an onset between 4 to 20 days after adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccination.",
          "At a minimum, countries should encourage clinicians to measure platelet levels and conduct appropriate radiological imaging studies as part of the investigation of thrombosis.  Clinicians should also be aware that although heparin is used to treat blood clots in general, administration of heparin in TTS may be dangerous, and alternative treatments such as immunoglobulins and non-heparin anticoagulants should be considered.",
          "There may be a geographic variation in the risk of these rare adverse events. It is therefore important to evaluate potential cases of TTS in all countries. Countries are encouraged to review, report and investigate all cases of TTS following COVID-19 vaccinations. Countries should assess cases according to the presence of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia and the time to onset following vaccination, using the Brighton Case Definition of TTS.",
          "Whilst we have some information on Comirnaty, Moderna (mRNA-1273), Vaxzevria and Covishield vaccines, there is limited post-market surveillance data on other COVID-19 vaccines and from low- and middle-income countries. GACVS highly recommends that all countries conduct safety surveillance on all COVID-19 vaccines and provide data to their local authorities and to the WHO global database of individual case safety reports. This is urgently needed to support evidence-based recommendations on these life-saving vaccines.",
          "Open, transparent, and evidence-based communication about the potential benefits and risks to recipients and the community is essential to maintain trust. WHO is carefully monitoring the rollout of all COVID-19 vaccines and will continue to work closely with countries to manage potential risks, and to use science and data to drive response and recommendations.",

And a high proportion of people who are severely ill in hospital with COVID-19 have diabetes. The Global Diabetes Compact will help to catalyze\r\n    political commitment for action to increase the accessibility and affordability of life-saving medicines for diabetes and also for its prevention and diagnosis.”",

          "The introduction of a pilot programme for WHO prequalification of insulin in 2019 has been an important step. Currently the insulin market is dominated by three companies. Prequalification of insulin produced by more manufacturers could help increase\r\n    the availability of quality-assured insulin to countries that are currently not meeting demand. In addition, discussions are already underway with manufacturers of insulin and other diabetes medicines and diagnostic tools about avenues that could\r\n    help meet demand at prices that countries can afford.",

          "People watching the Summit will hear from people living with diabetes from India, Lebanon, Singapore, the United Republic of Tanzania, the USA and Zimbabwe about the challenges they face in managing their diabetes and how these could be overcome. Part\r\n    of the Summit has been co-designed with people who live with diabetes and will give them a global platform to explain what they are expecting from the Compact and how they would like to be involved in its further development and implementation.",
          "“It is time to create momentum not just for living with diabetes, but thriving with it,” said Dr Apoorva Gomber, a diabetes advocate living with type 1 diabetes who is taking part in the Summit. “We must grab the opportunity of the Compact\r\n    with both hands and use it to ensure that we can look back in a few years’ time and say that, finally, our countries are equipped to help people with diabetes live healthy and productive lives.”",

Our collective future, literally, depends on it.”",
          "\"This is a significant milestone in the fight against COVID-19. Faced with the rapid spread of COVID-19 variants, global access to vaccines is fundamentally important to reduce the prevalence of the disease, slow down viral mutation, and hasten the end\r\n    of the pandemic,” said Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). “The extraordinary scientific achievements of the last year must now be matched by an unprecedented effort to protect the most\r\n    vulnerable, so the global community must remain firmly focused on reducing the equity gap in COVID-19 vaccine distribution.\"",

With variants emerging all over the world, we need to speed up global rollout. To do this, we need governments, along with other partners, to take necessary steps to increase supply, including\r\n    by simplifying barriers to intellectual property rights, eliminating direct and indirect measures that restrict exports of COVID-19 vaccines, and donating excess vaccine doses as quickly as possible.”",
          "According to its latest supply forecast, COVAX expects to deliver at least 2 billion doses of vaccines in 2021. In order to reach this goal, the COVAX Facility will continue to diversify its portfolio further, and will announce new agreements with vaccine\r\n    manufacturers in due course.",
          "Furthermore, in March it was announced that the United States government will host the launch event for the 2021 Gavi COVAX AMC Invest Opportunity to catalyze further commitment and support for accelerated access to vaccines for AMC-supported economies. An additional US$ 2 billion is required in 2021 to finance and secure up to a total of 1.8 billion donor-funded doses of vaccines.

But the fight against the virus is far from over: we must\r\n    continue to support COVAX and accelerate equitable access to vaccines in fragile countries, in particular through sharing of vaccine doses. This is what France wants to do, together with its EU and G7 partners.”",
          "Dr Gerd Müller, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany said: “We either beat the pandemic worldwide or we will not beat it at all. The only way out of the crisis is a global immunization campaign.\r\n    In order to now be able to vaccinate people quickly, we are using the tried and tested structures of the global vaccine alliance Gavi. Thanks to the vaccination platform COVAX, the structures are in place to provide vaccines for at least 20 per\r\n    cent of people in developing countries and emerging economies over the course of this year.”",
          "Heiko Maas, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Germany said: “The fact that St.Lucia yesterday became the 100th country to be supplied with vaccines via the COVAX platform supported by Germany and the EU, is a milestone on the way out\r\n    of the pandemic. This progress gives us hope, for we too will only be safe when everyone around the world is safe. Access to vaccines, medicines and tests must not become a geopolitical pawn. Rather, they must be available to all countries in a fair\r\n    and transparent manner. That’s why we’re committed to COVAX, to a multilateral approach.”",
          "Colm Brophy TD, Minister of State for Overseas Development and the Diaspora, Ireland said: “Through our funding to COVAX, Ireland is supporting developing countries, who most need vaccines and can least afford them, secure their\r\n    share of global supply.”",
          "Dag-Inge Ulstein, Minister of International Development, Norway, and Co-chair of the ACT-Accelerator Facilitation Council said: “In less than a year, the world has come together to develop and secure equitable global access to COVID-19\r\n    vaccines. That is a huge victory. But the risk of vaccine nationalism is still looming large. Countries and manufactures must prioritize global solutions. It is also crucial that all manufacturers continue to make their vaccines available and affordable\r\n    to COVAX, so that the global rollout can continue. Countries that have more vaccines than they need should share vaccines through COVAX. I also expect all relevant stakeholders to take action to ensure that the world can produce enough vaccines, at\r\n    a price that even the poorest countries can afford.”",
          "H.E. Dr Tawfig AlRabiah, Minister of Health in Saudi Arabia said: “‘People’s health first’ has been the guiding principle, driving all efforts in the fight against the pandemic - both nationally and globally -\r\n    to ensure that “No one is left behind”. We in the kingdom are proud contributors to GAVI and the COVAX facility, which has now shipped over 37 million vaccines. This show of solidarity is the cure to fighting COVID-19, and our\r\n    collective resilience will enable us to overcome any future pandemic we may face.”",
          "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office Minister Wendy Morton, United Kingdom said: “From Nigeria to Nepal, COVAX has now delivered life-saving vaccine doses to 100 countries and territories which is a huge achievement and\r\n    another step towards making us all safe. The UK has played a leading role in achieving equitable access to vaccines by providing £548 million for COVAX early on, which will help to deliver more than one billion doses around the world, as well\r\n    as lobbying international partners to increase their funding.”",
          "United States Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said: “The United States welcomes the news that COVAX has delivered safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to 100 countries.  The United States signaled our strong support for\r\n    COVAX through an initial $2 billion contribution to Gavi.  Through unprecedented partnerships among donors, manufacturers, and participating countries, COVAX has achieved extraordinary milestones in equitably distributing doses to the global\r\n    community in record time.”",
          "Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank said: “As part of Team Europe the European Investment Bank is pleased to provide EUR 400 million for COVAX, representing the EIB’s largest ever support for global public\r\n    health. COVAX has already provided vaccines to vulnerable groups and front line workers and brought hope to millions more. COVAX demonstrates the benefit of global cooperation to tackle the shared challenge of COVID. Congratulations to the COVAX team\r\n    and global partners in 100 countries around the world. Together we are ensuring equitable access to vaccines and together we are directing our efforts towards a global recovery.”",
          "Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca CEO , said: “Today marks a significant milestone in the global fight against the pandemic as 100 countries have received vaccine through COVAX. I am proud that the supply of our vaccine accounts for the\r\n    vast majority of doses being delivered through COVAX in the first half of this year. Over 37 million doses of our vaccine have been delivered to date which are protecting the most vulnerable populations around the world.  Together with our COVAX\r\n    partners, we continue to work 24/7 to deliver on our unwavering commitment to broad, equitable and affordable access.”",
          "Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said: “Congratulations to everyone who has worked tirelessly to reach this impressive milestone. At Pfizer we are driven every day by the belief that science will win. Through collaboration\r\n    and commitment, COVAX has brought forth a global solution that helps to bring breakthrough science to everyone, everywhere. We are proud to work together with the facility and all of its partners and remain firmly committed to working toward\r\n    the shared vision of equitable access for all to end this pandemic.”",
          "Sai D. Prasad, President, Developing Countries Vaccines Manufacturing Network (DCVMN) said: “COVAX has made history by ensuring equitable access for COVID-19 vaccines to all countries irrespective of their economic\r\n    status. The 100 th delivery marks a great milestone for COVAX, leading to enhanced deliveries during 2021. We commend the efforts by all partners in COVAX for this achievement. Developed and developing country manufacturers have played a\r\n    crucial role in product development and large scale manufacturing. In order to meet the requirements of all countries, more partnerships between innovators and manufacturers are required. COVAX’s leadership in COVID-19 vaccines will ensure that\r\n    we leave no one behind.”",
          "Thomas Cueni, Director General, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) & founding partner of ACT-A said: “The timeline is truly impressive. It's an innovation\r\n    success story with the first WHO vaccine approval on 31 December 2020, less than a year after the virus was first shared.  It’s a manufacturing success story with the scaling up from zero to one billion doses being produced by April 2021.\r\n     It is a logistics and country preparedness success story, with 100 countries receiving the vaccines and last but by no means least, it's a collaboration and solidarity success story, thanks to the commitment from donors and the tireless efforts\r\n    of the partners of COVAX including the developing and the developed world manufacturers. COVAX’s partnerships together with political leadership to equitably share surplus vaccines are the best guarantees we have that people who need the vaccine\r\n    will get it whenever they live, fast enough to outpace the virus’ mutations.”"

However, individuals who experience any severe symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain, neurological symptoms, such as severe and persistent headaches or blurred vision, tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the site of the injection - from around four to 20 days following vaccination, should seek urgent medical attention. Clinicians should be aware of relevant case definitions and clinical guidance for patients presenting thrombosis and thrombocytopaenia following COVID-19 vaccination .

          "As countries move forward post-COVID-19, it will be vital to avoid cuts in public spending on health and other social sectors. Such cuts are likely to increase hardship among already disadvantaged groups, weaken health system performance, increase health\r\n    risks, add to fiscal pressure in the future and undermine development gains.",
          "Instead, governments should meet WHO’s recommended target of spending an additional 1% of GDP on primary health care (PHC). Evidence reveals that PHC-oriented health systems have consistently produced better health outcomes, enhanced equity,\r\n    and improved efficiency. Scaling up PHC interventions across low- and middle-income countries could save 60 million lives and increase average life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030.",
          "Governments must also reduce the global shortfall of 18 million health workers needed to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030. This includes creating at least 10 million additional full-time jobs globally and strengthening gender equality efforts.\r\n    Women deliver most of the world’s health and social care, representing up to 70% of all health and care workers, but they are denied equal opportunities to lead it. Key solutions include equal pay to reduce the gender pay gap and recognizing\r\n    unpaid health care work by women."

          "In his role as WHO Special Envoy for the ACT-Accelerator, Carl Bildt will help lead the collective advocacy for the ACT-Accelerator, mobilizing support and resources so it can deliver against its strategy for 2021 .",
          "He will also support the leaders of the ACT-Accelerator co-convening agencies, particularly in aligning work that cuts across the diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines pillars and health-system connector; consult widely on the work of the ACT-Accelerator; advise the Director-General, ACT-Accelerator principals and stakeholders on emerging issues; and represent the ACT-Accelerator in key national and international fora.",
          "Carl Bildt joins the ACT-Accelerator at a pivotal time when the world rolls out vaccines against COVID-19, introduces new diagnostics and scales up life-saving oxygen and corticosteroids for severe disease, while addressing the uneven distribution of vaccines globally and the emergence of new variants of concern.",
          "The past year has highlighted the need for a globally coordinated response to the pandemic that prioritizes equitable access to COVID-19 tools and is fueled by sufficient financial investment. The ACT-Accelerator partnership, of leading public health organizations, is the only global initiative offering an integrated, end-to-end solution to expedite the end of the pandemic through the equitable distribution of vaccines, tests and treatments.",
          "Carl Bildt has had an extensive career dedicated to working for the global common good. He served as both Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Sweden, and is a renowned international diplomat, having been EU Special Envoy to the Former Yugoslavia; High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina; UN Special Envoy to the Balkan;, and Co-Chair of the Dayton Peace Conference.",
          "Dr Tedros said, “Former Prime Minister Bildt’s appointment as Special Envoy for the ACT -Accelerator comes at a time when global solidarity and equitable access to life-saving tools are more important than ever. We are fortunate to have him in this important leadership role, helping us to get therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines to health workers and vulnerable populations around the world.”",
          "Carl Bildt, said: “I am honoured to have been appointed as WHO Special Envoy for the ACT-Accelerator. As a unique instrument of coordination for the global effort to fight the pandemic, the ACT-Accelerator has proved its worth during the past year. But with infections rising in all regions of the world, and with the danger of vaccine nationalism growing, work must be intensified across the entire range of efforts to fight the pandemic. It’s a question of saving lives, protecting health systems and getting the global economy going again.”",

          "The Access to COVID-19 Tools ACT-Accelerator, is the proven, up-and-running global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. It was set up in response to a call from G20 leaders in March and launched by the WHO, European Commission, France and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in April 2020.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator is not a decision-making body or a new organization but works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organizations to end the pandemic. It is a framework for collaboration that has been designed to bring key players around the table with the goal of ending the pandemic as quickly as possible through the accelerated development, equitable allocation, and scaled up delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines, thereby protecting health systems and restoring societies and economies in the near term. It draws on the experience of leading global health organizations which are tackling the world’s toughest health challenges, and who, by working together, are able to unlock new and more ambitious results against COVID-19. Its members share a commitment to ensure all people have access to all the tools needed to defeat COVID-19 and to work with unprecedented levels of partnership to achieve it.",

In 2021, it is focused on procuring and distributing at least 900 million molecular and AG-RDTs to LMICs.",
              "The therapeutics pillar is led by Unitaid and Wellcome. Therapeutics can play a role in all stages of COVID-19 disease: to prevent infection; suppress symptoms and spread of infection to others; treat or prevent symptoms; as a life-saving treatment for severe symptoms; and as a treatment that can speed up recovery. The aim in the next 12 months is to develop, manufacture and distribute millions of treatment doses, helping COVID-19 sufferers to recover from the disease.",
              "The vaccines pillar, convened by CEPI, Gavi and WHO, is speeding up the search for an effective vaccine for all countries. At the same time, it is supporting the building of manufacturing capabilities, and buying supply, ahead of time so that at least 2 billion doses can be fairly distributed to the most high risk and highly exposed populations globally by the end of 2021.",

With significant advances in research and development by academia, private sector and government initiatives, the ACT-Accelerator has advanced our understanding of what works to fight the disease. It has transformed our ability to tackle COVID-19 on a global scale: vaccines are poised to roll-out worldwide, low-cost high-performing antigen rapid diagnostic tests can now detect transmission anywhere, affordable therapy for severe disease can save lives in any setting, and health systems are being prepared for the roll out of tools.",

          "About COVAX",
          "COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-convened by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership\r\n    with UNICEF as key implementing partner, developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available\r\n    worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.",
          "CEPI’s role in COVAX",
          "CEPI is leading on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio , investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support development of three safe and effective vaccines which can be made\r\n    available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility to a number of candidates, and made strategic investments in vaccine\r\n    manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine. CEPI is also investing in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine\r\n    candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.",
          "Gavi’s role in COVAX",
          "Gavi is leading on procurement and delivery at scale for COVAX: coordinating the design, implementation and administration of the COVAX Facility and the COVAX AMC and working with its Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery. As part of this role, Gavi hosts the Office of the COVAX Facility to\r\n    coordinate the operation and governance of the mechanism as a whole, manages relationships with Facility participants, and negotiates advance purchase agreements with manufacturers of promising vaccine candidates on behalf of the 190 economies participating\r\n    in the COVAX Facility. It also coordinates design, operation and fundraising for the COVAX AMC that supports 92 lower-income economies, including a no-fault compensation mechanism that will be administered by WHO. As part of this work, Gavi supports\r\n    governments and partners on ensuring country readiness, providing funding and oversight of UNICEF procurement of vaccines as well as partners’ and governments work on readiness and delivery. This includes support for cold chain equipment, technical\r\n    assistance, syringes, vehicles, and other aspects of the vastly complex logistical operation for delivery.",
          "WHO’s role in COVAX",
          "WHO has multiple roles within COVAX : It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery. Its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts ( SAGE ) on Immunization develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations. Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL) / prequalification programmes ensure harmonized review and authorization across member states.\r\n    It provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination. WHO leads, together with UNICEF, the Country Readiness and Delivery workstream , which provides support to countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines. Along with Gavi and numerous other partners working at the global, regional,\r\n    and country-level, the CRD workstream provides tools, guidance, monitoring, and on the ground technical assistance for the planning and roll-out of the vaccines . Along with COVAX partners, WHO has developed a no-fault compensation scheme as part of the time-limited indemnification and liability commitments.",
          "UNICEF’s role in COVAX",
          "UNICEF is leveraging its experience as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world and working with manufacturers and partners on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as freight, logistics and storage. UNICEF already procures more than\r\n    2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. In collaboration with the PAHO Revolving Fund, UNICEF is leading efforts to procure and supply doses of COVID-19 vaccines for COVAX.\r\n    In addition, UNICEF, Gavi and WHO are working with governments around the clock to ensure that countries are ready to receive the vaccines, with appropriate cold chain equipment in place and health workers trained to dispense them. UNICEF is also\r\n    playing a lead role in efforts to foster trust in vaccines, delivering vaccine confidence communications and tracking and addressing misinformation around the world.",
          "About ACT-Accelerator",
          "The Access to COVID-19 Tools ACT-Accelerator, is a new, ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. It was set up in response to a call from G20 leaders\r\n    in March 2020 and launched by the WHO, European Commission, France and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in April 2020.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator is not a decision-making body or a new organisation, but works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organisations to end the pandemic. It is a framework for collaboration that has been designed to bring key players around\r\n    the table with the goal of ending the pandemic as quickly as possible through the accelerated development, equitable allocation, and scaled up delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines, thereby protecting health systems and restoring societies and\r\n    economies in the near term. It draws on the experience of leading global health organisations which are tackling the world’s toughest health challenges, and who, by working together, are able to unlock new and more ambitious results against\r\n    COVID-19. Its members share a commitment to ensure all people have access to all the tools needed to defeat COVID-19 and to work with unprecedented levels of partnership to achieve it.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator has four areas of work: diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines and the health system connector. Cross-cutting all of these is the workstream on Access & Allocation."

          "The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered devastating consequences for human life and the global economy. Maritime and air transport are two essential activities that underpin global trade and mobility and are key to a sustainable socio-economic recovery.",
          "More than 80% of global trade by volume is moved by maritime transport. The global economy depends on the world’s 2 million seafarers who operate the global fleet of merchant ships. Seafarers have been severely impacted by the travel restrictions imposed during the pandemic. As of January 2021, it is estimated that some 400,000 seafarers are stranded on board commercial vessels, long past the expiry of their contracts and unable to be repatriated. A similar number of seafarers urgently need to join ships to replace them.",
          "Passenger air transport carried about 5.7 billion passengers in 2019 while airfreight represents 35% of the value of goods shipped in all modes combined. The total number of licensed aviation professionals, which include pilots, air traffic controllers and licensed maintenance technicians, was 887,000 in 2019, according to ICAO personnel statistics.  Application of stringent public health rules to air crew, including quarantine, has resulted in hindered connectivity, operational complexity and significant cost.",
          "Maritime and air transport rely on seafarers and aircrew. They are key workers required to travel across borders at all times, which may result in the need for them to present proof of a COVID-19 vaccination as a condition for entry in some countries. This is despite WHO recommendation that, at the present time, countries should not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination for international travel as a condition of entry, as there are still critical unknowns regarding the efficacy of vaccination in reducing transmission and limited availability of vaccines 1 . For shipping and air transport to continue to operate safely, the safe cross border movement of seafarers and aircrew must be facilitated. We reiterate our call upon countries that have not done so to designate seafarers and aircrew as key workers.",
          "With this statement, our organizations also call on governments to prioritize seafarers and aircrew in their national COVID-19 vaccination programmes, together with other essential workers, in accordance with the advice from the WHO SAGE Roadmap for prioritizing the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the context of limited supply published in November 2020 2 . Seafarers and aircrew need to be protected through vaccination as soon as possible, to facilitate their safe movement across borders. We also call on governments to identify and prepare for the challenges of COVID-19 vaccination of seafarers and aircrew, particularly for seafarers spending long periods of time away from their home country.",
          "Our organizations fully support the timely development of an international harmonized framework for vaccination certificates, to facilitate international travel for seafarers and aircrew.",
          "In December 2020, WHO established a Smart Vaccination Certificate working group to ensure that digitalized versions of vaccine certificates are interoperable 3 , and the UN Crisis Management Team for COVID-19, under the leadership of WHO, recognized that all countries should consider seafarers and aircrew, who are required to travel across borders during the pandemic, for essential allocation of vaccines.",

          "Amid a worsening humanitarian situation in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, reports of indiscriminate and targeted attacks against civilians, including rape and other horrific forms of sexual violence, continue to surface. This must stop.",
          "We call on all State and non-State parties to the conflict to fulfil their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law; ensure their forces respect and protect civilian populations, particularly women and children, from all human rights abuses; explicitly condemn all sexual violence; and take action to bring perpetrators to justice where abuses do occur.",
          "Women and children in affected areas are reporting significant challenges in accessing health, social welfare and justice services. Facility assessments undertaken in some health facilities in the region, including Mekelle, Adigrat and Shire, show gaps in premises’ security, as well as in staffing, services and supplies. Initial assessments of 106 facilities in Tigray between December 2020 and March 2021 show that nearly 70 per cent of facilities were looted, 30 per cent damaged, and only 13 per cent in Tigray were functional. Health services have also been rendered less functional by the displacement of many health-care workers, in addition to non-payment of salaries. Further health service availability assessments of over two thirds of the total 264 facilities in the region report large and widespread disruptions of services. Childhood vaccination services were observed in only 28 per cent of facilities and comprehensive nutrition services available in approximately 29 per cent of functioning facilities.",
          "Only one facility provides the full range of services for clinical management of rape survivors, and emergency contraception is fully available in less than half of the facilities assessed. The lack of direct access to health care also creates an environment of fear accessing health care, especially for women and children, who are already facing frequent and severe security threats and displacement. Moreover, many displaced civilians are sheltering in unfinished or damaged buildings, and most collective centres do not include separate spaces or latrines for women and men, girls and boys, thus increasing risks of gender-based violence (GBV) and the spread of certain infectious diseases.",
          "Preventing and responding to the grave human suffering resulting from this conflict will require a concerted effort at all levels.",
          "First, it is essential that an independent investigation into conflict-related sexual violence in Tigray be initiated, with the involvement of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.",
          "Humanitarian access is essential. Humanitarian staff need to be able to reach all regions of Ethiopia affected by conflict and violence. This includes major towns and rural areas in Tigray, as well as Benishangul Gumuz, Oromia, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples (SNNP) and Amhara, and in the regions hosting thousands of internally displaced people.",
          "When it comes to getting aid staff and supplies into Tigray, notwithstanding recent developments, much more remains to be done. If they are given the access and resources they need, aid agencies will be able to make the desperately needed prevention and response interventions that will save and transform lives, including health services and supplies, GBV case management, dignity kits, post-rape treatment, and safe spaces for women and children. Given the deep trauma many have experienced, support for mental health and psychosocial needs is also required.",
          "It is only with a concerted and comprehensive effort, fully grounded in respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, that the humanitarian response in Tigray will match the scale of humanitarian need, especially for women and children.",

          "An estimated 1.4 million fewer people received care for tuberculosis (TB) in 2020 than in 2019, according to preliminary data compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO) from over 80 countries- a reduction of 21% from 2019. The countries with the\r\n    biggest relative gaps were Indonesia (42%), South Africa (41%), Philippines (37%) and India (25%).",
          "“The effects of COVID-19 go far beyond the death and disease caused by the virus itself. The disruption to essential services for people with TB is just one tragic example of the ways the pandemic is disproportionately affecting some of the world’s\r\n    poorest people, who were already at higher risk for TB,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “These sobering data point to the need for countries to make universal health coverage a key priority as they respond to\r\n    and recover from the pandemic, to ensure access to essential services for TB and all diseases.”",
          "Building up health systems so everyone can get the services they need is key. Some countries have already taken steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on service delivery, by strengthening infection control; expanding use of digital technologies to\r\n    provide remote advice and support, and providing home-based TB prevention and care.",
          "But many people who have TB are unable to access the care they need. WHO fears that over half a million more people may have died from TB, simply because they were unable to obtain a diagnosis.",
          "This is not a new problem: before COVID-19 struck, the gap between the estimated number of people developing TB each year and the annual number of people officially reported as diagnosed with TB was about 3 million. The pandemic has greatly exacerbated\r\n    the situation.",
          "One way to address this is through restored and improved TB screening to rapidly identify people with TB infection or TB disease.  New guidance issued by WHO on World TB Day aims to help countries identify the specific needs of communities, the populations\r\n    at highest risk of TB, and the locations most affected to ensure people can access the most appropriate prevention and care services. This can be achieved through a more systematic use of screening approaches that employ novel tools.",
          "These include the use of molecular rapid diagnostic tests, the use of computer-aided detection to interpret chest radiography and the use of a wider range of approaches for screening people living with HIV for TB. The recommendations are accompanied by\r\n    an operational guide to facilitate roll-out.",
          "But this will not be enough alone. In 2020, in his report to the United Nations General Assembly,  the UN Secretary General issued a set of 10 priority recommendations that countries need to follow. These include activating high-level leadership\r\n    and action across multiple sectors to urgently reduce TB deaths; increasing funding; advancing universal health coverage for TB prevention and care; addressing drug resistance, promoting human rights and intensifying TB research.",

Everything WHO does is about stories, because everything we do is about people. We’re excited about the quantity and quality of entries in this year’s Health for All Film Festival. Ultimately, we hope the festival is not just a way to tell stories, but to change the arc of people’s stories around the world, towards better health.”",
          "The shortlisted films can be viewed by the public as of today through Youtube playlists available on the Festival’s website as well as WHO’s Youtube channel. The public is invited to post comments and questions on the short films and a selection of these questions will be featured during online award ceremonies in May.",

The European Medicines Agency’s Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee has reviewed 18 cases of CVST out of a total of more than 20 million vaccinations with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\r\n        in Europe. A causal relationship between these rare events has not been established at this time (1) .",

          "The report released today by WHO, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), calls for urgent action to combat ageism and better\r\n    measurement and reporting to expose ageism for what it is – an insidious scourge on society.",
          "The response to control the COVID-19 pandemic has unveiled just how widespread ageism is – older and younger people have been stereotyped in public discourse and on social media. In some contexts, age has been used as the sole criterion\r\n    for access to medical care, lifesaving therapies and for physical isolation.",

          "Ageism seeps into many institutions and sectors of society including those providing health and social care, in the workplace, media and the legal system. Healthcare rationing based solely on age is widespread.  A systematic review in 2020 showed\r\n    that in 85 per cent of 149 studies, age determined who received certain medical procedures or treatments.",
          "Both older and younger adults are often disadvantaged in the workplace and access to specialized training and education decline significantly with age. Ageism against younger people manifests across many areas such as employment, health, housing and politics\r\n    where younger people’s voices are often denied or dismissed.",
          "“Ageism towards younger and older people is prevalent, unrecognized, unchallenged and has far-reaching consequences for our economies and societies,” said Maria-Francesca Spatolisano, Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and\r\n    Inter-Agency Affairs in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. “Together, we can prevent this. Join the movement and combat ageism.”",
          "Ageism has serious and wide-ranging consequences for people’s health and well-being. Among older people, ageism is associated with poorer physical and mental health, increased social isolation and loneliness, greater financial insecurity, decreased\r\n    quality of life and premature death. An estimated 6.3 million cases of depression globally are estimated to be attributable to ageism.  It intersects and exacerbates other forms of bias and disadvantage including those related to sex, race and\r\n    disability leading to a negative impact on people’s health and well-being.",
          "“The pandemic has put into stark relief the vulnerabilities of older people, especially those most marginalized, who often face overlapping discrimination and barriers – because they are poor, live with disabilities, are women living alone,\r\n    or belong to minority groups,” said Natalia Kanem, Executive Director, United Nations Population Fund. “Let’s make this crisis a turning point in the way we see, treat and respond to older people, so that together we can build the\r\n    world of health, well-being and dignity for all ages that we all want.\"",
          "Ageism costs our societies billions of dollars. In the United States of America (USA), a 2020 study showed ageism in the form of negative age stereotypes and self-perceptions led to excess annual costs of US$63 billion for the eight most expensive health\r\n    conditions. This amounts to US$1 in every US$7 spent on these conditions for all Americans over the age of 60 for one year (see note to editors).",
          "Estimates in Australia suggest that if 5 per cent more people aged 55 or older were employed, there would be a positive impact of AUD$48 billion on the national economy annually. There are currently limited data and information on the economic costs of\r\n    ageism and more research is needed to better understand its economic impact, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.",
          "“Ageism harms everyone – old and young. But often, it is so widespread and accepted – in our attitudes and in policies, laws and institutions – that we do not even recognize its detrimental effect on our dignity and rights said\r\n    Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. “We need to fight ageism head-on, as a deep-rooted human rights violation.”"

              "Excess costs of health care: Ageism influences health through three pathways: psychological, behavioural and physiological. Psychologically, negative age stereotypes can exacerbate stress; behaviourally, negative self-perceptions of ageing predict\r\n        worse health behaviour, such as noncompliance with prescribed medications; physiologically, negative age stereotypes predict detrimental brain changes decades later, including the accumulation of plaques and tangles and reduction in the size of\r\n        the hippocampus. In the USA, ageism led to excess costs of US$63 billion for a broad range of health conditions during one year. This amounts to US$1 of every US$7 spent on the eight most expensive health conditions for all Americans\r\n        over the age of 60 during one year. The excess health care spending due to ageism was derived from the following: (a) number of Americans aged 60 years or older in 2013; (b) prevalence of interpersonal and self-directed ageism based on percentage\r\n        of people that agree to the following statements: “You are treated with less courtesy or respect than other people”, “Forgetfulness is a natural occurrence just from growing old” and “The older I get the more useless\r\n        I feel.” (c) evidence of the impact of such ageist statements on the eight health conditions; (d) prevalence of the eight health conditions in 2013, the most recent year for which health care spending was available; and (e) Institute for\r\n        Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) costs per person of the eight health conditions in 2013.  More information: https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/60/1/174/5166947 ."

It seriously harms the health of a child, and may drive a child to later engage in tobacco use, which will increase risk of serious health harms throughout\r\n    life,” she said."

          "New research from WHO and partners shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is severely affecting the quality of care given to small and sick newborns, resulting in unnecessary suffering and deaths.",
          "A study published in the Lancet EclinicalMedicine highlights the critical importance of ensuring newborn babies have close contact with parents after birth, especially for those born too small (at low birthweight) or too soon (preterm). However, in many countries, if COVID-19 infections are confirmed or suspected, newborn babies are being routinely separated from their mothers, putting them at higher risk of death and lifelong health complications.",
          "This is especially the case in the poorest countries where the greatest number of preterm births and infant deaths occur. According to the report, disruptions to kangaroo mother care – which involves close contact between a parent, usually a mother, and a newborn baby - will worsen these risks.",
          "Up to 125 000 babies’ lives could be saved with full coverage of kangaroo mother care. For babies born preterm or at low birthweight, kangaroo mother care (early, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with a parent and exclusive breastfeeding) is particularly critical. Among infants born preterm or at low birthweight, kangaroo mother care has been shown to reduce infant deaths by as much as 40%, hypothermia by more than 70%, and severe infections by 65%.",
          "“Disruptions to essential health services during COVID-19 have severely affected the quality of care provided to some of the most vulnerable babies, and this includes their right to the lifesaving contact they need with their parents,” said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director for Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing at WHO . “Decades of progress in reducing child deaths will be jeopardized unless we act now to protect and improve quality care services for mothers and newborns, and expand coverage of lifesaving interventions like kangaroo mother care.”",
          "WHO advises that mothers should continue to share a room with their babies from birth and be able to breastfeed and practice skin-to-skin contact – even when COVID-19 infections are suspected or confirmed - and should be supported to ensure appropriate infection prevention practices.",
          "“Much more attention is needed to ensure health practitioners and policymakers globally are aware of the need to keep mothers and babies together in these critical early days, especially for babies born too small or too soon,” said Queen Dube, Director of Health at the Ministry of Health in Malawi , one of the report authors. “Kangaroo Mother Care is one of our most cost-effective ways to protect small and sick newborns. According to our analysis, these risks by far outweigh the small chance of a newborn baby getting severe disease from COVID-19.”",
          "“Kangaroo mother care is among the best interventions to improve a premature or low birthweight baby’s chances of survival, especially in low-income countries,” she added.",
          "Evidence suggests that disruptions to kangaroo mother care may already be worryingly widespread. A systematic review of 20 clinical guidelines from 17 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic found that one-third recommended separation of mothers and newborns if the mother has or may have COVID-19. In a global survey of thousands of neonatal healthcare providers, published today in a related paper in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) Global Health , two-thirds of health workers in 62 countries reported they do not allow mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 to practice routine skin to skin contact, while nearly one-quarter did not allow breastfeeding, even by uninfected caregivers.",
          "Studies have reported mainly no symptoms or mild disease from COVID-19 in infected newborns, with low risk of neonatal death. This new study estimates that the risk of newborns catching COVID-19 would result in fewer than 2000 deaths.",
          "However, infection during pregnancy may result in increased risk of preterm birth, which means it is even more important to ensure the right care is given to support preterm babies and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "According to the most recent estimates, 15 million babies are born preterm (before 37 weeks) each year and 21 million are born at low birthweight (under 2.5kg). These babies face significant health risks including disabilities, developmental delays and infections, while prematurity-related complications are the leading causes of death of newborns and children under 5.",
          "About the study",
          "WHO authors have contributed to the following paper: Preterm care during the COVID-19 pandemic: A comparative risk analysis of neonatal deaths averted by kangaroo mother care versus mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in The Lancet Eclinical Medicine. A related study by the COVID-19 Small and Sick Newborn Care Collaborative Group was published today in the British Medical Journal , Small and sick newborn care during the COVID-19 pandemic: global survey and thematic analysis of healthcare providers’ voices and experiences .

Powered by the UN Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, it was developed as an innovative platform to enable private companies, individuals and other organizations to contribute directly to WHO’s efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to COVID-19 around the world.",
          "The fund’s first year has seen unprecedented solidarity: to date, more than 661 000 donors have contributed nearly US$ 250 million. The funds have be used to  provide  millions of frontline workers with critical personal protective equipment, medical supplies, and testing kits; to  manage misinformation and the infodemic; support vulnerable populations like refugees and displaced persons; and helped accelerate the research on vaccines, tests, and treatments.",
          "“I sincerely thank every individual, corporation and other organization for their donations to the Solidarity Response Fund,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Your generosity has made a difference. On the fund’s one-year anniversary, we have seen what we can accomplish together in times of need”.",
          "The Solidarity Response Fund has been a critical source of funding for the WHO’s overall  response. Since the beginning of the pandemic, WHO has shipped nearly 250 million items of personal protective equipment and vital medical supplies including oxygen across more than 150 countries, strengthened hundreds of national and subnational laboratories with technical support, supplied more than 250 million COVID-19 tests; coordinated the deployment of more than 180 teams across the world; and supported more than 12 000 intensive care beds in health systems that might otherwise have been overwhelmed.",
          "Despite this progress, current trends show that the fight is far from over. That’s why today the fund launches a renewed call for action for funds to contribute to the estimated   US$ 1.96 billion required by WHO in 2021 to respond to remaining and new challenges in the fight against COVID-19.",
          "Contributions to the next phase of the fund will support the efforts of WHO and its partners to continue to suppress transmission, reduce exposure, counter misinformation, protect the vulnerable, reduce mortality and morbidity and accelerate equitable access to new COVID-19 tools – including through WHO’s work with the ACT-Accelerator, to scale up vaccination globally, particularly for the most vulnerable countries, and ensure the delivery of life-saving supplies.",
          "The recently launched WHO Foundation will lead the next phase of the Solidarity Response Fund to support the continuing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, working in collaboration with the United Nations Foundation and a global network of fiduciary partners.",
          "“The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund galvanized an astonishing outpouring of global generosity beyond anything we have seen before.  We put all the resources of the UN Foundation behind this task and were overwhelmed by the global response that enabled us to get critical funds to the most urgent needs in the devastating first year of the pandemic. The Solidarity Response Fund is a true testament to the power of collective action, and what can be achieved when people from every sector and every corner of the world act together to respond to overcome a collective threat,” said Elizabeth Cousens, President and CEO of the UN Foundation.",
          "Launched in May 2020, the WHO Foundation is an independent grant-making organization that supports WHO’s efforts to address urgent global health challenges.",
          "“COVID-19 has affected all of us. Every country. Every company. Every community. It was inspiring to see the world rally behind the WHO last year in the form of hundreds of thousands of contributions to its Solidarity Response Fund. That money was put to good use and saved countless lives,\" said Anil Soni, CEO of the WHO Foundation. \"I am committed to maintaining the success of the Fund as a vehicle for individuals and corporations to power the global fight against COVID-19. This pandemic won't be over anywhere until it's over everywhere, and donations to the Solidarity Response Fund help move the world towards that goal.”",
          "The COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) , and accompanying guidelines, issued in February 2021, fully articulates the basis for WHO’s appeal. The document guides coordinated action that WHO must take at national, regional, and global levels to overcome the ongoing challenges in the response to COVID-19, address inequities, and plot a course beyond the pandemic.",
          "“We have achieved so much over the past year. Unfortunately, the pandemic is far from over and we can’t give up the fight yet. We thank you for your contributions and seek your continued support to beat COVID-19.” added Dr Tedros.",

          "Launched in April 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO), European Commission, France and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the ACT Accelerator is a partnership of leading public health agencies with equity at its heart.",
          "In under a year, the ACT Accelerator has driven real progress to accelerate the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has accelerated the development of COVID-19 tests, treatments, vaccines and health systems and transformed the ability to tackle COVID-19 on a global scale, but only if the world can ensure the equitable distribution of these vital tools.",
          "However, the world continues to face an unprecedented and rapidly evolving threat from COVID-19. Three major shifts in the pandemic and the operating environment for the ACT Accelerator have necessitated a refresh of ACT Accelerator priorities, financing requirements, and investment case. First, COVID-19 vaccines are now available, but face acute supply constraints. Second, virus variants are emerging with increasingly concerning characteristics. Third, despite valuable support from governments, regulators, manufacturers, and other stakeholders, there has been insufficient investment in global solutions to scale COVID-19 tools.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator is well positioned to respond to these challenges. In 2020, a substantial focus was on developing and evaluating a sound product portfolio by investing in R&D, product assessment, and market shaping, while laying the groundwork for large-scale procurement and in-country delivery. Now that an initial set of effective and affordable COVID-19 tools is available, resources are increasingly focused on optimizing their public health impact. In 2021, ACT Accelerator aims to fully leverage these existing tools and available volumes, then expand manufacturing, while continuing to invest in further R&D and product optimization.",
          "The original ACT-Accelerator investment case published in September 2020 outlined a total requirement of US$ 38.1 billion to fully fund its work. Based on the refreshed strategic priorities outlined above, the Pillars have adjusted their resource needs. Despite generous donor contributions amounting to US$ 11.0 billion to date, ACT Accelerator continues to require an additional US$ 22.1 billion in 2021 to deliver on its full promise, and fund its vital work to deliver over 2 billion doses of vaccines, 900 million tests and up to 100 million of new treatment courses. The publication of a more detailed Strategy and Budget outlines the detail behind these numbers.",
          "Tackling COVID-19 requires substantial financial investments, but the financial and economic ramifications of inaction are far greater. In January 2021, a study commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce demonstrated that even with strong COVID-19 vaccine coverage in high-income countries, inequitable access to COVID-19 tools elsewhere would cost high-income economies an additional US$ 2.4 trillion in 2021 alone. Investing in ACT Accelerator dwarfs the potential multiplier benefits of domestic fiscal support investments. If COVID-19 transmission is uncontrolled anywhere in the world, it remains a threat to everyone everywhere in the world.",
          "Commenting on today’s release of the Strategy and Budget, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO , said: “The ACT Accelerator has made strong progress. But new viral variants, limited vaccine supply, and underinvestment have resulted in the need to refresh the strategy and budget that chart the roadmap out of the pandemic. As we approach the one-year anniversary of the ACT Accelerator, we call on all nations to come together in global solidarity. It isn’t just the right thing to do, it is also the fastest and most effective way to save lives, protect health systems and restore economies.”",
          "Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI , said: “In recent weeks COVAX has begun to turn the tide on the early inequity of the global vaccine rollout. However, with the increased spread of COVID-19 variants, we have entered a new and less predictable phase of the pandemic. It is crucial that the vaccines we have developed are shared globally, as a matter of the greatest urgency, to reduce the prevalence of disease, slow down viral mutation, and bring the pandemic to an end. And in parallel, we must redouble our R&D efforts so we have the tools we need to tackle emerging variants of the virus.”",
          "Emma Hannay, Chief Access Officer & ACT-Accelerator Lead for FIND , said: “ In less than a year, the ACT-Accelerator partnership has spurred the development and delivery of affordable, reliable rapid tests, scaled up manufacturing, and reserved important volumes for LMICs. But while we are moving quickly, so is the virus: the emergence of new variants across the globe underscores the ongoing need for equitable access to testing and strong surveillance systems so that we are not flying blind as the pandemic evolves. Detection of flare-ups and hotspot is key to stop case numbers from rebounding during vaccine roll out .”",
          "Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance , said: \"Thanks to the US$6 billion committed by its donors to date, the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment has been able to begin protecting at-risk groups in lower-income countries with life-saving COVID-19 vaccines. While our work is only just beginning, we can now see the benefits of a multilateral solution to this pandemic. I encourage countries and others to continue to support the ACT Accelerator's critical mission across all pillars,\" said Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.”",
          "Peter Sands, Executive Director of The Global Fund , said: “ The ACT-Accelerator partnership has achieved major progress in less than a year, including the procurement of over 50 million COVID-19 tests for low- and middle-income countries. However, we now face a tough battle as new variants emerge, taking us into unknown terrain. Reducing inequities in testing is a critical, if we are to succeed in containing the spread of the virus and monitoring the emergence of new variants. We must continue to scale up the availability and deployment of rapid and affordable tests to support countries in their response to a fast-evolving pandemic.”",
          "Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director , said: “As the production and availability of the COVID-19 vaccines ramp up, the revised strategy will ensure that countries have the resources and support they need to administer them equitably. As UNICEF supports this historic initiative, we will also continue focusing on other essential maternal and child health services, including immunization, which are critical to saving lives while we work to turn the tide on the pandemic.”",
          "Dr Philippe Duneton, Unitaid Executive Director , said: \" This new strategy reflects the epidemiological reality we are all now facing - a mutating virus that doesn't respect national borders, which threatens the effectiveness of the tools we have to fight this pandemic. Now is the moment to push ahead with a firm commitment to equitable access for all to the treatments and tests we need to defeat COVID-19, alongside the roll-out of vaccines. Research and development, country-preparedness and the procurement of proven treatments, including medical oxygen, will all be vital in the months to come .\"",

          "The Access to COVID-19 Tools ACT-Accelerator, is the proven, up-and-running global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. It was set up in response to a call from G20 leaders in March and launched by the WHO, European Commission, France and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in April 2020.",
          "The ACT-Accelerator is not a decision-making body or a new organization but works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organizations to end the pandemic. It is a framework for collaboration that has been designed to bring key players around the table with the goal of ending the pandemic as quickly as possible through the accelerated development, equitable allocation, and scaled up delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines, thereby protecting health systems and restoring societies and economies in the near term. It draws on the experience of leading global health organizations which are tackling the world’s toughest health challenges, and who, by working together, are able to unlock new and more ambitious results against COVID-19. Its members share a commitment to ensure all people have access to all the tools needed to defeat COVID-19 and to work with unprecedented levels of partnership to achieve it.",

In 2021, it is focused on procuring and distributing at least 900 million molecular and AG-RDTs to LMICs.",
              "The therapeutics pillar is led by Unitaid and Wellcome. Therapeutics can play a role in all stages of COVID-19 disease: to prevent infection; suppress symptoms and spread of infection to others; treat or prevent symptoms; as a life-saving treatment for severe symptoms; and as a treatment that can speed up recovery. The aim in the next 12 months is to develop, manufacture and distribute millions of treatment doses, helping COVID-19 sufferers to recover from the disease.",
              "The vaccines pillar, convened by CEPI, Gavi and WHO, is speeding up the search for an effective vaccine for all countries. At the same time, it is supporting the building of manufacturing capabilities, and buying supply, ahead of time so that at least 2 billion doses can be fairly distributed to the most high risk and highly exposed populations globally by the end of 2021.",
              "The health systems connector pillar, led by the World Bank, the Global Fund and WHO, is working to ensure that these tools can reach the people who need them.",

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) today listed the COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S , developed by Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), for emergency use in all countries and for COVAX roll-out. The decision comes on the back of the European Medicines Agency\r\n    (EMA) authorization, which was announced yesterday.",
          "“Every new, safe and effective tool against COVID-19 is another step closer to controlling the pandemic,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “But the hope offered by these tools will not materialize unless they\r\n    are made available to all people in all countries. I urge governments and companies to live up to their commitments and to use all solutions at their disposal to ramp up production so that these tools become truly global public goods, available and\r\n    affordable to all, and a shared solution to the global crisis.”",
          "The vaccine from Janssen is the first to be listed by WHO as a single dose regimen, which should facilitate vaccination logistics in all countries. The ample data from large clinical trials shared by the company also shows that the vaccine is effective\r\n    in older populations.",
          "To expedite listing of the vaccine, WHO and a team of assessors from all regions adopted what is called an ‘abbreviated assessment’ based on outcomes of the EMA review, and evaluation of quality, safety and efficacy data focused on low- and\r\n    middle-income country needs. The WHO assessment also considered suitability requirements such as cold chain storage and risk management plans to be implemented in countries.",
          "While the vaccine needs to be stored at -20 degrees, which may prove challenging in some environments, it can be kept for three months at 2-8°C and it has a long shelf life of two years.",
          "WHO will convene its Strategic Advisory Group on Immunization Experts next week to formulate recommendations on use of the vaccine. In the meantime, WHO continues to work with countries and COVAX partners to prepare for roll-out and safety monitoring.\r\n    The COVAX Facility has booked 500 million doses of the vaccine.",

          "The emergency use listing (EUL) procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies. The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency, while\r\n    adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks.",
          "The EUL pathway involves a rigorous assessment of late phase II and phase III clinical trial data as well as substantial additional data on safety, efficacy, quality and a risk management plan. These data are reviewed by independent experts and WHO\r\n    teams who consider the current body of evidence on the vaccine under consideration, the plans for monitoring its use, and plans for further studies.",
          "As part of the EUL process, the company producing the vaccine must commit to continue to generate data to enable full licensure and WHO prequalification of the vaccine. The WHO prequalification process will assess additional clinical data generated from\r\n    vaccine trials and deployment on a rolling basis to ensure the vaccine meets the necessary standards of quality, safety and efficacy for broader availability.",

          "The committee recommends that people who are vaccinated be informed, prior to vaccination, of the potential for influenza-like symptoms to occur after receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. Such symptoms should be managed accordingly, with medical advice sought if required. The occurrence of transient symptoms such as headache, fever and muscle aches after a first dose of these vaccines should not prevent administration of the second dose.",

          "“IAEA data shows that around one-third of countries still do not have radiotherapy available, out of which 28 are in Africa,” said May Abdel-Wahab, Director of the IAEA’s Division of Human Health. “Many of them would benefit from increased access to radiotherapy services. The key is tailoring radiation oncology solutions to the situation on the ground, underpinned by appropriate safety infrastructure.”",
          "Types of radiotherapy equipment covered by the guide include external beam radiotherapy machines (both Cobalt-60 and linear accelerators), brachytherapy devices that apply radiation sources directly to tumours and complementary imaging devices such as conventional or computed tomography (CT) simulators, as well as other tools essential for safe operation and quality control. Depending on the type of radiotherapy machine, the need for specialized professionals and infrastructure, as well as quality assurance and maintenance, may vary.",
          "Safety is also covered extensively, with information provided on planning for bunkers to house radiotherapy equipment, shielding for walls, floor and ceilings and emergency buttons for treatment and control rooms. In addition, clear guidance is provided on what is required to ensure functionality of equipment for an optimal equipment lifespan, usually a period of 10-15 years.",
          "Selecting radiotherapy systems appropriate for given settings and matched to the existing workforce help ensure the delivery of safe radiotherapy. It contributes to the improvement of access to life-saving treatment by minimizing service interruptions because of machine downtime and builds a solid foundation for further expansion of services when the health-care system is ready for adoption of more complex radiotherapy systems.",
          "“While interruptions of radiotherapy equipment predate COVID-19,” said Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Director of the Department of Noncommunicable Diseases at WHO, “they have been exacerbated during the pandemic because of breakdowns in global supply chains and barriers to the free movement of technical service personnel. Any improvement that reduces interruptions can make the difference between life and death for patients whose tumours continue growing while they await treatment.”",
          "Radiotherapy equipment is, however, just one element of cancer management services. Others that need to be in place relate to early detection, diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing, pathology, surgery, systemic treatment and palliative care. The technologies associated with all of these services are listed in the WHO List of Priority Medical Devices for Cancer Management."

          "Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Save the Children, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) welcome the opportunity to make rotavirus vaccine available to more children living in humanitarian crises thanks to a landmark pricing agreement with the manufacturer, GSK.",
          "Children living in refugee camps, displaced communities or in other emergency situations now have a better chance of being protected against severe diarrhoeal disease with these lower price rotavirus vaccines. Diarrhoea is one of the leading causes of death among children under five.",
          "The agreement makes use of the multi-partner Humanitarian Mechanism , launched in 2017. Rotavirus vaccine is the second vaccine  to be accessed through the scheme, which depends on manufacturers making their vaccines available at their lowest price for use in emergencies - across countries of all income levels. The first to be made available was the pneumococcal vaccine.",
          "“We welcome this engagement from manufacturers and hope it will be a step towards making more vaccines available in the future at affordable prices,” said Dr Kate O’Brien, Director of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals at WHO . “It is unacceptable that some of the most at-risk children are not vaccinated against devastating diseases like rotavirus because of lack of availability or high costs.”",
          "Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhoeal disease in children under 5 years globally, responsible for up to 200,000 child deaths each year. Children in refugee camps and displaced communities are among the most vulnerable in the world to such diseases, due to population density, poor hygiene and sanitation, and higher rates of malnutrition. Vaccination is therefore especially critical for these children, who may otherwise lack access to essential health services.",
          "The Humanitarian Mechanism facilitates access to vaccines for humanitarian organizations working in countries affected by emergencies, where access and prices have otherwise been a bottleneck.",
          "“Every day across the globe, children die because they are critically weakened by diarrhoea – it’s one of the biggest killers of young children in the world. Save the Children is seeing the devastating impacts the rotavirus has on children every day, so we welcome this important commitment as a vital step in protecting some of the most vulnerable children from life-threatening, yet easily preventable diseases. Money should never be a barrier between life and death,” said Rachel Cummings, Director of the Humanitarian Public Health Team at Save the Children .",
          "Since 2017, nearly one million doses of pneumococcal vaccine have been approved for use by civil society organizations through the Mechanism in 12 countries: Algeria, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Greece, Kenya, Lebanon, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan and Syria. The pneumococcal vaccine protects against childhood pneumonia, also a leading cause of childhood deaths during emergencies.",
          "Once secured through the Mechanism, the vaccines are offered to humanitarian organizations working in camps and other emergency settings, who can make applications to access the vaccine at these lower prices.",
          "“The Humanitarian Mechanism has already expanded the number of children who can receive lifesaving vaccines, but to reach its full potential and save more lives, MSF calls on manufacturers to commit additional vaccines and to allow governments hosting children in humanitarian emergencies to access the vaccines too,” said Miriam Alia, Vaccination and Outbreak Response Referent at MSF. “ Children everywhere, no matter where they live, should have access to lifesaving vaccinations.”",
          "“We know that it is critical for us to expand the reach and breadth of immunization coverage among communities affected by humanitarian crises to meet our goal of immunization equity in the next decade,” said Robin Nandy, UNICEF’s Principal Advisor and Chief of Immunizations . “These communities bear the brunt of preventable morbidity and mortality and have disproportionately suffered from programme disruptions as a result of the pandemic. We very much welcome this initiative which further expands access to rotavirus vaccine at affordable prices for populations in need.”",
          "Additional commitments from manufacturers are sought to make more vaccines available through the Mechanism, including typhoid, human papillomavirus and other pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines.",
          "About",
          "The Humanitarian Mechanism was founded in 2017 through a partnership of UN and civil society organizations - MSF, Save the Children, UNICEF and WHO – to enhance access to vaccines in emergencies by civil society organizations in countries that are not otherwise eligible for Gavi support.",
          "The Humanitarian Mechanism partners invite NGOs and UN agencies working in refugee and IDP camps and emergencies to leverage the Mechanism so they can access the available rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines."

          "This week, Fiji in partnership with WHO launched its national Guidelines for Climate Resilient and Environmentally Sustainable Health Care Facilities (CRESHCF). This was realized through a multi-sectoral collaboration that spanned more than three years of consultations. The guidelines were published only 3 months after WHO launched the Global Guidance for Climate Resilient and Environmentally Sustainable Health Care Facilities .",
          "In 2017, after the launch of the country’s Climate Change and Health Strategic Action Plan 2016 – 2020 ( CCHSAP ), Fiji’s Ministry of Health and Medical Services committed the country to ‘Green Health Care’. These efforts in the health care sector would complement Fiji’s climate change leadership on the international stage, as the Prime Minister assumed the role of Presidency of the UNFCCC COP 23, and would support the government’s Nationally Determined Contribution ( NDC ) to the Paris Agreement.",
          "The guidelines were developed over several years following extensive consultations with national and international stakeholders. The guidelines further support the plans and policies of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Economy as custodian of the National Adaptation Plan , as well as the Climate Change Policy and Climate Change Bill.",
          "In his launching address, the Minster for Health and Medical Services underscored that the impacts of climate change on health can never be overemphasized. He added that recent cyclones have exposed our vulnerabilities, and that there is a need to build back better with approved global best practices and standards.",
          "Several health care facilities are already experiencing increased vulnerability, e.g. because of inundation due to rising sea levels or the loss of potable drinking water due to saltwater intrusion. Inland facilities increasingly experience unpredictable rainfall patterns, leading to flash flooding and related infrastructure damage, while remote facilities in the Western division frequently see their health services impacted by prolonged dry weather.",
          "Therefore, the national CRESHCF guidelines are a very relevant and timely resource to build climate resilience throughout Fiji’s health system and ultimately protect the Fijian population. Being a living document, the guidelines are expected to be reviewed and updated regularly.",
          "Fiji’s CRESHCF guidelines are based on WHO’s Guidance for Climate Resilient and Environmentally Sustainable Health Care Facilities, and similarly it has 4 fundamental pre-requisites: Health workforce : adequate numbers of skilled human resources with decent working conditions, empowered and informed to respond to increasing environmental challenges; Water, sanitation, and health care waste : sustainable water, sanitation and health care waste services for all healthcare facilities; Energy : Sustainable energy services powering Fiji’s health care facilities; and Infrastructure and technology: sustainable and climate-resilient infrastructure and technologies, ensuring the efficient functioning of the health care facility while building resilience and sustainability.",
          "In congratulating the Fijian government during the launching event, Dr Nasir Hassan, Team Coordinator Pacific Climate Change and Health, WHO, highlighted the pertinence of this document to the work undertaken by WHO’s Western Pacific Region (WPRO), where climate change, the environment and health is one of the four strategic priorities for the region. WHO is determined to support Fiji and its neighbours, and to help prepare the region for the continued impacts of climate change while ensuring a prosperous, healthy and safe Western Pacific."

          "Following from the publication of an interim distribution forecast, and based on current knowledge of supply availability, this first round of allocations provides information on provision of doses of the AstraZeneca(AZ)/Oxford vaccine to COVAX Facility\r\n    participants, through May 2021.",
          "This first round of allocation outlines delivery of doses of the AZ/Oxford vaccine – manufactured by AstraZeneca (AZ) and COVISHIELD, licensed to and manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII/AZ) – to Facility participants. Participants\r\n    not listed have either exercised their rights to opt-out of this vaccine, wish to transfer allocated doses to AMC participants, are AMC-eligible but have not joined the AMC, have voluntarily delayed receipt of doses and communicated this intent ahead\r\n    of allocation, or have not met financial requirements.",
          "This list will be updated by the end of the week to provide indicative timelines for the supply of these doses, split into Feb-March and April-May. These timelines are dependent on a variety of factors including national regulatory requirements, availability\r\n    of supply, and fulfilment of other criteria such as validated national deployment and vaccination plans (NDVPs) from AMC participants, indemnification & liability agreements, and export and import authorisations.",
          "Deliveries for this round of allocations has already begun, with India, Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire\r\n    receiving doses of the SII/AZ vaccine. Both Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire began vaccination campaigns utilising these\r\n    doses on Monday. Further deliveries are underway for this week, and as readiness criteria are fulfilled and doses become available, will continue on a rolling basis over the coming months.",
          "In addition to this first round of allocations, an exceptional distribution of 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech\r\n    vaccine, anticipated for delivery in Q1 2021, was announced in early February.",
          "Further allocation rounds for vaccines in the COVAX portfolio will be announced in due course.",

          "About COVAX",
          "COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi)\r\n    and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, UNICEF, the World Bank, and others. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers\r\n    to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.",
          "CEPI is focused on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio: investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support development of three safe\r\n    and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility to a number of candidates,\r\n    and made strategic investments in vaccine manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine. CEPI is also investing\r\n    in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.",
          "Gavi is focused on procurement and delivery for COVAX: coordinating the design, implementation and administration of the COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX AMC and working with its Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery. The COVAX Facility is the global pooled procurement mechanism for COVID-19 vaccines through\r\n    which COVAX will ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for all 190 participating economies, using an allocation framework formulated by WHO. The COVAX Facility will do this by pooling buying power from participating economies and providing\r\n    volume guarantees across a range of promising vaccine candidates. The Gavi COVAX AMC is the financing mechanism that will support the participation of 92 low- and middle-income countries in the Facility, enabling access to donor-funded doses of safe\r\n    and effective vaccines. Gavi is fundraising for the COVAX AMC, and funding UNICEF procurement of vaccines as well as partners’ and governments work on readiness and delivery, including support cold chain equipment, technical assistance, syringes,\r\n    vehicles, and other aspects of the vastly complex logistical operation for delivery. UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) will be acting as procurement coordinators for the COVAX Facility, helping deliver vaccines to COVAX\r\n    AMC participants and others.",
          "WHO has multiple roles within COVAX : It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation,\r\n    safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery. Its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts ( SAGE )\r\n on Immunization develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations. Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL)/prequalification programmes ensure harmonized review and authorization across member states. It provides global coordination and\r\n    member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination. WHO leads, together with UNICEF, the Country Readiness and Delivery workstream ,\r\n which provides support to countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines. Along with Gavi and numerous other partners working at the global, regional, and country level, the CRD workstream provides tools, guidance, monitoring, and on\r\n    the ground technical assistance for the planning and roll-out of the vaccines. Along with COVAX partners, WHO has developed a no-fault compensation scheme as part of the time-limited indemnification and liability commitments.",
          "UNICEF is leveraging its experience as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world and working with manufacturers and partners on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as freight, logistics and storage. UNICEF already procures more than\r\n    2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunization and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. In collaboration with the PAHO Revolving Fund ,\r\n UNICEF is leading efforts to procure and supply doses of COVID-19 vaccines for\r\n    COVAX. In addition, UNICEF, Gavi and WHO are working with governments around the clock to ensure that countries are ready to receive the vaccines, with appropriate cold chain equipment in place and health workers trained to dispense them. UNICEF is\r\n    also playing a lead role in efforts to foster trust in vaccines, delivering vaccine confidence communications and tracking and addressing misinformation around the world.",
          "About CEPI",
          "CEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations, launched at Davos in 2017, to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. CEPI has moved with great urgency and in coordination with WHO in response to the\r\n    emergence of COVID-19. CEPI has initiated ten partnerships to develop vaccines against the novel coronavirus. The programmes are leveraging rapid response platforms already supported by CEPI as well as new partnerships.",
          "Before the emergence of COVID-19, CEPI’s priority diseases included Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever and Chikungunya virus. CEPI also invested in platform technologies\r\n    that can be used for rapid vaccine and immunoprophylactic development against unknown pathogens (Disease X).",

          "Nearly 2.5 billion people worldwide ─ or 1 in 4 people ─ will be living with some degree of hearing loss by 2050, warns the World Health Organization’s (WHO) first World Report on Hearing, released today. At least 700 million of these people will require access to ear and hearing care and other rehabilitation services unless action is taken.",
          "\"Our ability to hear is precious. Untreated hearing loss can have a devastating impact on people’s ability to communicate, to study and to earn a living. It can also impact on people’s mental health and their ability to sustain relationships,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This new report outlines the scale of the problem, but also offers solutions in the form of evidence-based interventions that we encourage all countries to integrate into their health systems as part of their journey towards universal health coverage.”",
          "The report, launched ahead of World Hearing Day on 3 March, underlines the need to rapidly step up efforts to prevent and address hearing loss by investing and expanding access to ear and hearing care services. Investment in ear and hearing care has been shown to be cost-effective: WHO calculates that governments can expect a return of nearly US$ 16 for every US$ 1 invested.",
          "Main findings of the report",
          "Lack of accurate information and stigmatizing attitudes to ear diseases and hearing loss often limit people from accessing care for these conditions. Even among health-care providers, there’s often a shortage of knowledge about prevention, early identification and management of hearing loss and ear diseases, hampering their ability to provide the care required.",
          "In most countries, ear and hearing care is still not integrated into national health systems and accessing care services is challenging for those with ear diseases and hearing loss. Moreover, access to ear and hearing care is poorly measured and documented, and relevant indicators are lacking in the health information system.",
          "But the most glaring gap in health system capacity is in human resources. Among low-income countries, about 78% have fewer than one ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist per million population; 93% have fewer than one audiologist per million; only 17% have one or more speech therapist per million; and 50% have one or more teacher for the deaf per million. This gap can be closed through integration of ear and hearing care into primary health care through strategies such as task sharing and training, outlined in the report.",
          "Even in countries with relatively high proportions of ear and hearing care professionals, there is unequal distribution of specialists. This not only poses challenges for people in need of care, but also places unreasonable demands on the cadres providing these services.",
          "Main causes of hearing loss",
          "In children, almost 60% of hearing loss can be prevented through measures such as immunization for prevention of rubella and meningitis, improved maternal and neonatal care, and screening for, and early management of, otitis media - inflammatory diseases of the middle ear. In adults, noise control, safe listening and surveillance of ototoxic medicines together with good ear hygiene can help maintain good hearing and reduce the potential for hearing loss.",
          "Identification is the first step in addressing hearing loss and related ear diseases. Clinical screening at strategic points in life ensure that any loss of hearing and ear diseases can be identified as early as possible.",
          "Recent technological advances, including accurate and easy-to-use tools, can identify ear disease and hearing loss at any age, in clinical or community settings, and with limited training and resources. Screening can even take place in challenging situations such as those encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic and those living in underserved and remote areas of the world.",
          "Access to timely and appropriate care",
          "Once diagnosed, early intervention is key. Medical and surgical treatment can cure most ear diseases, potentially reversing the associated hearing loss. However, where hearing loss is irreversible, rehabilitation can ensure that those affected avoid the adverse consequences of hearing loss. A range of effective options are available.",
          "Hearing technology, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, when accompanied by appropriate support services and rehabilitative therapy are effective and cost-effective and can benefit children and adults alike.",
          "The report notes that the use of sign language and other means of sensory substitution such as speech reading are important options for many deaf people; hearing assistive technology and services such as captioning and sign language interpretation can further improve access to communication and education for those with hearing loss.",
          "“To ensure that the benefit of these technological advances and solutions is equitably accessible to all, countries must adopt an integrated people-centered approach,” said Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Director of the WHO Department of Noncommunicable Diseases. “Integrating ear and hearing care interventions within national health plans and delivering these through strengthened health systems, as part of universal health coverage, is essential to meet the needs of those at risk of or living with hearing loss.”",

              "Publication of the allocation of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine to 142 of COVAX’s participating economies, to be delivered between now and the end of May, is anticipated tomorrow."
            ]
          },
          "As the global rollout of COVAX vaccines accelerates, the first COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in Africa using COVAX doses began today in Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire. These campaigns are the among the first to use doses provided by the COVAX Facility’s Gavi COVAX Advanced Market Commitment (AMC).",
          "The AMC is the COVAX Facility’s mechanism to provide donor-funded vaccines to lower-income countries.",
          "The campaigns in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire follow deliveries to both countries last week with Ghana taking delivery of 600 000 doses on February 24 and Côte d’Ivoire 504 000 doses two days later. Both countries received the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine licensed and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII). The vaccine, branded COVISHIELD, was granted Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization on 15 February.",
          "H.E. Nana Akufo-Addo, President of the Republic of Ghana said: \"COVID-19 has changed the world. It has cost lives, battered health systems, and damaged livelihoods. But, through these challenges, we have seen the best of humanity exemplified through strong multilateral cooperation. Ghana welcomes the arrival of the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX AMC as a pathway to ending the acute phase of the pandemic. To maximise the public health benefit of the vaccine, the first doses will be prioritized for health and essential workers, and other at-risk groups. This important milestone will allow Ghana to get back to business, and build back our economy even stronger than before.\"",
          "The deliveries mark the start of what will be the largest, most rapid and complex global rollout of vaccines in history. In total, COVAX aims to deliver at least 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021, including at least 1.3 billion to the 92 economies eligible for support through the COVAX AMC.",
          "Confirmation of first-round allocations, covering the majority of the COVAX Facility participants, will be published 2 March 2021. COVAX doses to date have been delivered by SII to India, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, while Pfizer-BioNTech has delivered doses to the Republic of Korea. More deliveries by these two manufacturers are planned in the coming days, with 11 million doses in total planned to be delivered over the next seven days. In addition, AstraZeneca is set to commence shipments this week.",
          "COVAX, the overarching effort to accelerate development and access to COVID vaccines, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the World Health Organization (WHO) working in partnership with UNICEF as well as the World Bank, manufacturers and civil society organizations, and others.",
          "\"This is a day many of us have been dreaming of and working for more than 12 months,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General . \"It's gratifying to see the fruit of that labour. But success is still to come. This is only the beginning of what COVAX was set up to achieve. We have a lot left to do to realize our vision to start vaccination in all countries within the first 100 days of the year. There are just 40 days left.\"",
          "“As vaccination begins in Côte D’Ivoire, less than a year after COVID-19 was characterized as a global pandemic, I am filled with confidence, and I am sure that through COVAX and international solidarity we will be able to reach the most at-risk everywhere. Global equitable access to life-saving vaccines is the surest way to save lives and rebuild economies. I would like to thank all donors and also the leadership of the G7 group of nations. Nowadays vaccine policy is the best economic policy,” said José Manuel Barroso, Chair of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance .",
          "“The last year has been a dark one for families all over the world, but the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines provided a hopeful light at the end of the tunnel. Today, the COVAX Facility begins to make good on its promise to make sure that light shines for all,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director . “This unprecedented global effort has rallied the international community behind identifying acceptable vaccines, raising funds to procure them, and laying the groundwork for the world’s largest immunization campaign in history. Now, these vaccines are quickly reaching people in low and middle-income countries, many of which would have been left behind without the Facility’s work. This proves what we can accomplish when we all – the private sector, UN and development agencies, governments, donors, and other partners – work as one.”",
          "“This is a historic day in the global fight against COVID-19. Today’s vaccinations in Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana are among the first to be delivered through COVAX, which will protect many hundreds of millions of those most at risk from COVID-19, wherever they are in the world.” said Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI . “In the coming days and weeks, COVAX will begin to redress the global imbalance in vaccine deployment, but there is still much to do. The spread of new COVID-19 variants means global access to vaccines is more important than ever before, and the global community must remain firmly focused on this goal if we are to bring the pandemic to an end.”",
          "The start of Africa’s biggest immunization drive in history through the COVAX Facility marks a step forward in the continent’s fight against COVID-19. It is a welcome shift towards bringing African countries off the sidelines and back into the vaccination race, correcting the glaring inequity which has been an unfortunate hallmark of the global vaccine rollout to date. For months WHO teams in the region and partners have been supporting countries to plan and prepare for the complex challenges of such a massive vaccination campaign. We now look forward to seeing these plans put into action with an effective and efficient vaccine rollout,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa .",
          "“The first COVAX vaccine deliveries in West and Central Africa were a huge first step towards equity and a demonstration of global solidarity,” said UNICEF Regional Director for West and Central Africa Marie-Pierre Poirier . “A few days after the vaccine doses landed, we are already celebrating the first COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, starting today in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire, aimed at protecting the most vulnerable. We are proud that countries in West and Central Africa were ready from the get-go. UNICEF is active on the ground, together with WHO and other partners, to support the roll-out of the vaccination campaigns until everyone is safe.“"

I am delighted that we now have tangible results on the ground. I want to pay tribute to the tireless efforts of our partners, Gavi, CEPI, WHO and UNICEF. Team Europe is a proud supporter of COVAX and will continue to stand by the people of Africa.\"",
          "Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, Government of Canada and Gavi COVAX AMC co-chair said: “Today is yet again proof of what can be achieved through international collaboration. We have reached another milestone in the global vaccination effort, with the first COVAX vaccines being administered in Cote d’Ivoire. Canada is committed to helping everyone, everywhere recover from the pandemic, and also, to strengthening health systems.”",
          "Norwegian Minister of International Development and co-chair of ACT-A facilitation council Dag-Inge Ulstein said: “The progress on vaccines is impressive and, as a major funder to the ACT Accelerator, we believe in the need for the multilateral approach which is clearly working. As co-chair of the ACT Accelerator Facilitation Council, we urgently need to see the same traction in tests, treatments and health systems. Funding is needed to support this now; we have a small window of opportunity with the evolving context of the pandemic -new variants, limited vaccine supply, and underinvestment in global solutions means we cannot be complacent.”",

          "Sai D. Prasad, President, Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturer’s Network ( DCVMN ) said: “Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturer’s Network has strongly stood with all stakeholders during this unprecedented time of COVID-19 pandemic and has strived hard to develop, manufacture and roll out COVID-19 vaccines in a record time span of 10-12 months as a part of global collaboration and solidarity. We stand together shoulder to shoulder in this endeavour.”",
          "Thomas Cueni, Director General, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations ( IFPMA ) said: “Since the beginning of this pandemic, vaccine makers have spared no efforts to speed up development, production, registration, and equitable access to of high-quality vaccines. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are committed founding partners of ACT-Accelerator and COVAX, and we are excited that for the first time in the history of pandemics vaccines are rolled out in a coordinated manner quickly around the world. Another momentous effort, is the scaling up of the vaccine manufacturing from zero to millions in a matter of months. As producing vaccines is a complex process, so with such a scale up, there are inevitably going to be challenges ahead; we will continue working collaboratively to find solutions and join hands in making history.”"

It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.",
          "CEPI is focused on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio : investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support development of three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility to a number of candidates, and made strategic investments in vaccine manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine. CEPI is also investing in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.",
          "Gavi is focused on procurement and delivery for COVAX: coordinating the design, implementation and administration of the COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX AMC and working with its Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery. The COVAX Facility is the global pooled procurement mechanism for COVID-19 vaccines through which COVAX will ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for all 190 participating economies, using an allocation framework formulated by WHO. The COVAX Facility will do this by pooling buying power from participating economies and providing volume guarantees across a range of promising vaccine candidates. The Gavi COVAX AMC is the financing mechanism that will support the participation of 92 low- and middle-income countries in the Facility, enabling access to donor-funded doses of safe and effective vaccines. Gavi is fundraising for the COVAX AMC, and funding UNICEF procurement of vaccines as well as partners’ and governments work on readiness and delivery, including support cold chain equipment, technical assistance, syringes, vehicles, and other aspects of the vastly complex logistical operation for delivery. UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) will be acting as procurement coordinators for the COVAX Facility, helping deliver vaccines to COVAX AMC participants and others.",

          "El Salvador is first Central American country to achieve this status, third in all of the Americas in recent years",
          "El Salvador today became the first country in Central America to be awarded a certification of malaria elimination by the World Health Organization (WHO). The certification follows more than 50 years of commitment by the Salvadoran government and people\r\n    to ending the disease in a country with dense population and geography hospitable to malaria.",
          "“Malaria has afflicted humankind for millennia, but countries like El Salvador are living proof and inspiration for all countries that we can dare to dream of a malaria-free future,” said Dr.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.",
          "Certification of malaria elimination is granted by WHO when a country has proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the chain of indigenous transmission has been interrupted nationwide for at least the previous three consecutive years.",
          "With the exception of one outbreak in 1996, El Salvador steadily reduced its malaria burden over the last three decades. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of malaria cases declined from more than 9000 to 26. The country has reported zero indigenous cases\r\n    of the disease since 2017.",
          "“For decades, El Salvador has worked hard to wipe out malaria and the human suffering that it generates,” said Dr. Carissa F. Etienne, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), WHO’s regional office for the Americas. “Over the years, El Salvador has dedicated both the human and financial resources needed to succeed. This certification today is a life-saving achievement for the Americas.”",
          "El Salvador is the third country to have achieved malaria-free status in recent years in the WHO Region of the Americas ,\r\n following Argentina in 2019 and Paraguay in 2018. Seven countries in the region were certified from 1962 to 1973. Globally, a total of 38 countries and territories have reached this milestone.",
          "El Salvador’s Minister of Health, Dr Francisco José Alabi Montoya, said: “The people and the government of El Salvador, together with its health workers, have fought for decades against malaria. Today we celebrate this historical achievement\r\n    of having El Salvador certified malaria free.”",
          "El Salvador’s road to elimination",
          "El Salvador’s anti-malaria efforts began in the 1940s with mechanical control of the malaria vector – the mosquito – through construction of the first permanent drains in swamps, followed by indoor spraying with the pesticide DDT. In\r\n    the mid-1950s, El Salvador established a National Malaria Program (CNAP) and recruited a network of community health workers to detect and treat malaria across the country. The volunteers, known as “Col Vol,” registered malaria cases and\r\n    interventions. The data, entered into health information systems by vector control personnel, allowed for strategic and targeted responses across the country.",
          "By the late 1960s, progress had slowed as mosquitoes developed resistance to DDT. An expansion in the country’s cotton industry is thought to have fueled a further rise in malaria cases. Throughout the 1970s, there was a surge of migrant laborers\r\n    on cotton estates in coastal areas near mosquito breeding sites, in addition to discontinued use of DDT. El Salvador experienced a resurgence of malaria, reaching a peak of nearly 96 000 cases in 1980.",
          "With the support of PAHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), El Salvador successfully reoriented its malaria program, which led to improved targeting of resources and interventions\r\n    based on geographic distribution of cases. The government also decentralized its network of diagnostic laboratories in 1987, allowing for cases to be detected and treated more rapidly. These factors and the collapse of the cotton industry led to a\r\n    rapid decline of cases in the 1980s.",
          "The 2009 health reform, which included important improvements on budget and coverage of primary health care, as well as maintenance of the vector control program as the technical leader in malaria interventions, contributed to El Salvador’s success.",
          "Country leadership and consistent funding",
          "El Salvador’s government recognized early on that consistent and adequate domestic financing would be crucial to achieve and maintain its health-related goals, including for malaria. This commitment has been reflected for more than 50 years in national\r\n    budget lines.",
          "Despite reporting its last malaria-related death in 1984, El Salvador has maintained its domestic investments for malaria. In 2020, the country continued to rely on 276 vector control personnel, 247 laboratories, nurses and doctors involved in case detection,\r\n    epidemiologists, management teams and personnel, and more than 3000 community health workers. As part of El Salvador’s commitment to maintain zero cases, national budgeting for malaria has been and will be preserved, even through the pandemic.",
          "Global and regional initiatives",
          "El Salvador is a member of the WHO global “E-2020” initiative – a group of 21 countries identified in 2016 as having potential to eliminate malaria by 2020. With support from WHO and PAHO, national program staff from El Salvador have participated in global meetings that bring together malaria-eliminating\r\n    countries to share innovations and best practices.",
          "Although the majority of financing for malaria has come from domestic resources, El Salvador’s elimination effort benefited from external grants provided by the Global Fund.",
          "In 2019, El Salvador joined the Regional Malaria Elimination Initiative (RMEI), which was organized by the Inter-American Development Bank with technical leadership from PAHO and the participation of the Council of Health Ministers of Central America\r\n    (COMISCA).The initiative supports Central American countries, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Colombia in a collaborative effort to eliminate malaria.",
          "PAHO has provided technical support throughout El Salvador’s anti-malaria campaign, from control to elimination to prevention of reestablishment of the disease. El Salvador’s success is an important contribution to the PAHO Elimination Initiative , a collaborative effort between governments, civil society, academia, the private sector and communities to eliminate more than 30 communicable diseases and related conditions in the Americas,\r\n    including malaria, by 2030."

          "As of 2019, the Americas reported 723 000 confirmed cases of malaria, compared to almost 1.2 million cases in 2000. The total number of malaria deaths fell by 52% in the same period of time – from 410 to 197. Since 2015, the Region has seen a 66%\r\n    rise in cases largely due to increased malaria transmission in some countries. Despite the increase, advances against malaria continue. In 2020, Belize completed two years without indigenous malaria transmission and, by the end of 2020, 10 countries\r\n    and territories reported fewer than 2000 cases in 2019.",

          "“The No-Fault Compensation fund is a massive boost for COVAX’s goal of equitable global access to vaccines: by providing a robust, transparent and independent mechanism to settle serious adverse events it helps those in countries who might\r\n    have such effects, manufacturers to roll out vaccines to countries faster, and is a key benefit for lower-income governments procuring vaccines through the Gavi COVAX AMC,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi.",
          "The COVAX no-fault compensation programme will be operationalized through its web portal ( www.covaxclaims.com ) by 31 March 2021, which will include resources such as the programme’s\r\n    protocol, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and information on how to submit an application.",
          "Eligible individuals may apply for compensation under the programme once the portal becomes operational, even if a COVAX-distributed vaccine is administered to them before 31 March 2021.",
          "The programme is financed initially through Gavi COVAX AMC donor funding, calculated as a levy charged on all doses of COVID-19 vaccines distributed through the COVAX Facility to the AMC eligible economies until 30 June 2022.",
          "WHO is working with Chubb to secure insurance coverage for the programme with Chubb as lead insurer.",
          "“ Chubb is proud and honoured to work with the World Health Organization and its partners on the critically important COVAX programme,” said Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive\r\n    Officer of Chubb. “The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on people and economies around the globe, and the development and deployment of efficacious vaccines is a crucial step toward ending this crisis. However, a vaccination strategy\r\n    is only as effective as the number of people it reaches, which is why the COVAX facility is so critical. Access to the protection offered by a vaccine should not be limited or restricted. All countries, regardless of income levels, should have equal\r\n    access to these life-saving vaccines.”",
          "The delivery of COVID-19 vaccines during 2021 will be the fastest and largest global deployment of novel vaccines in history. The COVAX Facility aims, by the end of 2021, to deliver at least 2 billion doses of safe, effective and quality-assured vaccines\r\n    to all participating countries, including at least 1.3 billion doses to the 92 AMC-eligible countries and economies, at the same time as wealthier nations.",

          "At the halfway point in the World Health Organization and Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’ 100-day challenge , a movement of people and organizations is now uniting together under\r\n    the banner of vaccine equity. WHO welcomes the new commitments made by France, Germany, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America to COVAX and equitable allocation of vaccines. Backed by 190 countries and economies, COVAX is the global mechanism best positioned to deliver vaccines to the world and end the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "“There is a growing movement behind vaccine equity and I welcome that world leaders are stepping up to the challenge by making new commitments to effectively end this pandemic by sharing doses and increasing funds to COVAX,” said Dr Tedros,\r\n    Director-General of the World Health Organization. “This can’t be business as usual and there is an urgent need for countries to share doses and technology, scale up manufacturing and ensure that there is a sustainable supply of vaccines\r\n    so that everyone, everywhere can receive a vaccine.\"",
          "Close to 7000 people and hundreds of organizations have already signed on to a vaccine equity declaration that directly calls\r\n    on governments and manufacturers to speed up regulatory processes, boost manufacturing by sharing know-how and technology, and ensure that doses are shared equitably. There is a specific call to start with all health and care workers, who have been\r\n    on the frontlines of this pandemic for more than a year.",
          "Heads of state and sports stars like Romain Grosjean; international agencies including UNICEF, UN Development Programme, UN Women and the World Food Programme; sporting organizations like the International Olympic Committee, World Rugby and FIFA; networks\r\n    focused on faith, gender and youth, and civil society groups like the Elders, Global Health Council, Nursing Now, Pandemic Action Network, UHC2030 and Women in Global Health,*-- these and many more have signed on to the broad based movement, which\r\n    recognizes the moral, economic and global security imperative of equitable vaccine distribution.",
          "Dr Keith C Rowley, Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, and Chairman of the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) said, “Today, thankfully we are at that place where we now have tested and proven vaccines. A brightening light is shining\r\n    on our way towards a more successful response to the still marauding virus.”",
          "The movement for vaccine equity is growing, and to prevent virus variants from undermining our health technologies and hampering an already sluggish global economic recovery, it is critical that leaders continue to step up to ensure that we end this pandemic\r\n    as quickly as possible. Individuals and organizations everywhere are encouraged to join in this crucial effort.",

          "The twenty-seventh meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO Director-General on 1 February 2021 with committee members and advisers attending via video conference, supported by the WHO Secretariat.  The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV).  The following IHR States Parties provided an update at the video conference on the current situation in their respective countries: Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Sierra Leone and Pakistan and Tajikistan. Wild poliovirus The committee noted that the rising incidence of global WPV1 cases seen since 2019 may have peaked with 140 cases with onset of illness in 2020 as at 21 January 2021 compared to the 137 cases that had occurred in 2019 as reported at 21 January 2020.  While in Pakistan the number fell from 111 cases to 84, it is not clear that this is going to be sustained, while the number in Afghanistan had more than doubled from 26 to 56.  Transmission persists in the core reservoirs of Karachi and Quetta Block in Pakistan and in Southern Afghanistan and has expanded to previously polio-free areas such as North Sindh and South Punjab in Pakistan and the Western and Northern regions in Afghanistan. The increase in Afghanistan is likely due to the growing cohort of missed children throughout the country due to local vaccination bans and the effect of COVID-19. The number of positive environmental samples has increased from 463 in 2019 to 503 so far in 2020. The Committee noted that based on results from sequencing of WPV1 since the last committee meeting in October 2020, there were further instances of international spread of viruses from Pakistan to Afghanistan.  The ongoing frequency of WPV1 international spread between the two countries and the increased vulnerability in other countries where routine immunization and polio prevention activities have both been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are two major factors that suggest the risk of international spread may be at the highest level since 2014.  While border closures and lockdowns may mitigate the risk in the short term while in force, this would be outweighed in the longer term by falling population immunity through disruption of vaccination and the resumption of normal population movements. Circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) The committee was very concerned that cVDPV2 continues to spread rapidly.  The number of cases in 2020 is 1009 (year to date), 254% higher than the total for 2019.  As in all the years following 2016 when OPV2 was withdrawn, the number of cVDPV2 cases globally has been greater than the number of WPV1 cases. The Global Polio Laboratory Network routinely analyzes and tracks vaccine derived polioviruses just as it does wild polioviruses, to assist the polio program identify the patterns of spread and thereby provide opportunities to limit or prevent the circulation.  In the most recent quarterly routine analysis (July to September 2020) there has been evidence of exportation of cVDPV2 from:",
          "Pakistan to Afghanistan Sudan to Egypt Afghanistan to Iran Côte D’Ivoire to Mali Benin to Nigeria Afghanistan to Pakistan Chad to Sudan Chad into Cameroon Côte D’Ivoire and Togo to Burkina Faso Somalia to Ethiopia Burkina Faso to Mali Angola to Republic of Congo Chad and Sudan to Republic of South Sudan Ethiopia to Somalia",
          "More recently, in addition to the exportation of cVDPV2 to Egypt and the Republic of the Congo mentioned above, in West Africa, cVDPV2 that has been circulating in Côte d’Ivoire has now been found in sewage in Liberia, and similarly cVDPV2 previously found in Guinea has now caused an outbreak with at least three cases so far in Sierra Leone.  Following the earlier event in September 2020 where virus circulating in Darfur in Sudan was detected in sewage in Giza, Cairo, a second exportation has been detected in sewage in Alexandria in Egypt with links to the cVDPV2 found in the River Nile state in Sudan, and one detection in each of Anwan and Qena in southern Egypt linked to Alexandria.  The cVDPV2 virus causing the large outbreak in Afghanistan has now been detected in Sistan and Baluchistan province of the Islamic Republic of Iran, where it has been found in sewage in two districts on three separate occasions.  It has also been detected in two AFP cases in Tajikistan. However, the number of lineages detected so far in 2020 is 35, compared to 44 for the whole of 2019, and the number of newly emerged viruses is only 13 so far in 2020, compared to 38 during 2019.  This reduction may reflect refinement and modification of cVDPV2 outbreak management to lessen the risk of seeding new emergences. The committee noted that novel OPV2 (nOPV2) has received an interim recommendation for use under WHO’s Emergency Use Listing procedure (EUL) to enable rapid field availability, and potential wider rollout of the vaccine.  The EUL involves careful and rigorous analysis of existing data to enable early, targeted use of unlicensed products for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.  WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) endorsed accelerated clinical development of novel OPV2 and its assessment in October 2019. COVID-19 The committee was concerned that COVID-19 continues to have an impact on polio eradication at many levels.  Many of the polio affected countries are currently experiencing a second wave of COVID-19, notably Malaysia, Pakistan and Nigeria. Although resumption of SIAs is now a major focus of the polio program the effect of the pause in 2020 and the current second wave will hamper this resumption. There are ongoing signs of the impact of COVID-19 on surveillance, particularly with slow shipment and handling and reporting of samples for polio testing.   All these factors serve to heighten the risk of polio transmission. The committee noted that since the beginning of the pandemic, the value of polio-funded staff and assets contributed to the COVID-19 response in more than 50 countries is estimated at USD $104 million. In view of the overwhelming public health imperative to end the COVID-19 pandemic, the POB has committed to the polio program’s continued support for the next phase of COVID-19 response, COVID-19 vaccine introduction and delivery, through existing assets, infrastructure and expertise in key geographies. Conclusion The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further three months.  The Committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy duration of the polio PHEIC, but concludes that the current situation is extraordinary, with clear ongoing and increasing risk of international spread and ongoing need for coordinated international response. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion: Rising risk of WPV1 international spread: Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of WPV1 appears to be currently very high: transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan remains high noting that the small decrease in Pakistan is yet to be sustained, and in Afghanistan case numbers have doubled; expansion of WPV1 transmission into previously polio free areas in both countries and rising positive environmental samples in both endemic countries; the ongoing inaccessibility in many provinces of Afghanistan leading increasingly to highly susceptible populations which are and will continue to drive higher transmission; over 3 million children were missed in the October and November NIDs, and the cohort of missed children continues to grow quickly; ongoing vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan leading to higher numbers of missed children particularly in high risk districts; the fall in population immunity consequent on the four months pause in polio vaccination necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to greater susceptibility to poliovirus importation and outbreaks in high risk countries; the complicated context of WPV eradication activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan created by the need to simultaneously respond to cVDPV2 and COVID-19 ; the second wave of COVID-19 that appears to be currently under way in many polio affected countries making interventions more difficult; the difficulties in supplying vaccines due to the pandemic (as is being seen in Yemen, for example). Rising risk of cVDPV2 international spread: Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 appears to be currently very high: The increasingly large number of cases, environmental detections and documented exportations across borders to both new countries and already infected countries; The ever widening gap in population intestinal mucosal immunity in young children since the withdrawal of OPV2 in 2016; The same factors regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as mentioned above; The population of inaccessible children in Afghanistan that appears to be driving intense transmission there. Other factors include Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies including COVID19, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger, Somalia and Myanmar, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods. Population movement: While border closures may have mitigated the short term risk, conversely the risk once borders begin to be re-opened is likely to be higher. Risk categories The Committee provided the Director-General with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows: States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3. States infected with cVDPV2, with or without evidence of local transmission: States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV. Criteria to assess States as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV: Poliovirus Case: 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case PLUS one month to account for case detection, investigation, laboratory testing and reporting period OR when all reported AFP cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for WPV1 or cVDPV, and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative, whichever is the longer. Environmental or other isolation of WPV1 or cVDPV (no poliovirus case): 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample (such as from a healthy child) PLUS one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting period These criteria may be varied for the endemic countries, where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps. Once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected, the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months.  After this period, the country will no longer be subject to Temporary Recommendations, unless the Committee has concerns based on the final report. TEMPORARY RECOMMENDATIONS States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk of international spread WPV1 Afghanistan                       (most recent detection 1 Jan 2021) Pakistan                            (most recent detection 13 Jan 2021) cVDPV1 Malaysia                            (most recent detection 13 March 2020) Philippines                         (most recent detection 28 November 2019) Yemen                                (most recent detection 6 Aug 2020) These countries should: Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication; where such declaration has already been made, this emergency status should be maintained as long as the response is required. Ensure that all residents and long­term visitors (i.e. > four weeks) of all ages, receive a dose of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel. Ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within four weeks), who have not received a dose of bOPV or IPV in the previous four weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travelers. Ensure that such travelers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the IHR to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination. Restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travelers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea). Further intensify cross­border efforts by significantly improving coordination at the national, regional and local levels to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers crossing the border and of high risk cross­border populations. Improved coordination of cross­border efforts should include closer supervision and monitoring of the quality of vaccination at border transit points, as well as tracking of the proportion of travelers that are identified as unvaccinated after they have crossed the border. Further intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, as high routine immunization coverage is an essential element of the polio eradication strategy, particularly as the world moves closer to eradication. Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without new infections and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the above assessment criteria for being no longer infected. Provide to the Director-General a regular report on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel. States infected with cVDPV2, with or without evidence of local transmission: Afghanistan             (most recent detection 1 Jan 2020) Angola                     (most recent detection 9 February 2020) Benin                       (most recent detection 30 Nov 2020) Burkina Faso           (most recent detection 14 Nov 2020) Cameroon               (most recent detection 29 Septr 2020) CAR                        (most recent detection 2 Oct 2020) Chad                       (most recent detection25 Nov 2020) Rep Congo             (most recent detection 8 Sept  2020) DR Congo              (most recent detection 28 Oct 2020) Côte d’Ivoire          (most recent detection 9 Oct 2020) Egypt                      (most recent detection 23 January 2021) Ethiopia                  (most recent detection 30 Aug 2020) Ghana                    (most recent detection 9 March 2020) Guinea                   (most recent detection 26 Oct 2020) Iran                        (most recent detection 25 December 2020) (Islamic Republic of) Liberia                    (most recent detection 3 Nov 2020) Malaysia                (most recent detection 4 Feb 2020) Mali                        (most recent detection 31 Oct June 2020) Niger                      (most recent detection 25 August 2020) Nigeria                   (most recent detection 13 Nov 2020) Pakistan                 (most recent detection 28 Dec 2020) Philippines              (most recent detection 16 January 2020) Sierra Leone           (most recent detection 19 Nov 2020) Somalia                   (most recent detection 25Oct 2020) South Sudan           (most recent detection 6 Nov 2020) Sudan                     (most recent detection 3 Dec 2020) Tajikistan                (most recent detection 15 Jan 2021) Togo                       (most recent detection 3 May 2020) States that have had an importation of cVDPV2 but without evidence of local transmission should: Officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the prevention or interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency Undertake urgent and intensive investigations to determine if there has been local transmission of the imported cVDPV2 Noting the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections, consider requesting vaccines from the global mOPV2 stockpile based on the recommendations of the Advisory Group on mOPV2. Further intensify efforts to increase IPV immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data. Intensify national and international surveillance regional cooperation and cross­border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus. States with local transmission of cVDPV2, with risk of international spread should i n addition to the above measures should: Encourage residents and long­term visitors to receive a dose of IPV four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel. Ensure that travelers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status. Intensify regional cooperation and cross­border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus, and vaccinate refugees, travelers and cross­border populations, according to the advice of the Advisory Group. For both sub-categories: Maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least six months have passed without the detection of circulation of VDPV2 in the country from any source, and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until the state meets the criteria of a ‘state no longer infected’. At the end of 12 months without evidence of transmission, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations. States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV WPV1 none cVDPV Mozambique          (most recent cVDPV2 detection 17 December 2018) Indonesia               (most recent cVDPV1 detection 13 February 2019) Myanmar                (most recent cVDPV1 detection 9 August 2019) China                      (most recent cVDPV2 detection 18 August 2019) Zambia                   (most recent cVDPV2 detection 25 November 2019) These countries should: Urgently strengthen routine immunization to boost population immunity. Enhance surveillance quality, including considering introducing supplementary methods such as environmental surveillance, to reduce the risk of undetected WPV1 and cVDPV transmission, particularly among high risk mobile and vulnerable populations. Intensify efforts to ensure vaccination of mobile and cross­border populations, Internally Displaced Persons, refugees and other vulnerable groups. Enhance regional cooperation and cross border coordination to ensure prompt detection of WPV1 and cVDPV, and vaccination of high risk population groups. Maintain these measures with documentation of full application of high quality surveillance and vaccination activities. At the end of 12 months without evidence of reintroduction of WPV1 or new emergence and circulation of cVDPV, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations. Additional considerations The committee welcomed the Emergency Use Listing of novel OPV2 but cautioned there was much to be done before the new vacccine could be expected to have a significant impact globally on the spread of cVDPV2. The phased replacement during 2021 of Sabin OPV2 with novel OPV2 is expected to substantially reduce the source of cVDPV2 emergence, transmission and subsequent risk of international spread.  Full licensure and pre-qualification of nOPV2 is not expected before 2022; therefore all countries at risk of cVDPV2 outbreak should consider preparing for novel OPV2 use under Emergency Use Listing procedure. The committee welcomed the progress being made in individual countries that were facing huge challenges with both polio and COVID-19.  COVID-19 is also likely to continue to have a significant adverse impact on stopping polio transmission throughout 2021, with diversion of resources, barriers to successful polio campaign implementation and the consequential growing immunity gap.  However, the committee urged countries to look for where synergies can be built between polio and COVID -19 control, such as countering vaccine hesitancy, expanding and sharing testing resources, and vaccine management.  Countries also needed to make sure that local lockdowns and border restrictions were implemented in such a way as to avoid hampering specimen shipment and testing, particularly in West Africa where there are already constraints in lab capacity.  As testing for COVID-19 is strengthened, this should be done so as to strengthen lab capacity for other infectious diseases such as polio.  The committee urges affected countries to strengthen cross border cooperation as this appeared to be inconsistently carried out. The committee also noted the risk of vaccine hesitancy could be exacerbated during the pandemic, so that adverse events during the development or future deployment of any COVID-19 vaccine could compound the existing issues around polio vaccines, particularly but not only in Pakistan.  Conversely, vaccine issues arising out of novel OPV2 or trivalent OPV use could adversely affect any future COVID-19 vaccine deployment.  The committee urged countries with particular issues around vaccine hesitancy to make preparations now to avert situations of greater vaccine refusals through education campaigns, activities to counter misinformation and rumors and wherever possible provide incentives to target populations such as multi-antigen campaigns and offering other health and wellbeing services (vitamins, anti-worming medication, soap etc). The committee was also very concerned about the polio program funding gap which is developing in 2021 and beyond, noting several countries in Africa had been adversely affected by funding constraints.  The committee called on donors to maintain funding of polio eradication activities, as the potential for reversal of progress appears high, with many years of work undone easily and swiftly if WPV1 spreads outside the endemic countries. Noting the serious situation in Afghanistan, the committee welcomed the recent agreement regarding mosque to mosque vaccination campaign activities but urged using multiple vaccines to avoid outbreaks of other vaccine preventable diseases such as measles. Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 19 February 2021 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 19 February 2021."

Although resumption of SIAs is now a major focus of the polio program the effect of the pause in 2020 and the current second wave will hamper this resumption. There are ongoing signs of the impact of COVID-19 on surveillance, particularly with slow shipment and handling and reporting of samples for polio testing.   All these factors serve to heighten the risk of polio transmission.",

In view of the overwhelming public health imperative to end the COVID-19 pandemic, the POB has committed to the polio program’s continued support for the next phase of COVID-19 response, COVID-19 vaccine introduction and delivery, through existing assets, infrastructure and expertise in key geographies."

The phased replacement during 2021 of Sabin OPV2 with novel OPV2 is expected to substantially reduce the source of cVDPV2 emergence, transmission and subsequent risk of international spread.  Full licensure and pre-qualification of nOPV2 is not expected before 2022; therefore all countries at risk of cVDPV2 outbreak should consider preparing for novel OPV2 use under Emergency Use Listing procedure.",
          "The committee welcomed the progress being made in individual countries that were facing huge challenges with both polio and COVID-19.  COVID-19 is also likely to continue to have a significant adverse impact on stopping polio transmission throughout 2021, with diversion of resources, barriers to successful polio campaign implementation and the consequential growing immunity gap.  However, the committee urged countries to look for where synergies can be built between polio and COVID -19 control, such as countering vaccine hesitancy, expanding and sharing testing resources, and vaccine management.  Countries also needed to make sure that local lockdowns and border restrictions were implemented in such a way as to avoid hampering specimen shipment and testing, particularly in West Africa where there are already constraints in lab capacity.  As testing for COVID-19 is strengthened, this should be done so as to strengthen lab capacity for other infectious diseases such as polio.  The committee urges affected countries to strengthen cross border cooperation as this appeared to be inconsistently carried out.",
          "The committee also noted the risk of vaccine hesitancy could be exacerbated during the pandemic, so that adverse events during the development or future deployment of any COVID-19 vaccine could compound the existing issues around polio vaccines, particularly but not only in Pakistan.  Conversely, vaccine issues arising out of novel OPV2 or trivalent OPV use could adversely affect any future COVID-19 vaccine deployment.  The committee urged countries with particular issues around vaccine hesitancy to make preparations now to avert situations of greater vaccine refusals through education campaigns, activities to counter misinformation and rumors and wherever possible provide incentives to target populations such as multi-antigen campaigns and offering other health and wellbeing services (vitamins, anti-worming medication, soap etc).",
          "The committee was also very concerned about the polio program funding gap which is developing in 2021 and beyond, noting several countries in Africa had been adversely affected by funding constraints.  The committee called on donors to maintain funding of polio eradication activities, as the potential for reversal of progress appears high, with many years of work undone easily and swiftly if WPV1 spreads outside the endemic countries.",
          "Noting the serious situation in Afghanistan, the committee welcomed the recent agreement regarding mosque to mosque vaccination campaign activities but urged using multiple vaccines to avoid outbreaks of other vaccine preventable diseases such as measles.",
          "Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by affected countries, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 19 February 2021 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV.  The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s recommendations for countries meeting the definition for ‘States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread’, ‘States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread’ and for ‘States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV’ and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 19 February 2021."

We're delighted that ILO is joining the Global Action\r\n    Plan, and we look forward to working together to protect those who protect all of us.\"",
          "The ILO has staff based in regional and country offices in 135 countries and ongoing collaborations with WHO and other signatories of the Global Action Plan. Key areas of cooperation include health financing and social protection, occupational health\r\n    and safety, the working conditions of the health workforce and gender equality.",
          "On joining the partnership, Mr Ryder, Director-General of the ILO said: “The COVID-19 crisis has clearly demonstrated the interaction between health, social factors and decent work. It has highlighted the critical need for investments in all three\r\n    areas. This will foster recovery and will lead to a more sustainable, equitable development path. Equally, investments in the health of workers and the health and care workforce are vital to make progress towards universal health coverage. If we are\r\n    to achieve SDG3, increased cooperation is needed. By joining this partnership the ILO reaffirms its commitment to support countries during this pandemic and beyond, through a multilateral and coherent approach.”",

This means it is vitally important now to determine the vaccine’s effectiveness when it comes to preventing more severe illness caused by the B.1.351 variant.",

CEPI has announced funding for additional clinical research to optimize and extend the use of existing vaccines, which could include \"mix-and-match\" studies of different vaccines used in combinations that may improve the quality and strength of the immune response.  Such studies could be useful in optimizing the use of available vaccines, including the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine.",

The ability to deploy vaccines globally to address the evolving pandemic is more critical than ever, as is the importance of coordination to ensure we do not put the impact and value of vaccines at risk.  If new vaccines are required, ensuring global access to these is even more essential, as we continue to see that we are all safe only if everyone is safe.",
          "With regards to the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, COVAX has signed advance purchase agreements with AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India and has published plans to distribute nearly 350 million doses in the first half of the year. We expect a decision this month from WHO on whether the vaccines will be granted emergency use listing (EUL) as well as a SAGE recommendation on its optimal use. Should EUL be forthcoming, we expect the vaccine to play a key role in our effort to protect high risk persons and to help end the acute phase of the pandemic."

Bloomberg, Founder, Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies, today joined Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, in calling for urgent action to tackle noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, cancer and respiratory diseases, which account for over 74% of deaths globally and worsen outcomes of patients with COVID-19.",
          "This comes as WHO confirms that Bloomberg will continue for a third term as WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries.",
          "His WHO Ambassador role follows decades of involvement in health policy, including his three terms as mayor of New York City, and a long-standing collaboration with WHO to take on some of the biggest global health challenges. In his role, Bloomberg will continue to raise awareness about the link between COVID-19 and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), advocate for investment in measures to tackle NCDs and injuries, mobilize cities for better health, and support the use of health data to drive programs and policies.",
          "“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the full danger of noncommunicable diseases – and signaled the urgent need for stronger public health policies and investment to prevent them,” said Dr Tedros. “We urge world leaders in business and government to take aggressive steps to prevent noncommunicable diseases. Fewer NCDs would have meant fewer deaths during the pandemic.”",
          "“The majority of those who have died from COVID-19 had an underlying noncommunicable disease, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease or cancer. NCDs account for nearly three-quarters of all deaths around the world, and the scale and urgency of the problem was thrown into sharp relief by COVID-19. NCDs can be prevented, and we know what works,” said Michael R. Bloomberg, WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries. “Bloomberg Philanthropies has been working with WHO to reduce tobacco use, support healthier diets, fight cardiovascular disease, and strengthen health data to guide our work. We look forward to expanding our efforts to help more cities and countries take action on NCDs and to save lives.”",
          "NCDs currently kill over 40 million people every year. These chronic conditions have also increased the death toll from COVID-19, which has already taken over two million lives. People who are obese, who use tobacco, and who have hypertension are at increased risk of being hospitalized and dying from COVID-19.",
          "In addition to COVID-19, Bloomberg’s work with WHO and investments more broadly in public health focus on major, life-saving initiatives to reduce tobacco and youth e-cigarette use, support healthy food policy, reduce drowning, and improve road safety and maternal health, among others.",
          "In 2017, Bloomberg Philanthropies partnered with WHO and Vital Strategies to launch the Partnership for Healthy Cities, a network of 70 global cities, covering nearly 300 million people, committed to preventing NCDs and injuries since 2017.

          "In conjunction with the FIFA Club World Cup 2020, being held in Qatar from 4 to 11 February 2021, FIFA and WHO are launching a public awareness campaign involving star footballers, through TV and in-stadium messaging, to further promote the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator initiative launched in April 2020, and to urge people to practice mask wearing, physical distancing and hand hygiene.",
          "“We all have to play our part in the battle against the coronavirus. We are also calling on the international community to #ACTogether to ensure a level playing field in relation to access to vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests across the\r\n    globe,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said during a video conference prior to the kick-off of the FIFA Club World Cup.",

          "“Fairness is the foundation of football and all other sports, and this also must be the same when it comes to health,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “The rules of the COVID-19 challenge are simple: all people at risk from the coronavirus\r\n    in all countries must have equitable access to life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. In just nine months, the world has established these three powerful lines of defense against COVID-19. But our goal now is to ensure equitable access\r\n    and continued refinement of these tools.”",
          "Dr Tedros added: “WHO is grateful to FIFA for teaming up with health partners around the world to promote the need for the fair distribution of the tools needed to defeat the coronavirus.”",
          "The new FIFA-WHO collaboration will amplify life-saving messages to a global audience with a series of promotional videos being broadcast during the FIFA Club World Cup. In the videos, competing club captains reiterate the key steps for everyone to follow\r\n    in order to tackle and defeat the coronavirus by focusing on hands, elbow, face, distance, symptoms, masks and opening windows.",
          "“It is important that we do not forget that health comes first,” said the FIFA President. “Only by following the advice of our medical professionals will we be able to eliminate the threat posed by COVID-19, and I call upon everyone\r\n    to follow these steps in their daily lives. This advice not only protects you, but also protects your loved ones and those around you. In delivering these messages during the FIFA Club World Cup, I appreciate the support given by the participating\r\n    teams and their players, coaching staff and other officials in respecting the protocols that need to be followed in order to play this tournament, and to ensure that we keep the football flame flickering brightly during these challenging times.”",
          "The video awareness campaign will feature players and head coaches from the competing teams at the FIFA Club World Cup Qatar 2020 together with FIFA Legends, and will be published on various FIFA, WHO and club digital channels, with the support of broadcasters\r\n    worldwide.",

          "From Yohei Sasakawa, WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination",
          "Over the past year, the headlines have been dominated by COVID-19. It is easy to overlook other diseases, especially a disease such as leprosy that many people think is a disease of the past.",
          "But leprosy requires our attention. There are still some 200,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide each year. Millions of people are living with some form of disability as a result of leprosy.",
          "Both the label “leprosy” and the disability that can result if this age-old disease goes untreated can lead to social exclusion. Persons affected by leprosy continue to face discrimination, reinforced in some countries by outdated laws that make leprosy grounds for divorce, prevent people with the disease from participating in public life or place other restrictions on their activities.",
          "As WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination, I have seen for myself how leprosy has marginalized individuals. Women and children are particularly vulnerable to the social and economic consequences of the disease.",
          "Overcoming leprosy involves more than early diagnosis and prompt treatment. It also requires changing mindsets so that leprosy is no longer a source of shame or prejudice. We must remove all barriers in the way of those seeking medical care. We must eliminate the obstacles that prevent affected individuals and their families from living in dignity and enjoying all their basic human rights as full members of society.",
          "I often talk about leprosy in terms of a motorcycle. The front wheel represents curing the disease and the rear wheel symbolizes ending discrimination. Only when both wheels are turning at the same time will we make progress toward our destination of a leprosy-free world.",
          "As I survey the road ahead, I am confident we are moving in the right direction: the WHO’s Global Leprosy Strategy for 2021-2030 will generate renewed momentum; organizations of persons affected by leprosy are becoming more influential, and their calls for change more powerful; and the UN Special Rapporteur on leprosy is working tirelessly to see that principles and guidelines on the elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members are fully implemented.",
          "I believe we will achieve a world without leprosy one day. But along the way, we need to realize an inclusive society in which everyone has access to quality treatment and services, and a diagnosis of leprosy no longer comes with a possibility of devastating physical, social, economic or psychological consequences.",
          "Compared to other diseases, leprosy may only affect a small number of people, but we are all responsible for building an inclusive world."

          "To address the lack of access to tests and testing services in multiple countries, WHO since 2018 has published a yearly essential diagnostics list (EDL), a basket of recommended in vitro diagnostics that should be available at point-of-care\r\n    and in laboratories in all countries to increase timely and life-saving diagnoses.",
          "The latest edition , published today, includes WHO-recommended COVID-19 tests (PCR and Antigen), expands the suite of tests for vaccine-preventable and infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases (such as cancer and diabetes), and introduces a section\r\n    on endocrinology, which is important for reproductive and women’s health. For the first time, the list includes tests that should not be supplied in countries, either because they are not cost-effective, are unreliable or have been surpassed\r\n    by newer, easier to use technologies.",
          "‘Access to quality tests and laboratory services is like having a good radar system that gets you where you need to go. Without it, you’re flying blind,’ said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ‘All countries\r\n    should pay particular attention to the diagnostics space and use the essential list to promote better health, keep their populations safe, and serve the vulnerable.’",
          "The use of accurate, quality diagnostics is the first step in the development and implementation of strategies for treatment, control, and in many cases prevention of disease and outbreaks. Their critical role in the health system has been brought into\r\n    sharp focus by the current COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "‘Testing affects the majority of medical decisions,’ said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. ‘In all countries, the use of appropriate diagnostic tests can help\r\n    inform evidence-based treatment and responsible use of medicines, resulting in improved allocation of resources and better health outcomes.’",
          "The EDL is an evidence-based guide that looks at disease prevalence globally and for each condition recommends the appropriate test. That guidance aims not only to improve the health system’s capacity to reach accurate diagnoses, it also saves precious\r\n    health resources that would otherwise be wasted on inappropriate treatment or lengthy hospital stays.",
          "As well as tests intended for use in laboratories, the EDL recommends numerous diagnostics that should be available at primary care or community level. This is particularly important for rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, where medical facilities\r\n    and equipment may be lacking and health providers are often forced to make treatment decisions based solely on patient symptoms.",
          "The recommendations in the list are based on robust evidence and take into account country suitability. The process is overseen by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on In Vitro Diagnostics (SAGE IVD), a group of specialists from around the world\r\n    with long standing experience in the field of IVDs and their implementation, their use, regulation and evaluation. The experts evaluate data on the usefulness, impact and accuracy of each test considered in order to decide which should be recommended.",
          "The EDL is not prescriptive – it is intended as a policy tool for countries to create their own national lists based on their local context and needs. WHO will shortly also publish a step-by-step guide to aid countries wishing to develop a national\r\n    list. So far, WHO has worked with Nigeria, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan to support the development of their national EDLs and is currently in discussions with additional mostly African countries that have requested assistance to boost their diagnostic\r\n    services."

Rollout will commence with the successful negotiation and execution of supply agreements.",
          "In further support of its mission to expedite early availability of vaccines to lower-income countries and help bring a rapid end to the acute stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, COVAX also confirmed today that it will exercise an option – via an existing agreement with Serum Institute of India (SII) – to receive its first 100 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford University-developed vaccine manufactured by SII.",
          "Of these first 100 million doses, the majority are earmarked for delivery in the first quarter of the year, pending WHO Emergency Use Listing. The WHO review process, which is currently underway, follows approval for restricted use in emergency situations\r\nby the Drugs Controller General of India earlier this month, and is a critical aspect of ensuring that any vaccine procured through COVAX is fully quality assured for international use. According to the latest WHO update, a decision on this vaccine candidate is anticipated by the middle of February.",
          "COVAX also anticipates that, via an existing agreement with AstraZeneca , at least 50 million\r\nfurther doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine will be available for delivery to COVAX participants in Q1 2021, pending emergency use listing by WHO of the COVAX-specific manufacturing network for these doses. A decision on this candidate is also\r\nanticipated by WHO in February.",

This is not just significant for COVAX, it is a major step forward for equitable access to vaccines, and an essential part of the global effort to beat this pandemic. We will only be safe anywhere\r\nif we are safe everywhere,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which leads COVAX procurement and delivery.",
          "Preparations, led by WHO, UNICEF and Gavi, are already well under way for COVAX to deliver vaccines to economies eligible for support via the COVAX AMC, with Gavi making US$ 150 million available from its core funding as initial, catalytic support for\r\npreparedness and delivery.",
          "“The urgent and equitable rollout of vaccines is not just a moral imperative, it’s also a health security, strategic and economic imperative,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “This\r\nagreement with Pfizer will help to enable COVAX to save lives, stabilize health systems and drive the global economic recovery.”",
          "Building on the work of the past months supporting country readiness efforts, a “Country Readiness Portal” will be launched by WHO this month, which will allow AMC participants to submit final national deployment and vaccination plans (NDVPs).\r\nThis is a vital step before allocations can be made, to ensure that delivered doses are able to be effectively deployed and to identify where, if necessary, further support is needed.",
          "“These purchase agreements open the door for these lifesaving vaccines to become available to people in the most vulnerable countries,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “But at the same time we are securing vaccines we\r\nmust also ensure that countries are ready to receive them, deploy them, and build trust in them.”",
          "The COVAX Facility intends to provide all 190 participating economies with an indicative allocation of doses by the end of this month. This indicative allocation will provide interim guidance to participants – offering a minimum planning scenario\r\nto enable preparations for the final allocation of the number of doses each participant will receive in the first rounds of vaccine distribution.",
          "Supply update",
          "COVAX now has agreements in place to access just over two billion doses of several promising vaccine candidates . Negotiations continue\r\nfor further doses to be secured through existing R&D agreements by COVAX co-lead the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), through evaluations of new products with promising results and through contributions from donors.",
          "Based on this, COVAX anticipates being able to provide participating economies doses of safe and effective vaccines – enough to protect health care and other frontline workers as well as some high-risk individuals – beginning in Q1 2021. The\r\naim is to protect at least 20% of each participating population by the end of the year – unless a participant has requested a lower percentage of doses. At least 1.3 billion of these doses will be made available to the 92 economies eligible\r\nfor the Gavi COVAX AMC by the end of 2021.",
          "To meet its goal of securing two billion safe and effective vaccines in 2021, COVAX has built a diverse portfolio of vaccine candidates which mitigates the risk of a product failing development, production or regulatory processes, and ensures availability\r\nof products suitable for various contexts and settings. This work will continue at pace to enable further supply of vaccines suitable for use across a wide range of populations and settings in 2021 and beyond.",
          "“The progress in vaccine development so far has been extraordinary, and it is clear that we are now assembling the tools we need to bring the acute phase of the pandemic to an end. But we cannot afford to slow our efforts given the speed with which\r\nthis pandemic continues to wreak havoc,” said Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI. “The emergence of new variants of COVID-19 puts into sharp focus the need for us to be one step ahead of the virus by continuing to invest in vaccine R&D\r\n- specifically for next-generation vaccine candidates and to be ready for strain changes in existing vaccines - to ensure we have the tools to meet the needs of all populations in all countries for the long term.”",

It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to\r\nensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.",
          "CEPI is leading on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio , investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support development\r\nof three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility. As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility to a number\r\nof candidates, and made strategic investments in vaccine manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine. CEPI is also\r\ninvesting in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.",
          "Gavi is leading on procurement and delivery for COVAX, coordinating the design and implementation of the COVAX Facility and the COVAX AMC and working with Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery. The COVAX Facility is the global pooled procurement mechanism for COVID-19\r\nvaccines through which COVAX will ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for all 190 participating economies, using an allocation framework formulated by WHO. The COVAX Facility will do this by pooling buying power from participating economies\r\nand providing volume guarantees across a range of promising vaccine candidates. The Gavi COVAX AMC is the financing mechanism that will support the participation of 92 low- and middle-income countries in the Facility, enabling access to donor-funded\r\ndoses of safe and effective vaccines. UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) will be acting as procurement coordinators for the COVAX Facility, helping deliver vaccines to all participants.",
          "WHO has multiple roles within the COVAX: among other things it supports countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines and does so in partnership with UNICEF. It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D,\r\nallocation, and country readiness and delivery. Its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations. Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL)/prequalification programmes ensure harmonized\r\nreview and authorization across member states. It provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring. It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination. Along\r\nwith COVAX partners, it is developing a no-fault compensation scheme for indemnification and liability issues. COVAX is part of the Act accelerator which WHO launched with partners in 2020.",

Reports are in line with the expected, all-cause mortality rates and causes of death in the sub-population of frail, elderly individuals, and the available information does not confirm a contributory role for the vaccine in the reported fatal events. In view of this, the committee considers that the benefit-risk balance of BNT162b2 remains favourable in the elderly, and does not suggest any revision, at present, to the recommendations around the safety of this vaccine.",

          "Honorable Chair, Excellencies, Director-General, Ladies and Gentlemen",
          "Thank you once again for the opportunity to provide you with an update on the work of the Review Committee on the Functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005) during COVID-19.",
          "As you know, this Committee was convened by the Director-General on 8 September 2020, in line with World Health Assembly Resolution WHA73.1. The Committee is composed of experts with a wide range of expertise and with adequate gender and geographical representation. I have the honour to be the Chair of this Committee and am ably supported by our Vice-Chair, Professor Lucille Blumberg of South Africa and our Rapporteur, Professor Preben Aavitsland, from Norway.",
          "Our mandate is to review the functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005) during the COVID-19 response and the status of implementation of the relevant recommendations of previous IHR Review Committees and to make technical recommendations to the Director-General, including any potential amendments.",
          "We convened for 16 closed meetings so far, and we continue to work through three sub-groups: preparedness, alert, and response. I take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to our three subgroup leads. We also convened 5 open meetings, when we provided updates on our work and listened to the submissions and questions raised by Member States, international agencies and non-governmental organizations in official relation to WHO. These open meetings continue to be attended by numerous designated representatives.",
          "I reported on our progress to the 73rd World Health Assembly on 9 November 2020. And I continue to interact regularly with the Co-Chairs of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response and the Chair of the Independent Oversight Advisory Committee.",
          "Let me now turn to the substance of our work. I invite you to read our Interim Progress Report, document EB148/19. It details our preliminary findings as of December 2020, which were reached following numerous interviews, discussions and the review of a wealth of documentation.",
          {
            "text": "Let me point out the most important ones:",
            "bullets": [
              "Member States and experts overwhelmingly support the IHR as a cornerstone of international public health and health security law, but several areas need improving if we are to be better prepared for the next pandemic. While we have not finalized our article-by-article assessment, there is a growing belief in the Committee that most of the necessary improvements can be achieved through more effective implementation of the existing provisions of the IHR, and do not require at this point changes to the design of the IHR.",
              "National IHR Focal Points need to be further empowered, including where necessary through national legislation. National Focal Points play a critical role in the timely sharing of information, but their limited authority and status often lead to delays in notification. The Committee noted that effective IHR implementation requires many functions that are not within the narrow mandate of the national IHR focal points, such as multisectoral coordination for preparedness and response and collaborative risk assessment. The absence of a dedicated national entity with sufficient authority and a clear mandate to take ownership and leadership is considered a significant limitation to effective implementation of the IHR at national and subnational levels. At country level, national IHR focal points need to be integrated in the national emergency plan as well as the national health committee or similar body.",
              "The possible need for an intermediate level of alert before a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is declared, is also under consideration. The previous review committee on the Ebola response recommended such an intermediate level, but this recommendation was not taken up. The 5th open meeting of the Committee on 12 January 2021 discussed issues surrounding the possible introduction of a grading system. The different views expressed by Member States and the advantages and potential disadvantages of a new system will be further studied by the Committee. It is clear, that global preparedness, alert and response actions need to start much earlier and more decisively than they did during COVID-19. But it is far from certain, that introducing an intermediate level of alert would result in such earlier action. The Committee is considering how regular global and regional risk assessments can be used better to drive earlier and more targeted response measures at all levels. The aim, the Committee feels, should be to react early and strongly enough so as to prevent the need to declare a PHEIC.",
              "Compliance with IHR provisions remains a challenge in several areas, from setting up core capacities to implementing travel measures during health emergencies. The Committee is mindful of the lack of teeth in the IHR. We are therefore looking at new ways to monitoring and evaluating adherence to the IHR – both in preparedness and response – and to strengthen existing tools without overburdening countries. Considering a peer-review mechanism similar to the Universal Periodic Review used by the Human Rights Council, may be useful in improving preparedness and response. For example, the Universal Periodic Review has been shown to foster intersectoral coordination and whole-of-government approaches, to encourage good practices, and to link implementation of its recommendations with other government agendas – all of which are vital to strengthening IHR implementation. It is in this context that the Director-General has proposed the Universal Health and Preparedness Review initiative which is currently being pilot tested.",
              "Last but far from least, political support and resources for IHR implementation remain insufficient and irregular at all levels. In this context, the Committee is awaiting further detailed information on the funding mechanisms for IHR implementation."
            ]
          },
          "I would like to clearly state my conviction that we need more meaningful cooperation during and in-between health emergencies; more transparency, more regular detailed exchange of real-time data and experiences at all levels, more reliability of interaction, and greater speed in sharing data and samples. Fortunately, digital technology supporting such developments is increasingly becoming available, from data mining to find disease outbreaks early, to next generation sequencing to follow a pathogen around the globe, to virtual conferencing that makes human interaction easier.",
          "To come to the conclusion, the deadline for our final report is the 74th World Health Assembly in May 2021. However, as we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic will be far from over in 4 months’ time, and therefore our findings and recommendations will not necessarily be complete. Further deliberations may be needed later.",
          "Let me reiterate what I said in November 2020 on the occasion of the 73rd Health Assembly: The IHR are your instrument, our instrument, of international public health law. Making them work requires giving WHO the tools and the resources it needs to better prepare and protect humanity against public health risks, through an effective, coordinated, multisectoral and evidence-based public health response.",
          "Thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you today and let me also thank the Director-General for the excellent support provided by the WHO Secretariat to this Review Committee."

          "More than 2,800 scientists from 130 countries gathered on Friday (January 15) in a virtual forum hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) to identify knowledge gaps and set research priorities for vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.",
          "They discussed the safety and efficacy of existing vaccines and new candidates, ways to optimize limited supply, and the need for additional safety studies.",
          "“The development and approval of several safe and effective vaccines less than a year after this virus was isolated and sequenced is an astounding scientific accomplishment,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, in his opening remarks. “The approval of the first few vaccines does not mean the job is done. Far from it. More vaccines are in the pipeline, which must be evaluated to ensure we have enough doses to vaccinate everyone.”",
          "More than 30 million vaccine doses have already been administered in 47 mostly high-income countries. But the global vaccine rollout has exposed glaring inequalities in access to this life-saving tool.",
          "“The spirit of collaboration has to prevail in these challenging times as we seek to understand this virus,” said Dr John Nkengasong, Director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. “We have to be mindful of the inequalities and we must deliberately promote investment in regional capacities to level the playing field and have meaningful collaboration to begin to address some of the challenges.”",
          "Experts agreed the need for critical research on administering vaccines in different target populations, as well as on vaccination delivery strategies and schedules. This includes trials, modelling and observational studies, all of which would help to inform policy.",
          "They discussed the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants on the efficacy of vaccines, the impact of vaccines on transmission of infection, and the need to develop the next generation of vaccine platforms.",
          "“The world needs multiple vaccines that work in different populations in order to meet global demand and end the COVID-19 outbreak. Ideally, those will be single-dose vaccines that do not require cold chain, could be delivered without a needle and syringe and are amenable to large-scale manufacture,” said Professor Mike Levine, Founder and Former Director of the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland School of Medicine,",
          "The meeting concluded with agreement to establish a WHO-hosted platform for global sharing and coordination of emerging vaccine research information on efficacy and safety. The forum would enable scientists to share and discuss unpublished and published data and research protocols to further our collective understanding of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",
          "“The WHO will regularly convene experts from around the world, promote collaborative research, provide standard protocols and develop a platform for sharing the latest knowledge in the field,” said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, WHO Chief Scientist.",

          "On variants, the EC called for a global expansion of genomic sequencing and sharing of data, along with greater scientific collaboration to address critical unknowns.",
          "The committee urged WHO to develop a standardized system for naming new variants that avoids geographical markers, an area WHO has already begun work on.",
          "On vaccines, the committee underlined the need for equitable access through the COVAX Facility as well as technology transfer to increase global production capacities.",
          "The committee strongly encouraged vaccine manufacturers to rapidly provide safety and efficacy data to WHO for emergency use listing. The lack of such data is a barrier to ensuring the timely and equitable supply of vaccines at the global level.",
          "Given that the impact of vaccines in reducing transmission is yet unknown, and the current availability of vaccines is too limited, the committee recommended that countries do not require proof of vaccination from incoming travellers.",
          "The committee advised countries to implement coordinated, evidence-based measures for safe travel and to share with WHO experiences and best practices learned.",
          "This was the sixth meeting of the Emergency Committee on COVID-19. Since the declaration of a PHEIC on 30 January 2020, the Director-General has been reconvening the committee at three-month intervals to review progress.",

          "The four leading international health and humanitarian organizations announced today the establishment of a global Ebola vaccine stockpile to ensure outbreak response.",
          "The effort to establish the stockpile was led by the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision, which includes the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), with financial support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The stockpile will allow countries, with the support of humanitarian organizations, to contain future Ebola epidemics by ensuring timely access to vaccines for populations at risk during outbreaks.",
          "The injectable single-dose Ebola vaccine (rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP, live) is manufactured by Merck, Sharp & Dohme (MSD) Corp. and developed with financial support from the from the government of the United States of America (USA). The European Medicines Agency licensed the Ebola vaccine in November 2019, and the vaccine is now prequalified by WHO, and licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration as well as in eight African countries.",
          "Before achieving licensure, the vaccine was administered to more than 350,000 people in Guinea and in the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo under a protocol for “compassionate use”.",
          "The vaccine, which is recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization for use in Ebola outbreaks as part of a broader set of Ebola outbreak response tools, protects against the Zaire ebolavirus species which is most commonly known to cause outbreaks.",
          "“The COVID-19 pandemic is reminding us of the incredible power of vaccines to save lives from deadly viruses,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Ebola vaccines have made one of the most feared diseases on earth preventable. This new stockpile is an excellent example of solidarity, science and cooperation between international organizations and the private sector to save lives.”",
          "UNICEF manages the stockpile on behalf of the ICG which, as with stockpiles of cholera, meningitis and yellow fever vaccines, will be the decision-making body for its allocation and release.",
          "The stockpile is stored in Switzerland and ready to be shipped to countries for emergency response. The decision to allocate the vaccine will be made within 48 hours of receiving a request from a country; vaccines will be made available together with ultra-cold chain packaging by the manufacturer for shipment to countries within 48 hours of the decision. The targeted overall delivery time from the stockpile to countries is seven days.",
          "“We are proud to be part of this unprecedented effort to help bring potential Ebola outbreaks quickly under control,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “We know that when it comes to disease outbreaks, preparedness is key. This Ebola vaccine stockpile is a remarkable achievement - one that will allow us to deliver vaccines to those who need them the most as quickly as possible.”",
          "As Ebola outbreaks are relatively rare and unpredictable, there is no natural market for the vaccine. Vaccines are only secured through the establishment of the stockpile and are available in limited quantities. The Ebola vaccine is reserved for outbreak response to protect people at the highest risk of contracting Ebola – including healthcare and frontline workers.",
          "“This is an important milestone. Over the past decade alone we have seen Ebola devastate communities in West and Central Africa, always hitting the poorest and most vulnerable the hardest,” said IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain. “Through each outbreak, our volunteers have risked their lives to save lives. With this stockpile, it is my hope that the impact of this terrible disease will be dramatically reduced.”",
          "“The creation of an Ebola vaccine stockpile under the ICG is a positive step”, said Dr Natalie Roberts, Programme Manager, MSF Foundation. “Vaccination is one of the most effective measures to respond to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases, and Ebola is no exception. An Ebola vaccine stockpile can increase transparency in the management of existing global stocks and the timely deployment of the vaccine where it’s most needed, something MSF has called for during recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo.”",
          "An initial 6890 doses are now available for outbreak response with further quantities to be delivered into the stockpile this month and throughout 2021 and beyond. Depending on the rate of vaccine deployment, it could take 2 to 3 years to reach the SAGE-recommended level of 500,000 doses for the emergency stockpile of Ebola vaccines. WHO, UNICEF, Gavi and vaccine manufacturers are continuously assessing options to increase vaccine supply should global demand increase.",

          "Global scientists are intensifying research into COVID-19, as the World Health Organization (WHO) moves to expand its scientific collaboration and monitoring of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.",
          "A day-long virtual meeting of scientists from around the globe, convened by WHO, brought together more than 1 750 experts from 124 countries to discuss critical knowledge gaps and research priorities for emerging variants of the virus.",
          "Welcoming them, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said: “Science and research have played a vital role in responding to the pandemic since day one and will continue to be the heartbeat of everything WHO does.”",
          "The consultation was structured around six thematic areas covering epidemiology and mathematical modelling, evolutionary biology, animal models, assays and diagnostics, clinical management and therapeutics and vaccines.",
          "Scientists noted the importance of research to detect and understand early on the potential impact of emerging variants on diagnostics, treatments and vaccines.",
          "There was a consensus on the importance of integrating the new SARS-CoV-2 variants research into the global research and innovation agenda while enhancing coordination across disciplines.",
          "“Our collective goal is to get ahead of the game and have a global mechanism to quickly identify and study variants of concern and understand their implications for disease control efforts,” said Dr Ana Maria Henao Restrepo, Head of WHO’s\r\n    R&D Blueprint.",
          "It is normal for viruses to mutate , but the more the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads,\r\n    the more opportunities it has to change. High levels of transmission mean that we should expect more variants to emerge.",
          "Of the significant variants reported so far, some are associated with increases in transmissibility but not disease severity. Research is ongoing\r\n    to address whether the changes impact public health tools and measures.",
          "Genomic sequencing has been critical in identifying and responding to new variants.",
          "“So far an astounding 350 000 sequences have been publicly shared, but most come from just a handful of countries. Improving the geographic coverage of sequencing is critical for the world to have eyes and ears on changes to the virus,”\r\n    said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO Technical Lead on COVID-19.",
          "Increasing sequencing capacity across the world is a priority research area for WHO.",
          "Better surveillance and laboratory capacity to monitor strains of concern needs to be accompanied by prompt sharing of virus and serum samples via globally agreed mechanisms so that critical research can be promptly initiated each time.",
          "Scientists highlighted the importance of national data platforms to document critical clinical, epidemiological and virus data that facilitates the detection and assessment of new SARS-CoV-2 variants."
