These plans should clearly identify needs in terms of health workforce, infrastructure and materials, and how to further engage communities. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Note to editors:</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Participants discussed the following principles to be used across all 3 Ebola-affected countries:</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>1.

Non-fatal acts of violence take a particular toll on women and children. One in four children has been physically abused; one in five girls has been sexually abused; and one in three women has been a victim of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence at some point in her lifetime. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Key findings</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Jointly published today by WHO, the United Nations Development Programme, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the report indicates that:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>only one third of the 133 countries surveyed are implementing large-scale initiatives to prevent violence, such as bullying prevention programmes, visits by nurses to families at risk, and support to those who care for older people;</li>\n<li>just over half the countries are fully enforcing a set of 12 laws generally acknowledged to prevent violence, although 80% of countries have enacted them;</li>\n<li>only half of all countries have services in place to protect and support victims of violence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>The consequences of violence on physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health often last a lifetime. Violence also contributes to leading causes of death such as cancer, heart disease and HIV/AIDS, because victims are at an increased risk of adopting behaviours such as smoking, alcohol and drug misuse, and unsafe sex. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“The consequences of violence on families and communities are profound, and can result in lifelong ill health for those affected,” states Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. “Yet we know what works to prevent violence in our homes, schools and workplaces and on our streets and playgrounds. We should take inspiration from governments which have demonstrated success in reducing violence by taking the steps needed. They have shown us that indeed violence is preventable.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The <i>\"Global status report on violence prevention 2014\"</i> is the first report of its kind to assess national efforts to address interpersonal violence, namely child maltreatment, youth violence, intimate partner and sexual violence, and elder abuse. Individual country profiles reflect the extent to which key violence prevention programmes and laws and selected services for victims of violence are being implemented. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The report assessed the scale of implementation of 18 “best buy” violence prevention programmes. It shows, for example, that:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>one half of countries are implementing school-based programmes to teach children and adolescents “life-skills” such as non-violent conflict resolution; </li>\n<li>one half of countries are promoting efforts to change gender norms supportive of violence against women;</li>\n<li>one third of countries are putting in place programmes to improve parenting in families at risk of violence;</li>\n<li>less than one quarter of countries are developing public information campaigns to prevent elder abuse. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>\"High levels of family and community violence cripple both people’s ability to sustain their individual livelihoods, as well as a nation’s options for political, social, and economic development”, said Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme. \"This report takes stock of the measures countries are taking to prevent and respond to interpersonal violence, but the report also reveals gaps in global violence prevention which must be filled, such as the quality and reach of prevention programmes, the access to services for victims, particularly for women and girls who are disproportionately affected by violence, and the enforcement of existing laws.\" </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The report also reviewed 12 laws which are relevant for violence prevention. It shows, for example, that: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>98% of countries have laws against rape;</li>\n<li>87% of countries have laws against domestic violence; </li>\n<li>84% of countries have laws against carrying weapons in schools; </li>\n<li>40% of countries have laws against abuse in institutions for older people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>On average 80% of countries have enacted each of these 12 laws relevant for violence prevention. However, only just over half of countries report that these laws are fully enforced. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Laws protecting citizens against violent crime send a clear message to society about what is acceptable,” said Yury Fedotov, Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. “With this Global status report on violence prevention 2014, we have a useful tool for identifying the gaps in legislation and enforcement in countries, which can help to indicate what further action, is needed to ensure reductions in violent crime.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Providing care and support to victims of violence is important for reducing psychological trauma, helping victims heal, and preventing further involvement in violence. Despite strong evidence linking experiences of violence to mental health problems, under half of countries have mental health services to address victim needs, with only 15% of countries in Africa offering such services. Over two thirds of countries make available child protection services and medico-legal services for victims of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The <i>\"Global status report on violence prevention 2014\"</i> calls for a scaling up of violence prevention programmes in all countries; stronger legislation and enforcement of laws relevant for violence prevention; strengthened justice and security institutions to uphold the rule of law; and enhanced services for victims of violence. It also advocates for better and more effective use of data to inform violence prevention programming and to measure progress. The report is intended for use by governments to help identify gaps and encourage and guide actions and by nongovernmental organizations and experts to assist governments in their efforts. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Laura Sminkey<br/>\nCommunications Officer<br/>\nWHO Department for the Management of Noncommunicable Diseases, Disability, Violence and Injury Prevention Telephone: +41 22 791 4547<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 249 3520<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:sminkeyl@who.int\">sminkeyl@who.int</a> </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib<br/>\nCommunications Officer, WHO<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 3228<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 475 5556<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:chaibf@who.int\">chaibf@who.int</a> </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Sangita Khadka<br/>\nCommunications Specialist<br/>\nMedia &amp; Advocacy<br/>\nBERA / Bureau for Policy and Programme Support <br/>\nTelephone: +1 212 906 5043<br/>\nMobile: +1 917 530 8980<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:sangita.khadka@undp.org\">sangita.khadka@undp.org</a> </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Preeta Bannerjee<br/>\nPublic Information Officer<br/>\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime<br/>\nTelephone: +43 1 26060 5764<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:preeta.bannerjee@unodc.org\">preeta.bannerjee@unodc.org</a> </span></p>\n<div></div>",

    "content_html": "<div> <p><span class=\"\">News release</span>\n</p>\n</div> <p>\n<em class=\"dateline\">3 December 2014 ¦ Melbourne -</em>\n<span>New guidance from WHO aims to help countries better prevent and control cervical cancer. The disease is one of the world’s deadliest – but most easily preventable – forms of cancer for women, responsible for more than 270 000 deaths annually, 85% of which occur in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The new <i>\"Comprehensive cervical cancer control: a guide to essential practice\"</i> will be launched at the World Cancer Leaders’ Summit in Melbourne, Australia on 3 December 2014. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The main elements in the new guidance are:</span></p>\n<p>\n<span><b>Vaccinate 9 to 13-year-old girls with two doses of HPV vaccine</b> to prevent infection with the Human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus responsible for most cases of cervical cancer. The reduced, 2-dose schedule has been shown to be as effective as the current 3-dose schedule. The change will make it easier to administer the vaccine. In addition, it reduces the cost, which is particularly important for low- and middle-income countries where national health budgets are constrained but where the need for HPV vaccine is the greatest. Today, girls in more than 55 countries are protected by routine administration of HPV vaccine. Encouragingly, a growing number of low- and middle-income countries are introducing HPV vaccine in the routine schedule, with support from the GAVI Alliance.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span><b>Use HPV tests to screen women for cervical cancer prevention.</b> With HPV testing, the frequency of screening will decrease. Once a woman has been screened negative, she should not be rescreened for at least 5 years, but should be rescreened within 10. This represents a major cost saving for health systems, in comparison with other types of tests. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span><b>Communicate more widely.</b> Instead of focusing mostly on encouraging the screening of women aged over 29, the guide recommends communicating with a wider audience: adolescents, parents, educators, leaders and people working at all levels of the health system, to reach women throughout their lives.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Dr Nathalie Broutet, a leading WHO expert on cervical cancer prevention and control, says: “WHO’s updated cervical cancer guidance can be the difference between life and death for girls and women worldwide. There are no magic bullets, but the combination of more effective and affordable tools to prevent and treat cervical cancer will help release the strain on stretched health budgets, especially in low-income countries, and contribute drastically to the elimination of cervical cancer.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>An estimated one million-plus women worldwide are currently living with cervical cancer. Many have no access to health services for prevention, curative treatment or palliative care. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Addressing inequities</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Cervical cancer rates have fallen in much of the developed world during the past 30 years, largely due to screening and treatment programs. During the same time, however, rates in most developing countries have risen or remain unchanged, often due to limited access to health services, lack of awareness and absence of screening and treatment programmes. Rural and poorer women living in developed countries are at increased risk of invasive cervical cancer.\nThe new guidance highlights the importance of addressing gender discrimination and other inequities in relation to a range of other social factors (such as wealth, class, education, religion and ethnicity), in the design of health policies and programmes.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Unless we address gender inequality and ensure women’s right to health, the number of women dying from cervical cancer will continue to rise,” says Dr Marleen Temmerman, Director of WHO’s Department of Reproductive Health and Research. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Editor’s note: About the guide</h4>\n<p>\n<span>The new WHO guidance provides a comprehensive cervical cancer control and prevention approach for governments and healthcare providers. Also known as the “Pink Book,” it underlines recent developments in technology and strategy for improving women’s access to health services to prevent and control cervical cancer. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The guidance identifies key opportunities and ages throughout a woman’s life when cervical control and prevention can be put into action, especially for: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primary prevention: human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination targets girls aged 9 to 13 years, aiming to reach them before they become sexually active.</li>\n<li>Secondary prevention: access to technology for women over 30 years of age, such as VIA (visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid) or HPV testing for screening, followed by treatment of detected precancerous lesions, which may develop into cervical cancer.</li>\n<li>Tertiary prevention: access to cancer treatment and management for women of any age, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. </li>\n<li>When curative treatment is no longer an option, access to palliative care is crucial.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>A variety of health services and programmes are needed to implement the different elements of these recommendations. The guidance underlines the importance of collaboration between sectors, between health programmes, and between professionals working at all levels of the health service, for the success of cervical cancer prevention.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The guidelines also show how cervical prevention and control can be integrated into existing health care delivery systems, including for family planning, postpartum care and HIV/AIDS. The delivery of vaccinations to adolescents for example, opens the door to reaching them with additional health information, sexual education and advice about healthy life styles. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>A global opportunity to improve women’s health: Implementing cervical cancer prevention and control programmes supports the UN Secretary-General’s 2010 Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health.

Estimates suggest that globally, 1 in 3 women has experienced either physical or sexual violence from their partner, and that 7% of women will experience sexual assault by a non-partner at some point in their lives. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Yet, despite increased global attention to violence perpetrated against women and girls, and recent advances in knowledge about how to tackle these abuses, levels of violence against women – including intimate partner violence, rape, female genital mutilation, trafficking, and forced marriages – remain unacceptably high, with serious consequences for victims’ physical and mental health. Conflict and other humanitarian crises may exacerbate ongoing violence.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Between 100 and 140 million girls and women worldwide have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), with more than 3 million girls at risk of the practice every year in Africa alone. Some 70 million girls worldwide have been married before their eighteenth birthday, many against their will. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Although many countries have made substantial progress towards criminalising violence against women and promoting gender equality, the Series authors argue that governments and donors need to commit sufficient financial resources to ensure their verbal commitments translate into real change. Even where laws are progressive, many women and girls still suffer discrimination, experience violence, and lack access to vital health and legal services. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Action needed on causes of violence</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Importantly, reviewing the latest evidence, the authors show that not enough is being done to prevent violence against women and girls from occurring in the first place. Although resources have grown to support women and girls in the aftermath of violence (e.g., access to justice and emergency care), research suggests that actions to tackle gender inequity and other root causes of violence are needed to prevent all forms of abuse, and thereby reduce violence overall.</span></p>\n<div class=\"blockquote-container\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We must work towards achieving gender equality and preventing violence before it even starts.” </p>\n<p class=\"source\">\nProfessor Charlotte Watts, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom\n</p>\n</blockquote> </div>\n<p>\n<span>“Globally, 1 in 3 women will experience intimate partner and/or sexual violence by non-partners in their lifetime, which shows that more investment needs to be made in prevention. We definitely need to strengthen services for women experiencing violence, but to make a real difference in the lives of women and girls, we must work towards achieving gender equality and preventing violence before it even starts,” explains Series co-lead Professor Charlotte Watts, founding Director of the Gender Violence and Health Centre at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, London, UK. “No magic wand will eliminate violence against women and girls. But evidence tells us that changes in attitudes and behaviours are possible, and can be achieved within less than a generation.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Ultimately, say the authors, working with both the perpetrators of violence (men and boys) and women and girls will be essential to achieve lasting change, by transforming deeply entrenched societal norms on gender relations and the insidious belief that women are inferior. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Violence is often seen as a social and criminal justice problem, and not as a clinical or public health issue, but the health system has a crucial part to play both in treating the consequences of violence, and in preventing it. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Health-care providers are often the first point of contact for women and girls experiencing violence,” says Series co-lead Dr Claudia Garcia-Moreno, a physician at WHO, Geneva, who coordinates research and policy on violence against women.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Early identification of women and children subjected to violence and a supportive and effective response can improve women’s lives and wellbeing, and help them to access vital services. Health-care providers can send a powerful message – that violence is not only a social problem, but a dangerous, unhealthy, and harmful practice – and they can champion prevention efforts in the community. The health community is missing important opportunities to integrate violence programming meaningfully into public health initiatives on HIV/AIDS, adolescent health, maternal health, and mental health.”</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Five key actions needed</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The Series urges policy makers, health practitioners and donors worldwide to accelerate efforts to address violence against women and girls by taking 5 key actions. First, governments must allocate necessary resources to address violence against women as a priority, recognising it as a barrier to health and development. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Second, they must change discriminatory structures (laws, policies, institutions) that perpetuate inequality between women and men and foster violence. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Third, they must invest in promoting equality, non-violent behaviours and non-stigmatising support for survivors. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Fourth, they must strengthen the role of health, security, education, justice, and other relevant sectors by creating and implementing policies for prevention and response across these sectors, and integrating violence prevention and response into training efforts. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Finally, they must support research and programming to learn what interventions are effective and how to turn evidence into action. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>According to Series co-ordinator, Dr Cathy Zimmerman, from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, UK, “We now have some promising findings to show what works to prevent violence. Our upcoming challenge is to expand this evidence on prevention and support responses to many more settings and forms of violence. Most importantly, we urgently need to turn this evidence into genuine action so that women and girls can live violence-free lives.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In a comment accompanying the Series, former US President Jimmy Carter, founder of The Carter Center says, ”It is my hope that political and religious leaders will step forward and use their influence to communicate clearly that violence against women and girls must stop, that we are failing our societies, and that the time for leadership is now.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Series is published ahead of the 16 days of Activism against Gender Violence (Nov 25–Dec 10, 2014).</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>For Professor Charlotte Watts and Dr Cathy Zimmerman, Gender Violence and Health Centre, London School of Hygiene; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), London, United Kingdom, contact:<br/> LSHTM Press Office<br/>\nEmail: press@lshtm.ac.uk <br/> Telephone: +44 (0) 207 927 2802</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>For Dr Claudia Garcia-Moreno, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland, contact: <br/>\nChristian Lindmeier <br/>\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\nTelephone: +41 79 500 65 52<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:lindmeierch@who.int\">lindmeierch@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>For Dr Mary Ellsberg, Global Women’s Institute (GWI), George Washington University, Washington , D.C., United States of America, contact:<br/> Emily Grebenstein <br/>\nEmail: emgreb@gwu.edu <br/>\nTelephone: +1 202 994 3087<br/><br/>\nJason Shevrin<br/>\nEmail: jshevrin@gwu.edu<br/>\nTelephone: +1 202 994 5631</span></p>\n<div></div>",

The move came at the opening, in Rome, of the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2), organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WHO.</span></p><p><span>The Rome Declaration on Nutrition enshrines the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, and commits governments to preventing malnutrition in all its forms, including hunger, micronutrient deficiencies and obesity.</span></p><p><span>The Framework for Action recognizes that governments have the primary role and responsibility for addressing nutrition issues and challenges, in dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders-including civil society, the private sector and affected communities. Building on the Declaration's commitments, goals and targets, the Framework sets out 60 recommended actions that governments may incorporate into their national nutrition, health, agriculture, education, development and investment plans and consider when negotiating international agreements to achieve better nutrition for all.</span></p><p><span>FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva said: \"We have the knowledge, expertise and resources needed to overcome all forms of malnutrition. Governments must lead the way,\" he said. “But the push to improve global nutrition must be a joint effort, involving civil society organizations and the private sector.” </span></p><p><span>The Rome Declaration and Framework for Action, “are the starting point of our renewed efforts to improve nutrition for all, but they are not the finishing line. Our responsibility is to transform the commitment into concrete results,\" Graziano da Silva said.</span></p><p><span>\"We must now redouble our efforts,\" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a video address to ICN2 participants. \"I look forward to learning of the national commitment that each of you will make. In turn the UN system pledges to do all that it can to provide effective support,\" he added.</span></p><p><span>WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, said: \"The world's food system – with its reliance on industrialized production and globalized markets – produces ample supplies, but creates some problems for public health. Part of the world has too little to eat, leaving millions vulnerable to death or disease caused by nutrient deficiencies. Another part overeats, with widespread obesity pushing life-expectancy figures backwards and pushing the costs of health care to astronomical heights.\"</span></p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Specific targets</h3><p><span>The Framework lays out effective accountability mechanisms, including monitoring frameworks to track progress as well as nutrition targets and milestones based on internationally agreed indicators. Signatory countries should achieve specific results by 2025, including existing targets for improving maternal, infant and young child nutrition, and for reducing nutrition-related risk factors for noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers.</span></p><p><span>Sustainable food systems are key to promoting healthy diets. Governments are called upon to promote nutrition-enhancing agriculture, by integrating nutrition objectives into the design and implementation of agricultural programmes, ensure food security and enable healthy diets.</span></p><p><span>The Declaration and the Framework are the fruits of almost a year of intense negotiations involving representatives of FAO and WHO member countries. Countries recognized that, although important advances have been made in the fight against malnutrition since the first International Conference on Nutrition in 1992, progress has been insufficient and uneven.</span></p><p><span>While the prevalence of hunger has fallen by 21% since 1990-92, over 800 million people in the world still go hungry. Stunting (low height-for-age) and wasting (low weight-for-height) have also declined, yet an estimated 161 million and 51 million children aged under 5, respectively, were still affected in 2013. Undernutrition is linked to almost half of all child deaths under 5 years of age, some 2.8 million per year.</span></p><p><span>Over 2 billion people are affected by micronutrient deficiencies, or \"hidden hunger\", due to inadequate vitamins or minerals.

          "Joint WHO/FAO news release",
          "19 November 2014 ¦ Rome - In a major step towards eradicating malnutrition worldwide, over 170 countries today made a number of concrete commitments and adopted a series of recommendations on policies and investments aimed at ensuring that all people have access to healthier and more sustainable diets.",
          "Ministers and senior officials responsible for health, food or agriculture and other aspects of nutrition adopted the Rome Declaration on Nutrition, and a Framework for Action, which set out recommendations for policies and programmes to address nutrition across multiple sectors. The move came at the opening, in Rome, of the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2), organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WHO.",
          "The Rome Declaration on Nutrition enshrines the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, and commits governments to preventing malnutrition in all its forms, including hunger, micronutrient deficiencies and obesity.",
          "The Framework for Action recognizes that governments have the primary role and responsibility for addressing nutrition issues and challenges, in dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders-including civil society, the private sector and affected communities. Building on the Declaration's commitments, goals and targets, the Framework sets out 60 recommended actions that governments may incorporate into their national nutrition, health, agriculture, education, development and investment plans and consider when negotiating international agreements to achieve better nutrition for all.",
          "FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva said: \"We have the knowledge, expertise and resources needed to overcome all forms of malnutrition. Governments must lead the way,\" he said. “But the push to improve global nutrition must be a joint effort, involving civil society organizations and the private sector.”",
          "The Rome Declaration and Framework for Action, “are the starting point of our renewed efforts to improve nutrition for all, but they are not the finishing line. Our responsibility is to transform the commitment into concrete results,\" Graziano da Silva said.",
          "\"We must now redouble our efforts,\" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a video address to ICN2 participants. \"I look forward to learning of the national commitment that each of you will make. In turn the UN system pledges to do all that it can to provide effective support,\" he added.",
          "WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, said: \"The world's food system – with its reliance on industrialized production and globalized markets – produces ample supplies, but creates some problems for public health. Part of the world has too little to eat, leaving millions vulnerable to death or disease caused by nutrient deficiencies. Another part overeats, with widespread obesity pushing life-expectancy figures backwards and pushing the costs of health care to astronomical heights.\""

        "content": [
          "The Framework lays out effective accountability mechanisms, including monitoring frameworks to track progress as well as nutrition targets and milestones based on internationally agreed indicators. Signatory countries should achieve specific results by 2025, including existing targets for improving maternal, infant and young child nutrition, and for reducing nutrition-related risk factors for noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers.",
          "Sustainable food systems are key to promoting healthy diets. Governments are called upon to promote nutrition-enhancing agriculture, by integrating nutrition objectives into the design and implementation of agricultural programmes, ensure food security and enable healthy diets.",
          "The Declaration and the Framework are the fruits of almost a year of intense negotiations involving representatives of FAO and WHO member countries. Countries recognized that, although important advances have been made in the fight against malnutrition since the first International Conference on Nutrition in 1992, progress has been insufficient and uneven.",
          "While the prevalence of hunger has fallen by 21% since 1990-92, over 800 million people in the world still go hungry. Stunting (low height-for-age) and wasting (low weight-for-height) have also declined, yet an estimated 161 million and 51 million children aged under 5, respectively, were still affected in 2013. Undernutrition is linked to almost half of all child deaths under 5 years of age, some 2.8 million per year.",
          "Over 2 billion people are affected by micronutrient deficiencies, or \"hidden hunger\", due to inadequate vitamins or minerals. Meanwhile, the burden of obesity is growing rapidly, with around half a billion people now obese, and 3 times as many overweight. Some 42 million children under the age of 5 are already overweight. Moreover, different forms of malnutrition often overlap, with people living in the same communities – sometimes even in the same household – suffering from hunger, micronutrient deficiencies and obesity.

It offers a comprehensive analysis of strengths and challenges in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) provision within and across countries.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Water and sanitation are essential to human health. Political commitment to ensure universal access to these vital services is at an all-time high,” said Dr Maria Neira, Director of the WHO Department of Public Health and the Environment. “International aid for the sector is on the rise. But we continue to see major financial gaps at the country level, particularly in rural areas.”</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Strengthened political commitment</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Two thirds of the 94 countries surveyed recognized drinking-water and sanitation as a universal human right in national legislation. More than 80% reported having national policies in place for drinking-water and sanitation, and more than 75% have policies for hygiene.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>This strengthened political commitment at national levels is reflected in global discussions around the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Universal and equitable access to water, sanitation and hygiene have been proposed as global targets by the Member States working group tasked with developing the SDGs.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Now is the time to act,” says Michel Jarraud, Chair of UN-Water and Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. “We may not know yet what the post-2015 sustainable development agenda will look like. But we do know that water and sanitation must be clear priorities if we are to create a future that allows everyone to live healthy, prosperous and dignified lives.”</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Increased aid, better targeting of resources</h3>\n<p>\n<span>International aid for water and sanitation is on the rise. According to the report, financial commitments for WASH increased by 30% between 2010 and 2012 – from US$ 8.3 billion to US$ 10.9 billion.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Aid commitments are increasingly targeted to underserved regions, notably sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Asia and South-eastern Asia. GLAAS 2014 also highlights the strengthened targeting of WASH resources for the poor: more than 75% of countries reported having specific measures in their national plans to provide water and sanitation for low-income populations.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“For our partners, especially at country level, GLAAS is key for achieving sound, evidence-based decision-making,” says President John Agyekum Kufuor, Chair of Sanitation and Water for All. “The report guides governments in knowing where progress in WASH is being made and where more resources need to be allocated.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span> “As we identify the financial and human resource gaps, governments and donors can be more strategic in supporting policies and in implementing sustainable programmes to ensure equitable access to water and sanitation for all people,” says Chris Williams, Executive Director of the UN-based Water Supply &amp; Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC).</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Still major gaps </h3>\n<p>\n<span>Despite these gains, 2.5 billion men, women and children around the world lack access to basic sanitation services. About 1 billion people continue to practice open defecation. An additional 748 million people do not have ready access to an improved source of drinking-water. And hundreds of millions of people live without clean water and soap to wash their hands, facilitating the spread of diarrhoeal disease, the second leading cause of death among children under 5.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Many other water-borne diseases, such as cholera, typhoid and hepatitis, are prone to explosive outbreaks. Poor sanitation and hygiene can also lead to debilitating diseases affecting scores of people in the developing world, like intestinal worms, blinding trachoma and schistosomiasis.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Key challenges</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The report cites a number of key challenges.</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"section_head3\">Insufficient financing</h5>\n<p>\n<span>Though international aid for the WASH sector has increased, national funding needs continue to outweigh available resources. Eighty per cent (80%) of countries reported that current levels of financing are insufficient to meet their targets for drinking-water and sanitation.</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"section_head3\">Funding gap in rural areas</h5>\n<p>\n<span>While a vast majority of people who lack access to basic sanitation live in rural areas, the bulk of financing continues to benefit urban residents. Expenditures for rural sanitation comprise less than 10% of total WASH financing.</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"section_head3\">Weak national capacity to execute WASH plans</h5>\n<p>\n<span>Despite strong political support for universal access to water and sanitation, fewer than one-third of the countries surveyed for this report have national WASH plans that are being fully implemented, funded and regularly reviewed. </span></p>\n<h5 class=\"section_head3\">Critical gaps in monitoring</h5>\n<p>\n<span>Reliable data is vital to identify gaps in access to WASH services and inform policy decisions. Though many countries have WASH monitoring frameworks in place, a majority reported inconsistent or fragmented gathering of data and weak capacity for analysis.</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"section_head3\">Neglect for WASH in schools, health facilities</h5>\n<p>\n<span>Water and sanitation services in schools can ensure that children, especially girls, stay in school and learn lifelong hygiene habits. In health clinics, WASH services ensure the privacy and safety of patients, particularly expectant mothers during delivery, and are essential to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks. Yet, GLAAS data indicates that less than 30% of surveyed countries have national WASH plans for institutional settings that were being fully implemented, funded and regularly reviewed.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Investments pay off</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Investments in water and sanitation yield substantial benefits for human health and development. According to WHO estimates, for every dollar invested in water and sanitation, there is a US$ 4.3 return in the form of reduced health care costs for individuals and society. Millions of children can be saved from premature death and illness related to malnutrition and water-borne diseases. Adults can live longer and healthier lives. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The benefits cut across many sectors. Economic and environmental gains include, for example, greater productivity in the workplace and reduced pollution of water and land resources. Gains in quality of life include improved school attendance, greater privacy and safety – especially for women, children and the elderly – and a greater sense of dignity for all.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Note to Editors: </h4>\n<p>\n<span> An “improved” drinking water source is defined as a facility or delivery point that protects water from external contamination – particularly fecal contamination. This includes piped water into a dwelling, plot, or yard; public tap or standpipe; tube-well or borehole; protected spring; and rainwater collection. An \"improved\" sanitation facility is one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contact.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The 23 external support agencies include donor governments and other sources of funding/support (e.g. non-governmental organizations and foundations).</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>On 20 November 2014 the United Nations will mark the 20th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Convention recognizes “the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health” and “the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development”.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information please contact:</h4>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">In Geneva</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Christian Lindmeier <br/>\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\nTelephone: +41 79 500 65 52<br/>\nMobile: +41 7 94 45 31 64<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:lindmeierch@who.int\">lindmeierch@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Nada Osseiran<br/>\nCommunications Officer<br/>\nDepartment of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 4475<br/>\nMobile: +41 7 94 45 16 24<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:osseirann@who.int\">osseirann@who.int</a></span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">In New York</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Daniella Bostrom Couffe<br/>\nCommunications Manager, UN-Water<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 730 8561<br/>\nMobile: +4179 159 92 17<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:daniella.bostrom@unwater.org\">daniella.bostrom@unwater.org</a> </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Angelica Spraggins<br/>\nCommunications Officer, WHO New York Office<br/>\nTelephone: + 1 646 626 6050<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:spragginsan@who.int\">spragginsan@who.int</a> </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\"></h3>\n<div></div>",

    "content_html": "<p>The third meeting of the Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005) regarding the international spread of wild poliovirus in 2014 was convened by the Director-General through electronic correspondence from 2 through 7 November 2014.1 The following IHR States Parties submitted an update on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 31 July 2014: Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic.</p><p>The Committee noted that the international spread of wild poliovirus has continued since 31 July 2014, with at least 3 new exportations from Pakistan into neighbouring Afghanistan. There has been no other documented international spread of wild poliovirus since March 2014.</p><p>The risk of new international spread from Pakistan was assessed to have increased substantively since 31 July 2014, as cases have escalated during the current high transmission season and there has been no significant improvement in the underlying factors that are driving transmission in the country. The risk of new international spread from the other 9 currently infected States appears to have declined, with only 2 of those States having reported new cases since 31 July: Somalia (1 case) and Afghanistan (7 cases, most of which were due to imported virus).</p><p>The Committee remains concerned that implementation of the Temporary Recommendations is still incomplete, especially as immunization systems have continued to deteriorate in a number of the countries at greatest risk of new importations, particularly those affected by conflict. The Committee concluded that the countries identified at its 2nd meeting as ‘States currently exporting wild poliovirus’ or ‘States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting’ had not met fully the criteria for removing the recommended measures for reducing the risk of international spread of wild poliovirus. These criteria require documentation of the full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high-risk areas of these countries and that at least 6 months have passed without an exportation or, in the case of non-exporting countries, detection of wild poliovirus transmission from any source.</p><p>The Committee assessed that the event still constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and recommended the extension of the Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months.</p><p>Recognizing the escalating wild poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, with more reported cases than at any time in the past 14 years and ongoing cross-border exportation of the virus, the Committee provided the following additional advice to the Director-General for her consideration to reduce further the risk of international spread of wild poliovirus:</p><ul><li>Pakistan should restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travellers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea);</li><li>Pakistan should note that the recommendation stated previously for urgent travel remains valid (i.e. those undertaking urgent travel who have not received appropriate polio vaccination must receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure and be provided with appropriate documentation of that dose);</li><li>in advance of the next meeting of the Committee, Pakistan should provide to the Director-General a report on the implementation by month of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel, including the number of residents whose travel was restricted and the number of travellers who were vaccinated and provided appropriate documentation at the point of departure.</li></ul><p>If the existing and additional Temporary Recommendations for the vaccination of travellers from Pakistan cannot be fully implemented by the time the Committee next meets, the Committee will consider additional measures such as entry screening to reduce the risk of international spread.</p><p>The Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and declared that the international spread of wild poliovirus continued to constitute a PHEIC. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s additional advice on reducing the risk of international spread from Pakistan. The Director-General thanked the Committee Members and Advisors for their advice, requested their reassessment of this situation within three months and issued the following Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005), effective 13 November 2014:</p><h3>States currently exporting wild poliovirus</h3><p>Pakistan, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and the Syrian Arab Republic should:</p><ul><li>officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency;</li><li>ensure that all residents and long-term visitors (i.e. &gt; 4 weeks) receive a dose of OPV or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to international travel;</li><li>ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within 4 weeks), who have not received a dose of OPV or IPV in the previous 4 weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers;</li><li>ensure that such travellers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the International Health Regulations (2005) to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination;</li><li>maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least 6 months have passed without new exportations and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until at least 12 months have passed without new exportations.</li></ul><p>Pakistan should in addition:</p><ul><li>restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination.

      "description": "The third meeting of the Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005) regarding the international spread of wild poliovirus in 2014 was convened by the Director-General through electronic correspondence from 2 through 7 November 2014.1 The following IHR States Parties submitted an update on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on 31 July 2014: Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic.The Committee noted that the international spread of wild poliovirus has continued since 31 July 2014, with at least 3 new exportations from Pakistan into neighbouring Afghanistan. There has been no other documented international spread of wild poliovirus since March 2014.The risk of new international spread from Pakistan was assessed to have increased substantively since 31 July 2014, as cases have escalated during the current high transmission season and there has been no significant improvement in the underlying factors that are driving transmission in the country. The risk of new international spread from the other 9 currently infected States appears to have declined, with only 2 of those States having reported new cases since 31 July: Somalia (1 case) and Afghanistan (7 cases, most of which were due to imported virus).The Committee remains concerned that implementation of the Temporary Recommendations is still incomplete, especially as immunization systems have continued to deteriorate in a number of the countries at greatest risk of new importations, particularly those affected by conflict. The Committee concluded that the countries identified at its 2nd meeting as ‘States currently exporting wild poliovirus’ or ‘States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting’ had not met fully the criteria for removing the recommended measures for reducing the risk of international spread of wild poliovirus. These criteria require documentation of the full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high-risk areas of these countries and that at least 6 months have passed without an exportation or, in the case of non-exporting countries, detection of wild poliovirus transmission from any source.The Committee assessed that the event still constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and recommended the extension of the Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months.Recognizing the escalating wild poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, with more reported cases than at any time in the past 14 years and ongoing cross-border exportation of the virus, the Committee provided the following additional advice to the Director-General for her consideration to reduce further the risk of international spread of wild poliovirus:Pakistan should restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travellers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea);Pakistan should note that the recommendation stated previously for urgent travel remains valid (i.e. those undertaking urgent travel who have not received appropriate polio vaccination must receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure and be provided with appropriate documentation of that dose);in advance of the next meeting of the Committee, Pakistan should provide to the Director-General a report on the implementation by month of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel, including the number of residents whose travel was restricted and the number of travellers who were vaccinated and provided appropriate documentation at the point of departure.If the existing and additional Temporary Recommendations for the vaccination of travellers from Pakistan cannot be fully implemented by the time the Committee next meets, the Committee will consider additional measures such as entry screening to reduce the risk of international spread.The Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and declared that the international spread of wild poliovirus continued to constitute a PHEIC. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s additional advice on reducing the risk of international spread from Pakistan. The Director-General thanked the Committee Members and Advisors for their advice, requested their reassessment of this situation within three months and issued the following Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005), effective 13 November 2014:States currently exporting wild poliovirusPakistan, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and the Syrian Arab Republic should:officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency;ensure that all residents and long-term visitors (i.e. > 4 weeks) receive a dose of OPV or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to international travel;ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within 4 weeks), who have not received a dose of OPV or IPV in the previous 4 weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers;ensure that such travellers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the International Health Regulations (2005) to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination;maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least 6 months have passed without new exportations and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until at least 12 months have passed without new exportations.Pakistan should in addition:restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination. These recommendations apply to international travellers from all points of departure, irrespective of the means of conveyance (e.g. road, air, sea);note that the recommendation stated previously for urgent travel remains valid (i.e. those undertaking urgent travel who have not received appropriate polio vaccination must receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure and be provided with appropriate documentation of that dose);in advance of the next meeting of the Committee, should provide to the Director-General a report on the implementation by month of the Temporary Recommendations on international travel, including the number of residents whose travel was restricted and the number of travellers who were vaccinated and provided appropriate documentation at the point of departure.States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exportingAfghanistan, Ethiopia, Iraq, Israel, Nigeria and Somalia should:officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency;encourage residents and long-term visitors to receive a dose of OPV or IPV 4 weeks to 12 months prior to international travel; those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within 4 weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure;ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status;maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least 6 months have passed without the detection of wild poliovirus transmission in the country from any source, and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until at least 12 months without evidence of transmission. 1 Emergency Committee Members and Advisors: list of names, affiliations and interestsThe same Members and Advisors were invited to both meetings of the Emergency Committee.",

According to the estimates, some 4.3 million people worldwide die every year from household air pollution emitted by rudimentary biomass and coal cookstoves. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Ensuring cleaner air in and around the home is fundamental to reducing the burden of disease from air pollution, especially in low- and middle-income countries,” says Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. “The new WHO guidelines aim to help countries introduce cleaner technologies, improve air quality in poor households, reduce pollution-related diseases and save lives.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Nearly 3 billion people worldwide still lack access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. Millions of people die each year as a result of household air pollution; 34% are due to stroke, 26% to ischaemic heart disease, 22% to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 12% to childhood pneumonia and 6% to lung cancer.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>These diseases are primarily caused by high levels of fine particulate matter and carbon monoxide released by the burning of solid fuels such as wood, coal, animal dung, crop waste and charcoal in inefficient stoves, space heaters, or lamps. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">New emissions targets</h4>\n<p>\n<span>The guidelines include emissions targets for different kinds of domestic appliances, for both carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter. The targets are the result of years of review of the health impacts of household air pollution emissions and careful examination of the levels by which emissions would have to be reduced in order to meet WHO guidelines for air quality.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“If the new emission targets are met, then some 90% of homes globally will meet WHO’s air quality standards,” said Dr Neira. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Avoid unprocessed coal and kerosene</h4>\n<p>\n<span>The new guidelines recommend halting the use of unprocessed coal as a household fuel. Coal contains toxic elements such as arsenic, lead and mercury. The incomplete combustion of coal in inefficient stoves and space heaters can lead to severe illness and premature death.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The use of kerosene as a household fuel is also discouraged amid concerns around its adverse impact on air quality and safety. Kerosene is also associated with burns, fires and poisoning.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Health consequences</h4>\n<p>\n<span>In homes with open-burning and unvented coal or biomass stoves, emissions of particulate matter and other pollutants can be 100 times higher than WHO-recommended levels. Such pollutants are carcinogenic and cause heart and lung disease through impairing immune response, reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, causing systemic inflammation and ischemia, among other physiological disturbances.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Women and young children, who spend the most time near the domestic hearth, are particularly vulnerable,” says Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director General, Family, Women’s and Children’s Health cluster. “Globally, more than 50% of pneumonia deaths among children under 5 are linked to household air pollution.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Women and children may also suffer other consequences. In many regions, they spend hours every day gathering fuel for traditional stoves, restricting time for earning money and going to school.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">The way forward</h4>\n<p>\n<span>In order to meet the new targets, there needs to be rapid scale-up in access to cleaner and more modern cooking and heating appliances, as well as lamps, in developing country homes, says Dr Carlos Dora, WHO Coordinator for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“We need to scale up the use of clean fuels such as biogas, ethanol, or natural or liquefied petroleum gas with appropriate venting, as well as solar electricity solutions for lighting,” he said. “And clean technologies and fuels should be priced within reach of the lowest-income households.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>At the same time, the new guidelines advise countries not to use unprocessed coal or kerosene as home energy sources, and to look for substitute fuels. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“A great deal of work is going into improving the types of biomass cookstoves commonly used in developing countries for preparing meals, but only those that achieve these household fuel combustion emission targets can ensure lower health risks from household air pollution for women and children.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO regional and country offices will support governments, non-governmental organizations, the private sector and development partners in implementation of these guidelines.

By building trust and respect between burial teams, bereaved families and religious groups, we are building trust and safety in the response itself.” says Dr Pierre Formenty, one of WHO’s top Ebola experts. “Introducing components such as inviting the family to be involved in digging the grave and offering options for dry ablution and shrouding will make a significant difference in curbing Ebola transmission.” </span></p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">How infections occur during burials</h3><p><span>Ebola infections occur during burials when family and community members perform religious rites that require directly touching or washing the body, which still contains high levels of Ebola virus; and when family members distribute personal property of the loved one, which may be infected with the virus.</span></p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Step-by-step processes for safe burials</h3><p><span>Developed by an interdisciplinary team at WHO, in partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and faith-based organizations including World Council of Churches, Islamic Relief, Caritas Internationalis and World Vision, this updated protocol outlines step-by-step processes for safe and dignified burials. The protocol encourages inclusion of family and local clergy in the planning and preparation of the burial, as well as at the burial event itself, giving specific instructions for Muslim and Christian burials.</span></p><p><span>\"We are becoming known for \"dead body management\", but we do not \"manage\" dead bodies. We safely, respectfully and in a dignified manner, accompany our deceased fellow human beings and help to prepare them, in accordance with their cultures, for their last resting places. It is in this spirit that our volunteers carry out their difficult work\" says Elhadj As Sy, Secretary General, IFRC.</span></p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Safe alternatives</h3><p><span>“It is clear from Islamic juristic ruling that the necessity of religious washing of the body before burial of patients who die from Ebola is over-ruled,” says Rehanah Sadiq, a Muslim chaplain with University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust who served as consultant to WHO on the protocol. “However, it is vital to help bereaved families grieve and find closure by ensuring that sacred rites, such as performing a dry ablution, shrouding the body, and praying over the deceased are represented in Muslim funerals. Providing safe alternatives for families to maintain deeply-cherished practices helps them be part of the decision-making process, which is critical particularly during a time when they may be feeling helpless.”</span></p><p><span>“Giving the family an opportunity to view the body of the deceased, ensuring that the grave is appropriately labelled, and allowing religious leaders to offer prayers and family members the option to throw the first soil – these are important incentives for encouraging families to continue to find strength in their faith, and to keep other family members safe from becoming infected,” said Rev. Msgr. Robert J. Vitillo, Head of Delegation, Caritas Internationalis.</span></p><p><span>A team of medical anthropologists also contributed meaningful, safe alternatives for touching and bathing dead bodies, developed from research into the cultural significance and values of burial practices in affected countries. Consultations were held with religious leaders in affected countries to define what is meant by “dignified burial” in both the Muslim and Christian context. </span></p><p><span>The protocol also includes ways for Ebola burial teams to carry out their work safely while respecting family sensitivities. These include abstaining from wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) when first meeting with the family, and asking the family if there are specific requests for managing the burial and personal effects of the deceased. As the protocol is applied in affected countries, feedback from religious leaders, communities and people managing burials will be used to update and improve the protocol.</span></p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Safe and dignified burial protocol</h3><ul><li><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" data-sf-marked=\"\" href=\"/publications/i/item/WHO-EVD-Guidance-Burials-14.2\">How to conduct safe and dignified burial of a patient who has died from suspected or confirmed Ebola virus disease</a>\n</li></ul><hr/><h3 class=\"section_head1\">WHO media contacts:</h3><p><span>Laura Bellinger<br/>Communications Officer<br/>Telephone: +41 22 791 2409 <br/>Mobile: +41 795 597 062 <br/>E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:bellingerl@who.int\">bellingerl@who.int</a></span></p><p><span>Tarik Jasarevic<br/>Communications Officer<br/>Telephone: +41 22 791 50 99<br/>Mobile: +41 79 367 62 14<br/>E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:jasarevict@who.int\">jasarevict@who.int</a></span></p><div></div>",

          "Developed by an interdisciplinary team at WHO, in partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and faith-based organizations including World Council of Churches, Islamic Relief, Caritas Internationalis and World Vision, this updated protocol outlines step-by-step processes for safe and dignified burials. The protocol encourages inclusion of family and local clergy in the planning and preparation of the burial, as well as at the burial event itself, giving specific instructions for Muslim and Christian burials.",
          "\"We are becoming known for \"dead body management\", but we do not \"manage\" dead bodies. We safely, respectfully and in a dignified manner, accompany our deceased fellow human beings and help to prepare them, in accordance with their cultures, for their last resting places. It is in this spirit that our volunteers carry out their difficult work\" says Elhadj As Sy, Secretary General, IFRC."

          "“It is clear from Islamic juristic ruling that the necessity of religious washing of the body before burial of patients who die from Ebola is over-ruled,” says Rehanah Sadiq, a Muslim chaplain with University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust who served as consultant to WHO on the protocol. “However, it is vital to help bereaved families grieve and find closure by ensuring that sacred rites, such as performing a dry ablution, shrouding the body, and praying over the deceased are represented in Muslim funerals. Providing safe alternatives for families to maintain deeply-cherished practices helps them be part of the decision-making process, which is critical particularly during a time when they may be feeling helpless.”",
          "“Giving the family an opportunity to view the body of the deceased, ensuring that the grave is appropriately labelled, and allowing religious leaders to offer prayers and family members the option to throw the first soil – these are important incentives for encouraging families to continue to find strength in their faith, and to keep other family members safe from becoming infected,” said Rev. Msgr. Robert J. Vitillo, Head of Delegation, Caritas Internationalis.",
          "A team of medical anthropologists also contributed meaningful, safe alternatives for touching and bathing dead bodies, developed from research into the cultural significance and values of burial practices in affected countries. Consultations were held with religious leaders in affected countries to define what is meant by “dignified burial” in both the Muslim and Christian context.",
          "The protocol also includes ways for Ebola burial teams to carry out their work safely while respecting family sensitivities. These include abstaining from wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) when first meeting with the family, and asking the family if there are specific requests for managing the burial and personal effects of the deceased. As the protocol is applied in affected countries, feedback from religious leaders, communities and people managing burials will be used to update and improve the protocol."

As people across the world live longer, soaring levels of chronic illness and diminished wellbeing are poised to become a major global public health challenge.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Effective health interventions increasing life expectancy</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Worldwide, life expectancy of older people continues to rise. By 2020, for the first time in history, the number of people aged 60 years and older will outnumber children younger than 5 years. By 2050, the world’s population aged 60 years and older is expected to total 2 billion, up from 841 million today. Eighty per cent of these older people will be living in low-income and middle-income countries. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The increase in longevity, especially in high-income countries (HICs), has been largely due to the decline in deaths from cardiovascular disease (stroke and ischaemic heart disease), mainly because of simple, cost-effective strategies to reduce tobacco use and high blood pressure, and improved coverage and effectiveness of health interventions. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Challenge of ageing healthily</h3>\n<p>\n<span>However, although people are living longer, they are not necessarily healthier than before – nearly a quarter (23%) of the overall global burden of death and illness is in people aged over 60, and much of this burden is attributable to long-term illness caused by diseases such as cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, heart disease, musculoskeletal diseases (such as arthritis and osteoporosis), and mental and neurological disorders.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>This long-term burden of illness and diminished wellbeing affects patients, their families, health systems, and economies, and is forecast to accelerate. For example, latest estimates indicate that the number of people with dementia is expected to rise from 44 million now, to 135 million by 2050.</span></p>\n<div class=\"blockquote-container\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Deep and fundamental reforms of health and social care systems will be required.”</p>\n<p class=\"source\">\nDr John Beard, Director of Ageing and Life Course, WHO\n</p>\n</blockquote> </div>\n<p>\n<span>“Deep and fundamental reforms of health and social care systems will be required,” says Dr John Beard, Director of the Department of Ageing and Life Course at the WHO, and co-leader of the Series with Dr Ties Boerma and Dr Somnath Chatterji, also from WHO. “But we must be careful that these reforms do not reinforce the inequities that drive much of the poor health and functional limitation we see in older age.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“While some interventions will be universally applicable, it will be important that countries monitor the health and functioning of their ageing populations to understand health trends and design programmes that meet the specific needs identified”, adds Dr Ties Boerma, Director of the Department of Health Statistics and Informatics at WHO. “Cross-national surveys such as the WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE), the Gallup World Poll, and other longitudinal cohorts studies of ageing in Brazil, China, India, and South Korea, are beginning to redress the balance and provide the evidence for policy, but much more remains to be done.”</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Strategies must go beyond health sector</h3>\n<p>\n<span>However, the responsibility for improving quality of life for the world’s older people goes far beyond the health sector, say the Series authors. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Strategies are needed that better prevent and manage chronic conditions by extending affordable health care to all older adults and take into consideration the physical and social environment. Examples include changing policies to encourage older adults to remain part of the workforce for longer (e.g., removing tax disincentives to work past retirement age), emphasising low-cost disease prevention and early detection rather than treatment (eg, reducing salt intake and increasing uptake of vaccines), making better use of technology (eg, mobile clinics for rural populations), and training health-care staff in the management of multiple chronic conditions.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>According to Dr Chatterji, also from the Department of Health Statistics and Information Systems at WHO, “Collectively, we need to look beyond the costs commonly associated with ageing to think about the benefits that an older, healthier, happier, and more productive older population can bring to society as a whole.”</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">WHO media contacts</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Christian Lindmeier<br/>\nCommunications Officer<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 1948<br/>\nMobile: +41 7 95 00 65 52<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:lindmeierch@who.int\">lindmeierch@who.int</a>\n</span></p>\n<div></div>",

          "“While some interventions will be universally applicable, it will be important that countries monitor the health and functioning of their ageing populations to understand health trends and design programmes that meet the specific needs identified”, adds Dr Ties Boerma, Director of the Department of Health Statistics and Informatics at WHO. “Cross-national surveys such as the WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE), the Gallup World Poll, and other longitudinal cohorts studies of ageing in Brazil, China, India, and South Korea, are beginning to redress the balance and provide the evidence for policy, but much more remains to be done.”"

          "However, the responsibility for improving quality of life for the world’s older people goes far beyond the health sector, say the Series authors.",
          "Strategies are needed that better prevent and manage chronic conditions by extending affordable health care to all older adults and take into consideration the physical and social environment. Examples include changing policies to encourage older adults to remain part of the workforce for longer (e.g., removing tax disincentives to work past retirement age), emphasising low-cost disease prevention and early detection rather than treatment (eg, reducing salt intake and increasing uptake of vaccines), making better use of technology (eg, mobile clinics for rural populations), and training health-care staff in the management of multiple chronic conditions.",
          "According to Dr Chatterji, also from the Department of Health Statistics and Information Systems at WHO, “Collectively, we need to look beyond the costs commonly associated with ageing to think about the benefits that an older, healthier, happier, and more productive older population can bring to society as a whole.”"

          "\"Although PPE is the most visible control used to prevent transmission, it is effective only if applied together with other controls including facilities for barrier nursing and work organization, water and sanitation, hand hygiene, and waste management,\" says Marie-Paule Kieny, Assistant Director-General of Health Systems and Innovation. Benefits derived from PPE depend not only on choice of PPE, but also adherence to protocol on use of the equipment.",
          "A fundamental principle guiding the selection of different types of PPE was the effort to strike a balance between the best possible protection against infection while allowing health workers to provide the best possible care to patients with maximum ease, dexterity, comfort and minimal heat-associated stress.",
          "In this situation where evidence is still being collected, to see what works best and on an effective sustainable basis, it was considered prudent to provide options for selecting PPE. In most cases, there was no evidence to show that any one of the options recommended is superior to other options available for healthcare worker safety.",
          "Further work is needed to gather scientific experience and data from the field in systematic studies, in order to understand why some health workers are infected in the current outbreak and to increase effective clinical care. WHO is committed to working with international partners on these issues to build this evidence base."

As of 22 October 2014, the number of total cases stands at 9936 total cases, with 4877 deaths. Cases continue to increase exponentially in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; the situation in these countries remains of great concern. The key lessons learned to control the outbreak include the importance of leadership, community engagement, bringing in more partners, paying staff on time, and accountability. WHO, UN partners and the international community have scaled up their support in these three countries. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal were declared over as of 20 October and 17 October, respectively. The Committee welcomed this development and commended those involved in this achievement. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Cases have recently occurred in Spain and United States of America. The index cases in both of these countries originated in West Africa. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Update by IHR States Parties</h3>\n<p>\n<span>After the overview summary, the following IHR States Parties provided an update on and assessment of the Ebola situation in their countries, including progress towards implementation of the Emergency Committee’s Temporary Recommendations: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Spain, and United States of America. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>It was the unanimous view of the Committee that the event continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In light of States Parties’ presentations and subsequent Committee discussions, several points and challenges were noted for the affected countries and other countries. The primary emphasis must continue to be stopping the transmission of Ebola within the 3 affected countries with intense transmission. This action is the most important step for preventing international spread. Specific attention, including through appropriate monitoring and follow-up of their health, should be paid to the needs of health care workers. This will also encourage more health care staff to assist in this outbreak.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee reviewed the recommendations issued on 8 August and the comments published on 22 September, and provided the following additional advice to the Director-General for her consideration in addressing the Ebola outbreak in accordance with IHR (2005). All previous temporary recommendations remain in effect. Even though a few cases have occurred outside the 3 countries with intense transmission, the measures recommended appear to have been helpful in limiting further international spread. Additional recommendations follow below. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Recommendations for States with intense Ebola transmission (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone)</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Exit screening in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone remains critical for reducing the exportation of Ebola cases. States should maintain and reinforce high-quality exit screening of all persons at international airports, seaport, and major land crossings, for unexplained febrile illness consistent with potential Ebola infection. The exit screening should consist of, at a minimum, a questionnaire, a temperature measurement and, if fever is discovered, an assessment of the risk that the fever is caused by Ebola virus disease (EVD). States should collect data from their exit screening processes, monitor their results, and share these with WHO on a regular basis and in a timely fashion. This will increase public confidence and provide important information to other States. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO and partners should provide additional support needed by States to further strengthen exit screening processes in a sustainable way. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Recommendations for all States</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee reiterated its recommendation that there should be no general ban on international travel or trade. A general travel ban is likely to cause economic hardship, and could consequently increase the uncontrolled migration of people from affected countries, raising the risk of international spread of Ebola. The Committee emphasized the importance of normalizing air travel and the movement of ships, including the handling of cargo and goods, to and from the affected areas, to reduce the isolation and economic hardship of the affected countries. Any necessary medical treatment should be available ashore for seafarers and passengers.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Previous recommendations regarding the travel of EVD cases and contacts should continue to be implemented. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>A number of States have recently introduced entry screening measures. WHO encourages countries implementing such measures to share their experiences and lessons learned. Entry screening may have a limited effect in reducing international spread when added to exit screening, and its advantages and disadvantages should be carefully considered. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>If entry screening is implemented, States should take into account the following considerations: it offers an opportunity for individual sensitization, but the resource demands may be significant, even if screening is targeted; and management systems must be in place to care for travellers and suspected cases in compliance with International Health Regulations (IHR) requirements. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>A number of States without Ebola transmission have decided to or are considering cancelling international meetings and mass gatherings. Although the Committee does not recommend such cancellations, it recognizes that these are complex decisions that must be decided on a case-by-case basis. The Committee encourages States to use a risk-based approach to make these decisions. WHO has issued advice for countries hosting international meetings or mass gatherings, and will continue to provide guidance and support on this issue. The Committee agreed that there should not be a general ban on participation of competitors or delegations from countries with transmission of Ebola wishing to attend international events and mass gatherings but that the decision of participation must be made on a case by case basis by the hosting country. The temporary recommendations relating to travel should apply; additional health monitoring may be requested. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>All countries should strengthen education and communication efforts to combat stigma, disproportionate fear, and inappropriate measures and reactions associated with Ebola. Such efforts may also encourage self-reporting and early presentation for diagnosis and care. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Committee emphasized the importance of continued support by WHO and other national and international partners towards the effective implementation and monitoring of these recommendations. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Based on this advice and the information considered by the Committee, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment, and declared that the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone continued to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s advice and issued them as Temporary Recommendations under IHR (2005). The Director-General thanked the Committee members and advisors for their advice and requested their reassessment of this situation within 3 months or earlier should circumstances require. </span></p>\n<div></div>",

WHO’s <em>\"Global Tuberculosis Report 2014\"</em>, published today, shows that 9 million people developed TB in 2013, and 1.5 million died, including 360 000 people who were HIV positive.</span></p>\n<p><span>The report stresses, however, that the mortality rate from TB is still falling and has dropped by 45% since 1990, while the number of people developing the disease is declining by an average 1.5% a year. An estimated 37 million lives have been saved through effective diagnosis and treatment of TB since 2000. </span></p>\n<p><span>“Following a concerted effort by countries, by WHO and by multiple partners, investment in national surveys and routine surveillance efforts has substantially increased. This is providing us with much more and better data, bringing us closer and closer to understanding the true burden of tuberculosis,” says Dr Mario Raviglione, Director of the Global TB Programme, WHO.</span></p>\n<p><span>Although higher, these revised figures fall within the upper limit of previous WHO estimates. The report, however, underlines that a staggering number of lives are being lost to a curable disease and confirms that TB is the second biggest killer disease from a single infectious agent. In addition, around 3 million people who fall ill from TB are still being ‘missed’ by health systems each year either because they are not diagnosed, or because they are diagnosed but not reported.</span></p>\n<p><span>Insufficient funding is hampering efforts to combat the global epidemic. An estimated US$ 8 billion is needed each year for a full response, but there is currently an annual shortfall of US$ 2 billion, which must be addressed. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Diagnostic capacity for MDR-TB increasing faster than treatment capacity</h3>\n<p><span>The multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) crisis continues, with an estimated 480 000 new cases in 2013. Worldwide, about 3.5% of all people who developed TB in 2013 had this form of the disease, which is much harder to treat and has significantly poorer cure rates. While the estimated percentage of new TB cases that have MDR-TB globally remains unchanged, there are severe epidemics in some regions, particularly in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In many settings around the world, the treatment success rate is alarmingly low. Furthermore, extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), which is even more expensive and difficult to treat than MDR-TB, has now been reported in 100 countries.</span></p>\n<p><span>Since 2009, with more laboratories rolling out rapid tests, there has been a tripling of MDR-TB cases being diagnosed. In 2013, 136 000 MDR-TB cases were detected and 97 000 people were started on treatment. Although the number of patients treated has increased three-fold since 2009, at least 39 000 patients, diagnosed with this form of TB, were not being treated last year and globally only 48% of patients were cured. </span></p>\n<p><span>“The progress that has been made in combatting MDR-TB has been hard won and must be intensified. Containing and reversing the epidemic requires immediate and sustained efforts by all stakeholders,” says Dr Karin Weyer, WHO Coordinator for Laboratories, Diagnostics and Drug Resistance. “Improved diagnostic tools and access mean that we are detecting and treating more cases. But the gap between detecting and actually getting people started on treatment is widening and we urgently need increased commitment and funding to test and treat every case. In countries such as Estonia and Latvia, where there is universal access to rapid diagnostics and treatment, the number of MDR-TB cases has fallen significantly. This shows what can be achieved.”</span></p>\n<p><span>A special supplement to this year’s WHO report marks 20 years of anti-TB drug-resistance surveillance. It outlines the MDR-TB response to-date and the priority actions that must now be taken from prevention to cure. Anti-TB drug-resistance surveillance has been a pathfinder in global efforts against antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">HIV-related TB deaths down by one third in last decade</h3>\n<p><span>Another key challenge is the co-epidemic of TB and HIV. An estimated 1.1 million (13%) of the 9 million people who developed TB in 2013 were HIV-positive, with 4 out of 5 cases and deaths occurring in the African Region. While the number of TB deaths among HIV-positive people has been falling for almost a decade, from 540 000 in 2004 to 360 000 in 2013, antiretroviral treatment, preventive therapy and other key interventions still need to be further scaled-up.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Research funding urgently required</h3>\n<p><span>Research has a crucial role to play in ending the global TB epidemic and efforts to develop new tools to combat the disease have intensified during the past decade. The research and development pipeline has produced several new diagnostics (such as Xpert MTB/RIF) and 2 new drugs to treat MDR-TB (bedaquiline and delamanid). Additional rapid tests, new drugs and drug regimens, and vaccines are in clinical trials. However, TB research and development is still severely underfunded. </span></p>\n<p><span>“In addition to the serious underfunding for research, US$ 8 billion a year is required for TB and MDR-TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Domestic and international financing needs to step up to prevent millions of unnecessary deaths,” says Katherine Floyd, WHO Coordinator for TB Monitoring and Evaluation.</span></p>\n<p><span>The WHO report will be presented and discussed during the upcoming Union World Conference on Lung Health in Barcelona, Spain next week.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">For more information, contact</h3>\n<p><span>Christian Lindmeier<br/>\nWHO Media<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 79 11948 <br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:lindmeierch@who.int\">lindmeierch@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p><span>Alison Clements-Hunt<br/>\nCommunications Officer<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 1995<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:clementshuntal@who.int\">clementshuntal@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p><span>Hannah Monica Dias<br/>\nCommunications and Technical Officer<br/>\nGlobal TB Programme<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 4695<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:diash@who.int\">diash@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div> </div>",

          "“In addition to the serious underfunding for research, US$ 8 billion a year is required for TB and MDR-TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Domestic and international financing needs to step up to prevent millions of unnecessary deaths,” says Katherine Floyd, WHO Coordinator for TB Monitoring and Evaluation.",
          "The WHO report will be presented and discussed during the upcoming Union World Conference on Lung Health in Barcelona, Spain next week."

    "content_html": "<div> <p><span class=\"\">News release</span>\n</p>\n</div> <p>\n<em class=\"dateline\">18 October 2014 ¦ MOSCOW -</em>\n<span>The sixth session of the Conference of the parties (COP6) to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) concluded today in Moscow. Several landmark decisions were adopted in the course of the six-day session, regarded as one of the most successful in the WHO FCTC’s history.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In her opening speech, WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan said that “as implementation of the Framework Convention reaches new heights, the tobacco industry fights back, harder and through every possible channel, no matter how devious those channels and practices are.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Despite increased efforts by tobacco industry to undermine the WHO FCTC, important decisions were passed. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Parties have taken courageous steps forward in a number of areas and I am pleased by the guidance to the Secretariat to scale up our collaboration with international organizations to reduce tobacco use, while continuing to assist Parties in accelerating the implementation of the Treaty,” said Dr Vera da Costa e Silva, Head of the Convention Secretariat.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>One of the first decisions approved by the Parties was on the Article 6 guidelines, devoted to tax measures to reduce the demand for tobacco. Tobacco taxation is a very effective tool for influencing the prices of tobacco – higher taxes usually lead to higher prices, which in turn lead to lower consumption. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The regulations provide for tax rates to be monitored, increased and adjusted annually, taking into account inflation and income growth. At the same time, all tobacco products should be taxed in a comparable way to prevent substitutions of the use of one product with another.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Several measures aimed at restricting tobacco industry interference were decided by the parties, which concern implementation of Article 5.3 of the WHO FCTC. These include request the Convention Secretariat to continue providing technical support to the Parties, and to engage with international organizations on the matters of tobacco companies’ influence.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Another milestone in tobacco control was adoption of the decision on electronic nicotine (and non-nicotine) delivery systems, also known as electronic cigarettes. This rather novel product was first launched by independent companies, but many of them are now being controlled by multinational tobacco companies. The decision acknowledges the need for regulations along the lines of policies concerning other tobacco products, including banning or restricting promotion, advertising and sponsorship of ENDS.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>COP6 honored the tradition of the previous conferences and adopted the Moscow Declaration. Noting that the heaviest burden of tobacco related diseases is borne by the most vulnerable population groups, the Declaration calls on the parties to strengthen international collaboration on tobacco control and attain a voluntary global target of 30% prevalence reduction by 2025. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The President of the COP Bureau, Professor Chang Jin Moon, said that many other significant decisions were made and “it is clear that the Parties are supportive of continuing to raise the profile of the WHO FCTC in the international arena and on global health agenda.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>These decisions include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposals for regulation of smokeless tobacco and water pipe products;</li>\n<li>Recommendations for entry into force of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products;</li>\n<li>Continuing to work on Article 19 on liability of tobacco companies;</li>\n<li>Articles 17 and 18 principles addressing sustainable alternative livelihoods for tobacco growers;</li>\n<li>Trade and investment issues related to FCTC implementation;</li>\n<li>Assessment of the Convention’s impact on tobacco epidemic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>Together, these decisions will help move forward the treaty, which entered into force in February 2005. The number of Parties to the Convention is 179 as of today. It is the fastest ratified treaty in the UN history. Conference of the Parties is the governing body of the Convention, which meets regularly to review progress of the Convention and takes the decisions necessary to promote its effective implementation.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Media contact</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Andrey Muchnik <br/>\nCommunications Officer, WHO FCTC Secretariat<br/>\nMobile: +41 76483 7463 <br/>\nfrom October 18: +7 910 450 2365 <br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:muchnika@who.int\">muchnika@who.int</a>\n</span></p>\n<div></div>",

Its mode of transmission remains basically unchanged.Speculation that Ebola virus disease might mutate into a form that could easily spread among humans through the air is just that: speculation, unsubstantiated by any evidence.This kind of speculation is unfounded but understandable as health officials race to catch up with this fast-moving and rapidly evolving outbreak.To stop this outbreak, more needs to be done to implement – on a much larger scale – well-known protective and preventive measures. Abundant evidence has documented their effectiveness.",

This is a social crisis, a humanitarian crisis, an economic crisis and a threat to national security well beyond the outbreak zones,” said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General, to the UN Security Council on Thursday. “For these reasons, Mr Secretary-General and I are calling for a UN-wide initiative that draws together all the assets of all relevant UN agencies.\"\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>This is the first time in history that the UN has created a mission for a public health emergency. The Mission will bring together the vast resources of the UN agencies, funds and programmes, to reinforce WHO’s technical expertise and experience in disease outbreaks. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>While WHO plays a central role in leading the public health efforts for this response, the support of other UN agencies is essential to deal with the social, economic, development and security challenges that are affecting these countries and the region.\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“This unprecedented outbreak requires an unprecedented response,” said Dr David Nabarro, the UN Secretary General’s Senior Coordinator for the Ebola Response. “The number of cases have doubled in these countries in the last three weeks.

The average annual reduction has accelerated – in some countries it has even tripled – but overall progress is still short of meeting the global target of a two-thirds decrease in under-five mortality by 2015.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>New estimates in \"Levels and Trends in Child Mortality 2014\" show that in 2013, 6.3 million children under five died from mostly preventable causes, around 200 000 fewer than in 2012, but still equal to nearly 17 000 child deaths each day.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“There has been dramatic and accelerating progress in reducing mortality among children, and the data prove that success is possible even for poorly resourced countries,” said Mickey Chopra, head UNICEF’s of global health programmes. “There is now a gathering momentum from countries in every part of the world to make sure proven, cost-effective interventions are applied where they will save the most lives.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In 2013, 2.8 million babies died within the first month of life, which represents about 44% of all under-five deaths. About two-thirds of these deaths occurred in just 10 countries. While the number of neo-natal deaths have declined, progress has been slower than for the overall under-five mortality rate.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In June this year, WHO, UNICEF and partners issued the first-ever global plan to end preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths by 2035. The Every Newborn Action Plan calls for all countries to take steps to provide basic, cost-effective health services – in particular around the time of childbirth, as well as for small and sick babies – and to improve the quality of care.</span></p>\n<div class=\"blockquote-container\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The global community is poised to end preventable maternal, newborn and child deaths within a generation.\"</p>\n<p class=\"source\">\nDr Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General\n</p>\n</blockquote> </div>\n<p>\n<span> “The global community is poised to end preventable maternal, newborn and child deaths within a generation,” said Dr Flavia Bustreo, Assistant Director General at WHO. “We know what to do and we know how to do it. The challenge now is to move from plan to action – we are pleased to see countries like India beginning to lead the way.” </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Among the report’s other major findings:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eight of the 60 countries identified as ‘high mortality countries’ – with at least 40 under-five deaths for every 1000 live births – have already reached or surpassed the MDG target (67% reduction). The countries are Malawi (72%), Bangladesh (71%), Liberia (71%), Tanzania (69%), Ethiopia (69%), Timor-Leste (68%), Niger (68%) and Eritrea (67%). </li>\n<li>Eastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and Northern Africa, have already reduced the under-five mortality rate by more than two-thirds since 1990. </li>\n<li>Two countries, India (21%) and Nigeria (13%), together account for more than one-third of deaths among children below 5 years of age. </li>\n<li>While Sub-Saharan Africa has cut under-five mortality rates by 48% since 1990, it still has the world’s highest rate – 92 deaths per 1000 live births – nearly 15 times the average in high-income countries.</li>\n<li>Children born in Angola, which has the highest under-five mortality rate in the world (167 deaths per 1000 live births), are 84 times more likely to die before the age of five than children born in Luxembourg, with the lowest rate (2). Within countries, relative wealth, education, and location are key – a child’s risk of dying increases if she or he is born in a remote rural area, into a poor household or to a mother with no education.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>The leading causes of under-five deaths are pre-term birth complications (17%); pneumonia (15%); complications during labour and delivery (11%); diarrhoea (9%); and malaria (7%). Under-nutrition contributes to nearly half of all under-five deaths.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“For continued progress, it is essential to invest more in health systems that deliver high-quality, affordable services to all women and children who need them,” said Olusoji Adeyi, Director of Health, Nutrition and Population at the World Bank Group.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The report notes that major improvements in child survival are in part due to affordable, evidence-based interventions against the leading infectious diseases, such as immunization, insecticide-treated mosquito nets, rehydration treatment for diarrhoea, nutritional supplements and therapeutic foods. The major causes of neonatal mortality – pre-term birth complications (35%) or problems during delivery or birth (24%) – require health interventions closely linked with protecting maternal health.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Levels and Trends in Child Mortality 2014 report is developed annually by the United Nations Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, which is led by UNICEF and includes the World Health Organization, the World Bank Group and the United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Note to editors:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Global estimates of child mortality are challenging to produce because many countries lack complete systems to track vital records. The estimates released today are largely based on statistical models and data from a variety of sources, including household surveys and censuses.

For example, the estimated global number of 6.3 million deaths in 2013 falls within the statistical confidence range of 6.1 to 6.7. </span></p>\n<h5 class=\"section_head3\">About UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME) </h5>\n<p>\n<span>The Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation or IGME was formed in 2004 to share data on child mortality, harmonise estimates within the UN system, improve methods for child mortality estimation report on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and enhance country capacity to produce timely and properly assessed estimates of child mortality.

Some 75% of suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Pesticide poisoning, hanging and firearms are among the most common methods of suicide globally. Evidence from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States and a number of European countries reveals that limiting access to these means can help prevent people dying by suicide. Another key to reducing deaths by suicide is a commitment by national governments to the establishment and implementation of a coordinated plan of action. Currently, only 28 countries are known to have national suicide prevention strategies.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Suicide is a global phenomenon</h3>\n<div class=\"blockquote-container\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This report is a call for action to address a large public health problem which has been shrouded in taboo for far too long”.</p>\n<p class=\"source\">\nDr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General.\n</p>\n</blockquote> </div>\n<p>\n<span>Suicide occurs all over the world and can take place at almost any age. Globally, suicide rates are highest in people aged 70 years and over. In some countries, however, the highest rates are found among the young. Notably, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year-olds globally.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“This report is a call for action to address a large public health problem which has been shrouded in taboo for far too long” said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Generally, more men die by suicide than women. In richer countries, three times as many men die by suicide than women. Men aged 50 years and over are particularly vulnerable. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In low- and middle-income countries, young adults and elderly women have higher rates of suicide than their counterparts in high-income countries. Women over 70 years old are more than twice as likely to die by suicide than women aged 15-29 years. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Suicides are preventable</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Reducing access to means of suicide is one way to reduce deaths. Other effective measures include responsible reporting of suicide in the media, such as avoiding language that sensationalizes suicide and avoiding explicit description of methods used, and early identification and management of mental and substance use disorders in communities and by health workers in particular.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Follow-up care by health workers through regular contact, including by phone or home visits, for people who have attempted suicide, together with provision of community support, are essential, because people who have already attempted suicide are at the greatest risk of trying again.</span></p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“...effective measures can be taken, even just starting at local level and on a small-scale”.</p>\n<p class=\"source\">\nDr Alexandra Fleischmann, Scientist in the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse at WHO\n</p>\n</blockquote> </div>\n<p>\n<span>“No matter where a country currently stands in suicide prevention”, said Dr Alexandra Fleischmann, Scientist in the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse at WHO, “effective measures can be taken, even just starting at local level and on a small-scale”.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO recommends countries involve a range of government departments in developing a comprehensive coordinated response. High-level commitment is needed not just within the health sector, but also within education, employment, social welfare and judicial departments.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“This report, the first WHO publication of its kind, presents a comprehensive overview of suicide, suicide attempts and successful suicide prevention efforts worldwide.

Now is the time to act,” said Dr Shekhar Saxena, Director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse at WHO.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The report’s launch comes just a week before World Suicide Prevention Day, observed on 10 September every year. The Day provides an opportunity for joint action to raise awareness about suicide and suicide prevention around the world.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Working towards a global target</h3>\n<p>\n<span>In the WHO Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020, WHO Member States have committed themselves to work towards the global target of reducing the suicide rate in countries by 10% by 2020.

Comparing estimates for 2000 with those for 2012, there was an increase of 38% in suicide rates in the African Region. Suicide rates are particularly high among the elderly, but there is also a peak among the young. Suicide by intentional pesticide ingestion is among the most common methods of suicide globally, and of particular concern in rural agricultural areas in the African Region.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Suicide in the WHO Region of the Americas</h4>\n<p>\n<span>In the WHO Region of the Americas, estimated suicide rates are generally lower than in other WHO regions. However, Guyana is the country with the highest estimated suicide rate for 2012 globally, and Suriname has the sixth highest. Suicide rates in this Region show a first peak among the young, remain at the same level for other age groups and rise again in elderly men. In high-income countries, hanging accounts for 50% of suicides, and firearms are the second most common method, accounting for 18% of suicides. The relatively high proportion of suicides by firearms in high-income countries is primarily driven by high-income countries in the Americas where firearms account for 46% of all suicides; in other high-income countries firearms account for only 4.5% of all suicides.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Suicide in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region</h4>\n<p>\n<span>In the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, estimated suicide rates are generally lower than in other WHO regions. However, there is evidence that among certain age groups in this region, suicide rates are relatively high, particularly among young women and men aged 15–29 years, and women and men aged 60 years and above.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Suicide in the WHO European Region</h4>\n<p>\n<span>In the WHO European Region, the estimated suicide rate is somewhat above the global average of 11.4 per 100 000 in 2012, and 6 European countries are in the top 20 countries with the highest estimated suicide rates globally. Lithuania has the fifth highest and Kazakhstan has the tenth highest globally. Suicide rates in this Region show a first peak among the young, another for middle-aged men and rise again in the elderly. Of great concern is that suicide is the main cause of death in many European countries for the 15-29 age group. However, European countries are prominent among those that have developed suicide prevention strategies. </span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Suicide in the WHO South-East Asia Region</h4>\n<p>\n<span>In the WHO South-East Asia Region, the estimated suicide rate is the highest as compared to other WHO regions. Suicide rates show a peak among the young and among the elderly. Most suicides in the world occur in the South-East Asia Region (39% of those in low- and middle-income countries in South-East Asia alone) with India accounting for the highest estimated number of suicides overall in 2012. Suicide by intentional pesticide ingestion is among the most common methods of suicide globally, and is of particular concern in rural agricultural areas in the South-East Asia Region.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Suicide in the WHO Western Pacific Region</h4>\n<p>\n<span>In the WHO Western Pacific Region, the estimated suicide rate in low- and middle-income countries is lower than the global average of 11.4 per 100 000 in 2012. However, the Republic of Korea is the country with the third highest estimated suicide rate for 2012 globally. Suicide rates in this Region increase steadily with age, with the highest rates among the elderly. A high proportion of suicides in the world occur in the Western Pacific Region (16% in low- and middle-income countries in the Western Pacific alone) with China accounting for the second highest estimated number of suicides overall in 2012. The number of total suicide deaths in the Western Pacific Region is approximately 180 000. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Suicidal behaviour among young people has been a concern in a number of countries, particularly in countries of the Pacific. Low- and middle-income countries in the Western Pacific Region are the only region of the world where the proportion of all deaths due to suicide is greater in females than in males and the rank of suicide as a cause of death is higher in females than in males. Suicide by intentional pesticide ingestion is among the most common methods of suicide globally, and of particular concern in rural agricultural areas in the Western Pacific Region.</span></p>\n<div></div>",

Implementing the new WHO roadmap to coordinate and scale up international response will help the affected countries stop ongoing transmission, she said.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Dr David Nabarro, UN Coordinator for the Ebola Response, said the United Nations system is working together on 12 detailed steps for the global response, which he estimated will cost at least US $600 million and require “several thousand people to scale up our response by 3 to 4 times.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO Assistant Director-General for Global Health Security, Keiji Fukuda, who just returned from west Africa, said, “We don’t have enough health workers, doctors, nurses, drivers, and contact tracers” to handle the increasing number of cases. “Most of the infections are happening in the community, and many people are unwilling to identify themselves as ill. And if they do, we don’t have enough ambulances to transport them or beds to treat them yet,” he said.\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Dr Fukuda said that insufficient health personnel and facilities to care for the growing number of cases was fueling the spread of the epidemic, as families are forced to care for patients at home, putting them and their contacts at risk of contagion. Mobilizing international financial support and additional health personnel is a top priority for scaling up the international response, Dr Fukuda said.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Another urgent need is to open up airline routes that have been closed to affected countries. These closures “have a huge impact,” Dr Fukuda said, impeding the flow of experts and supplies into Africa, and the outbreak itself is having a negative impact on the economies of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. “People need medical supplies, food, fuel, charcoal, and other provisions. We have to get it to them.” He noted that “WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with Ebola virus disease or where individuals have had contact with cases of Ebola.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Dr Nabarro and Dr Fukuda just returned from a needs assessment in the affected countries to shape the new UN surge plan for the region. The urgent needs include communications and messaging, care for the infected and proper burials, diagnosis and contact tracing, health services for other conditions, transport and supplies, cash to pay health workers, medical services for responders, air and sea access, and strong coordination to avert economic downturns.\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The countries affected by the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone, have reported about 3,500 cases and 1,900 deaths, Dr. Chan noted. A separate outbreak has been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information, contact:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Christy Feig<br/>\nDirector of Communications<br/>\nWorld Health Organization<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 251 7055<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:feigc@who.int\">feigc@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Daniel Epstein<br/>\nWHO spokesperson<br/>\nMobile: +1 301 219-2015<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:epsteindb@msn.com\">epsteindb@msn.com</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Donna Eberwine-Villagrán<br/>\nMedia and Communication<br/>\nPan American Health Organization/World Health Organization<br/>\nTelephone: +1 202 974 3122<br/>\nMobile: +1 202 316 5469<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:eberwind@paho.org\">eberwind@paho.org</a> </span></p>\n<div></div>",

Even before the Ebola outbreak began, after years of conflict, the area of West Africa most affected by this disease suffered from a weakened and fragile health system with a shortage of health workers. Surge capacity of international health experts is essential to supplement the work of the local frontline workers in this response. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Since the beginning of the international response to the outbreak in March, WHO has deployed nearly 400 people from across the Organization and from partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to help respond to the disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. This is the first time someone working under the aegis of WHO has fallen ill with the disease. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Ebola virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids and people giving care or working around infected patients are known to be a high risk group. In the past six months of the outbreak, more than 225 health workers have fallen ill and nearly 130 have lost their lives to the disease they were working to contain. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO recognizes there is a risk for health workers who work around Ebola and takes many precautions before they deploy to help them protect themselves in the field. Once there, the Organization ensures those workers have access to appropriate medical advice and support.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Media contacts:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Gregory Hartl<br/>\nin Geneva, Switzerland <br/>\nMobile: +41 79 203 67 15 <br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:hartlg@who.int\">hartlg@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Tarik Jasarevic<br/>\nin Geneva, Switzerland <br/>\nMobile: +41 79 747 27 56 <br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:jasarevict@who.int\">jasarevict@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Christy Feig<br/>\nin Freetown, Sierra Leone<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 251 70 55 <br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:feigc@who.int\">feigc@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Nyka Alexander<br/>\nin Conakry, Guinea<br/>\nMobile:+224 621 845 603<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:nyka.alexander@gmail.com\">nyka.alexander@gmail.com</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

These professionals are taking personal risks to provide critical medical care, but have been threatened, shunned and stigmatized. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Doctors, nurses and other health workers must be allowed to carry out their life-saving humanitarian work free of threat of violence and insecurity,” says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Dr Richard Brennan, Director of WHO’s Department of Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response, adds: “Assaults on health workers and facilities seriously affect access to health care, depriving patients of treatment and interrupting measures to prevent and control contagious diseases. WHO has a specific mandate to protect the human right to health, especially for people affected by humanitarian emergencies.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>While the adverse impacts of attacks on health care have been well documented in conflicts such as Syria and South Sudan, Gaza, health workers are also being prevented from carrying out their essential work outside of war-zones. In Pakistan and Nigeria, polio vaccinators, most of them female, have been specifically targeted.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>As part of its lead role in coordinating the health response to international emergencies, WHO is working with partners to better document, prevent and respond to such incidents. Protecting those who care for the sick and vulnerable in the world’s most difficult circumstances is one of the most pressing responsibilities of the international community. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">For more information please contact:</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Paul Garwood<br/>\nWHO Department of Communications <br/>\nTelephone: +41 227911578 <br/>\nMobile: +41 796037294 <br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:garwoodp@who.int\">garwoodp@who.int</a> </span></p>\n<div></div>",

Usually when someone is sick with Ebola, they are so unwell that they cannot travel. WHO is therefore advising against travel bans to and from affected countries. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Because the risk of Ebola transmission on airplanes is so low, WHO does not consider air transport hubs at high risk for further spread of Ebola,” says Dr Nuttall. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In early August, after the meeting of the Ebola Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations, WHO provided advice to countries to help contain the current Ebola outbreak and prevent it from spreading further. The guidance recommended:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>no ban on international travel or trade;</li>\n<li>that countries be prepared to detect, investigate, and manage Ebola cases; including access to a qualified diagnostic laboratory for Ebola virus and, where appropriate, the capacity to identify and care for travellers originating from known Ebola-infected areas who arrive at international airports or major land crossing points with unexplained fever and other symptoms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>Worldwide, countries should provide their citizens traveling to Ebola-affected countries with accurate and relevant information on the Ebola outbreak and measures to reduce the risk of exposure.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">WHO media contacts:</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Gregory Hartl <br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 4458 <br/>\nMobile: +41 79 203 6715 <br/>\nEmail: hartlg@who.int\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Tarik Jasarevic<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 50 99<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 367 62 14<br/>\nEmail: jasarevict@who.int\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib<br/>\nTelephone: + 41 22 791 3228 <br/>\nMobile:+ 41 79 475 55 56 <br/>\nE-mail: chaibf@who.int </span></p>\n<div></div>",

The following IHR (2005) States Parties participated in the informational session of the meeting on Wednesday, 6 August 2014: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.\r\n    </span>\n</p><p><span>During the informational session, the WHO Secretariat provided an update on and assessment of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The above-referenced States Parties presented on recent developments in their countries, including measures taken to implement rapid control strategies, and existing gaps and challenges in the outbreak response.\r\n    </span>\n</p><p><span>After discussion and deliberation on the information provided, the Committee advised that:</span>\n</p><ul><li>the Ebola outbreak in West Africa constitutes an ‘extraordinary event’ and a public health risk to other States; </li><li>the possible consequences of further international spread are particularly serious in view of the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems in the currently affected and most at-risk countries. </li><li>a coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop and reverse the international spread of Ebola. </li></ul><p><span>It was the unanimous view of the Committee that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have been met.</span>\n</p><p><span>The current EVD outbreak began in Guinea in December 2013. This outbreak now involves transmission in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. As of 4 August 2014, countries have reported 1 711 cases (1 070 confirmed, 436 probable, 205 suspect), including 932 deaths. This is currently the largest EVD outbreak ever recorded. In response to the outbreak, a number of unaffected countries have made a range of travel related advice or recommendations. </span>\n</p><p><span>In light of States Parties’ presentations and subsequent Committee discussions, several challenges were noted for the affected countries: </span>\n</p><ul><li>their health systems are fragile with significant deficits in human, financial and material resources, resulting in compromised ability to mount an adequate Ebola outbreak control response;</li><li>inexperience in dealing with Ebola outbreaks; misperceptions of the disease, including how the disease is transmitted, are common and continue to be a major challenge in some communities; </li><li>high mobility of populations and several instances of cross-border movement of travellers with infection; </li><li>several generations of transmission have occurred in the three capital cities of Conakry (Guinea); Monrovia (Liberia); and Freetown (Sierra Leone); and </li><li>a high number of infections have been identified among health-care workers, highlighting inadequate infection control practices in many facilities.</li></ul><p><span>The Committee provided the following advice to the Director-General for her consideration to address the Ebola outbreak in accordance with IHR (2005).</span>\n</p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">States with Ebola transmission</h3><ul><li>The Head of State should declare a national emergency; personally address the nation to provide information on the situation, the steps being taken to address the outbreak and the critical role of the community in ensuring its rapid control; provide immediate access to emergency financing to initiate and sustain response operations; and ensure all necessary measures are taken to mobilize and remunerate the necessary health care workforce.</li><li>Health Ministers and other health leaders should assume a prominent leadership role in coordinating and implementing emergency Ebola response measures, a fundamental aspect of which should be to meet regularly with affected communities and to make site visits to treatment centres. </li><li>States should activate their national disaster/emergency management mechanisms and establish an emergency operation centre, under the authority of the Head of State, to coordinate support across all partners, and across the information, security, finance and other relevant sectors, to ensure efficient and effective implementation and monitoring of comprehensive Ebola control measures. These measures must include infection prevention and control (IPC), community awareness, surveillance, accurate laboratory diagnostic testing, contact tracing and monitoring, case management, and communication of timely and accurate information among countries. For all infected and high risks areas, similar mechanisms should be established at the state/province and local levels to ensure close coordination across all levels. </li><li>States should ensure that there is a large-scale and sustained effort to fully engage the community – through local, religious and traditional leaders and healers – so communities play a central role in case identification, contact tracing and risk education; the population should be made fully aware of the benefits of early treatment.</li><li>It is essential that a strong supply pipeline be established to ensure that sufficient medical commodities, especially personal protective equipment (PPE), are available to those who appropriately need them, including health care workers, laboratory technicians, cleaning staff, burial personnel and others that may come in contact with infected persons or contaminated materials. </li><li>In areas of intense transmission (e.g. the cross border area of Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia), the provision of quality clinical care, and material and psychosocial support for the affected populations should be used as the primary basis for reducing the movement of people, but extraordinary supplemental measures such as quarantine should be used as considered necessary.</li><li>States should ensure health care workers receive: adequate security measures for their safety and protection; timely payment of salaries and, as appropriate, hazard pay; and appropriate education and training on IPC, including the proper use of PPEs. </li><li>States should ensure that: treatment centres and reliable diagnostic laboratories are situated as closely as possible to areas of transmission; that these facilities have adequate numbers of trained staff, and sufficient equipment and supplies relative to the caseload; that sufficient security is provided to ensure both the safety of staff and to minimize the risk of premature removal of patients from treatment centres; and that staff are regularly reminded and monitored to ensure compliance with IPC. </li><li>States should conduct exit screening of all persons at international airports, seaports and major land crossings, for unexplained febrile illness consistent with potential Ebola infection. The exit screening should consist of, at a minimum, a questionnaire, a temperature measurement and, if there is a fever, an assessment of the risk that the fever is caused by EVD. Any person with an illness consistent with EVD should not be allowed to travel unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation.</li><li>There should be no international travel of Ebola contacts or cases, unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation. To minimize the risk of international spread of EVD: </li><ul class=\"disc\"><li>Confirmed cases should immediately be isolated and treated in an Ebola Treatment Centre with no national or international travel until 2 Ebola-specific diagnostic tests conducted at least 48 hours apart are negative;</li><li>Contacts (which do not include properly protected health workers and laboratory staff who have had no unprotected exposure) should be monitored daily, with restricted national travel and no international travel until 21 days after exposure; </li><li>Probable and suspect cases should immediately be isolated and their travel should be restricted in accordance with their classification as either a confirmed case or contact. </li></ul><li>States should ensure funerals and burials are conducted by well-trained personnel, with provision made for the presence of the family and cultural practices, and in accordance with national health regulations, to reduce the risk of Ebola infection. The cross-border movement of the human remains of deceased suspect, probable or confirmed EVD cases should be prohibited unless authorized in accordance with recognized international biosafety provisions. </li><li>States should ensure that appropriate medical care is available for the crews and staff of airlines operating in the country, and work with the airlines to facilitate and harmonize communications and management regarding symptomatic passengers under the IHR (2005), mechanisms for contact tracing if required and the use of passenger locator records where appropriate.</li><li>States with EVD transmission should consider postponing mass gatherings until EVD transmission is interrupted. </li></ul><h3 class=\"section_head1\">States with a potential or confirmed Ebola Case, and unaffected States with land borders with affected States</h3><ul><li>Unaffected States with land borders adjoining States with Ebola transmission should urgently establish surveillance for clusters of unexplained fever or deaths due to febrile illness; establish access to a qualified diagnostic laboratory for EVD; ensure that health workers are aware of and trained in appropriate IPC procedures; and establish rapid response teams with the capacity to investigate and manage EVD cases and their contacts. </li><li>Any State newly detecting a suspect or confirmed Ebola case or contact, or clusters of unexplained deaths due to febrile illness, should treat this as a health emergency, take immediate steps in the first 24 hours to investigate and stop a potential Ebola outbreak by instituting case management, establishing a definitive diagnosis, and undertaking contact tracing and monitoring.</li><li>If Ebola transmission is confirmed to be occurring in the State, the full recommendations for <em>States with Ebola Transmission</em> should be implemented, on either a national or subnational level, depending on the epidemiologic and risk context.</li></ul><h3 class=\"section_head1\">All States</h3><ul><li>There should be no general ban on international travel or trade; restrictions outlined in these recommendations regarding the travel of EVD cases and contacts should be implemented. </li><li>States should provide travelers to Ebola affected and at-risk areas with relevant information on risks, measures to minimize those risks, and advice for managing a potential exposure.</li><li>States should be prepared to detect, investigate, and manage Ebola cases; this should include assured access to a qualified diagnostic laboratory for EVD and, where appropriate, the capacity to manage travelers originating from known Ebola-infected areas who arrive at international airports or major land crossing points with unexplained febrile illness. </li><li>The general public should be provided with accurate and relevant information on the Ebola outbreak and measures to reduce the risk of exposure. </li><li>States should be prepared to facilitate the evacuation and repatriation of nationals (e.g. health workers) who have been exposed to Ebola.</li></ul><p><span>The Committee emphasized the importance of continued support by WHO and other national and international partners towards the effective implementation and monitoring of these recommendations. </span>\n</p><p><span>Based on this advice, the reports made by affected States Parties and the currently available information, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and on 8 August 2014 declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General endorsed the Committee’s advice and issued them as Temporary Recommendations under IHR (2005) to reduce the international spread of Ebola, effective 8 August 2014.

The 2nd meeting of the Emergency Committee was held by teleconference on Thursday 31 July 2014 from 13:00 to 17:15 Geneva time (CET) 1.</p><p>The affected States Parties that met the criteria for <em>‘States currently exporting wild poliovirus’</em> participated in the informational session of the meeting and were as follows: Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic.</p><p>During the informational session the WHO Secretariat updated the Committee on wild poliovirus transmission and international spread since 5 May 2014. The above affected States Parties presented information on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations issued on 5 May 2014, including the national declaration of a public health emergency and recommendations for travellers, and recent developments in the intensification of national polio eradication strategies.</p><p>Using the criteria applied to the declaration of the PHEIC in May, the Committee considered whether the conditions for a PHEIC still apply. After discussion of the information provided, the Committee advised that the international spread of polio in 2014 continues to constitute an extraordinary event and a public health risk to other States for which a coordinated international response continues to be essential.</p><p>Since 5 May 2014, and the onset of the high transmission season for polio, there has been new international spread of wild poliovirus in central Asia (from Pakistan to Afghanistan as recently as June 2014) and a poliovirus originating in Central Africa (Equatorial Guinea) was reported from the Americas. The latter had been detected in a single sewage sample that was collected in Brazil in March 2014 at a site that covered an international airport in the state of Sao Paolo. Equatorial Guinea was consequently confirmed as a <em>‘State currently exporting wild poliovirus’</em> and informed of the need to implement the relevant Temporary Recommendations, bringing to four the total number of <em>‘States currently exporting wild poliovirus’</em>. Two of the <em>‘States currently exporting wild poliovirus’</em>, Pakistan and Cameroon, have had additional cases and geographic expansion of the infected area within each country since 5 May 2014. The possible consequences of international spread have worsened since the declaration of the PHEIC, as susceptible populations living in polio-free but conflict-torn States and areas have increased, with further deterioration of their routine immunization services.</p><p>The international spread of poliovirus in 2014 continues to threaten the ongoing effort to eradicate globally one of the world’s most serious vaccine preventable diseases. It was the unanimous view of the Committee that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) continue to be met.</p><p>All four <em>‘States currently exporting wild poliovirus’</em> had initiated implementation of the Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director-General on 5 May 2014, and further intensified national eradication efforts. While recognizing and appreciating these efforts, the Committee noted that the application of the Temporary Recommendations by affected States Parties remains incomplete. Additional efforts are required to declare and/or operationalize national emergency procedures, to improve vaccination coverage of international travellers and to ensure eradication strategies are fully implemented to international standards in all infected and high risk areas.</p><p>The Committee reiterated that the over-riding priority for all polio-infected States must be to interrupt wild poliovirus transmission within their borders as rapidly as possible through high quality application in all geographic areas of the polio eradication strategies. The Committee reinforced the need for a coordinated regional approach to accelerate interruption of virus transmission in each epidemiologic zone.</p><p>The Committee provided the following advice to the Director-General for her consideration to reduce the international spread of wild poliovirus.</p><ul><li><em>States Currently Exporting Wild Poliovirus</em>: Pakistan, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and the Syrian Arab Republic continue to meet the criteria for such States and pose the highest risk for further wild poliovirus exportations in 2014.

The Temporary Recommendations issued by the Director-General on 5 May 2014 for such States should continue to be implemented.</li></ul><p>The Committee reaffirmed that any polio-free State which becomes infected with wild poliovirus should immediately implement the advice for <em>‘States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting’</em>. In the event of new international spread from an infected State, that State should immediately implement the requirements for <em>‘States currently exporting wild poliovirus’</em>. The Committee noted that although a single wild poliovirus of Equatorial Guinea origin had been detected in Brazil in March 2014, Brazil was not considered polio-infected in the context of the global eradication initiative, as there was no evidence that this poliovirus exposure had resulted in transmission2. The Committee stressed the importance of surveillance in all polio-infected and polio-free countries.</p><p>The Committee acknowledged the efforts that Affected States have made to address the Temporary Recommendations, and recognised the challenges experienced by Affected States in their implementation. However, cognizant of the grave implications of any new international spread of poliovirus for the global eradication effort, the Committee considered whether additional Temporary Recommendations were needed at this time to further mitigate this risk. The Committee decided that additional time is first required to fully gauge the impact of the existing Temporary Recommendations in reducing the international spread of wild poliovirus. The Committee recommended, however, that this situation be reviewed again after 3 months.</p><p>Noting the challenges, both material and technical, that States had reported in implementing the Temporary Recommendations, the Committee emphasized the importance of continued support by WHO and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative partners towards the effective implementation and monitoring of these recommendations.</p><p>Based on this advice and the reports made by affected States Parties, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment and declared that the international spread of wild poliovirus in 2014 continued to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General thanked the Committee Members and Advisors for their advice, requested their reassessment of this situation in 3 months and extended the following Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005), effective 3 August 2014:</p><h3>States currently exporting wild poliovirus</h3><p>These States should:</p><ul><li>officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency;</li><li>ensure that all residents and long-term visitors (i.e. &gt; 4 weeks) receive a dose of OPV or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to international travel;</li><li>ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within 4 weeks), who have not received a dose of OPV or IPV in the previous 4 weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers;</li><li>ensure that such travellers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the International Health Regulations (2005) to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination;</li><li>maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least 6 months have passed without new exportations and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until at least 12 months have passed without new exportations.</li></ul><h3>States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting</h3><p>These States should:</p><ul><li>officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency;</li><li>encourage residents and long-term visitors to receive a dose of OPV or IPV 4 weeks to 12 months prior to international travel; those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within 4 weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure;</li><li>ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status;</li><li>maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least 6 months have passed without the detection of wild poliovirus transmission in the country from any source, and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until at least 12 months without evidence of transmission.</li></ul><h4> </h4><p> </p><hr/><ul><li><a href=\"/groups/poliovirus-ihr-emergency-committee\">1 Emergency Committee Members and Advisors: list of names, affiliations and interests</a><br/>The same Members and Advisors were invited to both meetings of the Emergency Committee.</li><li><a data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2014_6_23polio-en\">2 Detection of poliovirus in sewage, Brazil</a></li></ul><p> </p>",

Viral hepatitis – a group of infectious diseases known as hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E – affects millions of people worldwide, causing acute and chronic liver disease and killing close to 1.4 million people every year.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“For years, viral hepatitis has been largely neglected,” says Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General at WHO. “But now we are beginning to see greater awareness and global momentum building to tackle it.” </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">New momentum</h3>\n<p>\n<span>This increasing interest stimulated debate on hepatitis at the 2014 World Health Assembly, when 194 countries endorsed a resolution to intensify efforts to prevent, diagnose, and treat viral hepatitis. The resolution emphasizes how important it is for countries to have comprehensive national plans to tackle hepatitis - designed to meet the needs of the country, using the resources available. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The World Health Assembly, composed of health ministers and other representatives from all WHO Member States, noted that testing is key: today, most people with hepatitis do not know they are infected, as often symptoms only appear decades later after serious liver disease sets in. It also highlighted the need to invest in effective prevention strategies. These include comprehensive programmes for people who inject drugs, assuring access to safe injections and blood transfusions, and expanding immunization programmes to protect people from hepatitis A and B. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The resolution recognizes the great potential of new medicines and treatment approaches for chronic hepatitis C and hepatitis B infection, calling for strategies to increase access to affordable, quality hepatitis medicines. It calls on WHO to examine the feasibility of eliminating hepatitis B and C. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Innovations in the hepatitis response</h3>\n<p>\n<span>World Hepatitis Day this year coincides with the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia, where a wide range of sessions focus on the public health and clinical challenges of preventing and managing viral hepatitis and HIV co-infection. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Many people who are at increased risk of, and affected by, HIV are also particularly vulnerable to viral hepatitis. As many as 4-5 million people are estimated to be infected with both HIV and hepatitis B. Similar numbers are infected with both HIV and hepatitis C. As more people living with both HIV and hepatitis receive HIV treatment, they survive long enough to develop hepatitis-C related cirrhosis and liver cancer, highlighting the need to protect them better from hepatitis and to treat them if they do develop it. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“The experience gained by HIV programmes in scaling up comprehensive prevention and treatment programmes, improving access to affordable medicines and diagnostics, engaging communities and reaching vulnerable and marginalized populations can do much to inform viral hepatitis responses, addressing wider populations of people affected by hepatitis B and C,” says Dr Hiroki Nakatani, Assistant Director-General for HIV, Tuberculosis, Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases, WHO. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>One of the most significant public health developments over the past year has been the huge advances in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. New drugs, with others in the pipeline, have the potential to transform hepatitis C treatment, with safe and simple treatments resulting in cure rates of over 90%. But major challenges remain to make such treatment affordable and accessible to those populations in greatest need.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO has been intensifying its support to countries to expand comprehensive hepatitis prevention and treatment programmes. In April this year WHO released new guidelines for the screening, care and treatment of people with hepatitis C infection. WHO is now developing new guidelines for the prevention and management of hepatitis B. In addition, on the occasion of World Hepatitis Day, WHO is releasing a new manual for tackling outbreaks of hepatitis E.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO is now working with a broad range of stakeholders, including affected populations, community networks, clinicians, national hepatitis programmes, service providers and donors to implement these guidelines, to expand prevention efforts and to make treatment affordable and accessible to those in need. Already plans are being developed in a number of low- and middle-income countries to rapidly expand access to both hepatitis B and C treatment, while also ensuring that there is adequate investment in proven hepatitis prevention interventions, including hepatitis vaccination programmes, harm reduction for drug users and blood and injection safety.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Increasing access to curative treatment for hepatitis B and C and expanding hepatitis B vaccination, and other prevention strategies, provide real opportunities for us to save lives and prevent suffering,” says Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director, HIV Department, WHO. “We are urging ministries of health to ‘think again’ about hepatitis and develop policies that translate into prevention and life-saving treatments.”</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">For more information, contact:</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Gregory Hartl<br/>\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 4458<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 203 6715<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:hartlg@who.int\">hartlg@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib<br/>\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 3228<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 475 5556<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:chaibf@who.int\">chaibf@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

In many countries they are left out of national HIV plans, and discriminatory laws and policies are major barriers to access. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO today released \"Consolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations\", in the lead-up to the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia, starting on 20 July.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Steps to reduce new HIV infections</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The guidelines outline steps for countries to reduce new HIV infections and increase access to HIV testing, treatment and care for these five ‘key populations’*. They include a comprehensive range of clinical recommendations but, for these to be effective, WHO also recommends countries need to remove the legal and social barriers that prevent many people from accessing services. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>For the first time, WHO strongly recommends men who have sex with men consider taking antiretroviral medicines as an additional method of preventing HIV infection (pre-exposure prophylaxis)** alongside the use of condoms. Rates of HIV infection among men who have sex with men remain high almost everywhere and new prevention options are urgently needed. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Modelling estimates that, globally, 20-25% reductions in HIV incidence among men who have sex with men could be achieved through pre-exposure prophylaxis, averting up to 1 million new infections among this group over 10 years. Studies indicate that women sex workers are 14 times more likely to have HIV than other women, men who have sex with men are 19 times more likely to have HIV than the general population, and transgender women are almost 50 times more likely to have HIV than other adults. For people who inject drugs, studies show the risks of HIV infection can be also 50 times higher than the general population. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“None of these people live in isolation,” says Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of the HIV Department at WHO. “Sex workers and their clients have husbands, wives and partners. Some inject drugs. Many have children. Failure to provide services to the people who are at greatest risk of HIV jeopardizes further progress against the global epidemic and threatens the health and wellbeing of individuals, their families and the broader community.”</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Continued global progress still needed</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The guidelines are published as new figures underline the need for continued global progress on HIV. By the end of 2013, around 13 million people were taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), with 11.7 million of these people living in low- and middle-income countries. This has led to a 20% drop in HIV-related deaths between 2009 and 2012.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>But while the number of people dying of AIDS is falling sharply, preventive efforts are still lagging too far behind, particularly among key populations. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>There are still significant gaps in addressing their needs in national HIV plans. Globally, just 70% of countries surveyed explicitly address the needs of men who have sex with men and sex workers, while the figure for injecting drug users was 40%. Transgender people are rarely mentioned in HIV plans. And even where policies exist on paper, it is hard for people to access services that can help them. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Key populations are less likely to have equal access to HIV treatment. For example, in some settings in Eastern Europe, people who inject drugs make up more than half of all people living with HIV, but only one third of people living with HIV have access to lifesaving ART. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In many countries, discrimination is reinforced by laws that criminalize sexual behaviours, drug use, gender expression or perceived sexual orientation. However where laws and policies support access to HIV services for these key populations, illness and death due to HIV among these groups has declined and new HIV infection rates remain low or have fallen, especially among sex workers and for people who inject drugs.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Bold policies can deliver bold results,” says Dr Rachel Baggaley, from WHO’s HIV Department. “Thailand was one of the first pioneers of programmes to recognise the need to keep sex workers healthy and reduce new HIV infection. Malaysia, Spain and the United Republic of Tanzania have made major advances in providing opioid substitution therapy and needles and syringe programmes for people who inject drugs. Data show that where a combination of effective HIV prevention and treatment services for people who inject drugs are available, HIV transmission among people who inject drugs is minimal.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>These new guidelines outline ‘comprehensive HIV packages’ for prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for the five key populations and address specific issues and needs of adolescents from these groups. These include measures to better manage sexual and reproductive health, mental health and co-infections such as tuberculosis and hepatitis. They highlight the need for needle and syringe and opioid substitution therapy programmes and include recommendations for treatment of overdose in the community.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>At the International AIDS Conference 2014 in Melbourne, WHO will call on governments to re-energize and strengthen HIV programmes so that all key populations benefit from the ongoing advances in HIV treatment and programme scale-up.</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\n<span>*Key populations are defined groups who, due to specific high risk behaviours, are at increased risk of HIV irrespective of the epidemic type or local context. Also, they often have legal and social issues related to their behaviours that increase their vulnerability to HIV. These guidelines focus on five key populations.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>** Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a way for people who do not have HIV, but who are at risk of getting it, to prevent them getting HIV by taking a single pill (usually a combination of two antiretrovirals) every day. PrEP, when taken consistently, has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who are at high risk by up to 92%. PrEP is much less effective if it is not taken consistently.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">For more information, contact:</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Melbourne: <br/>\nGlenn Thomas<br/>\nWHO Communications<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 509 0677<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:thomasg@who.int\">thomasg@who.int</a> </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Geneva: <br/>\nTunga Namjilsuren<br/>\nInformation Manager<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 1073<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:namjilsurent@who.int \">namjilsurent@who.int </a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

Today there are 33* countries and territories where there are fewer than 100 TB cases per million population.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The framework outlines an initial “pre-elimination” phase, aiming to have fewer than 10 new TB cases per million people per year by 2035 in these countries. The goal is to then achieve full elimination of TB by 2050, defined as less than 1 case per million people per year. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Although TB is preventable and curable, in these 33 settings 155 000 people still fall ill each year and 10 000 die. Millions are infected and at risk of falling ill.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The proposed framework builds on approaches that are already proving successful. It was developed with experts from low-burden countries and adapted from the new WHO global TB strategy, 2016-35, approved by the World Health Assembly in May 2014. Country representatives gathered to discuss the framework and its implementation at a meeting co-hosted by WHO and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) in Rome in collaboration with the Italian Ministry of Health.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Italy is one of the 21 European countries addressed by the framework. The 33 countries, territories and areas also include seven from the Americas, three from WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region, and two from WHO’s Western Pacific Region.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The countries recognize the common need to reenergize the efforts to eliminate TB as a public health problem and prevent its resurgence. As TB rates have fallen in many of these countries, attention to this public health threat has waned and capacity to respond could be weakened. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Low TB-burden countries already have the means to drive down TB cases dramatically by 2035,” says Dr Hiroki Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General. “Universal health coverage, which ensures everyone has access to the health services they need without suffering financial hardship as a result, is the bedrock. The key is to target smart TB interventions towards the people who need them most.”</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Key interventions</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The new WHO framework highlights the effectiveness of eight key interventions, in a coherent package for impact in the target countries:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ensure funding and stewardship for planning and services of high quality;</li>\n<li>address most vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups;</li>\n<li>address special needs of migrants; cross-border issues;</li>\n<li>undertake screening for active TB and latent TB infection in high-risk groups and provide appropriate treatment; manage outbreaks;</li>\n<li>optimize MDR-TB prevention and care;</li>\n<li>ensure continued surveillance and programme monitoring and evaluation;</li>\n<li>invest in research and new tools;</li>\n<li>support global TB control.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>Among the most vulnerable groups are people who are poor or homeless, migrants, and members of ethnic minorities. In addition, people who use drugs or are incarcerated, and people with compromised immune systems (e.g. people living with HIV, malnutrition, diabetes, smokers and heavy drinkers) all have a much greater risk of falling ill with TB. Many of these vulnerable groups face barriers in accessing health services.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Cross-border migration</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Addressing tuberculosis in the context of cross-border migration can also pose a significant challenge to health service providers. Many undergoing a course of TB treatment may have no option but to relocate for work, even if they have not completed their TB treatment. “Countries with a low incidence of TB are uniquely positioned to reach historically low levels of TB,” adds Dr Mario Raviglione, Director of WHO’s Global TB Programme. “They can serve as global trailblazers.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Globalization and increased population movements enable TB - an airborne infectious disease - to continue to spread across communities and countries. To eliminate the disease in low-burden countries it will be vital to dramatically scale up TB prevention and care in high-incidence countries. This interdependency calls for concerted action and tight collaboration between countries with high and low burden of TB.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Powerful antibiotics and better living standards have almost pushed the disease out of many high-income countries. But we still have not succeeded. And if we do the wrong things now, TB could rebound, including with more drug-resistant forms,” says Professor G.B. Migliori from ERS. “But if we get it right, and recommit to fighting the disease, both at home and abroad, TB will eventually no longer be a public health threat.” </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">Note to editors:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>In May, the World Health Assembly adopted the WHO’s new global TB strategy for the period 2016-2035, which aims to reduce global TB incidence by 90% and end the global TB epidemic.

While the number of suspected, probable and confirmed cases and deaths changes rapidly, the outbreak is causing concern among health authorities because the deadly disease is being transmitted in communities and in health-care settings, and it has appeared in cities as well as rural and border areas. The disease, which causes severe haemorrhaging and can kill up to 90% of those infected, is spread by direct contact with the blood and body fluids of infected animals or people. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Teams of experts deployed</h3>\n<p>\n<span>WHO, the Global Alert and Response Network (GOARN), and its partners are providing guidance and support and have deployed teams of experts to West African countries and to WHO’s African Regional Office in Brazzaville, Congo.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>These experts include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>epidemiologists to work with the countries in surveillance and monitoring of the outbreak;</li>\n<li>laboratory experts to support mobile field laboratories for early confirmation of Ebola cases;</li>\n<li>clinical management experts to help health facilities treat affected patients;</li>\n<li>infection and prevention control experts to help the countries stop community and health-care facility transmission of the virus;</li>\n<li>logisticians to dispatch needed equipment and materials; and</li>\n<li>social mobilization and risk communications teams to help health officials deliver appropriate messages about how to report, handle, and treat Ebola cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">WHO to convene regional experts for comprehensive operational response</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Recognizing that a coordinated regional response is essential, WHO is convening the leading health authorities from the affected and nearby countries in Accra, Ghana on July 2–3, to agree on a comprehensive operational response to control the Ebola outbreak.

The Committee focused attention on the need to further analyse the hospital outbreaks to better understand where breaches in infection prevention and control are taking place, including where patients who have not yet received a diagnosis gather and wait, often under crowded conditions, such as in emergency departments and clinics. The Committee also noted that recent investigative findings increasingly support the hypothesis that camels are an important source of exposure to MERS-CoV in the community. </span></p><p><span>The Committee reiterated that its previous advice remains relevant, and that all countries should: </span></p><ul><li>strengthen efforts to implement basic infection prevention and control measures, and increase education on these measures, especially among health care workers; </li><li>continue efforts to complete critical investigations as soon as possible, including case-control, serological, environmental, and animal studies, to better understand the epidemiology, especially risk factors; and to assess where breakdowns in infection prevention and control measures are occurring , and to share preliminary findings;</li><li>support strengthening capacities in vulnerable countries, especially those in Africa, and that these countries, and particularly those in Africa, should take concrete action in anticipation of Umra, Ramadan and Hajj with respect to basic public health actions such as conducting surveillance for MER CoV, raising awareness about and implementing basic infection prevention and control measures; </li><li>improve awareness about MERS CoV among the pilgrims who are planning to go for Umra and Hajj, especially for those with chronic illness, and for accompanying medical delegations to be made aware of how to detect MERS, and personal hygiene and basic infection control precautions;</li><li>continue to enhance awareness through effective risk communication concerning MERS-CoV to the general public, health professionals, and policy makers;</li><li>strengthen intersectoral collaboration and joint activities between animal and human health sectors; </li><li>share with WHO all relevant information needed to assess and manage MERS, in a timely manner, as required by the International Health Regulations (2005); and</li><li>use WHO recommendations, including for groups at higher risk of infection with MERS-CoV:</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/publications/i/item/10665-271410\">WHO travel advice on MERS-CoV for pilgrimages</a>\n</li><li><a class=\"link_media\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" data-sf-marked=\"\" href=\"/news/item/26-01-2018-update-on-mers-cov-transmission-from-animals-to-humans-and-interim-recommendations-for-at-risk-groups\">Update on MERS-CoV transmission from animals to humans, and interim recommendations for at-risk group</a>\n</li><li><a class=\"link_media\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" data-sf-marked=\"\" href=\"/publications/m/item/assesmment-of-potential-risk-mers-infection-among-health-care-personnel-in-a-health-care-setting-2019\">Assessment of potential risk factors of infection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among health care personnel in a health care setting</a>\n</li><li><a class=\"link_media\" href=\"/publications/i/item/10665-177869\">Interim surveillance recommendations for human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus</a>\n</li></ul><p><span>Finally, the Committee indicated that there was no solid information to support the use of thermal screening as a means to stop or slow the entry of MERS-CoV infections, and that resources for supporting such screening could be better used to strengthen surveillance, infection control and prevention or other effective public health measures.</span></p><p><span>Based on the Committee’s advice, and information currently available, the Director-General accepted the Committee’s assessment.

The report recommends new strategies to address these deficits and save millions of lives of women and newborns.</span></p>\n<div class=\"blockquote-container\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This report, like the Every Newborn Action Plan recently adopted by the World Health Assembly, sets a\nclear way forward. Both aim to encourage governments to allocate adequate resources for maternal and newborn health services within national health sector plans.\"</p>\n<p class=\"source\">\nDr. Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General for Family, Women's and Children's Health\n</p>\n</blockquote> </div>\n<p>\n<span>The 73 African, Asian and Latin American countries represented in the \"State of the World’s Midwifery\n2014: A Universal Pathway – A Woman’s Right to Health\" suffer 96% of the global burden of\nmaternal deaths, 91% of stillbirths and 93% of newborn deaths, but have only 42%\nof the world’s midwives, nurses and doctors. The report urges countries to invest in midwifery education and training to contribute to closing the glaring gaps that exist. Investments in midwifery education and training at agreed international standards can yield – as a study from Bangladesh shows – a 1600% return on investment.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Midwives make enormous contributions to the health of mothers and newborns and the well-being of\nentire communities. Access to quality health care is a basic human right. Greater investment in midwifery is key to making this right a reality for women everywhere,\" said Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, UNFPA Executive Director.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Midwives have a crucial role to play in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 (decrease child death) and 5 (increase maternal health). When educated to international standards and within a fully functional health system, they can provide about 90% of the essential care to women and newborns and can potentially reduce maternal and newborn deaths by two thirds. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Despite a steady decline in maternal deaths in the 73 countries that are covered in the report – dropping yearly by 3% since 1990 – and newborn deaths – decreasing by 1.9% per year since 1990 – there is more these countries need to do to address the severe shortage of midwifery care.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Midwives are central to midwifery care and the lives of women and newborn babies. The report\nprecedes the Lancet Special Series on Midwifery, which together with the report will provide the evidence to guide all policy-makers in their quest to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths,” said ICM President Frances Day-Stirk.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The report, launched at the 30th ICM Triennial Congress in Prague, Czech Republic highlights the\nprogress made since the inaugural 2011 report and solutions to the barriers outlined in four key areas: availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of midwifery services: A number of countries have\neffectively strengthened midwifery and improved access: Nearly half (45%) of the 73 countries have implemented measures to retain midwives in remote areas and 28% are increasing the recruitment and deployment of midwives, while 20% have implemented new codes of practice and 71% have improved information collection enabling countries to address shortages and education standards.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Despite progress, inequities such as lack of access to services and poverty have increased within and\namong countries. There are still not enough adequately educated midwives to support the health of women and newborns, and this contributes to hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths annually. Today, only 22% of countries have potentially enough midwives to provide life-saving interventions to meet the needs of women and newborns, which leaves over three-fourths (78%) of the countries with severe shortages in proper care. As the population grows, so does the gap in critical resources and infrastructure, unless urgent action is taken.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The 2014 report includes recommendations to close these gaps and to ensure all women have access to sexual, reproductive, maternal and newborn services. These include issues such as preventive and supportive care from a collaborative midwifery team, immediate access to emergency services when needed, and completing post-secondary education. From a broader perspective, women should delay marriage, have access to healthy nutrition and receive four pre-birth care visits.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“This report, like the Every Newborn Action Plan recently adopted by the World Health Assembly, sets a\nclear way forward. Both aim to encourage governments to allocate adequate resources for maternal and newborn health services within national health sector plans. This should include funds for the education and retention of midwives. We will continue to support countries to develop and strengthen their midwifery services as a critical intervention to save the lives of women and newborns,” said Dr. Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General for Family, Women's and Children's Health.</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">For more information, contact:</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib<br/>\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 475 55 56<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 32 28<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:chaibf@who.int\">chaibf@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Lothar Mikulla<br/>UNFPA<br/>Telephone: + 1 212 297 2629 (New York), +420 604 76 21 81 (Prague)<br/>Email:<a href=\"mailto:mikulla@unfpa.org\">mikulla@unfpa.org</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

Based on 2012 data, WHO estimates that by increasing tobacco taxes by 50%, all countries would reduce the number of smokers by 49 million within the next 3 years and ultimately save 11 million lives.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Today, every 6 seconds someone dies from tobacco use. Tobacco kills up to half of its users. It also incurs considerable costs for families, businesses and governments. Treating tobacco-related diseases like cancer and heart disease is expensive. And as tobacco-related disease and death often strikes people in the prime of their working lives, productivity and incomes fall. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Raising taxes on tobacco is the most effective way to reduce use and save lives,” says WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan. “Determined action on tobacco tax policy hits the industry where it hurts.”</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">The young and poor people benefit most</h3>\n<p>\n<span>High prices are particularly effective in discouraging young people (who often have more limited incomes than older adults) from taking up smoking. They also encourage existing young smokers to either reduce their use of tobacco or quit altogether.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Price increases are 2 to 3 times more effective in reducing tobacco use among young people than among older adults,” says Dr Douglas Bettcher, Director of the Department for Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases at WHO. “Tax policy can be divisive, but this is the tax rise everyone can support. As tobacco taxes go up, death and disease go down.” </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Good for economies too </h3>\n<p>\n<span>WHO calculates that if all countries increased tobacco taxes by 50% per pack, governments would earn an extra US$ 101 billion in global revenue.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“These additional funds could – and should – be used to advance health and other social programmes,” adds Dr Bettcher.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Countries such as France and the Philippines have already seen the benefits of imposing high taxes on tobacco. Between the early 1990s and 2005, France tripled its inflation-adjusted cigarette prices. This was followed by sales falling by more than 50%. A few years later the number of young men dying from lung cancer in France started to go down. In the Philippines, one year after increasing taxes, the Government has collected more than the expected revenue and plans to spend 85% of this on health services.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Tobacco taxes are a core element of tobacco control</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Tobacco use is the world’s leading preventable cause of death. Tobacco kills nearly 6 million people each year, of which more than 600 000 are non-smokers dying from breathing second-hand smoke. If no action is taken, tobacco will kill more than 8 million people every year by 2030, more than 80% of them among people living in low- and middle-income countries.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Raising taxes on tobacco in support of the reduction of tobacco consumption is a core element of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), an international treaty that entered into force in 2005 and has been endorsed by 178 Parties. Article 6 of the WHO FCTC, Price and Tax Measures to Reduce the Demand for Tobacco, recognizes that “price and tax measures are an effective and important means of reducing tobacco consumption by various segments of the population, in particular young persons”.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Editor’s note</h3>\n<p>\n<span>In September 2011, world leaders adopted a UN Political Declaration on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) at the United Nations General Assembly and committed themselves to accelerate implementation of the WHO FCTC. WHO was requested to complete a number of global assignments that would accelerate national efforts to address NCDs.\r\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Since then a global agenda has been set, based on 9 concrete global NCD targets for 2025 organized around the WHO Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013-2020. The plan comprises a set of actions which, when performed collectively by Member States, UN agencies and WHO, will help to achieve a global target of a 25% reduction in premature mortality from NCDs by 2025 and a 30% reduction in the prevalence of tobacco use. The WHO Global action plan indicates that the reduction of affordability of tobacco products by increasing tobacco taxes is a very cost-effective and affordable intervention for all Member States.\r\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The United Nations will hold a comprehensive review on the prevention and control of NCDs 10-11 July 2014 in New York. The review will provide a timely opportunity for rallying political support for the acceleration of actions by governments, international partners and WHO, included in the WHO global action plan – including raising tobacco taxes.</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">For more information, contact:</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Helena Humphrey<br/>\r\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\r\nTelephone: +41 22 791 39 10<br/>\r\nMobile: +41 79 514 15 26<br/>\r\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:humphreyh@who.int\">humphreyh@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib<br/>\r\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\r\nMobile: +41 79 475 55 56<br/>\r\nTelephone: +41 22 791 32 28<br/>\r\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:chaibf@who.int\">chaibf@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

This requires sharing information on the extent of resistance and the use of antibiotics in humans and animals. It also involves improving awareness among health providers and the public of the threat posed by resistance, the need for responsible use of antibiotics, and the importance of good hand hygiene and other measures to prevent infections.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The resolution urges Member States to strengthen drug management systems, to support research to extend the lifespan of existing drugs, and to encourage the development of new diagnostics and treatment options.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>As requested in the resolution, WHO will develop a draft global action plan to combat antimicrobial resistance, including antibiotic resistance for presentation to the World Health Assembly for approval next year.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005) </h3>\n<p>\n<span>Yellow fever is a disease specified in the International Health Regulations (2005) for which countries may require proof of vaccination from travellers as a condition of entry under certain circumstances, and may take certain measures if an arriving traveller does not have this certificate in his possession.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Health Assembly adopted revised provisions on yellow fever vaccination or revaccination under the International Health Regulations (2005). These include extending the validity of a certificate of vaccination against yellow fever from 10 years to the extent of the life of the vaccinated person. The revised provisions are based on the recommendations of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization following its scientific review and analysis of evidence.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Member States reaffirmed their strong and continuous commitment to the implementation of International Health Regulations (2005).</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Public health impacts of exposure to mercury and mercury compounds: the role of WHO and ministries of public health in the implementation of the Minamata Convention </h3>\n<p>\n<span>The World Health Assembly requested the WHO Secretariat provide expert advice to help health ministries implement the Minamata Convention on Mercury. Most mercury is released as a result of human activity, such as burning coal and waste and mining for mercury, gold and other metals. WHO considers mercury one of the top ten chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health concern.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The 2013 Minamata Convention aims to “protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds”. The legally binding convention will enter into force when 50 countries have ratified it. It encourages countries to identify and better protect people who are at particular risk from mercury and highlights the need to provide effective health services for everyone who has been affected by exposed to mercury.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Addressing the global challenge of violence, in particular against women and girls </h3>\n<p>\n<span>Across the world, each year, nearly 1.4 million people lose their lives to violence. Women and girls experience specific forms of violence that are often hidden. Globally, 1 in 3 women experience physical and/or sexual violence at least once in her life. For every person who dies as a result of violence, many more are injured and suffer from a range of adverse physical and mental health outcomes.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Member States will work to strengthen the role of the health system in addressing violence. WHO will develop a global plan of action to strengthen the role of national health systems within a multi-sectoral response to address interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Follow up of the Recife Political Declaration on Human Resources for Health: renewed commitments towards universal health coverage</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The Recife Political Declaration was formulated and adopted by participants of the Third Global Forum on Human Resources for Health, in November 2013. Rooted in the right to health approach, the Recife Declaration recognizes the centrality of human resources for health in the drive towards universal health coverage. It commits governments to creating the conditions for the inclusive development of a shared vision with other stakeholders and reaffirms the role of the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel as a guide for action to strengthen the health workforce and health systems.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Follow-up of the report of the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development: Financing and Coordination </h3>\n<p>\n<span>The Heath Assembly approved a resolution that significantly advances the quest for innovative, sustainable solutions for financing and coordinating health research and development (R&amp;D) for diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries. The decision provides a firm go-ahead on the implementation of innovative health R&amp;D demonstration projects. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>By virtue of this decision, WHO will take the first steps to establish at the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) a pooled fund for voluntary contributions towards R&amp;D for diseases of the poor. WHO Member States have emphasised the importance of inclusive coordination of these new developments. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Access to essential medicines </h3>\n<p>\n<span>WHO’s strategy to help countries improve access to essential medicines was approved. Key principles include selecting a limited range of medicines on the basis of the best evidence available, efficient procurement, affordable prices, effective distribution systems, and rational use. The WHO Essential medicines list was recognized as a valuable tool that enables countries to identify a core set of medicines which need to be available to provide quality medical care. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Regulatory system strengthening </h3>\n<p>\n<span>Effective medicines regulation ensures that medicines and medical products are of the required quality, safety and efficacy; medicines are appropriately manufactured, stored, distributed and dispensed; illegal manufacturing and trade is controlled and prevented; health professionals and patients have the necessary information to enable them to use medicines rationally; promotion and advertising is regulated and fair; and access to medicines is not hindered by unjustified regulatory work.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In order to improve the regulation of medical products globally and ensure that medical products are of assured quality, more emphasis needs to be placed on regulatory strengthening, and promoting collaboration in regulatory systems. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The WHA mandated WHO, in cooperation with national regulators, to continue its important role globally in medicines regulation through establishing necessary norms and standards, supporting regulatory capacity-building and strengthening safety monitoring programmes. Through its Prequalification programme, WHO is requested to continue to ensures the quality, safety and efficacy of selected priority essential medicines, diagnostics and vaccines. A new development endorsed by Member States is the future progressive transition of prequalification to networks of strengthened regulatory authorities.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Health intervention and technology assessment in support of universal health coverage </h3>\n<p>\n<span>Many countries currently lack the capacity to assess the merits of health technology. Health technology assessment (HTA) involves systematically evaluating the properties, effects, and/or impacts of different health technologies. Its main purpose is to inform technology-related policy-making in health care, and thus improve the uptake of cost-effective new technologies and prevent the uptake of technologies that are of doubtful value for the health system. Wasteful spending on medicines and other technologies has been identified as a major cause of inefficiencies in health service delivery. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Following the adoption of a resolution on HTA at the Health Assembly, WHO will support capacity-building for health technology assessment in countries. It will provide tools and guidance to prioritize health technologies and intensify networking and information exchange among countries to support priority setting. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Health in the post-2015 development agenda </h3>\n<p>\n<span>Member States approved a resolution on health in the post-2015 development agenda, stressing the need for ongoing engagement in the process of setting the agenda. This includes a need to complete the unfinished work of the health Millennium Development Goals, newborn health, as well as an increased focus on noncommunicable diseases, mental health and neglected tropical diseases. The resolution also stresses the importance of universal health coverage and the need to strengthen health systems. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Accountability through regular assessment of progress by strengthening civil registration, vital statistics and health information systems are crucial. Member States emphasized the importance of having health at the core of the post-2015 development agenda.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Newborn health: draft action plan </h3>\n<p>\n<span>The first-ever global plan to end preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths by 2035 calls for all countries to aim for fewer than 10 newborn deaths per 1000 live births and less than 10 stillbirths per 1000 total births by 2035.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Every year almost 3 million babies die in the first month of life and 2.6 million babies are stillborn (die in the last 3 months of pregnancy or during childbirth). Most of these deaths could be prevented by cost-effective interventions.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Plan’s goals will require every country to invest in high-quality care before, during and after childbirth for every pregnant woman and newborn and highlights the urgent need to record all births and deaths. </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib<br/>\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 475 5556<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 3228<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:chaibf@who.int\">chaibf@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Glenn Thomas <br/>\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 509 0677<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 3983<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:thomasg@who.int\">thomasg@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Tarik Jasarevic<br/>\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 50 99<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 367 62 14<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:jasarevict@who.int\">jasarevict@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

Traditional medicine covers a wide variety of therapies and practices which vary from country to country and region to region. The strategy aims to build the knowledge base for national policies and strengthen quality assurance, safety, proper use and effectiveness of traditional and complementary medicine through regulation. It also aims to promote universal health coverage by integrating traditional and complementary medicine services into health care service delivery and home care.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Disability action plan</h3>\n<p>\n<span>A new WHO global disability action plan 2014–2021 aims to improve the health and quality of life of the one billion people around the world with disabilities by improving their access to health care and creating new and strengthening existing services and technologies that help them acquire or restore skills and functions. It also aims to strengthen data and research. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>People with disabilities have the same general health care needs as others, but are three times more likely to be denied health care and four times more likely to be treated badly in health facilities. One in seven people worldwide has a disability. As people live longer and chronic diseases increase, more people are likely to develop disabilities. Road traffic crashes, falls, violence, natural disasters and conflict, unhealthy diet and substance abuse can also lead to disability.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Autism spectrum disorders</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The Health Assembly urged Member States to include the needs of individuals affected by autism spectrum and other developmental disorders in policies and programmes related to child and adolescent health and development and mental health. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>This means increasing the capacity of health and social care systems to provide services for individuals with autism spectrum disorders and for their families and shifting the focus of care from long-stay health facilities towards non-residential services in the community. It also means improving health surveillance systems to capture data on autism spectrum disorders and ensuring countries are better able to diagnose and treat autism spectrum disorders. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The resolution highlights the need for the WHO Secretariat to help strengthen countries’ capacities to address autism spectrum and other developmental disorders; facilitate resource mobilization; engage with autism-related networks; and monitor progress. All efforts will be conducted in alignment with the WHO Mental health action plan 2013–2020. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Autism spectrum disorders comprise a range of development disorders which include autism, childhood disintegrative disorder and Asperger syndrome. Worldwide, most people with autism spectrum disorders and their families do not receive any care from health and social care systems.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Psoriasis</h3>\n<p>\n<span>A resolution on psoriasis encourages Member States to raise awareness about the disease and to advocate against the stigma experienced by so many people who suffer from it. It requests the WHO Secretariat to draw attention to the public health impact of psoriasis and publish a global report on the disease, emphasizing the need for greater research and identifying successful strategies for integrating the management of psoriasis into existing services for noncommunicable diseases by the end of 2015.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by scaly, red skin lesions. People with psoriasis have relatively higher risks of heart disease, stroke, hypertension and diabetes. Studies have documented higher rates of depression and anxiety compared with the general population.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Strengthening palliative care as a component of comprehensive care</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Today’s resolution emphasizes that the need for palliative care services will continue to grow – partly because of the rising prevalence of noncommunicable diseases and the ageing of populations everywhere. The WHO global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020, endorsed by the Health Assembly in May 2013, includes palliative care among the policy options proposed to Member States and in its global monitoring framework. </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information, contact:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib<br/>\r\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\r\nMobile: +41 79 475 5556<br/>\r\nTelephone: +41 22 791 3228<br/>\r\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:chaibf@who.int\">chaibf@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Glenn Thomas <br/>\r\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\r\nMobile: +41 79 509 0677<br/>\r\nTelephone: +41 22 791 3983<br/>\r\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:thomasg@who.int\">thomasg@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Tarik Jasarevic<br/>\r\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\r\nTelephone: +41 22 791 50 99<br/>\r\nMobile: +41 79 367 62 14<br/>\r\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:jasarevict@who.int\">jasarevict@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

A former gynaecologist, she noted the lasting damage such violence can inflict on mental and physical health: “Almost all gender-based violence victims fall on the doorstep of the health sector.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>She stressed that the health sector has a responsibility to address the causes and consequences of violence. She called on delegates to ensure that everyone affected by violence has timely, effective and affordable access to all the health services they require, and that those services are free of abuse, disrespect and discrimination.\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Ms Gates then highlighted ways to improve the health of mothers and newborn babies, emphasizing the value of linking efforts to improve reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health – “the continuum of care”.\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>She pointed out that: “If women can plan their families, they are more likely to space their pregnancies. If they space their pregnancies, they are more likely to have healthy babies. If babies are healthy, they are more likely to flourish as children. When mothers have healthy pregnancies, and when children thrive, the positive benefits last a lifetime.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>She also called on delegates to pay more attention to newborn babies. Although there has been remarkable global progress in reducing the number of children dying before their fifth birthday, neonatal mortality rates have declined at a slower pace. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The Health Assembly will discuss a new action plan for newborns later this week. Ms Gates and other panelists at today’s technical briefing discussed quality of care around childbirth, and its potential to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths and stillbirths, generating a “triple return on investment”.</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information, contact:</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Glenn Thomas <br/>\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 509 0677<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 3983<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:thomasg@who.int\">thomasg@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Fadéla Chaib<br/>\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 475 5556<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 3228<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:chaibf@who.int\">chaibf@who.int</a></span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Tarik Jasarevic<br/>\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 50 99<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 367 62 14<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:jasarevict@who.int\">jasarevict@who.int</a>\n</span></p>\n<div></div>",

Five vice-presidents were also appointed from Bahrain, Congo, Fiji, Lithuania, and Sri Lanka, representing their respective regions. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>In her opening address to the Health Assembly, WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan voiced her deep concern about the increase worldwide of childhood obesity, with numbers climbing fastest in developing countries. “As the 2014 World Health Statistics report bluntly states, ‘Our children are getting fatter’,” she said.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>To gather the best possible advice on dealing with this crisis, Dr Chan announced that she has established a high-level Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity. The Commission - co-chaired by Sir Peter Gluckman, Chief Science Advisor to New Zealand’s Prime Minister, and Dr Sania Nishtar, founder of Pakistan’s health policy think tank, Heartfile – will produce a consensus report specifying which approaches are likely to be most effective in different contexts around the world. The recommendations of the report will be announced at next year’s Health Assembly.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Dr Chan challenged the Health Assembly to consider the potential impact on health worldwide of the changing poverty map – with 70% of the world’s poor living in middle-income countries with emerging economies. “Will economic growth be accompanied by a proportionate increase in domestic budgets for health? Will countries put polices in place to ensure that benefits are fairly shared?” she asked. “If not, the world will see a growing number of rich countries full of poor people.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>She also alerted delegates to the importance of addressing climate change: “In March, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its most dismal report to date, with a strong focus on the consequences for health.” Many delegates focused on the links between climate and health in the Health Assembly’s opening plenary debate, particularly the impact of climate on important social and environmental determinants of health – clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">New global strategy and targets for tuberculosis</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The first meeting of Committee A then opened with a discussion on communicable diseases.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Member States approved a resolution endorsing a new global strategy and targets for tuberculosis (TB) prevention, care and control after 2015.

Based on global averages, a girl who was born in 2012 can expect to live to around 73 years, and a boy to the age of 68. This is six years longer than the average global life expectancy for a child born in 1990. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO’s annual statistics report shows that low-income countries have made the greatest progress, with an average increase in life expectancy by 9 years from 1990 to 2012. The top six countries where life expectancy increased the most were Liberia which saw a 20-year increase (from 42 years in 1990 to 62 years in 2012) followed by Ethiopia (from 45 to 64 years), Maldives (58 to 77 years), Cambodia (54 to 72 years), Timor-Leste (50 to 66 years) and Rwanda (48 to 65 years).</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“An important reason why global life expectancy has improved so much is that fewer children are dying before their fifth birthday,” says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. “But there is still a major rich-poor divide: people in high-income countries continue to have a much better chance of living longer than people in low-income countries.”</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Gaps between rich and poor countries</h3>\n<p>\n<span>A boy born in 2012 in a high-income country can expect to live to the age of around 76 – 16 years longer than a boy born in a low-income country (age 60). For girls, the difference is even wider; a gap of 19 years separates life expectancy in high-income (82 years) and low-income countries (63 years).</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Wherever they live in the world, women live longer than men. The gap between male and female life expectancy is greater in high-income countries where women live around six years longer than men. In low-income countries, the difference is around three years.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Women in Japan have the longest life expectancy in the world at 87 years, followed by Spain, Switzerland and Singapore. Female life expectancy in all the top 10 countries was 84 years or longer. Life expectancy among men is 80 years or more in nine countries, with the longest male life expectancy in Iceland, Switzerland and Australia.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“In high-income countries, much of the gain in life expectancy is due to success in tackling noncommunicable diseases,” says Dr Ties Boerma, Director of the Department of Health Statistics and Information Systems at WHO. “Fewer men and women are dying before they get to their 60th birthday from heart disease and stroke. Richer countries have become better at monitoring and managing high blood pressure for example.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Declining tobacco use is also a key factor in helping people live longer in several countries.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>At the other end of the scale, life expectancy for both men and women is still less than 55 years in nine sub-Saharan African countries – Angola, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Mozambique, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.</span></p>\n<h5 class=\"section_head3\">Life expectancy at birth among men and women in 2012 in the 10 top-ranked countries*</h5>\n<br/>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\"></td>\n<td class=\"CenterAlign\">Men</td>\n<td class=\"CenterAlign\"></td>\n<td class=\"CenterAlign\"></td>\n<td class=\"CenterAlign\">Women</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\"></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody> <tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">Rank</td>\n<td>Country</td>\n<td>Life expectancy</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">Rank</td>\n<td>Country</td>\n<td>Life expectancy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\"></td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\"></td>\n<td class=\"CenterAlign\" colspan=\"2\"></td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\"></td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">1</td>\n<td>Iceland</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">81.2</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">1</td>\n<td>Japan</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">87</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">2</td>\n<td>Switzerland</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">80.7</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">2</td>\n<td>Spain</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">85.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">3</td>\n<td>Australia</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">80.5</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">3</td>\n<td>Switzerland</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">85.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">4</td>\n<td>Israel</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">80.2</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">4</td>\n<td>Singapore</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">85.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">5</td>\n<td>Singapore</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">80.2</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">5</td>\n<td>Italy</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">85</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">6</td>\n<td>New Zealand</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">80.2</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">6</td>\n<td>France</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">84.9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">7</td>\n<td>Italy</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">80.2</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">7</td>\n<td>Australia</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">84.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">8</td>\n<td>Japan</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">80</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">8</td>\n<td>Republic of Korea</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">84.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">9</td>\n<td>Sweden</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">80</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">9</td>\n<td>Luxembourg</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">84.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">10</td>\n<td>Luxembourg</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">79.7</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">10</td>\n<td>Portugal</td>\n<td class=\"RightAlign\">84</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n<span>* Countries with a population below 250 000 are omitted due to uncertainty in life-expectancy estimates.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Some other key facts from \"World Health Statistics 2014\"</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The top three causes of years of life lost due to premature death are coronary heart disease, lower respiratory infections (such as pneumonia) and stroke. </li>\n<li>Worldwide, a major shift is occurring in the causes and ages of death.

The top 3 causes of adolescent deaths globally are road traffic injuries, HIV/AIDS, and suicide. Worldwide, an estimated 1.3 million adolescents died in 2012.</span></p>\n<div class=\"blockquote-container\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We hope this report will focus high-level attention on the health needs of 10 to 19-year-olds and serve as a springboard for accelerated action on adolescent health.”</p>\n<p class=\"source\">\nDr Flavia Bustreo, Assistant Director-General for Family, Women and Children’s Health, WHO\n</p>\n</blockquote> </div>\n<p>\n<span>Drawing on a wealth of published evidence and consultations with 10 to 19-year-olds around the world, the report also brings together, for the first time, all WHO guidance on the full spectrum of health issues affecting adolescents. These include tobacco, alcohol and drug use, HIV, injuries, mental health, nutrition, sexual and reproductive health, and violence. The report recommends key actions to strengthen the ways countries respond to adolescents’ physical and mental health needs.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“The world has not paid enough attention to the health of adolescents,” says Dr Flavia Bustreo, Assistant Director-General for Family, Women and Children’s Health, WHO. “We hope this report will focus high-level attention on the health needs of 10 to 19-year-olds and serve as a springboard for accelerated action on adolescent health.”</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Road traffic injuries top cause of death</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Road traffic injuries are the number 1 cause of adolescent deaths globally, and the number 2 cause of illness and disability. Boys are disproportionately affected, with more than three times the rate of deaths than that of girls. Increasing access to reliable and safe public transport can reduce road traffic injuries among adolescents. Road safety regulations (e.g. alcohol and speed limits), establishing safe pedestrian areas around schools, and graduated licensing schemes where drivers privileges are phased in over time, can all reduce risks.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Mental health problems take a big toll</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Globally, depression is the number 1 cause of illness and disability in this age group, and suicide ranks number 3 among causes of death. Some studies show that half of all people who develop mental disorders have their first symptoms by the age of 14. If adolescents with mental health problems get the care they need, this can prevent deaths and avoid suffering throughout life.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Pregnancy and childbirth-related deaths have fallen</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Deaths due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth among adolescents have dropped significantly since 2000, particularly in regions where maternal mortality rates are highest. WHO’s South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean and African Regions have seen estimated declines of 57%, 50% and 37%, respectively. Despite these improvements, maternal mortality still ranks second among causes of death among 15 to 19-year-old girls globally, exceeded only by suicide.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Deaths due to HIV rising</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Estimates suggest that the number of HIV-related deaths among adolescents is rising. The increase is predominantly in the African Region, at a time when HIV-related deaths are decreasing in all other population groups. HIV now ranks as the second cause of deaths in adolescents globally.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Some other infectious diseases still major causes of death</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Thanks to childhood vaccination, adolescent deaths and disability from measles have fallen markedly—by 90% in the African Region between 2000 and 2012. However, common infectious diseases that have been a focus for action in young children are still killing adolescents. For example, diarrhoea and lower respiratory tract infections now rank second and fourth among causes of death in 10 to 14-year-olds. Combined with meningitis, these conditions account for 18% of all deaths in this age group, little changed from 19% in 2000.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">New data on adolescent health behaviours</h3>\n<p>\n<span>New data from countries where surveys have been done show that fewer than 1 in every 4 adolescents does enough exercise (WHO recommends at least one hour of moderate to vigorous exercise per day), and in some countries as many as 1 in 3 is obese.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>But some trends in adolescent health-related behaviours are improving. For example, rates of cigarette smoking are decreasing among younger adolescents in most high-income countries and in some middle- and low-income countries as well.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Critical period for preventing chronic disease</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Adolescence is an important time for laying the foundations of good health in adulthood. Many health-related behaviours and conditions that underlie the major noncommunicable diseases start or are reinforced during this period of life.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“If left unchecked, health problems and behaviours that arise during adolescence—such as tobacco and alcohol use, diet and exercise patterns, overweight and obesity—have a serious impact on the health and development of adolescents today, and potentially devastating effects on their health as adults tomorrow,” says Jane Ferguson, Scientist in WHO’s Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and lead author of the report. “At the same time, we must not let up on efforts to promote and safeguard the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents, including HIV.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Health policies from 109 countries were reviewed for this report. Among them, 84% give some attention to adolescents. In three-quarters, the focus is on sexual and reproductive health (including HIV/AIDS); approximately one-third address tobacco and alcohol use among adolescents; and one-quarter address mental health. The report highlights the need for more countries to follow the example of countries like India whose new adolescent health strategy addresses a broader spectrum of health issues affecting adolescents, including mental health, nutrition, substance use, violence, and noncommunicable diseases, in addition to sexual and reproductive health.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The report also emphasizes the need for improved data and information about adolescents’ health and the programmes that address it.</span></p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"subcol_1-1_1\">\n<div class=\"box\">\n<h3 class=\"box_title\">Top causes of deaths in adolescents</h3>\n<div class=\"teaser\">\n<ul class=\"decimal\">\n<li>Road traffic injuries</li>\n<li>HIV/AIDS</li>\n<li>Suicide</li>\n<li>Lower respiratory infections</li>\n<li>Violence</li>\n<li>Diarrhoea</li>\n<li>Drowning</li>\n<li>Meningitis</li>\n<li>Epilepsy</li>\n<li>Endocrine, blood, immune disorders</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"subcol_1-1_2\">\n<div class=\"box\">\n<h3 class=\"box_title\">Top causes of illness and disability</h3>\n<div class=\"teaser\">\n<ul class=\"decimal\">\n<li>\tDepression</li>\n<li>\tRoad traffic injuries</li>\n<li>\tAnaemia</li>\n<li>\tHIV/AIDS</li>\n<li>\tSelf-harm</li>\n<li>\tBack and neck pain</li>\n<li>\tDiarrhoea</li>\n<li>\tAnxiety disorders</li>\n<li>\tAsthma</li>\n<li>\tLower respiratory infections\n    </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information, contact</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Glenn Thomas <br/>\nWHO Department of Communications<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 509 0677<br/>\nTelephone.: +41 22 791 3983<br/>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:thomasg@who.int\">thomasg@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div> </div>",

Alcohol consumption can not only lead to dependence but also increases people’s risk of developing more than 200 diseases including liver cirrhosis and some cancers. In addition, harmful drinking can lead to violence and injuries.</p><p>The report also finds that harmful use of alcohol makes people more susceptible to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia.</p><p>The \"Global status report on alcohol and health 2014\" provides country profiles for alcohol consumption in the 194 WHO Member States, the impact on public health and policy responses.</p><p>“More needs to be done to protect populations from the negative health consequences of alcohol consumption,” says Dr Oleg Chestnov, WHO Assistant Director-General for Noncommunicable Diseases and Mental Health. “The report clearly shows that there is no room for complacency when it comes to reducing the harmful use of alcohol.”</p><p>Some countries are already strengthening measures to protect people. These include increasing taxes on alcohol, limiting the availability of alcohol by raising the age limit, and regulating the marketing of alcoholic beverages.</p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Report highlights</h3><p>The report also highlights the need for action by countries including:</p><ul><li>national leadership to develop policies to reduce harmful use of alcohol (66 WHO Member States had written national alcohol policies in 2012);</li><li>national awareness-raising activities (nearly 140 countries reported at least one such activity in the past three years);</li><li>health services to deliver prevention and treatment services, in particular increasing prevention, treatment and care for patients and their families, and supporting initiatives for screening and brief interventions.</li></ul><p>In addition the report shows the need for communities to be engaged in reducing harmful use of alcohol.</p><p>On average every person in the world aged 15 years or older drinks 6.2 litres of pure alcohol per year. But as less than half the population (38.3%) actually drinks alcohol, this means that those who do drink consume on average 17 litres of pure alcohol annually. </p><p>The report also points to the fact that a higher percentage of deaths among men than among women are from alcohol-related causes - 7.6% of men’s deaths and 4% of women’s deaths – though there is evidence that women may be more vulnerable to some alcohol-related health conditions compared to men. In addition, the authors note that there is concern over the steady increase in alcohol use among women.</p><p>“We found that worldwide about 16% of drinkers engage in heavy episodic drinking - often referred to as ‘binge-drinking’ - which is the most harmful to health,” explains Dr Shekhar Saxena, Director for Mental Health and Substance Abuse at WHO. \"Lower-income groups are more affected by the social and health consequences of alcohol. They often lack quality health care and are less protected by functional family or community networks.”</p><p>Globally, Europe is the region with the highest consumption of alcohol per capita, with some of its countries having particularly high consumption rates. Trend analysis shows that the consumption level is stable over the last 5 years in the region, as well as in Africa and the Americas, though increases have been reported in the South-East Asia and the Western Pacific regions.</p><p>Through a global network, WHO is supporting countries in their development and implementation of policies to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The need for intensified action was endorsed in the landmark 2011 United Nations General Assembly meeting, which identified alcohol as one of four common risk factors* contributing to the non-communicable diseases (NCDs) epidemic. </p><h4 class=\"section_head2\"> </h4><p></p><div> </div>",

About half of the urban population being monitored is exposed to air pollution that is at least 2.5 times higher than the levels WHO recommends - putting those people at additional risk of serious, long-term health problems. </span></p><p><span>In most cities where there is enough data to compare the situation today with previous years, air pollution is getting worse. Many factors contribute to this increase, including reliance on fossil fuels such as coal fired power plants, dependence on private transport motor vehicles, inefficient use of energy in buildings, and the use of biomass for cooking and heating. </span></p><p><span>But some cities are making notable improvements - demonstrating that air quality can be improved by implementing policy measures such as banning the use of coal for “space heating” in buildings, using renewable or “clean” fuels for electricity production, and improving efficiency of motor vehicle engines.</span></p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Health risks caused by air pollution</h3><p><span>The latest available data have prompted WHO to call for greater awareness of health risks caused by air pollution, implementation of effective air pollution mitigation policies; and close monitoring of the situation in cities worldwide. </span></p><p><span>“Too many urban centres today are so enveloped in dirty air that their skylines are invisible,” said Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General for Family, Children and Women's Health. “Not surprisingly, this air is dangerous to breathe. So a growing number of cities and communities worldwide are striving to better meet the needs of their residents - in particular children and the elderly.\" </span></p><p><span>In April 2014, WHO issued new information estimating that outdoor air pollution was responsible for the deaths of some 3.7 million people under the age of 60 in 2012. The Organization also emphasised that indoor and outdoor air pollution combined are among the largest risks to health worldwide. </span></p><p><span>There are many components of air pollution, both gaseous and solid. But high concentrations of small and fine particulate pollution is particularly associated with high numbers of deaths from heart disease and stroke, as well as respiratory illnesses and cancers. Measurement of fine particulate matter of 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter (PM2.5) is considered to be the best indicator of the level of health risks from air pollution. </span></p><p><span>In high-income countries, 816 cities reported on PM2.5 levels with another 544 cities reporting on PM10, from which estimates of PM2.5 can be derived. In low- and middle-income countries, however, annual mean PM2.5 measurements could be accessed in only 70 cities; another 512 cities reported on PM10 measurements. </span></p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Measures to clean air</h3><p><span>“We can win the fight against air pollution and reduce the number of people suffering from respiratory and heart disease, as well as lung cancer,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. “Effective policies and strategies are well understood, but they need to be implemented at sufficient scale. Cities such as Copenhagen and Bogota, for example, have improved air quality by promoting ‘active transport’ and prioritizing dedicated networks of urban public transport, walking and cycling.” </span></p><p><span>The report notes that individual cities can take local action to improve air quality and thus go against regional trends. And good air quality can go hand in hand with economic development, as indicated by some major cities in Latin America which meet, or approach, the WHO air quality guidelines. </span></p><p><span>“We cannot buy clean air in a bottle, but cities can adopt measures that will clean the air and save the lives of their people,” said Dr Carlos Dora, Coordinator, Interventions for Healthy Environments, WHO Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. </span></p><p><span>Measures include ensuring that houses are energy efficient, that urban development is compact and well served by public transport routes, that street design is appealing and safe for pedestrians and cyclists, and waste is well managed. Such activities not only clean the air but can also serve as a catalyst for local economic development and the promotion of healthy urban lifestyles.</span></p><p><span>Despite the upswing in air quality monitoring, many cities in low and middle income countries still lack capacity to do so.

An estimated 289 000 women died in 2013 due to complications in pregnancy and childbirth, down from 523 000 in 1990.</span>\n</p><p><span>Another WHO study, also published today in <em>\"The Lancet Global Health\"</em>, adds new knowledge about why these women are dying. <em>\"Global causes of maternal death: a WHO systematic analysis\"</em>, finds that more than 1 in 4 maternal deaths are caused by pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, HIV, malaria and obesity, whose health impacts can all be aggravated by pregnancy. This is similar to the proportion of deaths during pregnancy and childbirth from severe bleeding.</span>\n</p><p><span>“Together, the two reports highlight the need to invest in proven solutions, such as quality care for all women during pregnancy and childbirth, and particular care for pregnant women with existing medical conditions,” says Dr Flavia Bustreo, Assistant Director-General, Family, Women’s and Children’s Health, WHO.</span>\n</p><p><span>They also underscore the importance of having accurate data.</span>\n</p><p><span>\"Thirty-three maternal deaths per hour is 33 too many,\" said Tim Evans, Director, Health, Nutrition and Population, World Bank Group. \"We need to document every one of these tragic events, determine their cause, and initiate corrective actions urgently.\" </span>\n</p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Steady progress</h3><p><span><em>\"Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013\"</em> includes new data which were not captured in the last set of global estimates in 2012, as well as improved methods of estimating births and all female deaths.</span>\n</p><p><span>Eleven countries that had high levels of maternal mortality in 1990 (Bhutan, Cambodia, Cabo Verde, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Nepal, Romania, Rwanda, Timor-Leste) have already reached the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of a 75% reduction in maternal mortality from the 1990 rate by 2015. Based on these latest trends however, many low- and middle-income countries will not achieve this goal.</span>\n</p><p><span>Sub-Saharan Africa is still the riskiest region in the world for dying of complications in pregnancy and childbirth.</span>\n</p><p><span>“A 15-year-old girl living in sub-Saharan Africa faces about a 1 in 40 risk of dying during pregnancy and childbirth during her lifetime,” says Dr Geeta Rao Gupta, Deputy Executive Director, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). “A girl of the same age living in Europe has a lifetime risk of 1 in 3300 – underscoring how uneven progress has been around the world.”</span>\n</p><p><span>Despite advances in the last 20 years, there has been too little progress in preventing adolescent pregnancies, abortions, maternal deaths, sexually-transmitted infections and HIV, and there are significant gaps in availability, quality and access to comprehensive sexuality education and services for young people, especially in low-income countries.</span>\n</p><p><span>“More than 15 million girls aged 15 to 19 years give birth every year – 1 in 5 girls before they turn 18 – and many of these pregnancies result from non-consensual sex,” highlights Ms Kate Gilmore, Deputy Executive Director, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). “Relatively simple and well-known interventions, like midwifery services and gender-based violence prevention and response, can make a huge difference if scaled up and coupled with investments in innovations, especially in the area of contraceptives.”\r\n    </span>\n</p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">New information on causes of death</h3><p><span>A related WHO study of causes of more than 60 000 maternal deaths in 115 countries shows that pre-existing medical conditions exacerbated by pregnancy (such as diabetes, malaria, HIV, obesity) caused 28% of the deaths.</span>\n</p><p><span>Other causes included:\r\n    </span>\n</p><ul><li>severe bleeding (mostly during and after childbirth) 27%</li><li>pregnancy-induced high blood pressure 14%</li><li>infections 11%</li><li>obstructed labour and other direct causes 9%</li><li>abortion complications 8%</li><li>blood clots (embolism) 3%.</li></ul><p><span>Strong health systems – with facilities that have adequate health workers and equipment and medicines – are key to delivering quality health care to save the lives of women and their newborn babies.</span>\n</p><p><span>“The new data show a changing profile in the conditions that cause maternal deaths; reflecting the increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases in women throughout the world. Ending preventable maternal deaths will require both continued efforts to reduce complications directly related to pregnancy, and more of a focus on noncommunicable diseases and their effect in pregnancy. Integrated care for women with conditions like diabetes and obesity will reduce deaths and prevent long-lasting health problems,” says Dr Marleen Temmerman, Director, Reproductive Health and Research, WHO, and co-author of the study.</span>\n</p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">Better data needed to save lives</h3><p><span>A major challenge in addressing maternal deaths is the lack of accurate data. Although knowledge on the number of women dying and the reasons behind their deaths is improving, much remains unrecorded and unreported. In many low-income countries, maternal deaths go uncounted and frequently the cause of death is unknown or not recorded correctly, particularly when women die at home. This is consistent with general global trends: only one-third of all deaths worldwide are recorded and fewer than 100 countries record the cause of death using WHO’s International Classification of Disease.\r\n    </span>\n</p><p><span>As a result, it is often hard for national health programmes to allocate resources where they are needed most. This is why the United Nations Commission on Information and Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health is calling for better measurement of maternal and child deaths. The Commission requires that “by 2015, all countries have taken significant steps to establish a system for registration of births, deaths and causes of death”.</span>\n</p><p><span>There is growing consensus worldwide that ending preventable maternal deaths can be achieved by ensuring that every woman has access to quality health care. Global and national targets beyond 2015 will be important for tracking progress in reducing maternal deaths and ensuring that maternal health continues to be a global development priority.</span>\n</p><p><span>Highlights from <em>\"Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013\"</em>:</span>\n</p><ul><li><strong>Maternal mortality has declined:</strong> In 2013, the global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was 210 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births, down from 380 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 1990 (a 45% reduction).\r\n    </li><li><strong>Faster progress needed: </strong>The global reduction of MMR has accelerated, with a 3.5% annual decline from 2000-2013, as compared with 1.4% between 1990 and 2000. However, at current trends, most countries will not achieve the MDG target of a 75% reduction in MMR from 1990 to 2015. An average decline of 5.5% or more every year since 1990 is needed to meet the target on time.</li><li><strong>Ten countries carry most of the burden:</strong> Ten countries account for about 60% of global maternal deaths: India (50 000), Nigeria (40 000), Democratic Republic of the Congo (21 000), Ethiopia (13 000), Indonesia (8800), Pakistan (7900), United Republic of Tanzania (7900), Kenya (6300), China (5900) and Uganda (5900).</li><li><strong>Somalia and Chad have the highest risk: </strong>The highest lifetime risk of maternal death is in Somalia and Chad where women face a 1 in 18 and 1 in 15 lifetime risk respectively.</li></ul><h4 class=\"section_head2\">For interviews and further information, please contact:</h4><p><span>Glenn Thomas<br/>WHO, Geneva<br/>Communications Officer<br/>Telephone: +41 22 791 39 83<br/>Mobile: +41 79 509 06 77 <br/>Email:<a href=\"mailto:thomasg@who.int\">thomasg@who.int</a></span>\n</p><p><span><strong>UNICEF:</strong><br/>Kate Donovan<br/>Deputy, Media Section, New York<br/>Telephone: +1 212 326 7452\r\n        <br/>Mobile: +1 917 378 2128\r\n        <br/>Email: <a href=\"mailto:kdonovan@unicef.org\">kdonovan@unicef.org</a>\n</span>\n</p><p><span><strong>UNFPA:</strong><br/>Etienne Franca<br/>Coordinator, Sexual and Reproductive Health Communications, New York<br/>Telephone: +1 212 297 5208<br/>Mobile: +1 917 310 8957 <br/>Email: <a href=\"mailto:franca@unfpa.org\">franca@unfpa.org</a></span>\n</p><p><span><strong>World Bank Group:</strong><br/>Melanie Mayhew<br/>Communications Officer, Washington D.C.<br/>Telephone: +1 202 458 7891<br/>Mobile: +1 202 459 7115<br/>Email:<a href=\"mailto:mmayhew1@worldbank.org\"> mmayhew1@worldbank.org</a> </span>\n</p><hr/><h3 class=\"section_head1\">About the maternal mortality estimates</h3><p><span>* <em>\"Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2013\"</em> is published by the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG) which includes WHO, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) and the World Bank Group.

          "Eleven countries that had high levels of maternal mortality in 1990 (Bhutan, Cambodia, Cabo Verde, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Nepal, Romania, Rwanda, Timor-Leste) have already reached the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of a 75% reduction in maternal mortality from the 1990 rate by 2015. Based on these latest trends however, many low- and middle-income countries will not achieve this goal.",
          "Sub-Saharan Africa is still the riskiest region in the world for dying of complications in pregnancy and childbirth.",
          "“A 15-year-old girl living in sub-Saharan Africa faces about a 1 in 40 risk of dying during pregnancy and childbirth during her lifetime,” says Dr Geeta Rao Gupta, Deputy Executive Director, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). “A girl of the same age living in Europe has a lifetime risk of 1 in 3300 – underscoring how uneven progress has been around the world.”",
          "Despite advances in the last 20 years, there has been too little progress in preventing adolescent pregnancies, abortions, maternal deaths, sexually-transmitted infections and HIV, and there are significant gaps in availability, quality and access to comprehensive sexuality education and services for young people, especially in low-income countries.",
          "“More than 15 million girls aged 15 to 19 years give birth every year – 1 in 5 girls before they turn 18 – and many of these pregnancies result from non-consensual sex,” highlights Ms Kate Gilmore, Deputy Executive Director, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). “Relatively simple and well-known interventions, like midwifery services and gender-based violence prevention and response, can make a huge difference if scaled up and coupled with investments in innovations, especially in the area of contraceptives.”"

Ending preventable maternal deaths will require both continued efforts to reduce complications directly related to pregnancy, and more of a focus on noncommunicable diseases and their effect in pregnancy. Integrated care for women with conditions like diabetes and obesity will reduce deaths and prevent long-lasting health problems,” says Dr Marleen Temmerman, Director, Reproductive Health and Research, WHO, and co-author of the study."

          "A major challenge in addressing maternal deaths is the lack of accurate data. Although knowledge on the number of women dying and the reasons behind their deaths is improving, much remains unrecorded and unreported. In many low-income countries, maternal deaths go uncounted and frequently the cause of death is unknown or not recorded correctly, particularly when women die at home. This is consistent with general global trends: only one-third of all deaths worldwide are recorded and fewer than 100 countries record the cause of death using WHO’s International Classification of Disease.",
          "As a result, it is often hard for national health programmes to allocate resources where they are needed most. This is why the United Nations Commission on Information and Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health is calling for better measurement of maternal and child deaths. The Commission requires that “by 2015, all countries have taken significant steps to establish a system for registration of births, deaths and causes of death”.",
          "There is growing consensus worldwide that ending preventable maternal deaths can be achieved by ensuring that every woman has access to quality health care. Global and national targets beyond 2015 will be important for tracking progress in reducing maternal deaths and ensuring that maternal health continues to be a global development priority.",

However, at current trends, most countries will not achieve the MDG target of a 75% reduction in MMR from 1990 to 2015. An average decline of 5.5% or more every year since 1990 is needed to meet the target on time.",

The above affected States Parties presented on recent developments in their countries.</span>\n</p><p><span>After discussion and deliberation on the information provided, and in the context of the global polio eradication initiative, the Committee advised that the international spread of polio to date in 2014 constitutes an ‘extraordinary event’ and a public health risk to other States for which a coordinated international response is essential. The current situation stands in stark contrast to the near-cessation of international spread of wild poliovirus from January 2012 through the 2013 low transmission season for this disease (i.e. January to April). If unchecked, this situation could result in failure to eradicate globally one of the world’s most serious vaccine preventable diseases. It was the unanimous view of the Committee that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have been met.</span>\n</p><p><span>At end-2013, 60% of polio cases were the result of international spread of wild poliovirus, and there was increasing evidence that adult travellers contributed to this spread. During the 2014 low transmission season there has already been international spread of wild poliovirus from 3 of the 10 States that are currently infected: in central Asia (from Pakistan to Afghanistan), in the Middle East (Syrian Arab Republic to Iraq) and in Central Africa (Cameroon to Equatorial Guinea). A coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop this international spread of wild poliovirus and to prevent new spread with the onset of the high transmission season in May/June 2014; unilateral measures may prove less effective in stopping international spread than a coordinated response. The consequences of further international spread are particularly acute today given the large number of polio-free but conflict-torn and fragile States which have severely compromised routine immunization services and are at high risk of re-infection. Such States would experience extreme difficulty in mounting an effective response were wild poliovirus to be reintroduced. As much international spread occurs across land borders, WHO should continue to facilitate a coordinated regional approach to accelerate interruption of virus transmission in each epidemiologic zone.</span>\n</p><p><span>The over-riding priority for all polio-infected States must be to interrupt wild poliovirus transmission within their borders as rapidly as possible through the immediate and full application in all geographic areas of the polio eradication strategies, specifically: supplementary immunization campaigns with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), surveillance for poliovirus, and routine immunization. The Committee provided the following advice to the Director-General for her consideration to reduce the international spread of wild poliovirus, based on a risk stratification of the 10 States with active transmission (i.e. within the previous 6 months) as of 29 April 2014. </span>\n</p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">States currently exporting wild poliovirus</h3><p><span>Pakistan, Cameroon, and the Syrian Arab Republic pose the greatest risk of further wild poliovirus exportations in 2014. These States should:</span>\n</p><ul><li>officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency;</li><li>ensure that all residents and long-term visitors (i.e. &gt; 4 weeks) receive a dose of OPV or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to international travel;</li><li>ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within 4 weeks), who have not received a dose of OPV or IPV in the previous 4 weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers;</li><li>ensure that such travellers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the International Health Regulations (2005) to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination; </li><li>maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least 6 months have passed without new exportations and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until at least 12 months have passed without new exportations.</li></ul><p><span>Once a State has met the criteria to be assessed as no longer exporting wild poliovirus, it should continue to be considered as an infected State until such time as it has met the criteria to be removed from that category.</span>\n</p><h3 class=\"section_head1\">States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting</h3><p><span>Afghanistan, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Israel, Somalia and particularly Nigeria, given the international spread from that State historically, pose an ongoing risk for new wild poliovirus exportations in 2014.

Initial results from a new WHO global survey confirm that these infections are often resistant to the antibiotics used to treat them.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Healthcare-associated infections usually occur when germs are transferred by health-care providers’ hands touching the patient. Of every 100 hospitalized patients, at least 7 in high-income and 10 in low-/middle-income countries will acquire a healthcare-associated infection. Among critically ill and vulnerable patients in intensive care units, that figure rises to around 30 per 100 . Every year, hundreds of millions of patients around the world are affected by healthcare-associated infections, a high proportion of which is caused by germs that are resistant to antimicrobial drugs.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>When patients are infected with germs that do not respond well to antibiotics, they generally have worse clinical outcomes, cost more to treat and are more likely to die than other patients. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Antimicrobial resistance and good hand hygiene</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Earlier this week, WHO issued a major global report on antimicrobial resistance documenting high rates of resistance in bacteria that cause common infections (e.g. urinary tract infection, surgical site infections, pneumonia and bloodstream infections) in all regions of the world. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The initial results of the global survey confirm that resistance is very frequent in bacteria isolated in health-care facilities; for instance, for a devastating bug called Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), it is as high as 44%, 40% and 38% on average in Latin America, West African countries, and Europe respectively. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“There is clear scientific evidence that good hand hygiene by health workers reduces healthcare-associated infections caused by resistant germs, in particular by MRSA,” says Professor Benedetta Allegranzi, technical lead of the WHO Clean Care is Safer Care programme and of the activities planned for Hand Hygiene Day. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\"> 5 key moments</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Health workers can play a vital role to protect patients from infections that are difficult to treat by performing hand hygiene at 5 key moments, preferably by using an alcohol-based rub or by hand washing with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The ‘5 Moments’ for hand hygiene are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>before touching a patient.</li>\n<li>\tbefore clean and aseptic procedures (e.g. Inserting devices such as catheters).</li>\n<li>\tafter contact with body fluids.</li>\n<li>\tafter touching a patient.</li>\n<li>\tafter touching patient surroundings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<span>The use of alcohol-based hand rub products is a key factor to achieve improvement because they can be promptly used at the point of care when hand hygiene is needed to ensure patient safety and they have higher antimicrobial effect than soap and water.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Although the development of new antibiotics is vital to provide new treatment options, strengthening hand hygiene and other infection control best practices has the potential to stop antimicrobial resistance. Preventing the transmission and spread of the germs, avoids infections and the related treatment constraints and patient suffering,” says Dr. Edward Kelley, Director, Service Delivery and Safety which hosts the Clean Care is Safer Care programme. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>For this year’s “SAVE LIVES: Clean Your Hands” campaign, the Call to Action is “No action today; no cure tomorrow – make sure the WHO ‘5 Moments’ are part of protecting your patients from resistant germs.” Under this year’s campaign, more than 1100 health facilities have registered, committing to practice good hand hygiene, joining more than 16 000 health facilities in 168 countries that have committed in previous years. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“This continuous increase of participation shows that hand hygiene efforts continue to be prioritized and sustained worldwide, especially when combined with other important goals such as combating antimicrobial resistance,” says Professor Didier Pittet, Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre on Patient Safety (Infection Control) at the University of Geneva Hospitals. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Through the \"SAVE LIVES: Clean Your Hands\" campaign, WHO will continue to work with countries to highlight the issue of antimicrobial resistance and to promote the role that hand hygiene can play in preventing the spread of resistant germs.

While it is not possible to assess the true extent of the problem with the data available, that which is available is worrying. Significant resistance is reported for several bacteria that are spread in hospitals and communities. This includes significant E. coli resistance to third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones–two important and commonly used types of antibacterial medicine. In some parts of the region, as many as 80% of of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections are reported to be resistant to methicillin (MRSA), meaning treatment with standard antibiotics does not work.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">WHO Region of the Americas</h4>\n<p>\n<span>The Pan American Health Organization, WHO’s Regional Office for the Americas, coordinates the collection of data on antibiotic resistance from hospitals and laboratories in 21 countries in the Region. The results show high levels of <i>E. coli</i> resistance to third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones–two important and commonly used types of antibacterial medicine–in the Americas. Resistance to third generation cephalosporins in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> is also high and widespread. In some settings, as many as 90% of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections are reported to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA), meaning treatment with standard antibiotics does not work.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Data in the report show extensive antibiotic resistance across the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. In particular, there are high levels of <i>E. coli</i> resistance to third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones–two important and commonly used types of antibacterial medicine. Resistance to third generation cephalosporins in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> is also high and widespread. In some parts of the Region, more than half of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections are reported to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA), meaning that treatment with standard antibiotics does not work. The report reveals major gaps in tracking of antibiotic resistance in the Region. WHO’s Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean has identified strategic actions to contain drug resistance and is supporting countries to develop comprehensive national policies, strategies and plans.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">WHO European Region</h4>\n<p>\n<span>The report reveals high levels of resistance to third generation cephalosporins in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> throughout the WHO European Region. In some settings, as many as 60% of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections are reported to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA), meaning that treatment with standard antibiotics does not work. The report finds that although most countries in the EU have well-established national and international systems for tracking antibiotic resistance, countries in other parts of the Region urgently need to strengthen or establish such systems. WHO’s Regional Office for Europe and its partners are supporting these countries through the newly-established Central Asian and Eastern European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance network (CAESAR). The aim of CAESAR is to set up a network of national systems to monitor antibiotic resistance in all countries of the WHO European Region for standardized data collection so that information is comparable.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">WHO South-East Asia Region</h4>\n<p>\n<span>The available data reveal that antibiotic resistance is a burgeoning problem in WHO’s South-East Asia Region, which is home to a quarter of the world’s population. The report’s results show high levels of <i>E. coli</i> resistance to third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones—two important and commonly used types of antibacterial medicine–in the Region. Resistance to third generation cephalosporins in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> is also high and widespread. In some parts of the Region, more than one quarter of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections are reported to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA), meaning that treatment with standard antibiotics does not work. In 2011, the health ministers of the Region articulated their commitment to combat drug resistance through the Jaipur Declaration. Since then, there has been growing awareness of the need for appropriate tracking of drug resistance, and all countries have agreed to contribute information to a regional database. Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia, has identified drug resistance as a priority area of WHO’s work in the Region.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">WHO Western Pacific Region</h4>\n<p>\n<span>Collaboration on tracking of antibiotic resistance between countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region was established in the 1980s, but suffered setbacks following a series of emergencies in the early 2000s. However, many countries in the region have long-established national systems for tracking resistance. Recently, WHO’s Regional Office for the Western Pacific has taken steps to revive the regional collaboration. The report reveals high levels of<i> E. coli</i> resistance to fluoroquinolones–an important and commonly used type of antibacterial medicine–in the Region. Resistance to third generation cephalosporins in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> is also widespread. In some parts of the Region, as many as 80% of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections are reported to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA), meaning that treatment with standard antibiotics does not work.</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\n<span><sup>1</sup>CORRIGENDUM (22 September 2014) An error was identified in the number of new cases of gonorrhoea and has now been corrected from \"More than 1 million people are infected with gonorrhoea around the world every day\" to \"An estimated 106 million people are infected with gonorrhoea every year (2008 estimates)\".</span></p>\n<div></div>",

This includes significant E. coli resistance to third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones–two important and commonly used types of antibacterial medicine. In some parts of the region, as many as 80% of of Staphylococcus aureus infections are reported to be resistant to methicillin (MRSA), meaning treatment with standard antibiotics does not work."

This finding more than doubles previous estimates and confirms that air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk. Reducing air pollution could save millions of lives.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">New estimates</h3>\n<p>\n<span>In particular, the new data reveal a stronger link between both indoor and outdoor air pollution exposure and cardiovascular diseases, such as strokes and ischaemic heart disease, as well as between air pollution and cancer. This is in addition to air pollution’s role in the development of respiratory diseases, including acute respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The new estimates are not only based on more knowledge about the diseases caused by air pollution, but also upon better assessment of human exposure to air pollutants through the use of improved measurements and technology.

One third of the estimated 9 million people falling ill with TB each year do not get the care they need. In many countries, it is hard for people to access diagnostic services – particularly for MDR-TB. Some countries have only one central laboratory, which often has limited capacity to diagnose MDR-TB. In some cases, patient samples have to be sent to other countries for testing. Moreover, traditional diagnostic tests can take more than 2 months to get results. </span></p>\n<p><span>But the situation is beginning to change. New technologies can rapidly diagnose TB and drug-resistant TB in as little as two hours. </span></p>\n<p><span>“The MDR-TB story is being transformed by a fertile mix of collaborators, including those working on access to diagnosis,” says Philippe Meunier, the French Government’s Ambassador for the fight against HIV/AIDS and communicable diseases. “Increased capacity and reduced prices mean more patients can be served, and global health risks would be diminished.”</span></p>\n<p><span>In 2009, UNITAID provided US$ 87 million to support the EXPAND-TB multi-partner project to enable effective and sustained access, and use of recommended new TB diagnostic technologies in 27 low- and middle-income countries. These countries together carry 40% of the estimated global MDR-TB burden. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">The project delivers positive results</h3>\n<p><span>The project has delivered impressive results. Over 30% of the MDR-TB cases detected globally in 2012 were from EXPAND-TB countries. 90% of India’s detected MDR-TB cases were through EXPAND-TB supported services. Use of these tests requires strengthened laboratory services. By the end of 2013, 92 laboratories were fully operational. From 2009 to 2013, the number of MDR-TB cases diagnosed in the 27 countries tripled, with 36 000 diagnosed in 2013 alone. </span></p>\n<p><span>The project has enabled more patients to be treated with quality-assured second-line TB medicines. Through that demand, the project has helped to reduce the price of individual medicines and MDR-TB treatment regimens by one third. Prices have also dropped for diagnostic commodities.</span></p>\n<p><span>Project partners are WHO and the Global Laboratory Initiative (GLI), the Stop TB Partnership’s Global Drug Facility and FIND. Project funds have been used to purchase testing equipment and commodities, and to train laboratory technicians.</span></p>\n<p><span>The EXPAND-TB project complements investments in laboratory infrastructure and diagnostic services from international partners, including The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, The World Bank and the United States Government. </span></p>\n<p><span>“The gap in access to TB diagnostics and care is far from filled, but is narrowing. With the impetus of modern laboratories, we are on the right track finally to handle MDR-TB,” says Dr Mario Raviglione, Director of WHO’s Global TB Programme. </span></p>\n<p><span>Ministries of health are now working on securing domestic funding for the medium-term and working with partners to fill financing shortfalls for quality diagnostic tests and services. </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Note to editors</h3>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">EXPAND-TB Partners, and additional quotes from participants in the 20 March press briefing</h4>\n<p><span>WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system. It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health trends.</span></p>\n<p><span>UNITAID is a global health initiative launched in 2006 by the Governments of Brazil, Chile, France, Norway and the United Kingdom to provide sustainable funding for the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. About 70% of UNITAID’s funds come from a small levy on airline tickets. Through implementers, UNITAID finances the purchase of quality-assured drugs and diagnostics for patients in poor countries, using its market power to expand supply, promote development of new and better products, cut delivery lead times and reduce prices. </span></p>\n<p><span>Dr Philippe Duneton, Executive Director a.i., UNITAID said, “The EXPAND-TB project has been an important part of UNITAID’s TB investment portfolio as identifying cases has been, and remains, essential. To reach the missing three million, we must continue to find and use ever-better diagnostics technologies, but also enable access for low- and middle-income countries to the new medicines now available.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The Stop TB Partnership’s Global Drug Facility (GDF) coordinates and manages procurement and delivery of TB commodities like quality assured medicines, diagnostic equipment and supplies to eligible countries, offering as well technical assistance for building more sustainable supply chain systems. The GDF has procured and distributed diagnostics and laboratory equipment for the project and, by pooling the global demand for Second Line anti-TB Drugs within one single procurement platform, has reached up to 32% cost reduction for MDR-TB treatment, bringing a broader basis of suppliers producing quality assured medicines and allowing more market competition. </span></p>\n<p><span>“We need to ensure that diagnostics are accessible and closer to people. This project is a successful multi-partner strategic approach where diagnostic, treatment capacity and medicines supply have been linked together, showing the path for a stronger fight against MDR-TB \" said Dr Joel Keravec, GDF Special Advisor.</span></p>\n<p><span>FIND is an international non-profit organization that drives development and delivery of innovative diagnostic solutions for poverty-related diseases. As the main implementing partner for EXPAND-TB, FIND works closely with national TB programmes and multiple international and local partners to build laboratory capacity, accelerate uptake and establish the know-how needed for correct use of new TB technologies. FIND helps ensure that all the key components that are needed for successful diagnostic implementation are put in place, and aims to maximise patient impact. </span></p>\n<p><span>Dr Catharina Boehme, FIND’s Chief Executive Officer, said “Without diagnostics, medicine is blind. The EXPAND TB project is critical for scaling up the capacity to detect TB drug resistance. It has also laid the ground for rapid uptake and proper use of future diagnostic innovations that are urgently needed to effectively fight TB and drug resistance. Continued commitment from the global health community in support of new tools, especially point-of-care diagnostics, should remain a high priority.” </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h4 class=\"section_head2\">For more information, contact</h4>\n<p><span>Mr Tarik Jasarevic <br/>\r\nMobile: +41 79 367 6214<br/>\r\nTel.: +41 22 791 5099<br/>\r\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:jasarevict@who.int\">jasarevict@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div> </div>",

          "Dr Philippe Duneton, Executive Director a.i., UNITAID said, “The EXPAND-TB project has been an important part of UNITAID’s TB investment portfolio as identifying cases has been, and remains, essential. To reach the missing three million, we must continue to find and use ever-better diagnostics technologies, but also enable access for low- and middle-income countries to the new medicines now available.”",
          "The Stop TB Partnership’s Global Drug Facility (GDF) coordinates and manages procurement and delivery of TB commodities like quality assured medicines, diagnostic equipment and supplies to eligible countries, offering as well technical assistance for building more sustainable supply chain systems. The GDF has procured and distributed diagnostics and laboratory equipment for the project and, by pooling the global demand for Second Line anti-TB Drugs within one single procurement platform, has reached up to 32% cost reduction for MDR-TB treatment, bringing a broader basis of suppliers producing quality assured medicines and allowing more market competition.",
          "“We need to ensure that diagnostics are accessible and closer to people. This project is a successful multi-partner strategic approach where diagnostic, treatment capacity and medicines supply have been linked together, showing the path for a stronger fight against MDR-TB \" said Dr Joel Keravec, GDF Special Advisor.",
          "FIND is an international non-profit organization that drives development and delivery of innovative diagnostic solutions for poverty-related diseases. As the main implementing partner for EXPAND-TB, FIND works closely with national TB programmes and multiple international and local partners to build laboratory capacity, accelerate uptake and establish the know-how needed for correct use of new TB technologies. FIND helps ensure that all the key components that are needed for successful diagnostic implementation are put in place, and aims to maximise patient impact.",
          "Dr Catharina Boehme, FIND’s Chief Executive Officer, said “Without diagnostics, medicine is blind. The EXPAND TB project is critical for scaling up the capacity to detect TB drug resistance. It has also laid the ground for rapid uptake and proper use of future diagnostic innovations that are urgently needed to effectively fight TB and drug resistance. Continued commitment from the global health community in support of new tools, especially point-of-care diagnostics, should remain a high priority.”"

Access to contraception information and services will allow better planning for families and improved health.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">WHO guidance recommendations</h3>\n<div class=\"blockquote-container\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Ensuring availability and accessibility to the information and services they need is crucial, not only to protect their rights, but also their health.”</p>\n<p class=\"source\">\nDr Flavia Bustreo, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Family, Women, and Children’s Health\n</p>\n</blockquote> </div>\n<p>\n<span>The guidance recommends that everyone who wants contraception should be able to obtain detailed and accurate information, and a variety of services, such as counselling as well as contraceptive products. It also underlines the need for no discrimination, coercion or violence, with special attention given to assuring access to those who are disadvantaged and marginalized.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Other key measures are scientifically accurate sex education programmes for young people, including information on how to use and acquire contraceptives. The guidance states that adolescents should be able to seek contraceptive services without having to obtain permission from parents or guardians. It also recommends that women be able to request services without having to obtain authorization from their husbands. It emphasizes the importance of respecting the privacy of individuals, including confidentiality of medical and other personal information.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“A lack of contraception puts 6 out of 10 women in low-income countries at risk of unintended pregnancy,” says Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Family, Women, and Children’s Health. “Ensuring availability and accessibility to the information and services they need is crucial, not only to protect their rights, but also their health. These unintended pregnancies can pose a major threat to their own and their children’s health and lives.”</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Access to contraception</h3>\n<p>\n<span>In low- and middle-income countries, complications of pregnancy and childbirth are among the leading cause of death in young women aged 15–19 years. Stillbirths and death in the first week of life are 50% higher among babies born to mothers younger than 20 years than among babies born to mothers 20–29 years old.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Access to contraception allows couples to space pregnancies and enables those who wish to limit the size of their families to do so. Evidence suggests that women who have more than four children are at increased risk of death from complications of pregnancy and childbirth.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Many people who cannot currently access contraception services are young, poor, and live in rural areas and urban slums. Efforts are under way to address this need. The 2012 London Summit on Family Planning committed to extend family planning services to at least 120 million more people by the year 2020.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Global targets are stimulating much needed action to increase access to modern contraception,” says Dr Marleen Temmerman, Director of WHO’s Department of Reproductive Health and Research. “But we have to be careful that our efforts to meet those targets do not lead to human rights infringements. It is not just about increasing numbers, it’s also about increasing knowledge. It is vital for women—and men—to understand how contraception works, be offered a choice of methods, and be happy with the method they receive.”</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994 highlighted the importance of a rights-based approach to family planning. The past 20 years have seen a large amount of work demanding and defining a rights-based approach to health services—including contraception. Yet there has been comparatively little practical advice how to do so. WHO’s new guidance aims to address that gap.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The guidance also suggests ways to improve supply chains and affordability, recommends additional training for health workers, and outlines a series of steps to improve access in crisis settings, in HIV clinics, and during pre-natal and post-natal care.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The new guidance complements existing WHO recommendations for sexual and reproductive health programmes, including guidance on maternal and newborn health, sexuality education, prevention of unsafe abortion, and core competencies for primary health care.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">For more information, please contact:</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Glenn Thomas<br/>\nWHO Communications Officer<br/>\nTelephone: +41 22 791 3983<br/>\nMobile: +41 79 509 0677<br/>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:thomasg@who.int\">thomasg@who.int</a></span></p>\n<div></div>",

It is the first time the stockpile, created in 2013 by WHO, is being activated. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Although currently there is not a cholera outbreak, people displaced by the recent conflict and living in the camps are at risk due to poor sanitary conditions and overcrowding. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Starting today, 94 000 people will be vaccinated in the Minkaman camp, Awerial County, targeting displaced people and host communities, followed by vaccination campaigns in camps based in Juba, covering an additional 43 000 people. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Two doses of vaccine are required for an individual to be protected. The campaign begins with an initial round of vaccinations followed by - after a required 14 day interval - a second round of doses, which will complete the vaccination. For such a campaign to be effective, it is vital that a second dose is administered and this factor has led to the decision to begin with Minkaman, Awerial County, and Juba camps. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>“Minkaman camp in Awerial County and Juba camp have been selected because of the relative stability of the situation and easier access in those places,” says Dr Abdinasir Abubakar, from WHO’s Disease Surveillance and Response team, in South Sudan. “We are also looking at other camps, and once the accessibility and security improves, we will expand the cholera vaccination campaigns into these areas. We will be reviewing the situation day by day.” </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Why vaccinate against cholera?</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water and affects children and adults. It can kill in a matter of hours due to rapid dehydration. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Children are at a higher risk of infection. Once infected, in addition to dehydration, children develop severe hypoglycaemia that can lead to coma and death. Similarly, ‘at risk’ groups (for example malnourished people, the elderly, pregnant women, people with severe chronic disease, AIDS patients) are more likely to develop severe forms of the disease. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Access to clean water and adequate sanitation remain the mainstays of preventing both endemic cholera and cholera outbreaks, together with health education to promote the adoption of appropriate hygiene practices. Cholera vaccination is a safe and effective additional tool that can be used under the right conditions to supplement existing priority cholera control measures.</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO will coordinate the campaign in collaboration with MSF and Medair as an implementing partner in Awerial and Juba respectively. </span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Note to editors</h3>\n<p>\n<span>The International Coordinating Group (ICG), with representatives from WHO, IFRC, MSF and UNICEF, is the governance mechanism for the deployment of oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) through the emergency stockpile.

All shipments contained surgical materials, medicines to treat chronic and infectious diseases, infant incubators, ventilators and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>The first shipment containing 26 tons of medical supplies to treat more than 55 000 patients was delivered on 24 December 2013 to the Aleppo Teaching Hospital. The second shipment containing 80 tons of supplies to treat more than 213 000 patients was delivered to NGOs, local health authorities and to the Syrian Red Crescent Society (SRCS) in Aleppo’s contested areas on 3 January 2014. In addition, an estimated 118 000 patients can be treated with another shipment of 20 tons of supplies which were delivered to the Syrian Ministry of Health in Aleppo.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"section_head1\">Deteriorating health situation</h3>\n<p>\n<span>Since the beginning of the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic the health situation has been deteriorating with shortages of medicines and health workers, the destruction of health facilities and difficult access to health care. With the substantial damage to pharmaceutical plants, local production of medicines has been reduced by 65–70%. Prior to March 2011, 90% of medicines in the Syrian Arab Republic were locally produced. Medicine prices on the black market have risen steeply and are not available to the majority of the population, especially, in rural areas. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>These shipments continue the steady supply of medicine and medical supplies to all sides of the conflict. In 2013, WHO and its partners distributed medical supplies for 4.6 million people; supported mobile health clinics and other service delivery through 36 local NGOs and other health partners; trained almost 2500 local health workers on infectious diseases and outbreak response, chemical hazard, surveillance, malnutrition and mental health. </span></p>\n<p>\n<span>WHO has also established the Early Warning, Alert and Response System (EWARS) to be the front line to detect the earliest signs of a disease outbreak.

          "Since the beginning of the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic the health situation has been deteriorating with shortages of medicines and health workers, the destruction of health facilities and difficult access to health care. With the substantial damage to pharmaceutical plants, local production of medicines has been reduced by 65–70%. Prior to March 2011, 90% of medicines in the Syrian Arab Republic were locally produced. Medicine prices on the black market have risen steeply and are not available to the majority of the population, especially, in rural areas.",
          "These shipments continue the steady supply of medicine and medical supplies to all sides of the conflict. In 2013, WHO and its partners distributed medical supplies for 4.6 million people; supported mobile health clinics and other service delivery through 36 local NGOs and other health partners; trained almost 2500 local health workers on infectious diseases and outbreak response, chemical hazard, surveillance, malnutrition and mental health.",
          "WHO has also established the Early Warning, Alert and Response System (EWARS) to be the front line to detect the earliest signs of a disease outbreak. Detecting an outbreak in the earliest stages is the key to preventing the spread of disease. Currently more than 400 sites are reporting into the system from health facilities around the country.",
