Specifically, Sir Liam will mobilize political support for WHO Patient Safety with health leaders around the world and with major donors, philanthropic organizations and governments for priority activities addressing patient safety issues at national and international levels. He will also advise the WHO Director-General on strategic issues in patient safety and propose strategic actions and collaborations at global level.Ensuring patients receive safe, high quality health care\"With this nomination, WHO is signalling the importance of ensuring that patients get safe, high quality health care all around the world,\" says Director-General Margaret Chan. \"With the support and intellectual leadership of Sir Liam, the Patient Safety Programme has grown from a small specialist initiative within WHO to a global advocacy and scientific community, with activities in over 140 countries and all six WHO regions. It is now poised to do even more.\"Hundreds of thousands of patients affectedEvery year, hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide are harmed or die while using health services. Data from WHO and other sources indicates that patient safety incidents occur in anything between 4% to 16% of all hospitalized patients. A recent WHO Report on the burden of endemic health care-associated infection worldwide estimates that such infections affect hundreds of millions of people globally. The burden is at least twice as high in developing countries compared to developed countries.Patient Safety ProgrammeIn many cases, this harm is preventable. WHO's Patient Safety Programme (formerly the World Alliance for Patient Safety) was established in 2004 to coordinate, facilitate and accelerate patient safety improvements around the world. In its first seven years, the programme has stimulated global awareness and knowledge about the importance of patient safety towards building and maintaining effective health systems and services.WHO Patient Safety Programme created the world’s only global \"Patients for Patient Safety\" movement, and obtained 124 country pledges to reduce health care-associated infection, The programme also launched the world's first ever \"Safe Surgery Checklist\", used by more than 1500 hospitals. Its Patient safety curriculum guide enables undergraduates to learn about patient safety before going into clinical practice. Meanwhile 13 000 health-care settings worldwide have taken action to reduce infection rates through improved hand hygiene.Awareness of patient safety\"We have come a long way in raising the world's awareness of patient safety, but challenges still remain,\" states Sir Liam. \"Health care has not achieved the level of safety of many other high-risk industries. Citizens of countries around the world find it incredible that errors lead to patients getting the wrong operation or the wrong medication, sometimes with fatal consequences. Lessons need to be learned from such tragedies and action taken. The WHO Patient Safety Programme will be the cornerstone of a renewed effort globally to address these issues.\"Sir Liam served as the Chairman of the World Alliance for Patient Safety. He currently holds a number of appointments including, Chancellor of Newcastle University, Chairman of the National Patient Safety Agency in England, and Chair in Health Policy at Imperial College London.",

      "description": "The number of children under five years of age dying each year declined from more than 12 million in 1990 to 7.6 million in 2010, UNICEF and WHO said today, releasing the latest estimates on worldwide child mortality.These new figures show that compared to 1990, around 12 000 more children’s lives are saved each day.Declining child mortality rate in sub-Saharan AfricaAn annual report on child mortality found that in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the highest number of under-five deaths in the world, the speed at which the under-five mortality rate is declining doubled from 1.2 per cent a year during 1990-2000 to 2.4 per cent a year during 2000-2010.“The news that the rate of child mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa is declining twice as fast as it was a decade ago shows that we can make progress even in the poorest places, but we cannot for a moment forget the chilling fact of around 21,000 children dying every day from preventable causes,” said Anthony Lake, UNICEF Executive Director. “Focusing greater investment on the most disadvantaged communities will help us save more children’s lives, more quickly and more cost effectively.”Rate of progressBetween 1990 and 2010, the under-five mortality rate dropped by more than one-third, from 88 deaths per 1,000 live births to 57.Unfortunately, this rate of progress is still insufficient to meet Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4), which calls for a two-thirds reduction in the under-five mortality rate by 2015.\"Reductions in child mortality are linked to many factors, particularly increased access to health care services around the newborn period. As well as prevention and treatment of childhood illnesses, and improved nutrition, immunization coverage, and water and sanitation,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director General. \"This is proof that investing in children's health is money well spent, and a sign that we need to accelerate that investment through the coming years.\"Greatest improvements seen in countries where children are most vulnerableSome of the greatest improvements are in countries where children are most vulnerable.One example is Niger, where the 1990 under-five mortality rate was 311 per 1,000 live births. To address the often large distances between people and health centres, a strategy of deploying trained community health workers to deliver high-impact interventions at thousands of new health posts across the country was used. In 2010, Niger was one of the five countries with the greatest absolute reductions in overall under-five mortality rates, together with Malawi, Liberia, Timor-Leste and Sierra Leone.Dr. Chan and Mr. Lake agreed that the commitment of governments and the implementation of strategies to overcome local constraints to access and use of essential services are critical success factors.The report shows that newborns and infants are the most at risk of dying, and there has been less progress for them than within the under-five age category as a whole. More than 40 per cent of under-five deaths occur within the first month of life and over 70 per cent in the first year of life.Disparities persistThe improvements and progress are encouraging – but stark disparities persist. Sub-Saharan Africa is still home to the highest rates of child mortality, with one in eight children dying before reaching five – more than 17 times the average for developed regions (1 in 143). Southern Asia has the second highest rates with 1 in 15 children dying before age five.Under-five deaths are increasingly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. In 1990, 69 per cent of under-five deaths occurred in these two regions – in 2010, that proportion increased to 82 per cent. About half of all under five deaths in the world took place in just five countries in 2010: India, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan and China.The new estimates are published in the 2011 report Levels & Trends in Child Mortality, issued by the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME), which is led by UNICEF and WHO and includes the World Bank and the UN Population Division.About UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME)IGME was formed in 2004 to share data on child mortality, harmonize estimates within the UN system, improve methods for child mortality estimation report on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and enhance country capacity to produce timely and properly assessed estimates of child mortality. The IGME, led by the United Nations Children’s Fund and the World Health Organization, also includes the World Bank and the United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs as full members.The IGME’s independent Technical Advisory Group, comprising leading scholars and independent experts in demography, provides technical guidance on estimation methods, technical issues and strategies for data analysis and data quality assessment.The IGME updates its child mortality estimates annually after reviewing newly available data and assessing data quality. The 2011 child mortality report contains the latest IGME estimates of child mortality at the country, regional and global levels. Country-specific estimates and the data used to derive them are available from the child mortality database of the IGME.About UNICEFUNICEF is on the ground in over 150 countries and territories to help children survive and thrive, from early childhood through adolescence. The world’s largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments.About WHOWHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.

It is also at the heart of three health-related Millennium Development Goals – reduce child death (MDG 4), improve maternal health (MDG 5) and fight AIDS, malaria and other diseases (MDG 6).The report builds on prior initiatives to strengthen midwifery worldwide. These include the joint statement by WHO, the International Confederation of Midwives and and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics on Making Pregnancy Safer (2004) and the World Health Report 2005.",

Lange, Senior Program Officer for Developing Country Policy & Advocacy at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Sharing accomplishmentsTDR is reaching out to anyone who has been involved in the programme to share their stories and accomplishments since their original connection. A new social networking site has been set up and anyone who has been involved with TDR is being invited to contribute to the site.Tanzanian scientists were among those that nominated TDR for the award. \"Our 35 year partnership has enabled a disease endemic country like ours to aspire to eventually find and develop solutions to our own problems, as well as share our technical knowledge with other disease endemic countries,\" says Dr Hassan Mshinda, Director General of the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology.At an event to announce the winner during the annual World Health Assembly in May, WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said, “developing countries greatly need research and development for innovative tools. They consistently give public health its greatest leaps forward.\"TDR receives US$ 1 million as part of the award, which will be used to expand its fellowship and training programmes. The award was established by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to recognize organizations that have made outstanding contributions to improving health, especially in resource-poor settings. This year's winner was chosen by a jury of international health leaders from more than 150 nominations received from around the world. TDR joins 10 winners from past years of the Gates Award, which is administered by the Global Health Council.",

Residential wood and coal burning for space heating is an important contributor to air pollution, especially in rural areas during colder months.“Local actions, national policies and international agreements are all needed to curb pollution and reduce its widespread health effects\" said Dr Michal Krzyzanowski, Head of the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health in Bonn, Germany. \"Data from air quality monitoring that is released today, identify regions where action is most needed and allows us to assess the effectiveness of implemented policies and actions.”Notes to editors:Air quality data have been compiled from publicly available national or city-specific sources, which are based on results of air quality monitoring conducted by individual cities. The measurements used in the database are taken from monitoring sites in cities, including roadside, but excluding industrial and other recognized 'hot spots' that are not representative of the exposure of many people (e.g. crossings at highways) in order to avoid overestimates.Measurements as applied in the database, including reported PM10 levels, represent annual averages. PM10 is an important indicator of urban air pollution, and the health risks associated with the complex mixtures of pollutants typically found in cities. The smaller PM10 particles are able to penetrate deep into the lungs, and also to cross into the blood, causing damage in many organ systems. In some cities, measurements of even smaller particles such PM2.5 are available, and these are also included in the database.The data are based on measurements from 2003 to 2010, with the great majority being reported for the period 2008-2009. Data are presented for individual cities, urban populations of countries (as available), and for WHO regions.These air quality data sets, along with the latest updates of the related burden of disease, and corresponding frequently asked questions, are available online.",

      "description": "Noncommunicable diseases are the leading killer today and are on the increase, the first WHO Global status report on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) launched today confirms. In 20081, 36.1 million people died from conditions such as heart disease, strokes, chronic lung diseases, cancers and diabetes. Nearly 80% of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.Noncommunicable diseases a two-punch blow to development\"The rise of chronic noncommunicable diseases presents an enormous challenge,\" says WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan, who launched the report during the WHO Global Forum on addressing the challenge of noncommunicable diseases, being held today in Moscow, the Russian Federation. \"For some countries, it is no exaggeration to describe the situation as an impending disaster; a disaster for health, for society, and most of all for national economies.\"Dr Chan adds: \"Chronic noncommunicable diseases deliver a two-punch blow to development. They cause billions of dollars in losses of national income, and they push millions of people below the poverty line, each and every year.\"Millions of deaths can be preventedBut millions of deaths can be prevented by stronger implementation of measures that exist today. These include policies that promote government-wide action against NCDs: stronger anti-tobacco controls and promoting healthier diets, physical activity, and reducing harmful use of alcohol; along with improving people's access to essential health care.The Global status report on NCDs provides global, regional and country-specific statistics, evidence, and experiences needed to launch a more forceful response to the growing threat posed by chronic noncommunicable diseases. It provides a baseline to chart future NCD trends and responses in countries, including in terms of its socioeconomic impacts. The report provides advice and recommendations for all countries and pays special attention to conditions in low- and middle-income countries which are hardest hit by NCDs.Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, or 17 million people annually, followed by cancer (7.6 million), respiratory disease (4.2 million), and diabetes (1.3 million). These four groups of diseases account for around 80% of all NCD deaths, and share four common risk factors:tobacco usephysical inactivitythe harmful use of alcohol andpoor diets.Not just a problem of affluent societies\"About 30% of people dying from NCDs in low- and middle-income countries are aged under 60 years and are in their most productive period of life. These premature deaths are all the more tragic because they are largely preventable,\" says Dr Ala Alwan, WHO Assistant Director-General for Noncommunicable Diseases and Mental Health. \"This is a great loss, not just at an individual level, but also profoundly affect the family and a country's workforce. For the millions struggling with poverty, a vicious circle ensues. Poverty contributes to NCDs and NCDs contribute to poverty. Unless the epidemic of NCDs is aggressively confronted, the global goal of reducing poverty will be difficult to achieve.\"NCDs killed 63% of people who died worldwide in 2008. This equals 36 million and nearly 80% of these NCD deaths - equivalent to 29 million people - occurred in low- and middle-income countries, dispelling the myth that such conditions are mainly a problem of affluent societies. Without action, the NCD epidemic is projected to kill 52 million people annually by 2030.Country-by-country estimates of the NCDsThe WHO report provides country-by-country estimates of the NCDs epidemic and their risk factors, the challenges blocking many countries from taking effective action, and measures that can save millions of lives and reduce spiralling health-care costs.Such measures include implementing the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, such as raising taxes on tobacco, banning tobacco advertising and legislating to curb smoking in public places. Other measures include reducing levels of salt in foods, stopping the inappropriate marketing of unhealthy food and non-alcoholic beverages to children, and controls on harmful alcohol use.An action planThis new report is a key component of the 2008-2013 Action Plan for the implementation of the WHO Global Strategy on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases. This Action Plan was endorsed by the 2008 World Health Assembly. It provides countries a roadmap for taking action against NCDs, including raising the priority of NCD control, improving disease surveillance, enabling governments to take comprehensive action against the diseases, and protecting countries, particularly developing, from the burden of the epidemic.The report was launched during the WHO Global Forum on NCDs, which has attracted around 300 key figures from the civil and private sectors, academia, and others to urge greater action against this group of diseases. The Forum provides direct feedback to the 28-29 April First Global Ministerial Conference on Healthy Lifestyles and NCD Control, organized by the Russian Federation and WHO.These two events are key milestones in the build-up to the first-ever UN General Assembly High-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of NCDs, being held in New York, the United States of America, on 19-20 September, 2011.",

      "description": "An increasing number of countries are facing a double burden of disease as the prevalence of risk factors for chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases and cancers increase and many countries still struggle to reduce maternal and child deaths caused by infectious diseases, for the Millennium Development Goals, according to the World Health Statistics 2011 released by the WHO today.Noncommunicable diseases such heart diseases, stroke, diabetes and cancer, now make up two-thirds of all deaths globally, due to the population aging and the spread of risk factors associated with globalization and urbanization. The control of risk factors such as tobacco use, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet and excessive use of alcohol becomes more critical. The latest WHO figures showed that about 4 out of 10 men and 1 in 11 women are using tobacco and about 1 in 8 adults is obese.In addition many developing countries continue to battle health issues such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria that are most likely to kill children under the age of five. In 2009, 40% of all child deaths were among newborns (aged 28 days or less). Much more needs to be done to achieve the MDGs by the target date of 2015, but progress has accelerated.Child mortality declined at 2.7% per year since 2000, twice as fast as during the 1990s (1.3%). Mortality among children under five years fell from 12.4 million in 1990 to 8.1 million in 2009.Maternal mortality declined at 3.3% per year since 2000, almost twice as fast in the decade after 2000 than during the 1990s (2%). The number of women dying as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth has decreased from 546,000 in 1990 to 358,000 in 2008.\"This evidence really shows that no country in the world can address health from either an infectious disease perspective or a noncommunicable disease one. Everyone must develop a health system that addresses the full range of the health threats in both areas.\" says Ties Boerma, Director of WHO's Department of Health Statistics and Informatics.The report also shows that more money is being spent on health and people can expect to live longer (life expectancy in 2009 was 68 years, up from 64 years in 1990); but the gap in health spending between low- and high-income countries remains very large.In low-income countries, per capita, health expenditure is an estimated US$ 32 (or about 5.4% of gross domestic product) and in high-income countries it is US$ 4590 (or about 11% of gross domestic product).High-income countries have, per capita, on average 10 times more doctors, 12 times more nurses and midwives and 30 times more dentists than low-income countries.Virtually all deliveries of babies in high-income countries are attended by skilled health personnel; but this is the case for only 40% of deliveries in low-income countries.World Health Statistics 2011 is an annual report based on more than 100 health indicators reported by WHO's 193 Member States and other reliable sources. These data provide a snapshot of the global health situation and trends. However, timely, accurate health information is hard to obtain in some parts of the world, because the country health information systems are weak.\"While the World Health Statistics 2011 provide clear evidence of the improvements occurring in information gathering, there are still large gaps in global health data,\" says Colin Mathers, Coordinator of Mortality and Burden of Disease at WHO. \"WHO is committed to working with its Member States, other UN agencies and partners to continue to improve the information available to monitor the health of the world's people and the effectiveness of health systems and interventions.\"The release of the report coincides with the launch of WHO's new Global Health Observatory, a new website that serves as a one-stop shop for data and analyses on health priorities around the world. The Observatory provides easy access to the world's largest and most comprehensive collection of health data, bringing together WHO's data from all major health and disease programmes. It includes easy access to over 50 databases and 800 indicators with analyses of the global health situation and trends, covering priority health topics such as child, maternal and reproductive health, infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases and risk factors, environmental health, mortality and burden of diseases, road safety, health systems and equity. An online version of the World Health Statistics dataset is also available through the Observatory.",

    "content_html": "<p>The Sixty-fourth World Health Assembly, with more than 2700 delegates, including Health Ministers and senior health officials, nongovernment organizations, civil society groups and other observers concluded business on Tuesday afternoon.</p><h3>A productive Assembly</h3><p>The World Health Assembly spent eight days working through a broad agenda developed by the previous Executive Board. In the end, 28 resolutions and three decisions were adopted to guide the upcoming work of the Organization and to address priority global health issues.</p><p>\"I believe this has been an especially productive and profoundly effective Assembly,\" says Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization. \"These World Health Assemblies are having a tremendous impact on the health of this world.\"</p><p>After opening speeches from Dr Chan, Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh, and Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the policy work of the Health Assembly began with a presentation of outcomes from the independent Review Committee which reviewed WHO's response to the influenza pandemic and the International Health Regulations. After a year of investigation, the committee agreed that the International Health Regulations helped better prepare the world to cope with public health emergencies but that the world is currently ill prepared to respond to a severe pandemic or to any other public health emergency on a similarly global and threatening scale. In addition, the Committee declared that the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was indeed a real pandemic and found no evidence WHO was influenced by industry in its decision making.</p><h3>Improving global preparedness for future pandemics</h3><p>In another agenda item aimed to improve global preparedness for future pandemics, delegates approved a framework for pandemic influenza preparedness, the culmination of four years of negotiation between WHO's Member States. The framework will improve influenza virus sharing and access to vaccines and other benefits. Member States agreed the framework lays the groundwork for better preparedness and better access to tools and knowledge. The next phase is to ensure the implementation of the agreement.</p><h3>WHO reform</h3><p>The Organization's budget for 2012-2013 was also discussed and adopted. The program budget of US$ 3.959 billion was recognized by the delegates as a transitional budget that will help the Organization respond to financial austerity and prepare for a series of reforms underway.</p><p>There was robust discussion at the Assembly on the proposed programme of WHO reform. Countries welcomed and supported the reforms and wanted to be kept informed and involved, especially on the reforms related to global health governance.</p><p>\"The most important message for me was your clear consensus on the need for reform and your clear desire to see these reforms reinforce WHO's position as the foremost authority on international health,\" says Dr Chan.</p><h3>Noncommunicable diseases</h3><p>Delegates and other partners engaged in a lengthy discussion on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancers, and chronic respiratory diseases. NCDs pose one of the greatest challenges to health and development today and contribute to more than 60 percent of deaths worldwide. Delegates unanimously endorsed the World Health Assembly resolution on the preparations for the United Nations General Assembly high-level meeting on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases being held this September. Delegates urged heads of state and government to attend the meeting in New York.</p><h3>Five resolutions to strengthen health systems</h3><p>Progress on prevention and control of NCD and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will require strong health systems and the Assembly recognized the importance of this area of work. The delegates approved five resolutions to strengthen health systems including strategies to strengthen nursing and midwifery, actions to improve the health workforce through effective implementation of the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel, and efforts to improve national policy dialogue to build more robust health policies, strategies and plans. In addition two other resolutions encourage sustainable health financing structures and universal coverage of health care and services, and focus on strengthening national health emergency and disaster management capacities and resilience of health systems.</p><h3>Resolutions and reports support health-related MDGs</h3><p>Health-related MDGs received support with resolutions and reports on immunization strategy, infant and young child nutrition, child injury prevention, youth health risks, malaria, and the presentation of the final report of the Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health.</p><ul><li>The progress report on the global immunization vision and strategy was widely supported. Delegates highlighted their country's achievements in increasing immunization coverage, reducing vaccine-preventable deaths and implementing advocacy events such as the regional immunization weeks. But they also recognized that several challenges remain, including mobilizing more resources to strengthen national immunization programmes; ensuring a balanced approach in strengthening immunization systems; introducing new vaccines; preventing a resurgence of measles through high vaccination coverage; and facilitating vaccine technology transfer to developing countries. The work outlined in the strategy will contribute to overcoming these challenges.<br/> </li><li>Member States commend WHO's leadership and collaboration with UNICEF, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and other partners on the Decade of Vaccines -- a vision for using the next 10 years to achieve immunization goals and reach important milestones in vaccine research, development, financing and public support.<br/> </li><li>Member States also discussed the outline of an implementation plan for maternal, infant and young child nutrition. The plan, currently under development, tackles the double burden of undernutrition and overweight and focuses on the window of opportunity between conception and the second year of life. More than 100 million children under age five were underweight in 2010 and more than 170 million were stunted because of it, according to WHO figures. In addition, some 43 million children were estimated to be overweight and obese in 2010, putting them at risk of serious health conditions in future years.<br/> </li><li>The World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on child injury prevention. The resolution provides a platform to support action on preventing child injuries, which are the leading cause of death for children over the age of 5. More than 830 000 children die each year from road traffic crashes, drowning, burns, falls and poisoning. Effective interventions to prevent these injuries exist, and include enforcement of speed limits around schools, placing children in child-restraints in the back seat of a vehicle, removing or covering water hazards, installing smoke alarms, and setting up poison control centres.<br/> </li><li>Young people (10-24 years old) currently represent one quarter of the world's population, and Member States agreed to focus on preventing health risks specifically associated with this age group. A resolution calls Member States to step up their efforts on youth health to attain the health-related MDGs. Work should focus on preventing HIV and pregnancy during adolescence, and preventing the adoption of risk behaviours (e.g. tobacco and harmful use of alcohol) linked to non-communicable diseases.<br/> </li><li>The Health Assembly adopted a resolution on malaria calling on Member States to keep malaria high on the political and development agendas in order to sustain the tremendous gains made during the past decade, and calling on international partners to ensure adequate and predictable funding so that global malaria targets for 2015 can be met. The resolution highlighted the need for continued universal coverage with malaria vector control for at-risk persons, expanded access to diagnostic testing for suspected malaria and treatment for confirmed cases, and strengthened malaria surveillance systems. The need to implement the WHO Global Plan for Artemisinin Resistance Containment, and to develop a global plan for insecticide resistance management in malaria vectors, were also emphasized.<br/> </li><li>In an effort to support the UN's Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health, the delegations welcomed the final report of the Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health. They agreed that the ten recommendations in the report will increase the likelihood that pledges are honoured and will help ensure that resources are spent in the most effective way to save lives. The delegates urged Member States to implement the recommendations, requested the Executive Board hold a discussion in January 2012 on the implementation of the recommendations and also requested a progress report for the next Health Assembly.<br/> </li></ul><h3>A new, comprehensive strategy to combat HIV</h3><p>The Health Assembly adopted a new, comprehensive strategy to combat HIV, The Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV/AIDS, 2011-2015, which will guide actions by WHO and countries around the world during this critical time for the future of the HIV response. At least 4.2 million new HIV infections would be averted and 2 million lives could be saved, if WHO's existing HIV treatment recommendations were fully implemented in 2011-2015. Under the new Strategy, WHO aims to promote greater innovation in HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care services so that countries can achieve the goal of universal access to HIV services.</p><h3>Resolution on health conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory</h3><p>The WHA adopted a resolution on health conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan. The need for universal coverage of health services was reaffirmed while recognizing that the acute shortage of financial and medical resources is jeopardizing access of the population to curative and preventive services. The Assembly requested the WHO Director-General continue to meet the health needs of Palestinian people and the Syrian population in the occupied Syrian Golan.</p><h3>Reaffirmed that the remaining stock of smallpox virus should be destroyed</h3><p>The Health Assembly strongly reaffirmed the decision of previous Assemblies that the remaining stock of smallpox (variola) virus should be destroyed when crucial research based on the virus has been completed. The state of variola virus research will be reviewed at the 67th World Health Assembly in 2014 and in light of that, determining a date for destruction of the remaining virus stocks will be discussed.</p><h3>Annual report on the eradication guinea-worm disease</h3><p>The delegates adopted a resolution paving the way for an annual report on the eradication of dracunculiasis (more commonly known as guinea-worm disease) to be presented every year beginning with the next Health Assembly. Dracunculiasis is the second disease which is approaching eradication (the first being smallpox) and it occurs only after people drink contaminated water. Previously it was responsible for millions of infections across Africa and Asia. The disease mainly occurs in remote poverty-stricken areas, with limited or no access to safe drinking water.</p><h3>Strong commitment to polio eradication</h3><p>The global health community sent a sign of strong commitment to polio eradication with discussion focusing on the 'significant advances' since the launch of a new strategic plan and new, bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine in 2010. In India and Nigeria -- the source of all importations of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free countries in recent years -- polio cases declined by 95% between 2009 and 2010; during the same period polio cases due to the type 3 virus declined by 92% globally. Delegates called for strong national and subnational leadership by political authorities for the implementation of polio eradication strategies and highlighted the need for countries to significantly strengthen routine immunization. Delegates expressed particular concern over the funding gap of US$ 665 million to fully carry out polio eradication activities in 2011 and 2012. Delegates requested WHO to provide additional technical support to countries with ongoing, re-established polio transmission (Angola, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo), to continue to pursue research for post-eradication risk management and to help countries maintain high-quality surveillance and population immunity until eradication is complete globally.</p><h3>Improving access to quality and affordable medical products</h3><p>The WHA also discussed the report from the working group of Member States on Substandard/Spurious/Falsely-Labelled/Falsified/Counterfeit Medical Products on improving access to quality and affordable medical products. They also approved the decision to extend the working group to resume its work and report to the next World Health Assembly.</p><h3>Protecting health from climate change</h3><p>Member States welcomed the priority that WHO has placed on protecting health from climate change, and reinforced their own commitment, citing new initiatives from Regional Ministerial meetings to new implementation projects.</p><h3>Revitalizing the Global Task Force on Cholera Control</h3><p>Delegates agreed that cholera remains public health threat for many countries and the incidence is on the rise. They expressed the urgent need for effective public health interventions, such as solid surveillance systems, improved environmental management, access to clean water and proper sanitation, and the adequate use of cholera vaccines as a complementary measure. Cholera was recognized as an indicator of how well the environment is managed. Member States underscored the need to revitalize the Global Task Force on Cholera Control and emphasized the need to scale up advocacy measures.</p><h3>Improving access to safe water and sanitation</h3><p>The WHA adopted a resolution to reinvigorate efforts in clean drinking water, sanitation and health. Waterborne diseases continue to kill more than two million people per year. Member states called for WHO to strengthen its major normative functions on water and health, and expand its monitoring role of progress toward access to safe water and sanitation. The resolution also underscores the need for continued capacity development by strengthening health policy at all levels.</p><h3>Protect public health from chemicals and waste</h3><p>Delegations acknowledged the need to better handle chemicals and waste management to protect public health. They agreed that special attention should be given to the management of pesticides and other chemicals to prevent stockpiles of unwanted chemicals accumulating and to prevent human exposure through contaminated air and water. As a follow-up to the phasing out of mercury from health care facilities, Member States requested WHO through the Libreville Declaration on Health and Environment and other global initiatives to maintain health care waste management as a priority issue on its public health agenda, to protect the environment and ensure safety of staff, waste workers and communities.</p><p>The World Health Assembly is held annually in Geneva, Switzerland and is the decision-making body of the WHO. It is attended by delegations from all WHO Member States and focuses on a specific health agenda prepared by the Executive Board. The main functions of the World Health Assembly are to determine the policies of the Organization, appoint the Director-General in election years, supervise financial policies, and review and approve the proposed programme budget.</p>",

After a year of investigation, the committee agreed that the International Health Regulations helped better prepare the world to cope with public health emergencies but that the world is currently ill prepared to respond to a severe pandemic or to any other public health emergency on a similarly global and threatening scale. In addition, the Committee declared that the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was indeed a real pandemic and found no evidence WHO was influenced by industry in its decision making."

The disease mainly occurs in remote poverty-stricken areas, with limited or no access to safe drinking water.Strong commitment to polio eradicationThe global health community sent a sign of strong commitment to polio eradication with discussion focusing on the 'significant advances' since the launch of a new strategic plan and new, bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine in 2010. In India and Nigeria -- the source of all importations of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free countries in recent years -- polio cases declined by 95% between 2009 and 2010; during the same period polio cases due to the type 3 virus declined by 92% globally. Delegates called for strong national and subnational leadership by political authorities for the implementation of polio eradication strategies and highlighted the need for countries to significantly strengthen routine immunization. Delegates expressed particular concern over the funding gap of US$ 665 million to fully carry out polio eradication activities in 2011 and 2012. Delegates requested WHO to provide additional technical support to countries with ongoing, re-established polio transmission (Angola, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo), to continue to pursue research for post-eradication risk management and to help countries maintain high-quality surveillance and population immunity until eradication is complete globally.Improving access to quality and affordable medical productsThe WHA also discussed the report from the working group of Member States on Substandard/Spurious/Falsely-Labelled/Falsified/Counterfeit Medical Products on improving access to quality and affordable medical products. They also approved the decision to extend the working group to resume its work and report to the next World Health Assembly.Protecting health from climate changeMember States welcomed the priority that WHO has placed on protecting health from climate change, and reinforced their own commitment, citing new initiatives from Regional Ministerial meetings to new implementation projects.Revitalizing the Global Task Force on Cholera ControlDelegates agreed that cholera remains public health threat for many countries and the incidence is on the rise. They expressed the urgent need for effective public health interventions, such as solid surveillance systems, improved environmental management, access to clean water and proper sanitation, and the adequate use of cholera vaccines as a complementary measure. Cholera was recognized as an indicator of how well the environment is managed. Member States underscored the need to revitalize the Global Task Force on Cholera Control and emphasized the need to scale up advocacy measures.Improving access to safe water and sanitationThe WHA adopted a resolution to reinvigorate efforts in clean drinking water, sanitation and health. Waterborne diseases continue to kill more than two million people per year. Member states called for WHO to strengthen its major normative functions on water and health, and expand its monitoring role of progress toward access to safe water and sanitation. The resolution also underscores the need for continued capacity development by strengthening health policy at all levels.Protect public health from chemicals and wasteDelegations acknowledged the need to better handle chemicals and waste management to protect public health. They agreed that special attention should be given to the management of pesticides and other chemicals to prevent stockpiles of unwanted chemicals accumulating and to prevent human exposure through contaminated air and water. As a follow-up to the phasing out of mercury from health care facilities, Member States requested WHO through the Libreville Declaration on Health and Environment and other global initiatives to maintain health care waste management as a priority issue on its public health agenda, to protect the environment and ensure safety of staff, waste workers and communities.The World Health Assembly is held annually in Geneva, Switzerland and is the decision-making body of the WHO. It is attended by delegations from all WHO Member States and focuses on a specific health agenda prepared by the Executive Board. The main functions of the World Health Assembly are to determine the policies of the Organization, appoint the Director-General in election years, supervise financial policies, and review and approve the proposed programme budget.",

Under the theme \"Combat Drug Resistance\", WHO calls for urgent and concerted action by governments, health professionals, industry and civil society and patients to slow down the spread of drug resistance, limit its impact today and preserve medical advances for future generations.</p><h3>On the brink of losing miracle cures</h3><p>“The message on this World Health Day is loud and clear. The world is on the brink of losing these miracle cures,” said WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan. “In the absence of urgent corrective and protective actions, the world is heading towards a post-antibiotic era, in which many common infections will no longer have a cure and, once again, kill unabated.”</p><h3>Measures to combat drug resistance</h3><p>Today, WHO is publishing a policy package that sets out the measures governments and their national partners need to combat drug resistance. The policy steps recommended by WHO include:</p><ul><li>develop and implement a comprehensive, financed national plan</li><li>strengthen surveillance and laboratory capacity</li><li>ensure uninterrupted access to essential medicines of assured quality</li><li>regulate and promote rational use of medicines</li><li>enhance infection prevention and control</li><li>foster innovation and research and development for new tools.</li></ul><p>The discovery and use of antimicrobial drugs to treat diseases such as leprosy, tuberculosis, gonorrhea and syphilis changed the course of medical and human history. Now, those discoveries and the generations of drugs that followed them are at risk, as high levels of drug resistance threaten their effectiveness.</p><p>Drug resistance is a natural biological phenomenon, through which microorganisms acquire resistance to the drugs meant to kill them. With each new generation, the microorganism carrying the resistant gene becomes ever more dominant until the drug is completely ineffective. Inappropriate use of infection-fighting drugs (underuse, overuse or misuse) causes resistance to emerge faster.</p><h3>Resistance detected in a number of diseases</h3><p>Last year, at least 440 000 new cases of multidrug resistant-tuberculosis were detected and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis has been reported in 69 countries to date. The malaria parasite is acquiring resistance to even the latest generation of medicines, and resistant strains causing gonorrhea and shigella are limiting treatment options. Serious infections acquired in hospitals can become fatal because they are so difficult to treat and drug-resistant strains of microorganism are spread from one geographical location to another in today's interconnected and globalized world. Resistance is also emerging to the antiretroviral medicines used to treat people living with HIV.</p><h3>Getting everyone on the right track</h3><p>“On this World Health Day, WHO is issuing a policy package to get everyone, especially governments and their drug regulatory systems, on the right track, with the right measures, quickly,” said Dr Chan. “The trends are clear and ominous. No action today means no cure tomorrow. At a time of multiple calamities in the world, we cannot allow the loss of essential medicines – essential cures for many millions of people – to become the next global crisis.”</p><p>\"WHO has established many initiatives to understand and address drug resistance over the last decade, particularly in relation to some of the world's most deadly infectious diseases,\" said Dr Mario Raviglione, Director of WHO Stop TB Department, who has been leading the preparations for World Health Day 2011. \"Those measures must now be further strengthened and implemented urgently across many diseases and across many sectors. New collaborations, led by governments working alongside civil society and health professionals, if accountable, can halt the public health threat of drug resistance.\"</p><h3>Everyone can make a contribution</h3><p>Although governments need to take the lead and develop national policies to combat drug resistance, health professionals, civil society and other groups can also make important contributions. For example, doctors and pharmacists can prescribe and dispense only the drugs that are required to treat a patient, rather than automatically giving either the newest or best-known medicines. Patients can stop demanding that doctors give them antibiotics when they may not be appropriate. Health professionals can help rapidly reduce the spread of infection in health care facilities.</p><p>Collaboration between human and animal health and agriculture professionals is also vital, as the use of antibiotics in food animal production contributes to increased drug resistance. Approximately half of current antibiotic production is used in agriculture, to promote growth and prevent disease as well as to treat sick animals. With such massive use, those drug resistant microbes generated in animals can be later transferred to humans.</p><p>Governments and partners need to work closely with industry to encourage greater investment in research and development of new diagnostics that can help improve decision making as well as drugs to replace those that are being lost to resistance. Today, less than five per cent of products in the research and development pipeline are antibiotic drugs. Innovative incentive schemes are needed to stimulate industry to research and develop new antimicrobial drugs for the future.</p>",

      "description": "Health workers are at the frontline in providing prevention, treatment and care for people living with HIV and TB throughout the world. They are at risk of occupational exposure to HIV and TB but often themselves lack adequate access to protection and treatment. To address this gap, new international guidelines are being launched today by the International Labour Organization (ILO), WHO and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).The new guidelines are important particularly for health workers in areas with high prevalence of HIV and TB, such as doctors, nurses and midwives, technical staff such as pharmacists and laboratory technicians, as well as health managers, cleaners, security guards and other support workers. There are an estimated 60 million health workers throughout the world.“These guidelines directly aim to ensure that health workers have access to universal and standard precautions, preventive therapy for tuberculosis, HIV post-exposure prophylaxis, treatment, compensation schemes for occupational infection, and social security or occupational insurance at the workplace,” said Mr. Assane Diop, ILO Executive Director for the Social Protection Sector.Attention to the needs of health workersWhile UNAIDS, ILO and WHO have been championing universal access and making sure people have the right to access prevention, treatment, care and support for HIV and TB services, not enough attention has been paid to the needs of health workers. These guidelines help fill the response gap to reach towards the universal access objective.\"WHO recognizes health workers' risk of acquiring HIV or TB and the need for comprehensive occupational health and safety procedures,\" said Dr Hiroki Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. \"These new guidelines provide key recommendations to protect health workers, patients and their families from the significant threat of HIV and TB in all our health facilities.”Guidelines- 14 action pointsThe 14 action points provided in the guidelines are based on respect for workers' rights as well as practical workplace health and safety programmes to ensure a safer work environment, active participation of health workers as well as public and private health services employers. The guidelines also address challenges such as the high level of stigma and discrimination associated with both diseases.“Health workers are one of our most precious resources in the global response to both HIV and TB,” said Dr Paul De Lay, UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director. “These new guidelines can ensure that health staff have access to the highest standards of TB and HIV prevention, treatment and care so they can stay healthy and continue caring for others.”The new guidelines also drew strong support from the ILO’s employer and worker constituents, with Mr. Antonio Peñalosa, Secretary-General of the International Organization of Employers (IOE), calling them “a useful tool to assist the health care sector in staff retention and motivation.”Sharan Burrow, General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, called them “a major breakthrough,” adding, “With these guidelines, the ILO, WHO and UNAIDS are providing an important and scientifically sound basis for safe working environments that prevent health workers’ infections caused by exposure at work.”Recent surveys show that health workers prefer convenient and cost-effective solutions, including having dedicated HIV and TB services at their workplaces, and linking them to other occupational health services.The guidelines which were developed jointly by experts from ILO,WHO and UNAIDS are based on systematic literature reviews, international consultations and an assessment of current practices in 21 country-based studies. They bring together a vast body of evidence and existing guidelines from the ILO, WHO and UNAIDS that now includes a specific and coherent focus on protecting health workers.",

A decrease of more than 50% in the number of confirmed cases of malaria was also found in 32 of the 56 malaria-endemic countries outside Africa during this same time period, while downward trends of 25%–50% were seen in eight additional countries.

By maintaining these essential gains, we can end malaria deaths by 2015.”</p><h4>Strategies to fight malaria</h4><p>The strategies to fight malaria continue to evolve. Earlier this year, WHO recommended that all suspected cases of malaria be confirmed by a diagnostic test before antimalarial drugs are administered. It is no longer appropriate to assume that every person with a fever has malaria and needs antimalarial treatment. Inexpensive, quality-assured rapid diagnostic tests are now available that can be used by all health care workers, including at peripheral health facilities and at the community level. Using these tests improves the quality of care for individual patients, cuts down the over-prescribing of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) and guards against the spread of resistance to these medicines.</p><h4>Fragility of malaria control</h4><p>While progress in reducing the burden of malaria has been remarkable, resurgences in cases were observed in parts of at least three African countries (Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, and Zambia). The reasons for these resurgences are not known with certainty but illustrate the fragility of malaria control and the need to maintain intervention coverage even if numbers of cases have been reduced substantially.</p><h4>Work remains to attain targets</h4><p>The report stressed that while considerable progress has been made, much work remains in order to attain international targets for malaria control.</p><ul><li>Financial disbursements reached their highest ever levels in 2009 at US$ 1.5 billion, but new commitments for malaria control appear to have levelled-off in 2010, at US$ 1.8 billion. The amounts committed to malaria, while substantial, still fall short of the resources required for malaria control, estimated at more than US$ 6 billion for the year 2010.</li><li>In 2010, more African households (42%) owned at least one ITN, and more children under five years of age were using an ITN (35%) compared to previous years. Household ITN ownership reached more than 50% in 19 African countries. The percentage of children using ITNs is still below the World Health Assembly target of 80% partly because up to the end of 2009, ITN ownership remained low in some of the largest African countries.</li><li>The proportion of reported cases in Africa confirmed with a diagnostic test has risen substantially from less than 5% at the beginning of the decade to approximately 35% in 2009, but low rates persist in the majority of African countries and in a minority of countries in other regions.</li><li>By the end of 2009, 11 African countries were providing sufficient courses of ACTs to cover more than 100% of malaria cases seen in the public sector; a further 5 African countries delivered sufficient courses to treat 50%–100% of cases. These figures represent a substantial increase since 2005, when only five countries were providing sufficient courses of ACT to cover more than 50% of patients treated in the public sector.</li><li>The number of deaths due to malaria is estimated to have decreased from 985 000 in 2000 to 781 000 in 2009.

      "description": "The 62nd World Health Assembly opened today in Geneva, as officials from 193 member countries began their annual review of the activities of the WHO and set new priorities for the future.In her address to the Health Assembly, WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan noted that the world was facing multiple crises, including the current financial crisis and global economic downturn. In addition to this, it also faced the prospect of the first influenza pandemic of this century.She said that the world today was more vulnerable to the adverse effects of an influenza pandemic than it was in 1968, when the last pandemic began. The increase in air travel meant that any city with an international airport was at risk of an imported case. Global economic interdependence amplified the potential for economic disruption.Under these circumstances, it was vital to see that no part of the world suffered disproportionately. \"We have to care about equity. We have to care about fair play,\" she said.Dr Chan noted that 85% of the burden of chronic diseases was concentrated in low-income and middle-income countries, which meant that the developing world had by far the largest pool of people at risk for severe and fatal H1N1 infections.She urged the international community to look at everything that could be done to collectively protect developing countries from bearing the brunt of an influenza pandemic.The Director-General said she had reached out to manufacturers of antiviral drugs and vaccines, to Member States, donor countries and UN agencies, civil society organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and foundations to stress the need to extend preparation and mitigation measures to the developing world. The United Nations Secretary-General had joined her in these efforts.With regard to the criteria for a move to Phase 6, Dr Chan said she had listened to the comments made by Member States during a high-level consultation earlier in the day. \"As the chief technical officer of this Organization, I will follow your instructions closely, particularly concerning criteria for a move to Phase 6, in discharging my duties and responsibilities to Member States.\"The Director-General said that concerns about a pandemic should not overshadow, or interrupt other vital health programmes. She said that an effective public health response to threats depended on strong health systems that were inclusive, and offered universal coverage down to the community level. Adequate numbers of trained, motivated and compensated staff, as well as fair access to affordable medical products and other interventions were all required for an effective public health response to the current situation.She urged delegations in particular to complete work under the item on public health, innovation and intellectual property. The International Health Regulations and the need to finish the job of polio eradication were all important issues.Dr Chan also referred to the proposed programme budget which will be discussed by the World Health Assembly, and said that \"WHO is prepared to lead the response to a global public health emergency. Our services, in several areas, are strained, but we are coping. We need to be assured that we continue to function well, especially if the emergency escalates.\"",

    "content_html": "<p> </p>\n<p>Zimbabwe's cholera outbreak, one of the world's largest ever recorded, is far from being brought under control. An enhanced response is needed to urgently reverse an epidemic that has so far infected more than 60,000 people and killed more than 3,100 since August 2008.</p>\n<p>\"The World Health Organization and other international and local partners are supporting the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare's (MoHCW) efforts to control the epidemic. But unless drastic action is taken by all players in this crisis, more Zimbabweans will succumb to the outbreak, and other countries in the southern African region will face the continued threat of spill over epidemics,\" said Dr Eric Laroche, Assistant Director-General for WHO's Health Action in Crises Cluster.</p>\n<p>Urgent measures needed in Zimbabwe include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increasing awareness, particularly at grassroots level, regarding prevention and treatment measures. Most recorded deaths have occurred at home, which means that more effective messaging directed at all communities, particularly the remotest parts of the country, is crucial for the Zimbabwean public to be best prepared to act against the epidemic.</li>\n<li>making available more medicines, particularly oral rehydration salts (ORS) and chlorine tablets, at community level so health care workers, and ordinary people themselves, have the means to quickly treat cases of cholera that emerge. One of the greatest challenges is ensuring people can access health services. As this is not possible for many people, due to limited access to transport or money to pay for the trip to the health facility, stocks of simple yet life-saving supplies, such as ORS and chlorine tablets, must be provided to each community.</li>\n<li>mobilizing resources to pay thousands of Zimbabwean doctors, nurses and other health staff who have been unable to obtain salaries and have not had enough money for basic needs, such as buying a bus ticket to get to work. This vacuum in availability of national health staff is a prime factor in the increasing number of cholera sufferers dying.</li>\n<li>opening access to more nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to respond to the cholera outbreak in more areas of the country. Currently, NGOs, such as Médecins Sans Frontières, are operating large numbers of cholera treatment centres and units in areas where other support, including government, is not available. Such activities must be promoted so to increase access to health care, particularly at district level.</li>\n<li>strengthening the multisectoral response being provided by all players - United Nations, NGOs, governments and donors - is vital. More effort is needed in multiple areas, including improved case management, water and sanitation, social mobilization, provision of financial resources to health providers operating in Zimbabwe, and increasing health staff in the field.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"We are dealing with an extraordinary public health crisis that requires from us all an extraordinary public health emergency response, and this must happen now before the outbreak causes more needless suffering and death,\" Dr Laroche said. \"Political differences need to be put aside, economic barriers overcome, health services in the country's periphery strengthened and community awareness to respond enhanced to save many more people from dying due to a disease that can be readily prevented and treated.\"</p>\n<p>As of 29 January, 2009, that number had reached 60 401, with 3161 deaths, and showed no signs of abating. All 10 provinces, as well as neighbouring countries, have been affected. Although the Case Fatality Rate has decreased slightly, it is still above 5%, with about three times more deaths being recorded at community level rather than within health facilities. The acceptable level should be below 1%. Neighbouring South Africa has also reported 3000 cases, but the strength of its health care and water and sanitation systems have seen the case fatality rate remain below 1%.</p>\n<p>WHO and its partners have worked efficiently with the MoHCW to date to respond to the outbreak, including by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>establishing a Cholera Command and Control Centre in the capital, Harare, to coordinate and strengthen alert, response, case management, social mobilization and logistics activities.</li>\n<li>mobilizing an outbreak response team of more than 40 experts, including national and international disease control specialists from across WHO.

      "description": "Zimbabwe's cholera outbreak, one of the world's largest ever recorded, is far from being brought under control. An enhanced response is needed to urgently reverse an epidemic that has so far infected more than 60,000 people and killed more than 3,100 since August 2008.\"The World Health Organization and other international and local partners are supporting the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare's (MoHCW) efforts to control the epidemic. But unless drastic action is taken by all players in this crisis, more Zimbabweans will succumb to the outbreak, and other countries in the southern African region will face the continued threat of spill over epidemics,\" said Dr Eric Laroche, Assistant Director-General for WHO's Health Action in Crises Cluster.Urgent measures needed in Zimbabwe include:increasing awareness, particularly at grassroots level, regarding prevention and treatment measures. Most recorded deaths have occurred at home, which means that more effective messaging directed at all communities, particularly the remotest parts of the country, is crucial for the Zimbabwean public to be best prepared to act against the epidemic.making available more medicines, particularly oral rehydration salts (ORS) and chlorine tablets, at community level so health care workers, and ordinary people themselves, have the means to quickly treat cases of cholera that emerge.

More effort is needed in multiple areas, including improved case management, water and sanitation, social mobilization, provision of financial resources to health providers operating in Zimbabwe, and increasing health staff in the field.\"We are dealing with an extraordinary public health crisis that requires from us all an extraordinary public health emergency response, and this must happen now before the outbreak causes more needless suffering and death,\" Dr Laroche said. \"Political differences need to be put aside, economic barriers overcome, health services in the country's periphery strengthened and community awareness to respond enhanced to save many more people from dying due to a disease that can be readily prevented and treated.\"As of 29 January, 2009, that number had reached 60 401, with 3161 deaths, and showed no signs of abating. All 10 provinces, as well as neighbouring countries, have been affected. Although the Case Fatality Rate has decreased slightly, it is still above 5%, with about three times more deaths being recorded at community level rather than within health facilities. The acceptable level should be below 1%. Neighbouring South Africa has also reported 3000 cases, but the strength of its health care and water and sanitation systems have seen the case fatality rate remain below 1%.WHO and its partners have worked efficiently with the MoHCW to date to respond to the outbreak, including by:establishing a Cholera Command and Control Centre in the capital, Harare, to coordinate and strengthen alert, response, case management, social mobilization and logistics activities.mobilizing an outbreak response team of more than 40 experts, including national and international disease control specialists from across WHO.

      "description": "In Geneva this Friday, a broad range of stakeholders will formally launch the new Strategic Plan 2010-2012 for eradicating wild poliovirus.Polio eradication sits at a critical junctureAcross Africa, 10 of the 15 previously polio-free countries re-infected in 2009 have successfully stopped their outbreaks1. Key endemic countries are witnessing historic gains against the disease. Nowhere is progress more evident than Nigeria, where case numbers have plummeted by more than 99% – from 312 cases at this time last year, to three in 2010. In India, for the first time ever, the remaining endemic states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have not reported any wild poliovirus type 1 cases concurrently for more than six months.Time to build upon gains already made in 2010This meeting in Geneva is being held to build on the gains already made in 2010 and to galvanize new action on polio eradication. Last month, the World Health Assembly welcomed the new plan while expressing deep concern about the US$ 1.3 billion funding shortfall (out of a budget of US$ 2.6 billion) over the next three years. This financing shortfall is a serious risk to the eradication of polio – activities are already being cut back or postponed due to a lack of funds.The Ministers of Health of Nigeria, Afghanistan, Angola and Senegal, among a number of other senior health ministry officials, existing and potential funders, vaccine manufacturers and key partner organizations will attend the meeting – co-hosted by WHO Director-General Margaret Chan and the new UNICEF Executive Director Tony Lake – to discuss the implementation, monitoring, economics and financing of the new plan.WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan called on the international funding community to stand tall for polio eradication. \"The next three years, and especially the next 12 months, are critical to the polio eradication initiative and, by extension, the entire international public health agenda.\"Plan builds on major lessons learntThe new plan builds on major lessons learnt to date, including findings from a major independent evaluation examining the remaining barriers to eradication. It introduces district- and area-specific strategies to target the ever-shrinking remaining reservoirs of poliovirus, exploits the game-changing bivalent oral polio vaccine to increase the impact of immunizations, and tackles health system weaknesses. The success of this plan now hinges on implementation of activities at field level and the provision of adequate financing.Adequate resources needed to eradicate polioPartners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative are examining every possible option to seek fresh funding while managing existing cash flow to limit any threat to the immunization plan. The risk of not stopping polio in endemic countries was made clear when a large type-1 outbreak originally from India spread to Tajikistan early in 2010 where, to date, it has paralysed 239 children. Tajikistan had been polio-free since 1997. This highlights the urgency of capitalizing on recent gains made in the polio-endemic countries.“Polio eradication remains an urgent priority for our foundation,” said Tachi Yamada, president of global health at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “We call on donor governments to also prioritize polio as we seek to eliminate these last, most difficult cases.”“The complete eradication of polio is an absolute goal and it requires absolute commitment from us all,” said UNICEF Executive Director Tony Lake.“Rotary believes the new Strategic Plan provides the blueprint to achieving the goal of polio eradication,” said Carl-Wilhelm Stenhammar, 2010-11 Chair, The Rotary Foundation. When Rotary initially launched the effort in 1985, 1 000 children were being paralyzed daily by polio across 125 countries each year. Rotary has since contributed more than US$900 million in that time, and the incidence of polio has fallen by more than 99%.Global Polio Eradication InitiativeThe Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is spearheaded by national governments, WHO, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF. Since 1988 (the year the GPEI was launched), the incidence of polio has been reduced by more than 99%. In 1988, more than 350 000 children were paralyzed each year in more than 125 endemic countries. In 2009, 1 595 children were paralyzed in 24 countries. Only four countries remain endemic: Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan.",

    "content_html": "<p>WHO and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today announced the launch of a Joint Programme on Cancer Control, aimed at strengthening and accelerating efforts to fight cancer in the developing world.</p>\n<p>The agreement reflects growing international concern over cancer as one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Cancer accounted for 7.4 million deaths in 2004 (around 13% of all deaths).</p>\n<p>“In low- and middle-income countries, cancer overwhelmingly affects the poor. This has huge implications for human suffering, health systems, health budgets and the drive to reduce poverty,” said WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan, who signed the joint programme agreement with IAEA Director General Dr Mohamed ElBaradei.</p>\n<p>If current knowledge were put into practice, at least one third of cancer cases could be prevented, another third could be detected early, treated and cured; and suffering could be alleviated through palliative care for patients with advanced cancers.</p>\n<p>“The IAEA has long provided radiation technology and expertise to developing countries, but radiotherapy alone cannot halt the growing global cancer crisis,” said Dr ElBaradei. “The Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy was created to help build a broader, more integrated approach to cancer care and control. The joint programme with WHO underlines our conviction that only through combined effort and collaboration can we bring hope and relief to those whose lives are threatened by cancer.”</p>\n<p>Efforts in the joint programme are focusing on six model demonstration sites (PMDS) in Albania, Nicaragua, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Viet Nam and Yemen. Joint efforts will also respond to requests for cancer control assessment and programme development assistance in low- and middle-income countries.</p>\n<p>WHO and the IAEA have complementary mandates when it comes to fighting cancer. WHO is the directing and coordinating agency for health in the UN system, while the IAEA’s expertise in radiation medicine is a vital element of cancer diagnosis and cure strategies. The joint programme will provide the framework for the two organizations to dovetail their work, building on their areas of expertise to create a more coordinated and robust approach to combating cancer in low- and middle-income countries.</p>\n<p>The formation of a WHO-IAEA joint programme began in May 2005 when the World Health Assembly adopted a far-reaching resolution (WHA58.22) in response to the dramatic increase in cancer incidence worldwide. Later that year, the IAEA established its Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT) to help expand radiotherapy capacity in developing countries and build partnerships to address the huge disparities that exist in cancer care services. Since then, PACT, WHO and other key international cancer organizations have undertaken increasingly productive collaboration, working together to tackle the crisis on a broad, multidisciplinary front.</p>\n<p>According to the terms of the agreement, the WHO-IAEA joint programme will “coordinate activities and resources supporting the development and implementation of sustainable comprehensive cancer control programmes in low- and medium-income countries.” The successful collaborations with other key international cancer organizations will continue to be a cornerstone of the joint programme.</p>\n<p>WHO and IAEA aim to work ever more closely with partners to help develop the kind of effective, integrated national cancer control programmes (NCCPs) needed in developing countries to control cancer. Such programmes include cancer prevention, early detection, screening, diagnosis, treatment, palliative care and monitoring including cancer registries. NCCPs fit in the broader WHO framework to strengthen health systems with a major focus on primary health care.</p>\n<h3>Related link</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/health-topics/cancer\" target=\"_blank\">More information on cancer</a></p>",

      "description": "WHO and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today announced the launch of a Joint Programme on Cancer Control, aimed at strengthening and accelerating efforts to fight cancer in the developing world.The agreement reflects growing international concern over cancer as one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Cancer accounted for 7.4 million deaths in 2004 (around 13% of all deaths).“In low- and middle-income countries, cancer overwhelmingly affects the poor. This has huge implications for human suffering, health systems, health budgets and the drive to reduce poverty,” said WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan, who signed the joint programme agreement with IAEA Director General Dr Mohamed ElBaradei.If current knowledge were put into practice, at least one third of cancer cases could be prevented, another third could be detected early, treated and cured; and suffering could be alleviated through palliative care for patients with advanced cancers.“The IAEA has long provided radiation technology and expertise to developing countries, but radiotherapy alone cannot halt the growing global cancer crisis,” said Dr ElBaradei. “The Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy was created to help build a broader, more integrated approach to cancer care and control. The joint programme with WHO underlines our conviction that only through combined effort and collaboration can we bring hope and relief to those whose lives are threatened by cancer.”Efforts in the joint programme are focusing on six model demonstration sites (PMDS) in Albania, Nicaragua, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Viet Nam and Yemen. Joint efforts will also respond to requests for cancer control assessment and programme development assistance in low- and middle-income countries.WHO and the IAEA have complementary mandates when it comes to fighting cancer. WHO is the directing and coordinating agency for health in the UN system, while the IAEA’s expertise in radiation medicine is a vital element of cancer diagnosis and cure strategies. The joint programme will provide the framework for the two organizations to dovetail their work, building on their areas of expertise to create a more coordinated and robust approach to combating cancer in low- and middle-income countries.The formation of a WHO-IAEA joint programme began in May 2005 when the World Health Assembly adopted a far-reaching resolution (WHA58.22) in response to the dramatic increase in cancer incidence worldwide. Later that year, the IAEA established its Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT) to help expand radiotherapy capacity in developing countries and build partnerships to address the huge disparities that exist in cancer care services. Since then, PACT, WHO and other key international cancer organizations have undertaken increasingly productive collaboration, working together to tackle the crisis on a broad, multidisciplinary front.According to the terms of the agreement, the WHO-IAEA joint programme will “coordinate activities and resources supporting the development and implementation of sustainable comprehensive cancer control programmes in low- and medium-income countries.” The successful collaborations with other key international cancer organizations will continue to be a cornerstone of the joint programme.WHO and IAEA aim to work ever more closely with partners to help develop the kind of effective, integrated national cancer control programmes (NCCPs) needed in developing countries to control cancer. Such programmes include cancer prevention, early detection, screening, diagnosis, treatment, palliative care and monitoring including cancer registries. NCCPs fit in the broader WHO framework to strengthen health systems with a major focus on primary health care.Related linkMore information on cancer",

      "description": "A comprehensive action plan that can save up to 5.3 million children from dying of pneumonia by 2015 is being launched today by the WHO and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).Pneumonia is the biggest cause of child deaths in the world, killing 1.8 million children under five years of age every year, more than 98% of which occur in 68 developing countries. In spite of its huge toll, relatively few resources are dedicated to tackling this child killer.The Global action plan for the prevention and control of pneumonia (GAPP) includes recommendations on what needs to be done, specific goals and targets, and estimates of what it will cost and how many lives will be saved. Its aim is to increase awareness of pneumonia as a major cause of child deaths, and it calls on global and national policy-makers, donor agencies and civil society to take immediate action to implement the plan.\"This action plan provides the strategy to prevent and control pneumonia, which today kills more children than any other illness,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO. \"We know the strategy will work, and if it is applied in every high burden country, we will be able to prevent millions of deaths.\"\"Pneumonia is the leading cause of under age five mortality, killing over 4 000 children every day,\" said UNICEF Executive Director, Ann M. Veneman. \"Effective interventions to reduce deaths caused by pneumonia must be used more widely and made more readily available for children at risk.\"The release of the GAPP strategy coincides with the first Global Pneumonia Summit being held in New York City on 2 November.The GAPP has a three-pronged vision:Protecting every child by providing an environment where they are at low risk of pneumonia (with exclusive breastfeeding for six months, adequate nutrition, preventing low-birth-weight, reducing indoor air pollution, and increasing hand washing);Preventing children from becoming ill with pneumonia (with vaccination against its causes: measles, pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae b, as well as preventing and treating HIV in children, and providing zinc for children with diarrhoea);Treating children who become ill with pneumonia with the right care and antibiotics (in communities, health centres and hospitals).The cost of implementing the GAPP by scaling up the recommended measures in the 68 high burden countries is estimated at US$ 39 billion for 2010-2015. The costs are expected to double over the six-year period, rising from an annual need of US$ 3.8 billion in 2010 to US$ 8.0 billion by 2015.Specific targets and goals to be reached by 2015 under the GAPP strategy are to expand coverage of all relevant vaccines and exclusive breastfeeding rates to 90%, and raise the level of access to appropriate pneumonia case management to 90%. This will lead to a reduction in child pneumonia deaths by 65% and cutting the number of severe pneumonia cases in children by 25%, compared to 2000 levels.",

This will require an annual decline of 5.5%. The 34% decline since 1990 translates into an average annual decline of just 2.3%.</p><p>\"The global reduction in maternal death rates is encouraging news,\" says Dr Margaret Chan, the Director-General of WHO. \"Countries where women are facing a high risk of death during pregnancy or childbirth are taking measures that are proving effective; they are training more midwives, and strengthening hospitals and health centres to assist pregnant women. No woman should die due to inadequate access to family planning and to pregnancy and delivery care.\"</p><p>Pregnant women still die from four major causes: severe bleeding after childbirth, infections, hypertensive disorders, and unsafe abortion. Every day, about 1000 women died due to these complications in 2008. Out of the 1000, 570 lived in sub-Saharan Africa, 300 in South Asia and five in high-income countries. The risk of a woman in a developing country dying from a pregnancy-related cause during her lifetime is about 36 times higher compared to a woman living in a developed country.</p><p>\"To achieve our global goal of improving maternal health and to save women's lives we need to do more to reach those who are most at risk,\" says Anthony Lake, Executive Director of UNICEF. \"That means reaching women in rural areas and poorer households, women from ethnic minorities and indigenous groups, and women living with HIV and in conflict zones.\"</p><p>The new estimates show that it is possible to prevent many more women from dying.
