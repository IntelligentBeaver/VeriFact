          "In Viet Nam, the WHO Country Office (WCO) is making great strides in improving health outcomes, supported by the Core Predictable Country Presence (CPCP) element in the Country Office Strengthening Action Plan. CPCP helps to ensure that WHO has the right expertise and capacity to address health challenges, respond to emergencies and strengthen partnerships. It has added capacity and much-needed “bandwidth” in the WCO Viet Nam, which is helping the WCO to in its work to make a real difference in people’s lives.",
          "Zumrad Sagdullaeva joined WCO Viet Nam as a Partnerships Officer under a CPCP-funded position in mid-2024. In just a few months, she has played a key role in mobilizing resources and building strong partnerships. Angela Pratt, WHO Representative in Viet Nam, praised her contributions:“Zumrad has really hit the ground running in her first few months in Viet Nam, quickly adding huge value – and much needed additional bandwidth – to the team's work in a range of key areas. In particular, Zumrad’s presence has helped to expand key partnerships and identify important resource mobilization opportunities in the climate change and health portfolio, a critical area of work for WHO in Viet Nam.”",
          "Through tailored “partner intelligence”, which builds on WHO’s global Contributor Profiles and adapts them to the country’s unique context, the Partnerships Officer ensures that partner engagements are well informed and aligned with shared priorities. As part of this initiative, a comprehensive Partners Database is also under development to facilitate multisectoral collaboration and resource mobilization.",
          "The CPCP role has proven especially critical in times of crisis. After Typhoon Yagi in September 2024, Zumrad and the team developed a US$ 612 000 UN Joint Programme proposal to support affected communities. Reflecting on the experience, she shared: “It has been particularly fulfilling to help strengthen WHO’s position and leadership in emergency response as part of the UN Country Team’s humanitarian response structure, as I led the consolidation of the UN Joint Programme proposal on the Typhoon Yagi response. I received appreciation not only from my WR but also from UNICEF, UNFPA and UN Women who I worked closely with in this endeavor. ”",
          "As Partnership Officer funded by CPCP, Zumrad helps WCO Viet Nam’s work not only meet urgent needs but also support long-term health initiatives. WCO Viet Nam successfully mobilized 600 000 Australian dollars from DFAT to address HIV/AIDS treatment needs through a swift and coordinated proposal process. Similarly, the team supported the development of a US$ 6 million proposal with the Korea Foundation for International Healthcare (KOFIH) to support underfunded programmes on climate change and health. Collaboration has also extended across UN agencies, fostering a spirit of partnership. The CPCP-supported role has enhanced inter-agency resource mobilization efforts through two joint WHO-UNDP conceptual frameworks to tackle air pollution and public procurement challenges. WCO worked closely with UNDP and UNICEF to co-lead an integrated offer on climate and health, which we hope will be included in Viet Nam’s 2025 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) 3.0 under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. These initiatives reflect a shared commitment to improving health outcomes in Viet Nam through collective action. In addition to driving strong partnerships, the CPCP role ensures compliance with WHO’s Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors by due diligence and risk assessment for partnerships. At the same time, collaboration with the communications team has amplified donor visibility, sharing success stories that inspire further support. CPCP is more than a structural framework – it helps to ensure WCO Viet Nam has the right people and skillsets in place to deliver impactful results. By enabling WCO Viet Nam to respond swiftly and effectively, CPCP strengthens WCO Viet Nam’s ability to continue to address health challenges, improve health outcomes, bringing hope and better health to millions of people."

Continued collaboration and empowerment are key to advancing the health and rights of people living with HIV in Angola and beyond.\"",
          "Rodrigo Pinheiro, representing civil society, shared his enthusiasm: \"Participating in the meeting with Portuguese-speaking countries was immensely gratifying, with a great exchange of experiences. Presenting the Lusophone community health network allowed us to discuss common proposals and goals to advance in the fight against STI/HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis, aiming for elimination by 2030. We hope for more meetings of the Lusophone network, possibly every year, so we can monitor our progress. The CPLP Congress on HIV/AIDS in 2025 will also be fundamentally important for our struggle.\"",
          "Dr Draurio Barreira, Director of HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Viral Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, emphasized unity: \"It is with great satisfaction and enthusiasm that I express our joy in resuming constructive and collaborative dialogue with Portuguese-speaking countries, especially in promoting integrated responses to HIV, hepatitis, STIs and TB. This symbolizes not only a step forward in our joint efforts to eliminate these diseases as public health problems by 2030 but also reaffirms the invaluable value of our unity and collaboration. Together, we are stronger and capable of overcoming challenges, advancing toward a healthier future for our populations.\"",
          "Ricardo Fuertes, representing the Secretary of State for Health Promotion, Portuguese Ministry of Health, highlighted the importance of collaboration between governments and civil society within the Community of Portuguese Language Countries in the area of drug policies. “This is an opportunity to implement effective drug policies adapted to local needs, with services integrated into the rest of the health care and social support network. These policies, based on knowledge and human rights, have already shown excellent results. To strengthen this exchange of experiences, it is essential to incorporate practices developed in partner countries, such as community interventions, peer work and task shifting, which are often overlooked in strictly medicalized contexts.”",
          "Dr Miguel Aragon, coordinator of CDE/PAHO/Brazil, stressed the importance of sharing information and good practices between the participating countries. \"The exchange of data on the incidence and control of these diseases can lead to the development of more informed policies adapted to local realities. Strengthening support and collaboration networks between Portuguese-speaking countries will not only enrich strategies to combat the diseases but will also foster a sense of solidarity and collective commitment in favour of global health. With the implementation of the initiatives discussed, there is hope that nations will be able to make significant progress in the fight against these threats to public health by 2030.\"",

          "The impact of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in Nepal is overwhelming. An estimated 71% of total deaths in the country were due to NCDs. Inclusive of deaths due to injuries, the figure staggers to 80%.",
          "Implementation of a multisectoral approach is key to effectively addressing the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases. Aligned with this principle, the Government of Nepal endorsed the second Multisectoral Action Plan (MSAP) on prevention and control of NCDs in 2021. WHO Country Office for Nepal supported in drafting the plan and has been working closely with the Ministry of Health and Population and other stakeholders to implement the plan.",
          "“Although the Country Office had been conducting multisectoral advocacy and engagement in the past, it was in a limited capacity, primarily due to lack of clarity about WHO’s working modality with sectors beyond health. Through enhanced delegation of authority (DOA) to WHO representatives which allow quick decision making, and prioritization of working across sectors, the Country Office Strengthening Action Plan has empowered the staff and the country office to accelerate and strengthen multisectoral collaboration and deliver impact, particularly in NCDs,” said Dr Rajesh Pandav, WHO Representative to Nepal.",
          "“In the past two years, we have initiated several collaborations that have effectively contributed to aligning efforts across sectors to prevent and control NCDs and seen some great results. These partnerships have informed how we work across sectors to deliver results in tackling alcohol control, helmet use promotion and mainstreaming actions to curb use of e-cigarettes,” said Dr Gampo Dorji, Team Lead for NCDs at WCO Nepal.",
          "Traffic personnel in Kathmandu, Nepal is using a speedometer to check speed of an oncoming vehicle. Credit: WHO Nepal",
          "For instance, WCO Nepal’s engagement with the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transportation, Nepal Road Safety Council, Nepal Police and civil society groups on road safety culminated into a development of a strategy for enforcement of helmet use among two wheelers in the country and expansion of drink driving counter measures beyond Kathmandu, the capital city. More than 33 000 breath tests have been conducted in Madhesh Province in 2024 after WHO supported codesigning of breath tests to check for drink driving with Nepal Police.",
          "“WHO has been an important partner, supporting to conduct capacity building activities, providing us guidance on preparing significant strategic documents and sharing valuable inputs on designing interventions to improve the road safety situation in Nepal. We look forward to continuing and strengthening this collaboration, particularly in the areas of introducing international best practices in Nepal, bench marking by participating in national and international events, and in conducting research activities,” said Saroj Kumar Pradhan, National Road Safety Council.",
          "Similarly, WCO Nepal’s partnership with the Ministry of Health and Population and a civil society group, in regulating and curbing alcohol advertising and sponsorship promotion, led to a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court of Nepal in 2023 which upheld the ban on any form of alcohol advertisement throughout the country.",
          "And most recently, WCO’s collaboration with the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control under the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock on trans fat regulation led to the passage of a legislation limiting use of toxic trans-fatty acids for the first time, contributing to WHO’s goal of global trans fat elimination by 2025.",
          "Building on these successful multisectoral partnerships, WCO Nepal will continue to engage and work across sectors to fight the burden of NCDs in the country. Advocacy for the adoption of universal helmet use, strengthening enforcement for ban on e-cigarettes, capacity building for implementation of trans fat regulation and strengthening health promoting school environments are some of the immediate priorities of WHO. These partnerships built beyond the health sector in Nepal, are clear demonstration of strategic role WHO can leverage to make health-in- all policies a reality as reflected in the WHO General Programme of Work."

          "Kua lives in remote Sa Kuan Village, Luang Prabang Province with her husband Sivong and their four children. The family's village sits in a beautiful but remote and mountainous part of Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), several hours from a major road and a more than one-and-a-half-hour drive across rugged terrain to the closest medical facility, Huay Khing Health Centre. Giving birth at home placed Kua at an increased risk of pregnancy complications with no access to medical support. It was impossible for her to travel safely to the small health centre late in her pregnancy due to significant financial costs and a lack of transport. Since 2021, Lao PDR has been using geospatial analysis as a powerful tool in the effort to enhance primary healthcare services. The tool maps data for demographic and socio-economic status, the location of health facilities, use of health services, and the available human resources for health. This data has allowed the Government to improve its strategic planning and resource allocation to improve the accessibility, availability, and quality of health and care services at the primary care level. Improving health infrastructure and the availability of health and care workers encourages trust in health services amongst the population. This approach also provides clear guidance on where further investment is needed to address health inequity issues. \"Lao PDR will be using geospatial analysis to drive decision-making about where to improve and invest in primary health services across the country. It means we can be more strategic and precise about better supporting those communities who need health services the most, leading us purposefully along the path to achieve universal health coverage,\" said Dr Bounserth Keoprasith, Director General of the Department of Planning and Finance at the Ministry of Health for Lao PDR. Aiming to improve equity and achieve universal health coverage The Lao PDR Health Sector Reform Strategy 2021-2030 identifies strengthening primary health care as a critical foundation to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) and other health-related Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. WHO, through the UHC Partnership , supported the development process of the Health Sector Reform Strategy through technical guidance and financial support to organize consultations at central and subnational levels. While Lao PDR has improved many health targets in the past decades, the Government is putting more emphasis on improving health equity, eliminating communicable diseases, and reducing maternal mortality and under-five mortality rates by improving services for hard-to-reach populations in remote and rural areas. Mapping for equity and change All three levels of WHO, through the UHC Partnership , provided support to the Ministry of Health to undertake this comprehensive initiative on geospatial analysis. Initially, a pilot project took place in two provinces with the aim of identifying data to support health planning including the selection of health facilities for investment, closure, or repurposing, and the redistribution of human resources for health at the subnational level. In 2023, the Ministry of Health used the pilot results to guide further analysis and dissemination and facilitated consultations through two regional workshops with Director-Generals, Deputy Director-Generals, planning focal points, and concerned technical officers from provincial level and central departments. These workshops took place at the subnational level across 17 provinces to improve planning for human resources for health. \"When I participated in the consultation on health planning, it was of huge significance to be able to draw upon the data made available through the geospatial analysis. Although we can all speak from professional experience about health workforce and health facilities challenges, having accurate data available makes our contributions and decision-making more meaningful than ever before,\" said Dr Viengsy Souphakdy, Director-General of the Provincial Health Office of Champasak Province in Lao PDR. Geographical data, health attributes data, social determinants of health, and demographic data all provided valuable inputs into the analysis. Geographical data included information about health centres, road networks, and barriers to entry such as bodies of water. Road network data and waterbodies data were gathered from the Centre for Development and environment and Open Street Maps . \"The geospatial analytical approach that the Ministry of Health has taken is very refreshing. Being able to consider and analyse multiple levels of data simultaneously has brought a depth and breadth to our strategic decision-making. In consultation with others working at sub-national level, we are confident this will strongly improve how we manage primary health care,\" said Dr Phetvongsinh Chivorakhoun, Deputy Chief of the Division of Planning and Budgeting of the Department of Planning and Finance at the Ministry of Health, Lao PDR. The UHC Partnership operates in over 125 countries, representing over 3 billion people. It is supported and funded by Belgium, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Japan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and WHO."

          "Rosa Francisco Pedro's life was forever changed at age 33 when she tested positive for HIV. Today, as a 54-year-old leader of MWENHO, an association of women living with HIV in Angola, Rosa plays a critical role advocating for the rights and health of people living with HIV, representing Angola civil society at the Lusophone community health network meeting.",

          "Rosa with members of MWENHO at a candlelight ceremony commemorating World AIDS Day © MWENHO",
          "Rosa's health challenges began in 2000 with severe symptoms leading to hospitalization. However, it wasn't until 2003, encouraged by a missionary nurse, that Rosa bravely got tested, confirming the HIV-positive diagnosis. In 2004, she enrolled on antiretroviral therapy  and co-founded the MWENHO Association. Under the guidance of the missionary nurse who first encouraged her to get tested, Rosa learned the importance of community outreach and support, which fuelled her commitment to activism. As Rosa's knowledge and experience grew, so did her role as an activist.",
          "By educating herself and others about HIV, advocating for treatment access, and sharing her experiences, Rosa became an influential leader. Her work focuses not only on improving the condition of people living with HIV in Angola but also on fostering collaboration among Portuguese-speaking countries facing similar challenges.",
          "Now, Rosa represents people living with HIV at international meetings such as the Lusophone meeting . “These forums are crucial for discussing challenges, sharing successful strategies, and building solidarity among nations with shared linguistic and cultural ties,” said Rosa when asked about the relevance of the event.",
          "Despite significant strides, Rosa acknowledges ongoing challenges, such as political commitment and resource allocation for community led activities in Angola. However, she remains hopeful and motivated, seeing these meetings as vital opportunities to push for change and strengthen community ties across borders.",
          "Rosa Francisco Pedro embodies the spirit of resilience and empowerment. From facing the challenges linked to her diagnosis, she has become an inspiration and a catalyst for change, influencing policies and inspiring communities across the Portuguese-speaking countries.",

          "Rosa extended her heartfelt gratitude to WHO and all partners who support these vital international meetings. She emphasizes the importance of continued collaboration and empowerment, which are key to advancing the health and rights of people living with HIV in Angola and beyond."

          "While breast cancer has a high media profile in many parts of the world, the concept of breast health is still taboo in numerous communities. This was the reason that the Zambian Cancer Society (ZCS), created the “Duku Challenge”. Across Zambia, men and women were asked to wear a head scarf, called a Duku, as a show of solidarity with breast cancer survivors. This has now become an annual October event with multiple on and offline events, including sharing information and survivor stories, engaging with businesses and encouraging early detection. The events take place over the month, hence the combination of words Duku and October into Dukutober.",

          "In the past, you would rarely hear people ask about cancer...some people would say cancer is cancer, that what you don’t know won’t kill you. Mulenga Mwansabamba Mwanza / Dukutober participant and Former ZAQA employee",
          "A small department of 35 staff, within the Zambian Qualifications Authority (ZAQA), a Zambian government association, decided to join in. In 2023, they wore t-shirts and had a cancer awareness talk every Friday at lunchtime. The most important was to “make it fun: don’t bore people” explains Mulenga Mwansabamba Mwanza, a Dukutober supporter who participated. She remembers it as enjoyable and interesting as well as informative and insightful. The normal Friday team building lunch was converted into a cancer awareness talk during October. Cancer survivors and medical experts were asked to share their experiences. A nurse and doctor, both female, were made available for private sessions to those who wanted them, and breast cancer clinical sessions with nurses were available for anyone who wanted to participate. Questions were encouraged and clear information given. Some of the most common questions were on how and why to check for breast cancer and how to increase their breast awareness.",
          "In Zambia, and in other parts of the world, there has been an acceptance of cancer as an unchanging part of life. There was low awareness and discussion on how to prevent, detect and get treatment for cancer. In 2022, it was estimated that more than 15 000 people get cancer, and 9000 died each year . In settings where early detection and treatment are accessible, 5-year survival rate from breast cancer exceeds 80%. In contrast, in settings with weaker health systems, a majority of women with breast cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease and 5-year survival rates are lower, ranging from 10% to 40%.",
          "Between 60% to 70% of women in African countries are diagnosed at a late stage, and only 1 in 2 women diagnosed with breast cancer in an African country will survive 5 years.",
          "Since its creation, Dukutober has extended beyond breast cancer to include cervical cancer, which is the only cancer that can be eliminated through vaccination, screening and treatment. Combined, breast and cervical cancer are over 30% of cancer cases in Zambia.",
          "Janice Matwi, Country Manager Accountant participating in the Dukutober events. Photo credit: Chibesa Mulumba / Gspeed Photography",
          "The message should be early detection saves lives because that’s the whole point. Mulenga Mwansabamba Mwanza / Dukutober participant and Former ZAQA employee",
          "Getting the message out that early detection of breast and cervical cancer saves lives is part of both the WHO Global Breast Cancer Initiative and the WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Initiative . The question as to whether or not a person has cancer can cause apprehension, keeping some from seeking the information they need to prevent and manage it. “It is a small question, but it is scary. The lack of adequate information is truly frightening; it’s the worst part”, explains Mulenga. This is exactly why prevention and early detection campaigns are so important.",
          "More is needed, such as linking community action to political will and national policies. WHO has worked with policy-makers in Zambia to develop the National Cancer Control Plan 2022–2026 , which prioritizes breast and cervical cancer, as well as the National Guidelines for the Early Diagnosis of Breast Cancer which are currently being implemented through the Ministry of Health.",
          "Most definitively there are still a few things I want to know, but I am in a better place than previously, I am being inquisitive, not coming from a place of fear, now I am coming from a place of: What more can I know? Mulenga Mwansabamba Mwanza / Dukutober participant and Former ZAQA employee",
          "To succeed, cancer policies and programmes should be informed by people with lived experiences. When Mulenga heard directly from a cancer survivor: “You can see it, you can walk in her shoes and realise how serious it was”. The Zambian Cancer Society Dukutober campaign owes its success to its founders, its supporters, those who spoke on their experiences of cancer, those who wore the Duku and most of all, those who talked on the topic, on and offline. It took an unspoken topic and made it fun while staying keeping focused on the most vital point: early detection saves lives."

Dr Guy Fones / Director a.i., NCD Department, World Health Organization",
          "The importance of including people with lived experience of cancer and those who support and care for people with cancer in the design of health policies has long been understood by the World Health Organization (WHO). It forms the cornerstone of WHO’s Framework for meaningful engagement of people living with noncommunicable diseases, mental health and neurological diseases. Yet how can it be successfully implemented? The obvious answer is to co-create implementation priorities bringing together people with lived experience of cancer alongside those who have platforms or power to influence change. This is why WHO hosted an event “Co-creating priorities for Cancer 2030 with people affected by cancer” at the 2024 World Cancer Congress .",
          "The Union for International Cancer Control organizes the World Cancer Congress every 2 years to facilitate connections amongst international cancer control collaborators and global leaders and this year nearly 2000 participants from more than 120 countries participated. Within the World Cancer Congress, WHO hosted a meeting between 120 people with lived experiences and emergent leaders in cancer care. The goal was to co-develop cancer priorities and harness leadership skills in using WHO’s approach to meaningful engagement.",

          "...the World Cancer Congress is working to bring people with lived experience, to be a part of something international like the meaningful symposium, which means that our voices were heard….people with lived experience had long asked to be an active part of policy making, rather than have others speak on their behalf, they wanted, and policy needed, their direct input. Eman Shannan / AHP Founder and cancer survivor, Gaza, occupied Palestinian territory",
          "People with lived experience are individuals or communities with first-hand experience of cancer. It includes those who have recovered and those currently undergoing treatment. Eman Shannan is one such person. She survived breast cancer and is the founder and general manager for the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Aid and Hope Program for Cancer Patients Care (AHP), supporting cancer patients care in Gaza, occupied Palestinian territory.",
          "Eman participated in the meeting and experienced first-hand the diplomatic deliberations between delegates from all around the world, as part of the WHO’s effort to increase participants ability to negotiate and lead national or global policy discussions. Participants were divided into 3 core groups each focused on defining specific priorities for governments, WHO and the broader development community. Preparation for the event was intense with groups coming together online twice prior to the main event, to develop their statements of priorities and where they additionally received WHO support towards a better understanding of the principles of meaningful engagement. At the main in-person event in Geneva, their formal representation was integrated into the proceeding, with a delegation from WHO on hand to make sure procedures were understood and navigated.",
          "Eman Shannan speaking at the Aid and Hope Gala Dinner, Gaza, occupied Palestinian territory, October 2022. Photo credit: Rushdi Al-Sarraj, 2022, occupied Palestinian territory",
          "I was grateful that I will have the chance...as a Palestinian from Gaza...to be part of this important committee...when I had cancer and survived, I thought that the worst...that the battle was cancer, but no, what happened in Gaza was the worst nightmare...It is was not possible (that this is)... real life...so many cancer survivors cannot speak, so many do not have access to treatment. Eman Shannan / AHP Founder and cancer survivor, Gaza, occupied Palestinian territory",
          "After careful deliberations, a draft joint statement of priorities was issued for each of the 3 thematic areas. Priorities for WHO included amongst many others, a request to produce frameworks, guidance and toolkits for national stakeholders and community leaders to better and more meaningfully engage people with lived experience in the design, implementation, and monitoring of cancer care programmes. At the close of the meeting the participants resolved to continue the deliberation process outside of the meeting with the final statements due to be completed in the upcoming months, leading into the Fourth UN High-level Meeting on Noncommunicable Diseases. The group also concluded that a World Health Assembly resolution on the meaningful engagement of people with lived experience of cancer would secure the political action needed to implement the stated priorities and existing frameworks.In 2022, WHO launched the global campaign to amplify the voices of those affected by cancer as part of the WHO framework for meaningful engagement of people living with noncommunicable diseases . This campaign aims to ensure the inclusion of the needs and expectations of people and communities impacted by cancer by including the people impacted by cancer.",
          "For people like Eman, the opportunity to speak from experience was vital in connecting all aspect of having cancer from managing the disease to the impact on mental stress, costs and challenges of receiving treatment and, in her case, conflict.",
          "Despite significant progress in the development and implementation of national cancer control plans, gaps remain in a full health systems response for the prevention and control of all people affected by cancer and particularly those who are vulnerable. The inclusion of patient and caregiver experiences will go a long way to filling these gaps.",
          "For WHO, this meeting is an important milestone in its commitment to advance meaningful engagement of people with lived experience of cancer in all programmes and policies."

          "Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most critical global health threats we face today. It affects humans, animals and plants, and occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines. In humans, AMR leads to infections that become difficult or even impossible to treat, increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, disability and death. Today, AMR is associated with about 5 million deaths per year, a figure projected to increase in the coming decades.",
          "In 2015, a Global Action Plan (GAP) on AMR was adopted by the World Health Assembly (WHA) to ensure that infectious diseases could still be treated with quality-assured, safe and effective medicines. The GAP has driven subsequent progress, which has only been possible because of donor contributions to WHO’s AMR initiatives.",
          "By 2024, the foundations of the global response were laid as many countries are taking the lead: 170 have developed an AMR National Action Plan (NAP) spanning the health, environmental, animal and agrifood sectors. 67% are currently implementing their NAPs, according to the Tracking AMR Country Self-assessment Survey (TrACSS). Results from the Global AMR and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) also indicated that 92 and 74 countries are now submitting data on AMR and antimicrobial use, respectively."

In September, global leaders approved a political declaration at the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) High-Level Meeting on AMR . In November, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia hosted the 4th High-Level Ministerial Conference on AMR , sustaining momentum, including around the establishment of an Independent Panel for Evidence on Action Against AMR in 2025. As a result, WHO, Member States and all AMR partners are now equipped with roadmaps, commitments and targets. The global health community aims to ensure global deaths associated with bacterial AMR are reduced by 10% annually by 2030, as well as establish sustainable sources of financing to address AMR, including as part of the AMR Multi-Partner Trust Fund . Going forward, WHO will emphasize more and more progress at country level. AMR response is drawing from all levels and a range of teams. WHO is working through a consolidated, cross-cutting approach, which is particularly suited to AMR as it touches on many domains and requires a health systems approach. This will improve efficiencies and effectiveness, as well as maximize the use of scarce financial resources.

          "It took just one loudspeaker for Sallay Carew to find her voice in Freetown, Sierra Leone. “Come to our cervical cancer screening clinic just next door, it’s free, it’s very important for women over 30 years old…this is a preventable cancer…” she speaks loudly as she moves through local markets, and around the hospitals. When women approach her she answers their questions, and occasionally talks sternly to men who make light of the issue, educating them about the importance of taking their own wives or daughters for cervical cancer screening.",
          "Cervical cancer screening, Freetown, Sierra Leone, April 2024. Photo credit: WHO / Jin Ni",
          "It might not sound like a normal day for a trained nurse. But Sallay Carew is also Sierra Leone’s national focal point person on community engagement for cervical cancer. A big part of her role is to ensure people are aware of what cervical cancer is and how screening could save their lives. When she’s not in clinics, she goes out in the streets, calling women to get screened. Today, after just 10 minutes of rallying, the empty clinic is filled with women who are curious and ready to be screened.",
          "Sierra Leone is unfairly impacted by cervical cancer. Every year, more than 500 new cases are detected in the country with an estimated 400 women die because of this preventable cancer.",
          "“It wasn’t until 2021 that Sierra Leone really started its cervical cancer screening programme. I was one of the first nurses who got trained when this clinic was set up, but initially, we didn’t have a lot of demand because people didn’t know about cervical cancer,” explains Nurse Sallay. “So I felt that it was up to me to raise awareness, so women won’t die needlessly in my community. I had to get creative, I went in the streets with my loudspeaker, and I begged my daughter, who works for a radio station, to let me go on their programme to talk about cervical cancer. That really changed things.”",
          "Cervical cancer screening, King Harman Hospital, Sierra Leone, April 2024. Photo credit: WHO / Jin Ni",
          "From that day, growing numbers of women have started to take up the national offer for their free screening, something that has been available in Sierra Leone since 2021. From June 2021 to December 2023, over 13 000 women were screened across the country.",
          "I heard Sister Sallay on the radio one day, she talked about symptoms at one point, and I thought I might have felt some discomfort and wanted to go in to check. I’m 47 years old, but I’m divorced and supporting my 2 kids just by selling some food items in the streets, so I only decided to go because it’s free. Frea Sonsiama",
          "Frea Sonsiama is one of them, who like so many was encouraged to attend by both Sallay’s advocacy and the lack of cost. “I heard Sister Sallay on the radio one day, she talked about symptoms at one point, and I thought I might have felt some discomfort and wanted to go in to check. I’m 47 years old, but I’m divorced and supporting my 2 kids just by selling some food items in the streets, so I only decided to go because it’s free.”",
          "Sierra Leone primarily uses a common test known as visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) to screen for cervical cancer. It is cheap, easy and effective. VIA allows the trained health worker to directly see lesions and other changes in the cervix. Unfortunately, when Nurse Sallay carried out the test on Frea she found damaged tissue, which is often a sign of cancer. Sister Sallay performed a biopsy of the tissue and sent it to the lab for further follow-up.",
          "But screening is just one piece of the bigger puzzle of cervical cancer elimination. “Frea came in today again, almost one year after we did the test and treated the lesions, but we still don’t have her test results from the biopsy,” sighs Sister Sallay. “This is now a major challenge for us. The pathology test results take very long, and people have to pay US$ 15 to do them. Women like Frea just don’t have that kind of money, so we still don’t know if she has cervical cancer or not.”",
          "Cervical cancer screening, Princess Christian Maternity Hospital, Freetown, Sierra Leone, April 2024. Photo credit: WHO / Jin Ni",
          "We are looking for funding to support HPV testing, some of the screening programmes that were funded before are losing the funding, consumables and supplies can become problems for our facilities. Financing of services for advanced lesions is a big issue, as most women cannot afford the costs Dr Francis Moses, Programme Manager, National Reproductive Health and Family Planning at the Ministry of Health, Sierra Leone.",
          "This highlights some of the challenges facing Sierra Leone in their cervical cancer elimination programme. In addition, funding for the initial screening is not always guaranteed. “We are looking for funding to support HPV testing, some of the screening programmes that were funded before are losing the funding, consumables and supplies can become problems for our facilities. Financing of services for advanced lesions is a big issue, as most women cannot afford the costs,” explains Dr Francis Moses, programme manager of the National Reproductive Health and Family Planning at the Ministry of Health. “This year, the supplies of HPV vaccine for Sierra Leone are also interrupted as we heard from the manufacturer. Since 2022 we have offered HPV vaccination routinely for 10-year-old girls, and in October this year, we had planned for a catch-up campaign for 11–18-year-olds. Losing this is unacceptable for us.”",
          "Sierra Leone has made a solid 3-year plan in order to address some of these issues and answer the WHO call to be on the road to eliminating cervical cancer by 2030. With limited resources, the country is developing a fully costed plan for screening and treatment, including community engagement and strengthening referral pathways for advanced lesions, integrated with other health services, such as HIV care and treatment clinics, antenatal care and other entry points where patients may access the health system.",
          "Frontline health workers like Nurse Carew are often at the forefront of efforts to prevent and treat cervical cancer. In Sierra Leone, sometimes, they are the first and the only health professionals women encounter. They provide crucial information on vaccines, screening and treatment for cervical cancer. As they support the women in their communities, governments and organization need to urgently step up the effort to support health workers and the work on cervical cancer."

They have just been painted in bright teal – a colour that represents advocacy for cervical cancer. This is where Karen Nakawala will base herself today, while she continues her work to advocate for the elimination of cervical cancer in Zambia. As a survivor of cervical cancer herself, she understands what many of the patients go through.",
          "Today, 2 women came to look for Karen, seeking her advice. Their mother has been diagnosed with cervical cancer, but with limited treatment options and finances, she feels unable to do anything about it. The daughters are devastated by the news, but they also don’t know what they can do.",
          "This is a typical situation where women come to ask for my thoughts. Of course they can’t give up, but with limited treatment available here in Zambia, they are looking at other options, options that will cost money and can plunge a family into poverty. Karen Nakawala",
          "“This is a typical situation where women come to ask for my thoughts. Of course they can’t give up, but with limited treatment available here in Zambia, they are looking at other options, options that will cost money and can plunge a family into poverty.” Karen told us.",
          "Zambia has the third highest burden of cervical cancer in the world, with an incidence rate of 71.5 per 100 000 women and a mortality rate of 49.4 per 100 000 women in 2022. Despite being a preventable and treatable disease, cervical cancer accounts for 23.8% of all new cancer cases and 41.1% of all new cancer cases in women in the country.",
          "To address this challenge, the Government has been scaling HPV vaccination, cervical cancer screening and treatment programmes over the past 21 years.",
          "HPV vaccine have been in use over the past 18 years. Its safety is constantly monitored and has proven to be excellent. It is highly effective, even after a single dose. In September 2023, Zambia launched a major HPV vaccine campaign where over 63% of the country’s 1.42 million girls between 9–14 years old received a vaccine dose. For those who are living with HIV, 3 doses of vaccine are still needed.",
          "In 2019, Zambia had also introduced HPV DNA testing, a more sensitive method compared to visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA)-based screening, alone. By combining HPV DNA testing with visual VIA, Zambia is aiming to expand its screening coverage to reach as many women and girls in the country as possible. If diagnosed early and managed effectively, cervical cancer is one of the most successfully treatable forms of cancer.",

          "The Government’s efforts to strengthen cervical cancer programmes are only made possible with the help of well trained and dedicated health care workers like Gloria Mwale, a nurse at Chipata First Level Hospital in Lusaka. She is one of a cadre of nurses in the country trained to perform loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), an office-based method of treating precancerous cells found on the cervix. Due to her exceptional skills, Nurse Mwale now trains doctors and nurses in Zambia and from other African countries. Zambia has been an important hub for south–to–south collaboration on building a robust health workforce, supporting other African countries including Botswana, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.",

          "“The treatment for cervical cancer wasn’t straightforward for me once I was diagnosed. Even though the Government has a programme to send patients to India for treatment, the wait list is very long” says Mitondo. “I have a young daughter, and as a single mother, it was an incredibly tough time. We lived far from the capital city with no treatment options, I had to get enough money and organize myself to get treatment in another country, leaving my daughter behind with relatives for months. It was a lot of physical, emotional and financial stress we all had to go through, and we continue to feel the impact.”",
          "Karen supported Mitondo during her battle with cervical cancer. “We are happy to see the progress the country has made on cervical cancer programmes over the past years, but as I get to know and support more and more women battling or battled against cervical cancer like myself, there is so much more we can do to ensure these women are well supported,” she says. “So many of these women are mothers like myself, and many [are] breadwinners of the family. We struggled through treatment, and we continue to struggle sometimes with reduced energy levels, prolonged side effects from treatment. We really need more support, so our family don’t plunge into poverty because of cancer, and our children can grow up with their mothers and a bright future ahead.”"

After another 2 hours of driving along the dirt road, the clinic appears: a solitary building with only a few houses close by. This is where nurse Josephine Matare works.",
          "The clinic was built in the 1970s, and the infrastructure is old. Its rooms are simple, with handwritten health messages on the walls. There is barely any furniture in the clinic except a few basic beds and desks.",

          "Cervical cancer remains a significant public health concern in Zimbabwe, ranking fourth globally and regionally, with alarming incidence and mortality rates. Annually, approximately 3043 women in Zimbabwe are diagnosed with cervical cancer, and tragically, 1976 lives are lost to the disease.",
          "While Zimbabwe has established screening programmes, access remains uneven. As of 2019, only 20% of the population had access to screening services. At the end of 2023, Zimbabwe introduced the use of HPV DNA tests, a more accurate and sensitive screening method than previous options. Around 200 clinics around the country like Umboe received self-sampling testing kits for health workers to disseminate and collect in their catchment area.",
          "“These kits really change things for the women here because they don’t need to visit a provincial hospital to get a test that they know nothing about. We can just give these to them with instructions, and they could do it in the privacy of their own homes,” says Nurse Matare. “But of course, there are challenges, issues of stigma or confusion on the collection of the sample for example, so we really had to explain very well and convince them that it’s a good test so that if you are found to have a disease, you can be treated as soon as possible.”",
          "Cervical cancer prevention, Zimbabwe, April 2024. Photo credit: WHO / Jin Ni",
          "Once the samples are collected, they are sent to the Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital laboratory for processing. Over 3000 samples have been tested since the start of the operation. But the laboratory faces its own challenges. Regular power cuts are a persistent issue, and as demand for the test increases, staff are looking for more sustainable systems to meet needs such as solar power.",
          "“Zimbabwe had made a lot of effort towards eliminating cervical cancer, but we still face major challenges. We have a shortage of community health workers who are critical in the mobilization of cervical cancer screening as well as other health priorities,” observed Douglas Mombeshora, the Minister of Health and Child Care of Zimbabwe during a meeting with WHO in 2024. “We have 64 000 health workers now, but we need to double this number to 128 000 by 2028 to meet the health care needs. We need to give them good incentives, so that we can retain our personnel.”",

          "The shortage of health care workers can be felt across the country. On the outskirt of Harare, communities sometimes rely on advocates as their only source of health information. Tariro is from one such community, and has taken matters into her own hands. Having survived cervical cancer, she now runs a youth community centre and advocates about healthy lifestyles and the importance of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening.",

          "Zimbabwe introduced the national HPV vaccination programme in 2018 and over 1 million girls have been vaccinated to date. The country however experienced setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, slowing down the progress. To increase vaccination coverage to 90%, Zimbabwe is conducting school-based vaccination campaigns, along with integrated vaccination outreaches to ensure that even girls out of school are not left behind. This is another area where more health workers are needed.",
          "Back in Umboa clinic, Nurse Matare felt emotional. The Minister spoke and commended her and other frontline health workers for their hard work. She knows that they are training new health workers at the provincial hospital and is hopeful that she will get more support in the coming months."

          "In recent years, Mexico City has faced a significant increase in motorcyclist fatalities and injuries. From 2019 to 2022, deaths among motorcyclists and passengers increased by 134%, while injuries grew by 89%. [1] This mirrors a regional increase in deaths among users of powered two- and three-wheelers, which increased from 15% to 25% of all road traffic deaths in the region of the Americas between 2010 and 2021.",
          "In Mexico City, the rise is partly due to the growing popularity of motorcycles as an affordable and efficient mode of transportation, in a city notorious for its dense and congested traffic. Between 2014 and 2023 the number of motorcycles registered in the city more than tripled, increasing from 210 020 in 2014 to 716 400 in 2023. This trend has led to a higher incidence of motorcycle crashes, resulting in more severe injuries and fatalities. In 2022, motorcycles were involved in 6 out of 10 traffic incidents; nearly half of the fatalities in such incidents (174 out of 381) were motorcyclists, of which 50% (86 out of 174) died in single-vehicle crashes, often involving skidding or colliding with a tree or pole. Vulnerable road users (motorcyclists, pedestrians, and cyclists) accounted for 81% of traffic fatalities during this period (2019-2022), with motorcyclists representing the largest group at 47%.",
          "To address this issue, between 2023 and 2024 the city undertook several actions to reduce motorcycle-related crashes, fatalities and injuries by strengthening and enforcing regulations to improve safety. Their actions align with several WHO-recommended interventions around improving road safety for powered two- and three-wheelers.",
          "Enacting new regulations to enhance motorcycle safety",
          "In September 2023 the city amended existing legislation to increase motorcyclist safety in several ways. One of these was connected to reducing the speed at which motorcycles travel around the city. Higher speeds on roads correlate directly with an increased likelihood of traffic fatalities or severe injuries. [2] An increase of 1 km/h in average vehicle speed can result in a 3% increase in traffic crashes resulting in injuries, and a 4-5% increase in fatal crashes. Limiting speeding is an intervention that has been repeatedly shown to be effective. [3] The city legislation now prevents motorcycles from using roads where the maximum speed permitted is 80 km/h. The aim is to ensure motorcycle drivers travel on roads with lower speed limits, and that their risk of speed-related crashes is consequently reduced.",
          "In addition, Mexico City amended the local regulations to require the use of certified helmets by motorcycle riders, limit the number of passengers on motorcycles, and prohibit the transport of infants . [4] Improving helmet use is an important component of road safety for motorcycle use. Head injuries are the main cause of death in most motorcycle crashes in Mexico City, and WHO data shows quality helmets reduce the risk of death by 40% and reduce the risk of brain injury by up to 70%. [5]",
          "Restricting the number of passengers on motorcycles can also ensure optimal conditions for safe riding, mitigating the risk of crashes caused by loss of balance. Whilst global evidence is limited on the use of age restrictions, Mexico City decided to introduce one based on local data. Between January 2019 and March 2023, 17 minors died in Mexico City while traveling on motorcycles, accounting for 3% of all motorcyclist fatalities in the capital. [6] The city has now introduced a restriction on children under 12 travelling as passengers on motorcycles. [7]",
          "These new restrictions apply to all city roads, and the city can now impound vehicles where drivers have violated any of these measures, as well as issuing penalty fines. In addition to reducing road traffic crashes, the economic impact of this regulatory amendment is expected to be substantial. In addition to healthcare savings from reducing deaths and injuries, it also expects to reduce costs associated with traffic incident responses, which can cost between 500 000 and 1 million pesos per patient. (SEDESA, 2024). Toughening penalties by impounding violating motorcycles is also initially expected to generate revenue, as well as ensuring compliance and incentivizing behavior change.",
          "Implementation and enforcement",
          {
            "text": "Once the local transit legislation was amended, the city focused on implementation and enforcement. To do this they undertook a range of measures:",
            "bullets": [
              "Infrastructure changes : The city installed 100 vertical signaling points, both preventive and restrictive, at locations with the highest rates of fatal crashes",
              "Free helmet distribution : To increase helmet use, safe helmets must be widely available and affordable. To achieve this, 1000 helmets meeting the specifications outlined in the regulation have been provided by the city government for distribution at motorcycle schools throughout the city, as part of the standard training curriculum. Currently, 1000 free helmets have been given out to motorcyclists attending the city’s Moto School, and this is envisaged as a first phase of support for enforcing the new helmet requirements. The Moto School has also run training sessions and events across various boroughs in the city, and it has successfully trained over 1000 participants, 66% of whom use motorcycles as their primary mode of transportation. Out of those who participated in a survey, 45% indicated that they believe more Moto Schools and training would help reduce fatalities and injuries among motorcycle users.",
              "Control checkpoints : Checkpoints, run by the Secretary of Mobility and the Secretariat of Citizen Security, play a dual role of providing information and carrying out enforcement. The checkpoints inform motorcyclists about the essential measures they must follow when riding, including the use of complete protective gear (helmet, gloves, jacket, equipped pants, and boots), vehicle maintenance, and driving techniques to prevent traffic incidents. Information is also given about the amended regulations, and motorcyclists not compliant with the new requirements receive a fine of between MX 1086 - 2 171 (USD 56 - 111). Those with no helmets must complete a questionnaire, after which they receive a pass to attend a training session at a motorcyclist school and, in doing so, receive a free helmet. By the end of July 2024, 131 control checkpoints had already been conducted.",
              "Communication campaign : A city campaign – #ParaSalvarVidas – was launched by the Secretary of Mobility to improve public knowledge about the new regulations, and to increase compliance rates. Messaging focused on the importance of respecting speed limits and proper helmet use, in addition to the new regulation prohibiting passengers under 12 years old. Sustained media publicity and awareness campaigns should accompany enforcement activities to promote adherence to road rules by motorcyclists. [8] Evidence suggests that programs targeting at-risk motorcyclists, combined with increased awareness among the general population, can generate the necessary public support to increase compliance with such regulations."
            ]
          },
          "Initially there were concerns about pushback on the new amendments, especially around limiting the use of motorcycles on high-speed roads. Previous attempts to stop motorcycles under 600 cc from using these had been met with protests and road blockades by motorcyclists.  To mitigate this risk, local government staff from Mexico City engaged with motorcyclist groups early on in the process. They had multiple meetings over several months to discuss why these measures were needed to prevent deaths and the benefits to their safety, such as the reduced risk of head trauma from wearing helmets. The motorcyclist groups eventually supported the changes, and even participated in launch events connected to the new regulations.",
          "Preliminary analysis by the city indicates encouraging results. Data analysis conducted to assess the impact of the 100 signage installations revealed a 33% reduction in motorcycle-related incidents in 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, reducing from 301 to 202 incidents. There was also a small drop in fatalities. Since the launch of the #ParaSalvarVidas campaign and the enforcement of the reforms, there has been a reduction in the percentage of motorcycles impounded for operating without proper registration (from 27% to 8%) and the rate of motorcycles operating without license plates decreased from 11% to 9%. The percentage of motorcycles cited for carrying minors has reduced by nearly two-thirds, from 1.3% to 0.4%, while those penalized for having more than two passengers decreased by 75%, from 0.8% to 0.2%. Additionally, the rate of motorcycles cited for passengers not wearing helmets declined from 4.7% to 2%, and the rate for drivers not wearing helmets saw a slight decrease from 0.9% to 0.8%. These data suggest that the actions are having their intended effect.",
          "The city will continue to enforce its speed limits and the new motorcycle regulations, with intensified efforts scheduled for major holiday periods. By maintaining rigorous oversight and increasing enforcement activities during high-traffic periods, the city aims to ensure compliance with these regulations and enhance overall road safety for motorcycle drivers and other road users. Whilst speeding remains an area of concern, the city aims to continue efforts to create safer, slower roads for citizens in the future.",

          "The National Institute of Public Hygiene records an average of 14 000 dog bites and 20 rabies deaths per year with 48% of deaths affecting children aged under 15 years. Boys and men are disproportionately victims with over 66.2% of reported human rabies cases (2) . However, human rabies surveillance data are not complete and all cases or even deaths are not captured due to difficulties with diagnosis, reporting and health-seeking behaviour (3) .",
          "In 2017, faced with risks to the community posed by rabid dogs in the Gbêkê region, a Local Committee for the Fight Against Rabies was established. The Committee was founded by Prefectoral Order (No. 40/P.BKE/SG2 of 20 November 2017) and includes representatives from both the animal and human health sectors as well as civil society groups, community leaders, local media organizations and nongovernmental organizations such as Breakthrough ACTION. As one communications specialist points out, community engagement, particularly the involvement of community leaders, is essential in raising awareness about rabies.",
          "“We know that rabies awareness and education is lifesaving. We needed to get a diverse group of partners together to develop an educational programme which would reach all corners of our community. Indeed, some people only follow the instructions of their leader or guide.”",
          "William Beine, Senior Technical Advisor, Breakthrough ACTION .",
          "Outreach awareness and education campaigns, developed in collaboration with teachers and educators, were organized in schools, from kindergarten through to higher education. Dog bite prevention was prioritized. Awareness of dog behaviour and body language can be transformative, particularly for children, who might refuse to tell their families if they feel they might be in trouble for playing around with dogs. Delays in seeking treatment cost lives.",
          "“Crucially, we wanted children to understand that in the event of exposure, rabies is preventable with timely action. Therefore, we taught children about the importance of thorough wound washing and post-exposure rabies vaccination. The school environment is a strategic target: firstly, it’s home to a very large, easily accessible population; secondly, once pupils have been made aware, they will acquire good reflexes that they will adopt in life; and thirdly, they will be able to pass on this information to their respecti ve families. This awareness and knowledge will save lives and prevent delays in visits to the health centre.” Lekouo Traoré, Spokesperson for the Union of Community Chiefs residing in Bouaké, President of the local rabies control committee, Gbêkê.",
          "The programme has been rolled out to over 3200 students, and 83 teachers received online training to deliver the materials in their classrooms. However, the programme has not stopped at schools. The Local Committee for the Fight Against Rabies extended the reach of the programme to all corners of the community. Faith-based organizations, women’s groups and traditional leaders are collaborating to share information about how to prevent bites and treat for rabies.",
          "Whilst there is more that can be done to strengthen health systems and more accurately capture data on the number of suspected and confirmed rabies cases, community awareness and education is paramount to ensure that no one loses their life to this deadly disease. Community mobilization around rabies control is one of the key steps in achieving the Zero by 30 goal.",
          "“We hope that the lessons learnt in the Gbêkê region will inspire other regions of Côte d’Ivoire to implement similar programmes in their communities. Together, we can achieve zero deaths from rabies by 2030.”",

To address this, WHO adopted the Policy on prevention, detection and response to fraud and corruption in 2022. The Policy builds on anti-fraud and anti-corruption practices promoted by leading international professional bodies and peer organizations, particularly within the United Nations (UN) system. Maintaining an up-to-date anti-fraud and anti-corruption framework, WHO provides assurance to its Member States, donors and the public that integrity and accountability lie at the core of all its activities.",
          "Since the publication of the Policy, about 200 anti-fraud and anti-corruption (AFAC) ambassadors have been certified to bring the training to staff and non-staff in the field. To elevate these efforts, a first-of-its-kind WHO training and certification course was held in September 2024 in the WHO African Region. Hosted in collaboration with the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) in Kenya, it involved 30 WHO staff from across the WHO African, Eastern Mediterranean and European Regions and headquarters. This WHO-ACFE training and certification course was organized by WHO’s Office of Compliance Risk Management and Ethics (HQ/CRE) at headquarters in coordination with the Global Management Cluster/Compliance Risk Management and Assurance Unit in the WHO Regional Office for Africa.",
          "WHO staff previously certified as fraud examiners shared with participants their personal experience and the benefit of the certification for both staff and the Organization. The participants will also have an opportunity to join a global network of fraud examiners in which innovative tools, processes and best-in-class practices are shared. Attending the on-site sessions of certification for fraud examiners has been particularly valuable, as it provides a clear direction for participants on where to focus in the future. Once certified, these key WHO staff will be able to implement comprehensive strategies for deterrence, detecting and responding to fraudulent and corrupt activities. They all agreed that the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) has proven to be an exceptional resource, broadening their understanding of new scams and trends in fraud detection."

I will use the knowledge gained from the course when advising internal WHO teams how to strengthen their systems and controls to better prevent against fraud. If effectively implemented, prevention plays a vital role in combatting fraud in any organization. As a result, concerted efforts by experts in headquarters and the Regional Office for Africa bear fruits in producing anti-fraud champions in WHO – and I am proud to be one of them!”",

          "“Here are some key benefits from the course: it has equipped me with the knowledge, expertise and skills necessary to protect and enhance the financial integrity of our budget centre. By applying these skills, we can ensure that our resources are used effectively and ethically, fostering a culture of accountability and trust.”",
          "Mr Anthony Haruna Ahmed, Administrative Officer in the WHO Regional Office for Europe",
          "“I always need to embed a transparent, fraud-free attitude in my daily activities. I am particularly thrilled by the practical step-by-step procedures on how to access internal controls and the need to strengthen prevention over detection, together with the unquantifiable value to an organization of an effective internal control system. This will be particularly useful to me and my team. I gained useful knowledge on how to detect and conduct fraud investigation and analyse cases of other financial crimes which can be used during litigation. I would recommend the training to all finance professionals.”",

          "“ACFE’s global approach to fraud detection and prevention aligns very well with my WHO experience at the country, regional and global levels. Being part of the ACFE gives me access to a global network of professionals and continuous resources, like tools and databases, that can assist in ongoing fraud prevention efforts. Since investigations are under the Office of Internal Oversight mandate, my role in capitalizing on the training outcomes will be in proactively managing fraud risk and strengthening internal controls in my department and suggesting further improvements to mitigate risks.”"

          "Gulkumar is not the type to spend money; she did not even have a party for her own wedding. But she did pay out of pocket for treatment when her daughter was diagnosed with cancer. For that, she did not even consider the cost. She allowed herself to be supported by her sister and her nephew, knowing that the costs were too high for her to carry alone. She left her job for a year. The extended family sent money for care – including purchasing the cancer medicines needed for treatment – and for the indirect costs of a cancer treatment, like transport. Because the rest of the family lived so far from the treating centre, they had to make weekly, then monthly trips to the capital by plane.",
          "The experience of Gulkumar Ergeshbaeva and her family is all too common.",
          "Each year, an estimated 400 000 children develop cancer , starting a life changing journey for themselves and their families. Yet inequalities result in not just different health outcomes but also different financial burdens.",
          "“Inequality can be a key factor in whether a child recovers from cancer. What their families earn, whether they are a girl or a boy, what age they are, which town they are born in, can contribute to survival rates within countries as well as between them – that must change.”",

          "Pharmacy in Kyrgyzstan. Credits WHO/ Kyrgyzstan",
          "Only 29% of low income countries report that cancer medicines are generally available to their populations compared to 96% of high income countries, leaving countless families exposed to the inexcusable reality of having to purchase medicines from private pharmacies or hospitals.",
          "The costs of cancer do not stop there. When governments do not cover essential cancer services, families are subjected to multiple costs: expenses on cancer services such as direct costs, expenses to facilitate access to care such as transportation and housing such as indirect costs and broader expenses linked to chronic illnesses such as caregivers not being able to work. These compounding costs can be substantive and prolonged, eating into family's savings and assets.",
          "As a way to tackle these issues WHO has the WHO Global NCD Platform (GNP), which aims to keep NCDs, including cancer, high on political, health and development agendas. This does this by taking on the role of facilitator, convener and an accelerator of action at international, regional and country levels to assist in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.",
          "In Kyrgyzstan , where Gulkumar and her family live, costs can add up. The government does cover the costs of cancer medicines, but due to stockouts, families may be required to purchase from private pharmacies at higher prices and, potentially, less certainty on quality.",
          "The WHO Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer (GICC) was launched in 2018 with the objective to improve access and increase survival. GICC has a goal to achieve at least 60% survival for all children with cancer by 2030. This type of investment in health would save an additional 1 million lives over the next decade: the initiative has already advanced in over 70 countries, including Kyrgzystan, which became a GICC focus country on October 2023.",
          "High income countries have shown that where comprehensive services are generally and quickly accessible, more than 80% of children with cancer are cured and financial hardship can be mitigated. Yet, there are worse outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. A childhood inequalities report , which included Kyrgyzstan, shows that inequalities contribute to and are driving outcomes. Inequalities can be found in each stage of the cancer pathway from underdiagnosis and underreporting to long term effects of treatment on education and employment.",
          "Countries participating in GICC are showing that small investments can catalyze policy changes including cancer as part of universal health coverage. By investing in health systems, by setting priorities and providing care for all, governments and communities can improve access and reduce financial hardship.",
          "Elsewhere in Kyrgyzstan, Gulzat Zhapanova and her family had to buy a new car after the public transportations services could not accommodate the disabilities of her daughter after her cancer diagnosis. That was just the beginning of the broader impact of a cancer diagnosis"

          "1. What is a WHO malaria-free certification?",
          "Certification of malaria elimination is the official recognition by WHO of a country’s malaria-free status. The certification is granted when a country has shown – with rigorous, credible evidence – that the chain of indigenous malaria transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes has been interrupted nationwide for at least the past three consecutive years. A country must also demonstrate the capacity to prevent the re-establishment of transmission.",
          "The final decision on awarding a malaria-free certification rests with the WHO Director-General, based on a recommendation by the independent Technical Advisory Group on Malaria Elimination and Certification (TAG-MEC).",
          "More information on WHO’s malaria-free certification process is available here .",
          "2. How many countries been certified malaria-free in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, and globally?",
          "Egypt is the third country to be awarded a malaria-free certification in this region, after United Arab Emirates (2007) and Morocco (2010). With this announcement, a total of 44 countries and 1 territory have been certified malaria-free by WHO.",
          "3. When was malaria first detected in Egypt?",
          "Malaria has been traced in the country as far back as 4000 B.C., with genetic evidence of the disease found in Tutankhamun and other ancient Egyptian mummies. Cases were historically reported in human settlements near the Nile River, where conditions for breeding and survival of mosquito vectors of malaria were favorable.",
          "4. When did the country’s malaria control effort first begin?",
          "Early efforts to reduce human-mosquito contact in Egypt began in the 1920s when the country prohibited the cultivation of rice and agricultural crops near homes. Egypt designated malaria a “notifiable disease” in 1930 and, soon after, opened its first malaria control and research station. The first comprehensive malaria survey in Lower Egypt in 1936 indicated that prevalence of the disease varied from less than 1% in Giza to around 40% in the provinces of Qaliubiya, Beheira, and Dakahlia.",
          "During World War II, Egypt experienced an unprecedented surge in malaria cases among both civilians and military personnel as a result of a disruption of public health services, shortages in the supply of malaria treatments and larvicides, population displacement, and the invasion of Anopheles arabiensis , an efficient mosquito vector of malaria. The country mounted a successful response through the establishment of 16 treatment divisions and the recruitment of over 4000 health workers to implement vector control measures.",
          "5. What about post- World War II efforts to control malaria?",
          "Malaria control success during the 1950s and 1960s was mainly driven by continued vector surveillance, larval control (applying chemicals to standing water bodies where mosquitoes breed), environmental management and rapidly increasing economic development in previously rural and agricultural areas. This period also saw the introduction of campaigns using the insecticide DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane).",
          "The construction of the Aswan Dam, completed in 1969, created a new malaria risk for Egypt in the area close to the Sudan border. An extensive system of irrigation canals and reservoirs fed by the dam increased the potential for stagnant water in agricultural fields and nearby communities. Building on the successful experience of the elimination of Anopheles arabiensis , the Government of Egypt launched a project in 1970 in collaboration with Sudan that mitigated the malaria threat near the Aswan Dam. The project involved, among other measures, rigorous vector control and public health surveillance to rapidly detect and respond to any signs of malaria outbreaks.",
          "6. How did Egypt succeed in stamping out the last cases of malaria?",
          "By 2001, malaria was firmly under control and the Ministry of Health and Population set its sights on elimination through a strong, time-limited attack on any remaining locally transmitted malaria cases.",
          "Egypt experienced a small outbreak of indigenous malaria cases in the Aswan Governorate in 2014 which was successfully managed through early case identification, prompt treatment, vector control and public education.",
          "Over the last decade, Egypt has made significant progress in expanding access to health services for the population. Notably, 95% of Egyptians live within 5 kilometers of a primary health care facility. Malaria diagnosis and treatment are provided free of charge to the entire population, including undocumented migrants from Sudan.",
          "Malaria control in Egypt has been successfully integrated with the management of other vector-borne diseases. In 2016, Egypt formed a High Committee for Integrated Vector Management, with representatives from Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment, and Ministry of Water Resources & Irrigation. The Committee reinforces an integrated approach to tackle vector-borne diseases, with secured funding through synergy and coordination across ministries.",
          "7. What measures has Egypt taken to prevent the re-establishment of malaria transmission?",
          "The Government of Egypt is committed to preventing the re-establishment of malaria transmission. To maintain a robust surveillance and response system, the country has invested in ensuring continued capacity for malaria diagnosis, treatment, entomological surveillance and vector control.",
          "Egypt’s long-term cross-border partnership with neighbouring countries, including Sudan, has played a key role in preventing the re-establishment of local malaria transmission, paving the way for the country to be officially certified as malaria-free.",
          "In response to the armed conflict in Sudan that displaced thousands of civilians to Egypt starting in April 2023, the Egyptian Ministry of Health implemented an action plan to provide life-saving and supportive care, manage gender-based violence, and respond to malaria, leishmaniasis, and filariasis.",
          "Egypt provides free access to essential health services for migrants, regardless of their legal status. Essential supplies, including malaria rapid diagnostic tests and antimalarial medications, have been delivered to designated hospitals, particularly in the point of entry in Aswan."

I am the one who is always around and continues to remain in the region. Being a local bred doctor with rural and remote lifestyle and Aboriginal heritage allows me to relate on levels others cannot. Being a doctor is so rewarding, and [by] being a doctor in my community, I can only hope I continue to improve health care across my region.  Having to leave home to study nearly broke me a number of times. Having to leave home to study nearly broke me a number of times.  I wasn't the academic people thought I was, I had to work extremely hard to overcome failing and fight with myself to stay away from the one place I wanted to be: home.  In my professional journey I have had to overcome people assuming that I was given a hand up, that I was not worthy to be in the position I am and had to continue to fight to prove I am as skilled and able to work as a Senior Rural Generalist.  I hope many more rural women have the power to follow their dreams, overcome any challenges they feel are too big or not achievable.

          "WHO estimates that over one billion young people globally are at risk of hearing loss due to avoidable recreational sound exposure . It’s also now known that 40 percent of people aged between 12 and 35 in high and middle income countries are exposed to damaging sound levels in entertainment venues, and so in response to this public health issue, WHO developed the Global standard to reduce the risk of hearing loss in people visiting entertainment venues and events. Designed as a set of evidence based recommendations, the standard comprises six features an event or venue needs to implement to reach compliance. These features are designed to cover key areas of sound engineering, audio system design, venue design and training, and together aim to reduce the risk of hearing damage for audiences without compromising the entertainment experience.",
          "WHO Global standard for safe listening venues and events (1) Limiting average sound levels to 100 dB (LAeq, 15 min) (2) Monitoring sound levels of the venue (3) Optimizing venue acoustics and sound systems (4) Making personal hearing protection available (5) Access to quiet zones (6) Provision of training and information to onsite staff",
          "Intervention",
          "While some of the six guidelines had already been implemented in different festivals, this was the first time the complete set of guidelines had been implemented in such a large event. Held over nine days in December 2023, the Serendipity Arts Festival brought together over 1 800 artists across twelve venues, captivating hundreds of thousands of attendees.",
          "The festival was largely successful in its ambition: sound levels were actively monitored at all key venues; exceedances of the volume limit were infrequent, minor, and short lived; sound systems were generally of high quality and suitably deployed; and audience members had access to high fidelity earplugs, quiet spaces to rest their ears, and information about safe listening.",
          "Coordinating the successful attempt was Nitya Iyer and Sukarn Khankriyal, managers of the Serendipity Arts Festival for the last eight years, with support from the WHO Ear and Hearing Care Programme, who organized for two safe listening audio and hearing experts to attend the Serendipity Arts Festival and pre event site visits. The experts, Dr Ian Wiggins and Dr Adam Hill, liaised with SAF staff to ensure that the features of the Global standard were achieved, and the event was compliant.",
          "“We were really excited about being the first to attempt it…the festival has long had a history of inclusivity and accessibility… from the very beginning … not just because of rules or laws, but as people”",

          "Khankriyal and Iyer are already thinking of more sound and accessibility improvements for next year’s festival, with a focus on spreading more information during the festival as well as throughout the industry. They intend to spread the word on how to facilitate safe listening behaviours to both audiences and artists. With over a billion young people at risk of hearing loss because of unsafe listening practices, it is a good start.",

          "Managers Nitya Iyer and Sukarn Khankriyal had the assistance of Ian Wiggins and Adam Hill. Ian, a key contributor to the creation of the global standard, worked to make sure it all ran smoothly. “Awareness has been gradually being raised as time's gone on...There was an accessible international outlook to their festival. So I think it suited what they were trying to do”. Adam, an acoustics expert, worked closely with the festival’s audio and sound production teams to prepare them for what compliance with the standard would entail, integrating sound measurement devices at each of the 12 venues of the festival. “The technical crew, they weren't quite sure what to make of it in the beginning. And I think once they realized that we're not there to be the noise police, everything was fine. Once installed, the monitoring system even allowed fully remote monitoring of sound levels."

In the 2000s, there was increased social attention to the issue of suicide, and children who lost their parents began to break the taboo by speaking out in the media about their experience. In 2006, more than 100 000 signatures were collected through a petition drive to legislate on suicide prevention, spearheaded by NGOs involved in suicide prevention activities and providing support for bereaved families. The Basic Act on Suicide Countermeasures, enacted the same year, suicide, marked a shift in perception, as suicide came to be recognized as a social issue, not just an individual problem."

Global leaders and representatives from international organizations, UN agencies, NGOs, and civil society gathered in April in Geneva, Switzerland, for the High-level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Situation in Ethiopia. The event aimed to raise funds to support Ethiopia's urgent humanitarian needs. The situation is critical particularly in regions like Tigray, Amhara, Afar, and Oromia. Widespread hunger, disease outbreaks, and infrastructure degradation due to armed conflict have left millions of people without access to essential services. The High-level Pledging Event resulted in financial announcements totalling US$ 610.1 million to support Ethiopia.

          "Introduction to WHO's Basic package of interventions for rehabilitation: A toolkit for primary care professionals",
          "The World Health Organization (WHO) is developing a Basic package of interventions for rehabilitation: A toolkit for primary care professionals that supports existing health workers (those not trained as rehabilitation specialists) to safely and effectively deliver basic rehabilitation care that helps to address critical unmet rehabilitation needs. The toolkit supports doctors and nurses in identifying people with rehabilitation needs, providing basic care, and referring to rehabilitation specialists (rehabilitation-trained therapists and doctors) when necessary and feasible.",
          "Importance of enhancing rehabilitation delivery in China",
          "In China, the demand for rehabilitation services has been steadily increasing due to the country's ageing population (402 million people projected to be over 60 by 2040) and the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases. However, the availability and accessibility of these services remain limited, especially in rural and underserved areas. Primary care settings, including aged-care facilities, which are expanding across the country, hold immense potential as a service delivery platform for rehabilitation, a need that is currently unmet. Integrating rehabilitation into primary care settings and strengthening referral pathways that connect them with rehabilitation service providers will ensure more people receive the care on time and through a cost-effective approach.",
          "Pilot test of WHO's Basic package of interventions for rehabilitation: A toolkit for primary care professionals in China",
          "In a significant collaborative effort in May this year, WHO together with Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation (WHO Collaborating Center), Sun-Yat Sen University (WHO Collaborating Center), Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Tongji Hospital, and Tongji Medical College of Huazhhong University of Science and Technology jointly conducted a 5-day pilot test of the resource among primary care workers with support from rehabilitation specialists in Shenzhen, China. This pilot aimed to evaluate the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the resource within the primary care services.",
          "Each day of the workshop covered various primary care and rehabilitation topics. From hands-on training sessions to interactive discussions, the participants were actively engaged. The palpable synergy between the primary care workers and rehabilitation specialists set a positive tone for the workshop, reflecting their enthusiasm and commitment. To gather qualitative feedback on the training’s effectiveness, a post-test and structured interviews with participants were undertaken to measure knowledge gains.",
          "A group of participants and trainer performing a demonstration of a rehabilitation intervention, China. Photo credit: Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation",
          "Participant engagement and outcomes",
          "The workshop included 18 primary care workers (doctors, nurses, and junior rehabilitation therapists) supported by 10 experienced rehabilitation specialists (occupational and physical therapists and physical rehabilitation medicine doctors) . One of the workshop's highlights was establishing a mentorship programme. Primary care workers were linked to mentors (rehabilitation specialists) based on their local areas, fostering a sense of community and continuous learning.",
          "The feedback from participants was overwhelmingly positive. An impressive 94% of primary care workers and 90% of rehabilitation service providers agreed that the Basic package of interventions for rehabilitation: A toolkit for primary care professionals was acceptable, feasible, and effective. This endorsement underscores the workshop's success and potential to transform primary care services.",
          "As a result of the workshop, basic rehabilitation care is now being delivered by primary care workers in their respective facilities, with local rehabilitation trained mentors and the WHO rehabilitation team providing remote support via a WeChat platform.",
          "Despite the positive outcomes, participants highlighted the need for policy changes and additional support to sustain the momentum, noting that addressing these challenges is necessary for long-term success.",
          "Participants of the workshop in a classroom, China. Photo credit: Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation",

          "Uncle Feng",
          "Uncle Feng, 87, a retired auto engineer, lives in Yee Hong Heights (YHH), an older people home. After a COVID-19 hospitalization and a transient ischemic attack, his health declined, causing hand numbness with difficulty making a fist and holding a cane. On discharge from the hospital, Uncle Feng returned to YHH and began rehabilitation.",
          "Jenny, a YHH junior therapist prescribed exercises after the recent training in May: elastic finger exercises and ball pinching. Uncle Feng diligently performs these for 30 minutes daily. He appreciates the simplicity and flexibility of the routine.",
          "After 2 weeks, his finger weakness improved significantly, dropping from 5 to 3 out of 10 on a self-rated assessment. He can now make fists and use this hand more. Uncle Feng finds the exercises accessible to master and follows Jenny's advice not to overdo them.",
          "Patient doing a rehabilitation exercise, China. Photo credit: Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation",
          "The older adults who ate at the same table with him noticed that Uncle Feng's condition had improved and said it would be great if they also received further rehabilitation. Uncle Feng's younger brother also had similar problems, so Uncle Feng introduced his younger brother to the rehabilitation exercises. Uncle Feng is very grateful to get rehabilitation.",
          "Bojin and Ling",
          "Bojin, a stroke survivor in Conghua, China, experienced significant improvements in his mobility and independence through the Basic package of interventions for rehabilitation: A toolkit for primary care professionals.",
          "After suffering a stroke 12 years ago that left him with limited mobility on his left side, Bojin relied heavily on his wife Ling for daily tasks. However, BRP trainee Jianting introduced door-to-door rehabilitation services, improving Bojin's condition. Through daily hand and shoulder exercises and gait training, Bojin saw remarkable progress: his shoulder mobility increased, stiffness decreased, and his walking time to the market reduced from 30 to 20 minutes. This rehabilitation enhanced Bojin's physical capabilities and rekindled hope for the couple, inspiring dreams of future activities and demonstrating the profound impact of targeted rehabilitation efforts on quality of life.",
          "Patient doing a rehabilitation exercise with the health worker, China. Photo credit: Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation",
          "Follow-up actions and conclusion",
          "Mentors will provide continuous support, share valuable resources, and answer questions through the digital platform WeChat, ensuring the trained primary care workers can access rehabilitation specialist advice and guidance whenever needed. In addition, over 3 months, mentors will visit health facilities, assess the needs of primary care workers, and provide practical support. These visits are crucial for identifying specific challenges and offering tailored solutions that improve health care delivery.",
          "Three months after the initial visits, the WHO Rehabilitation team and the Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation will follow up on the activities of the primary care workers. This follow-up is essential to reviewing progress, addressing ongoing issues, and ensuring that the training and mentoring have a lasting impact.",
          "Patient in a wheelchair doing a rehabilitation exercise with two health workers, China. Photo credit: Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation",
          "This initiative's impact goes beyond one region. Trained primary care workers from other areas are already putting their skills to use, bringing rehabilitation to primary care. Digital mentoring, on-site support, and close follow-up empower these primary care workers for better rehabilitation delivery.",

          "Immunization remains a mainstay in safeguarding children's health worldwide but achieving universal vaccination coverage has been a significant global challenge. In lower and middle-income countries, more than 12.4 million children received no vaccines in 2020. These vulnerable children, known as “zero-dose children”, account for a substantial portion of preventable deaths in children. Nigeria faces a particularly alarming situation among these countries, with over 2.2 million estimated zero-dose children in 2021 1 . To address this pressing issue, the signatory agencies of the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All (SDG3 GAP) are collaborating with the Nigerian government to reach every child with immunization services. Through their joint efforts, SDG3 GAP partners embrace a collaborative approach as the most effective path toward achieving this critical goal."

          "Reaching zero-dose children requires locating and engaging the communities they belong to. Since such communities often include remote rural, urban poor, or conflict affected areas facing  various forms of deprivation, cross sectoral collaboration is needed to identify and reach them. Starting in 2020, SDG3 GAP partners and the Nigerian government collaborated to create a data system to identify zero-dose communities. Led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and supported by UNICEF and WHO, this effort combined data from various sources, such as immunization records, health facilities, surveys, and local community data at the sub-national level.",
          "Joint workshops and meetings with stakeholders were organized, resulting in a detailed analysis pinpointing 100 local government areas (LGAs) in 18 states that account for 1.5 million of Nigeria's 2.2 million zero-dose children. This analysis informed the design of zero-dose priority actions within the National Strategy for Immunization and PHC System Strengthening (NSIPSS), providing a comprehensive framework for improving immunization coverage. It also provided the basis of collaborative efforts and plans between partners to reach these communities.",
          "NPHCDA and partners including WHO and UNICEF developed an Immunization Recovery Plan 2022-2025 that incorporated a Big Catchup Plan specifically targeting zero-dose children. Through the GAVI-HSS project, GAVI collaborated directly with eight priority states, addressing low immunization coverage and a high burden of zero-dose children with a USD 50 million PHC and immunization grant. The World Bank partnered with 16 priority states through the Immunization Plus and Malaria Progress by Accelerating Coverage and Transforming Services (IMPACT) Project, focusing on strengthening vaccine supply, cold chain equipment, and monitoring systems to reduce under-five mortality rates. Additionally, funding channels and technical assistance from the Global Fund, WHO, and UNICEF supported 17 states in reaching identified zero-dose local government areas."

These investments have not only established valuable infrastructure and skilled human resources but also fostered strong community networks with trusted relationships with local leaders. Leveraging these networks, partners are now facilitating the delivery of immunization services to zero-dose children across the entire country.",
          "Supported by UNICEF, GAVI, and WHO, these networks are being transformed into formal Community Health Influencers, Promoters, and Services (CHIPS) as part of the Nigerian government's community engagement strategy. The CHIPS program, initiated in 2018, promotes local ownership and engagement, employing community-led case-finding strategies to identify and immunize zero-dose children within the national community engagement framework. Through joint efforts, SDG3 GAP partners, National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) and other stakeholders have developed national implementation guidelines for the CHIPS strategy, ensuring effective local participation and progress in reaching every child with life-saving vaccines.",
          "As of January 2023, integration of routine immunization in COVID-19 vaccination efforts have seen more than 4 million eligible children immunized since March 2021, out of which over 700,000 received Penta-3 vaccination.

          "Mozambique has embarked on a journey to strengthen its primary health care (PHC) services and community health initiatives, through a decentralized governance model since 2019. With support from a collaborative effort between the Global Financing Facility (GFF), Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GF), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank (WB), Mozambique has made progress to meet many of its health goals. According to the Demographic and Health Survey of 2023, the under-five mortality rate improved to 60 per 1000 live births, down from 97 in 2011, and the neonatal mortality rate decreased from 30 to 24 per 1000 live births over this period (1).  Additionally, the maternal mortality ratio in Mozambique has improved from 532 deaths per 100 000 live births in 2000 to 127 in 2020, which is lower than the regional average (2).  Addressing maternal mortality stands as a top priority under the Community Health Strategy (CHS), which aims to diminish mortality rates by promptly identifying risks among pregnant women and ensuring early referrals from the community to health facilities with greater capacity.",

WHO is providing technical assistance to the MoH to develop a legal framework enabling the formal recognition of CHWs and providing them the opportunity to receive some form of remuneration. The CHS also complements the National Strategic Health Plan and the Provincial Strategic Health Plans of Tete and Niassa.",

On average, these sessions were attended by 40 to 60 parliamentarians from two key commissions: the Commission for Health and Social Affairs and the Commission for Finance and Budget.

          "Engaging health workers to communicate on female genital mutilation (FGM) is a useful and effective tactic to prevent this harmful practice, according to a recently published study.",
          "FGM, which includes any injury to female genitals for non-medical reasons, has serious health risks for women and girls, and is internationally recognized as a violation of human rights. While the health system can play a key role in stopping the practice, in some settings so-called “ FGM medicalization ” – when it is performed by health workers – is on the rise.",
          "WHO is strongly opposed to health professionals performing FGM. As well as urging all health workers to uphold the medical code of ethics to “do no harm”, and thereby reject such requests to preform FGM, it is also working with health systems to provide proactive health education about its immediate and long-term risks for women and girls.",
          "A joint statemen t by United Nations’ agency heads, including WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, commended a recent decision in the Republic of the Gambia not to overturn a ban on the practice, but also emphasized the importance of continued efforts in prevention. Engaging health workers will be a critical part of this approach.",
          "“Recent months have emphasized the need for continued advocacy to advance gender equality, end violence against girls and women, and secure the gains made to accelerate progress to end FGM,” they stated. “It also underscores the importance of engaging with communities and grassroots organizations, working with traditional, political, and religious leaders, training health workers, and raising awareness effectively on the harms caused by the practice.”",
          "In 2022, the World Health Organization published a FGM prevention training package for primary care health workers which strengthened their knowledge about the practice and its risks, while encouraging them to engage positively with communities and patients. The curriculum included interactive teaching methods such as storytelling, group discussions, values clarification exercises, and communication skills-building – all intended to sensitively consider the cultural context and local perspectives.",
          "The new research, published in BMJ Open , evaluated the effectiveness of this approach. The study was conducted in 180 antenatal care clinics in Guinea, Kenya and Somalia. These countries were selected because of their high national prevalence of FGM including high rates of medicalization. Every clinic received general guidance and materials on FGM prevention and care, while half were randomly assigned to receive WHO’s communication training at three months.",
          "Three months later, researchers returned to all clinics to collect data from health workers and clients. Health workers who received the training were more likely to ask about clients’ FGM status and beliefs, as well as discuss why or how it should be prevented. The results were encouraging; clients of workers who had undergone the training were less supportive of FGM overall and had lower intentions of having their own daughters undergo the practice.",
          "Interviews were also conducted at some of the clinics providing pregnancy services. These showed that most health workers and clients were satisfied with how the topic was discussed, and that they felt it was appropriate to do so in this setting.",
          "The study shows clearly that health workers in primary care settings can be influential opinion leaders in changing attitudes on FGM. Christina Pallitto / Scientist at WHO and HRP",
          "A health worker from Guinea told the researchers, “Because of this training, I am now able to raise women’s awareness [of FGM] and persuade them about the ... disadvantages.” Similarly, one client in Kenya, speaking to the researchers about her experience, described the encounter positively. “I feel that our discussion today was very important, it has helped me understand a lot,” she said. “When I get home, I will sensitize others about FGM.”",
          "“The study shows clearly that health workers in primary care settings can be influential opinion leaders in changing attitudes on FGM,” said senior study author Christina Pallitto, Scientist at WHO and the Human Reproduction Programme (HRP). “Engaging nurses and midwives should be a key element of prevention and response to FGM. Using this approach can help highly affected countries like The Gambia to prevent medicalized FGM as part of broader efforts to end the practice and protect the health of women and girls.”",
          "The papers were published in BMJ Open ( https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/14/7/e078771.full ) and Global Public Health ( https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17441692.2024.2369100 ).9"

          "Stigma and discrimination increase vulnerability to HIV acquisition and affect both quality of life, utilization of health services and treatment outcomes for people seeking HIV services. Engaging with health facilities and their employees to establish dignified, inclusive services is essential to provide quality services to meet global HIV targets and reach marginalized populations , such as men who have sex with men. Efforts and research focused on the reduction of intersectional stigma (stigma of various forms that overlap) has been implemented and evaluated for impact on testing and other services in several health facilities in Ghana, including Ashaiman Municipal Hospital.",
          "Roberta Araba Amoquandoh is the HIV Coordinator at the Ashaiman Municipal Hospital in Accra, Ghana. She is a champion who participated in developing a stigma and discrimination reduction programme for her hospital based on the Total Facility Approach. Together with a team of champions and two facility colleagues, she implemented specific activities for their hospital after attending a stigma-reduction training of trainers. The activities included participatory trainings on stigma reduction for the majority (75%, or 145 people) of hospital staff at all levels and implementing other stigma-reduction interventions.",
          "“I believe stigma and discrimination is an issue and I felt it was important that everyone learn and understand that someone living with HIV should not be treated differently,” she said. “I want everyone who comes to our facility from all communities to know that they will be treated with respect and dignity by everyone who works here.”",
          "Roberta and the other two facilitators with a representative from Ghana based NGO at the launching of Ashaiman Municipal Hospital as a stigma free health care facility (photo © Richmond Nkruma).",
          "As part of the programme of the 22 nd International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa (ICASA 2023), held in December 2023 in Harare, Zimbabwe, WHO organized a satellite session to highlight and share good practices in reducing HIV-related stigma and discrimination in the healthcare settings. As a panellist of the WHO session, Roberta reflected on various aspects of her journey in becoming a stigma-reduction trainer and champion. This includes encouraging her healthcare facility colleagues to embrace the importance of these activities to provide dignified quality care to all clients. She joined the programme following a discussion with a community member who said, “If you want to change us, first love us.” She realized that community members need to feel more respected, heard and seen in her facility.",
          "Her journey included being trained as a participatory stigma-reduction trainer, which introduced her to concepts and practices that were new to her, like teaching colleagues how to be positive about HIV testing, or on-boarding new staff, and providing services to clients from the stigmatized group.",
          "As part of the participatory stigma-reduction training, Roberta learnt new concepts and practices such as promoting positive attitudes towards HIV testing among colleagues and orienting new staff to serve stigmatized clients. With support from the management team, Roberta and her colleagues gained skills to advocate for reducing stigma towards people living with HIV and key populations, conducting stigma-reduction trainings for facility staff including but not limited to administration, health care providers, security personnel and others. Training sessions encouraged open dialogue and participation, with staff using their preferred language. Activities included sharing personal stories and learning de-stigmatizing messages through songs, fostering enthusiastic engagement across the facility.",
          "The participatory training activities that Roberta found most impactful included: 1) Stigma reflection: where trainees reflected on instances when they felt isolated or rejected from being different from others 2) Empowerment: as health care workers were provided tools and a safe place to practice new skills on addressing stigma related issues in a professional manner when speaking with both clients and colleagues and, 3) thinking outside the “gender box” as it taught participants that we all express our gender in different ways.",
          "After the training, the hospital stigma-reduction champion and management teams developed additional facility specific initiatives These included banners, posters and announcements; introduction of complaint and compliment system; trainings for additional and new staff as well as conducting stigma reduction refresher exercises during staff meetings and ward rounds.",
          "Finally, Roberta wanted to share a fellow nurse’s mantra that she holds true to herself, her colleagues and her community: “Treat everyone as you want to be treated.”",
          "About the Intervention",
          "The Total Facility Approach (TFA) to HIV-related reduction, which engages everyone in a health care facility, is a programme that aims at creating a more dignified and inclusive environment for all. It engages everyone in a health care facility. The TFA encompasses action at three levels in the healthcare system: 1) individual level with a focus on client interactions; 2) interpersonal level to focus on how staff work with each other (stigma towards each other); and 3) institutional/organizational level.",
          "The TFA includes a training of trainers, facility level training and champion teams/facility activities and small grants to facilities to kick-start activities that were identified at the various levels that would impact stigma and discrimination (1) .  TFA addresses multiple and intersecting aspects of stigma and provides participatory trainers toolkits, available in several languages that can be adapted to the local context, different stigmas and specific facilities. It targets actionable drivers of stigma among health facility staff such as: fear of HIV acquisition, lack of awareness of stigma, attitudes, and health facility environment. This approach is built on 20 years of research and programmatic work and has been implemented in several countries, including in Ghana (1,2) .",
          "The original Health Policy Plus (HP+) TFA was adapted in Ghana to address intersectional stigma faced by men who have sex with men at health facilities through a multi-level intersectional stigma reduction cluster randomized trial named PRISM (Promoting the Reduction of Intersectional Stigma among men who have sex with men) (3,4) . This programme was intended to reduce health facility intersectional stigma, increase autonomy and a supportive peer and health facility climate for men who have sex with men.",

          "Self-testing was adopted very early in the HIV response and has since changed service delivery across many conditions and disease areas. While initially focused on enabling early diagnosis and treatment of people with HIV, new evidence has highlighted HIV self-testing (HIVST) as a tool to help prevent new infections.",
          "Every year there are more than one million new and preventable HIV infections. Testing is essential to increase access to and make effective use of HIV prevention such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Despite the strong evidence that PrEP and PEP prevent HIV acquisition, access is suboptimal. It is estimated that only 2.5 million people are taking PrEP, far fewer than the 10 million people needed to achieve global HIV prevention goals to have fewer than 370 000 infections by the end of 2025.",
          "In its new HIV testing guidelines , WHO is calling for the expansion of HIVST to support the initiation, continuation, and re-starting of PrEP. HIVST can be integrated with various PrEP delivery methods, including oral PrEP and vaginal ring. Ongoing research is still needed to understand the role of self-testing within long-acting injectable PrEP. This strategy increases flexibility and access by streamlining service delivery, reducing testing requirements and clinic visits, and increasing convenience to suit client needs and preferences.",
          "As WHO launches its updated guidelines, the following case studies from 5 countries underscore the potential for HIVST and PrEP integration and illustrate the different ways programmes successfully implement WHO recommendations."

Healthcare or community workers generally offer standard testing or self-testing, including online access options. All those reporting a negative self-test result and deemed eligible are offered PrEP. From January to December 2023, 11 841 HIVST kits were distributed and 96% had a negative result. Of these, 67% were successfully linked to PrEP services, significantly improving demand creation for PrEP. The national programme report of those with a positive self-test result shows that 95% are linked to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 96% achieved viral suppression.",

          "Gyani, a 28-year-old woman from Nepal’s Rautahat district, is a PrEP champion. She casually shows her peers her bottle and tells them how it is helping her to prevent HIV infection. In her reassuring voice she shares her PrEP and self-testing journey, encouraging other sex workers in her network to consider self-testing and accessing PrEP. Through this approach, Gyani has inspired more than 40 of her peers, at substantial HIV risk to self-test, enroll in and take PrEP. Gyani says that her transformation from a struggling single mother to confident PrEP champion who has helped to save her peers from HIV is not just the story of her personal triumph over fear and fear of stigma, but it is also about the importance of supporting access to stigma-free and person-centered services."

Clients reporting a negative self-test result online are promptly initiated on PrEP without the requirement of further testing. The convenience and privacy have greatly reduced stigma and increased PrEP uptake, leading to a broader and more sustained HIV prevention effort in the region. As of March 2024, HIVST kits were distributed to 743 people, and out of all individuals reporting a negative self-test result, 40.8% engaged with PrEP online, with 53.8% initiating PrEP, 32.7% receiving a refill, and 13.6% restarting PrEP.",

          "Pangpond, a 26-year-old gay man, saw an advertisement for an online PrEP service that used HIVST. As a former PrEP user, he was immediately attracted to the convenience it offered. He had started PrEP 6 months ago but found it difficult to make follow-up visits due to his busy work schedule. Now, he could use PrEP without the need to travel to the clinic, which he preferred. “I felt very confident going out and partying when I was on PrEP,” Pangpond shared. “But I just started a new job, and finding time to refill my PrEP was challenging. When I saw the ad for the online PrEP service I was interested right away. It was so simple. The clinic sent me the HIVST kit and I followed the instructions. I had to ask the clinic for advice online when I first used it, then I sent them the result, and they sent me PrEP to initiate. I followed the same steps to refill PrEP a month later. This was incredibly convenient, and I quickly regained control, feeling ready to enjoy life again.”"

The self-test, in this way, offers an agile, discreet, safe, and confidential solution, facilitating the restart of PrEP and ensuring the necessary follow-up for the user who wishes to use it as an additional tool to manage their risk of HIV infection.”",

This convenience ensures that tests are regular, protecting me against HIV. With a significant reduction in the time spent at health facilities, effectively using PrEP has become more convenient, with appropriate support from a team prepared to answer questions and monitor my health.” He added, “When they offered Home PrEP, I decided to try it because it was faster, more practical, and would streamline the whole process. I was skeptical, thinking it might not work and wouldn't save much time, but to my pleasant surprise, things went very well. The self-test is very easy to do—no mystery, the instructions are clear, it's practical, safe, and fast. “"

This work aims to contribute to achieving WHO’s goal of Health for All, agreed upon at the Thirtieth World Health Assembly in 1977. The concept of primary health care (PHC) was introduced in the late 1970s. Recognizing the importance of promoting PHC throughout the world to achieve health for all, Mr Sasakawa established this prize to recognize the PHC role for health development and some outstanding innovative work in this field. In 1985, the Nippon Foundation and Sasakawa Health Foundation, which together have contributed more than US$ 200 million to WHO's programmes, took another important initiative by establishing the Sasakawa Health Prize under the auspices of WHO to recognize and encourage grassroots efforts to promote Health for All. Every year since then, it is awarded to individuals and/or institutions which contribute to the promotion of health programmes or notable advances in PHC, already accomplished and extending far beyond the call of normal duties. “As we mark the fortieth milestone of the Sasakawa Health Prize, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all who have supported this Health Prize over the years,” said Mr Yohei Sasakawa, Chairman of The Nippon Foundation, at the award ceremony at the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly in Geneva. “Established by my late father, it highly values and emphasizes the critical role of primary healthcare as the key to achieving good health. I fully recognize the importance of the spirit of the Declaration of Alma Ata, as primary healthcare contributes to quote the promotion and protection of the health of the people which is essential to sustained economic and social development and contributes to a better quality of life and to world peace.”"

              "The Korea Foundation for International Healthcare (KOFIH) was established in 2006 to promote global health cooperation and carries out government-level health assistance projects as a public agency under the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Republic of Korea. KOFIH initiated the establishment of the Dr LEE Jong-wook Memorial Prize for Public Health to honour the late Dr LEE Jong-wook, the sixth Director-General of WHO, who dedicated his life to serving the underprivileged. Established by KOFIH and WHO in 2008, the Prize is awarded to a person or persons, an institution or institutions, a governmental or nongovernmental organization or organizations who have made an outstanding contribution to public health with a focus on improving equity. Presented once a year, it upholds Dr LEE’s core values of promoting public health. As a public agency dedicated to global health cooperation, KOFIH has a long-standing relationship with WHO. KOFIH strives to create a healthier world and contribute to the long-term improvement of global public health. “We will continue our efforts to improve global public health in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Republic of Korea and will always stand with WHO on that path,” said Dr Il-Soo Ha, President of KOFIH when presenting the 2024 award."

              "The Award was established in 2019 upon the initiative of the Ministers of Health of Member States of the WHO African Region, in the context of the commemoration of the 100-year anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s birth and his exceptional life and contributions to the world. At the Seventy-first World Health Assembly in May 2018, the Ministers noted, “We concurrently celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the creation of the World Health Organization, whose mandate is to achieve health coverage for all, but also the fortieth anniversary of the Alma Ata Declaration on Primary Healthcare, which has been fully focused on local communities essential to universal health coverage. This echoes the values and principles for which Nelson Mandela fought and lived.” The Award recognizes Nelson Mandela’s exceptional role in the promotion and protection of human rights in the global fight against HIV, AIDS and TB, including stigma and discrimination associated with these diseases. He also played a key role in promoting universal access to health care with great vision, in line with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union agenda 2016–2030 to achieve health goals. Nelson Mandela said, “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being for himself and for his family, including food, clothing, housing, medical health care, and necessary social services and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowed, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.” HE Mr Mxolisi Nkosi, Ambassador of South Africa to the United Nations and other organizations in Geneva, said in May 2024 at the Health Assembly, “May this award continue to inspire your work as well as others in the effort to follow the path to ensuring health for all and in promoting the social equity ideals that Nelson Mandela represented.”"

          "From 2021-2023, the EU contributed EUR 20 million and adopted a flexible, highly responsive approach to how the funding is spent in view of rapidly changing conditions. This allowed WHO to work closely with national governments, and other partners such as civil society organizations, to identify and provide the services that people needed in real time.",

For example, Cambodia strengthened government coordination capacity in surveillance, laboratory, risk communication, clinical management, vaccination and infection prevention control, and there was high-level ministerial engagement with international health regulations, pandemic preparedness, and the strengthening of subnational health security systems.",
          "Surveillance, risk assessment, and contract tracing capabilities were strengthened in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Viet Nam and Thailand. For example, Lao PDR strengthened its surveillance systems, conducted investigations, contact tracing, risk assessment and response to disease outbreaks, integrated COVID-19 into existing influenza surveillance, and conducted 64 risk assessments in total, using multisource surveillance.",
          "Malaysia strengthened surveillance data management and analysis, and collaborated and coordinated national, regional, and provincial action on public health emergencies and emerging infectious diseases between the Ministry of Health and WHO. National laboratories were strengthened in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. For example, Indonesia established external quality assessment of COVID-19 laboratories to ensure quality testing of COVID-19, providing 1034 testing panels to 989 laboratories in 34 provinces.",

For example, Myanmar printed 10 000 posters, and distributed 5400 information kits to flood- and conflict-affected populations. WHO’s open course on Risk communications essentials was translated into the local languages to mobilize community volunteers and local service providers. In Myanmar, activities were conducted through civil society organizations, and WHO worked with World Vision to train a team of migrant health volunteers who provided important health services to over 5,800 members of Thailand’s migrant communities.",
          "In Malaysia, the project helped vaccinate 7882 individuals in 483 localities by conducting outreach COVID-19 vaccination campaigns for hard-to-reach areas in Sabah State. In Viet Nam, the project collaborated with the Tay Nguyen Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology to develop routine immunization programmes for those who missed their routine vaccines due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

          "Over 2.4 billion people live with a health condition that may benefit from rehabilitation, and this number is estimated to increase. Of these, there are 86 million people in need of rehabilitation due to a stroke. In many parts of the world, this need is largely unmet. More than half of people requiring rehabilitation in some low- and middle-income countries, do not receive them.",

Madeline Niebanck, rehabilitation advocate, Maddi Stroke of Luck founder, and stroke survivor Anybody may need rehabilitation at some point in their lives, following an injury, surgery, disease or illness, or simply because of age, therefore rehabilitation should be available for all the population and through all stages of the life course. Efforts to strengthen rehabilitation should be directed towards supporting the health system as a whole and integrating rehabilitation into all levels of health care. Rehabilitation is an essential health service and crucial for achieving universal health coverage. Maddi said: “I wish I had heard a little more: be patient. Be patient, put in the work, give it time and don’t give up. Progress doesn’t happen overnight, it happens over time.” Good advice for rehabilitation and for making sure that rehabilitation is made part of universal health coverage.

This condition is the leading cause of maternal mortality, accounting for over 20% of all maternal deaths recorded globally. It was only last year, at the summit hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO), that Nguku began to share her story. Following the Postpartum Haemorrhage Summit, WHO and partners launched a Roadmap for combatting postpartum haemorrhage by 2030, with a milestone tracker for accountability toward progress on this key issue. For Women’s Health Month, Nguku spoke with the United Nations’ Human Reproduction Programme (HRP) about her work and what needs to be done to reduce deaths from this devastating condition."

I witnessed mothers dying in childbirth, with the majority dying from post-partum haemorrhages. I watched helplessly as some bled to death, since I did not have what I needed as a midwife to save them. That struck me and I started raising the visibility and profile of mothers and newborns dying in childbirth from preventable causes, which led to the founding of White Ribbon Alliance – Kenya. I have been doing that ever since."

As a young midwife, and a mother-to-be then, I did not imagine that I could suffer from any childbirth complications. But we know that any pregnancy can have complications and I experienced heavy bleeding with the birth of my son 16 years ago. I survived it thanks to the fast, quality care that I received in a private hospital in Nairobi. Sadly, unlike me, many women who suffer from postpartum haemorrhage live in low-resource settings and cannot access that kind of care, and that upsets me so much."

          "Women have told us many things. For example, they say that they are encouraged to go to the facility for delivery. However, in some of the health facilities, there is nothing to support them once the haemorrhaging starts. In most of the areas that we work in, there are few midwives to follow up with mothers who have recently given birth and who could be victims after discharge.",

When she alerted the nurses, they said what she was experiencing was normal, so she went home. Soon after, she fainted and was rushed back to the clinic where the health workers didn't know what to do. She said there was no ultrasound machine to check the cause of the bleeding or any medication to stop the bleeding. She had to transfer to a county hospital, where her bleeding finally stopped."

          "Following feedback provided by the Colombian Government in 2022 and due to significant successes in the initial years of implementation of the Interagency Strategy (see related case study from 2021 here ), the collaboration among the UN agencies and the Colombian government was scaled up to include interventions aiming to tackle gender-based violence (GBV), malnutrition as well as road safety issues hence extending the coordination mechanism to help accelerate additional SDG targets (2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.6, 5.2) in line with the country’s health priorities and national strategies.",
          "Among the feedback form the Colombian government was the recommendation to continue fostering collaborative work and to include the views of beneficiaries during the planning of interventions. Catalytic funds from the SDG3 GAP were thus used to strengthen the coordination and collaborative work between the UN agencies, civil society and local governments. The funding further supported capacity building of national and local authorities, health care providers and community leaders to improve maternal, neonatal and child health, nutritional health, GBV services and road safety measures. Community-based organisations and civil society were included in the planning of the interventions through a participative approach.",
          "For example, through a participative approach with community members, normalized phenomena related to harmful practices in women, girls and adolescents were identified which in turn enabled the development of practical tools for dignified and humanized care for populations that suffer or have suffered gender violence.",
          "Gender violence has been an invisible phenomenon, affecting hundreds of women, girls and adolescents within indigenous communities in Colombia. Cases of gender violence continue to cause concern in the country: in 2023, 158,394 cases were reported, with women, adolescents and girls making up 80% of the victims. In indigenous communities, more than 4,332 cases were reported for 2023. In addition to physical, psychological and sexual violence, there are also the issues of child marriages and early unions, as well as female genital mutilation.",
          "To address the challenges, the Interagency Strategy strengthened the capacities of health professionals with a training of trainers model on comprehensive, humanized and dignified response to GBV using the tools that were developed through the participative approach. The collaboration also enhanced institutional and community capacities in order to provide a comprehensive response to the phenomenon of violence.",
          "The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) emphasizes interagency collaboration in Colombia's prioritized areas as a vital strategy for advancing sexual and reproductive health among indigenous communities. This collaboration has strengthened advocacy with national and local health authorities, integrated indigenous perspectives into policies, improved intercultural adaptations of maternal health services, enhanced health professional capacities in SRH, and provided intercultural training for traditional birth attendants. These concerted efforts lead to the creation of inclusive, culturally sensitive, and effective SRH services, which are critical in reducing maternal morbidity and mortality among indigenous communities. Additionally, they help bridge the gap in guaranteeing sexual and reproductive rights and contribute to Colombia's progress towards achieving ZERO preventable maternal deaths."

Nevertheless, the country faces a series of challenges, including elevated degrees of inequality, intensified and escalated by the socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "During the COVID-19 pandemic, PAHO/WHO supported the Government of Costa Rica in implementing a community participation and intersectoral action approach to boost Primary Health Care (PHC) whereby communities identified areas for action. The approach was successful and is being extended, in tandem with development partners, to further accelerate progress towards health-related SDGs in the country. The Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and wellbeing (SDG3 GAP) is being used as a platform to facilitate inter-agency exchange of expertise and information leading to an overall increased impact of support to the country."

One central focus of the initiative has been ensuring the integration of health care services, which are mainly delivered by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund and the Ministry of Health.",
          "With the help of catalytic funds provided through SDG3 GAP, workshops were held to train community leaders on community mental health, GBV and self-care for non-communicable diseases (NDCs). The GBV element of the project was developed in the context of previous collaboration with UNFPA and the UN Interagency Group on Gender, which is housed under the Costa Rican UN Resident Coordinator Office and includes UNICEF, UNFPA and UNDP.",
          "Consequently, around 150 new community leaders from areas prioritized by the Ministry of Health were trained to identify and address GBV and mental health issues, which add to those trained in previous iterations of the initiative. The initiative provided community leaders with the necessary tools to disseminate information and collaboratively create action plans with and for the communities. The project works closely with the Ministry of Heath to ensure alignment with national strategies and plans.",

          "Several communities were chosen to create support networks to prevent GBV. This helped the Ministry of Health and the Costa Rican Social Security Fund to further connect with local communities, thus increasing the capacity to respond and adapt to the needs of the community.",
          "Another round of catalytic funding was released by SDG3 GAP signatory agencies in early 2023 to further strengthen collaboration among stakeholders and establish additional inter-sectoral committees and train more community leaders on mental health and GBV issues. This resulted in an overall strengthened capacity to respond to the needs of the local communities in combating mental health and GBV issues. One of the key components of this project is the incorporation of a Trainer of Trainer model, which allows the community leaders to continue the training independently to ensure sustainability.",

This person was also my carer so it was really hard to be able to leave. I was thinking, ‘How am I going to survive without this person?’ I didn't know where else to go.

Carers come everywhere with us, whether it's to doctors’ appointments, to therapy, even to appointments at the bank. And because we've got a disability, it is seen as their role of caring. Nobody questions it. Unfortunately for disabled women, we've usually lived a lifetime of disempowering experiences. So we're already often fairly reliant on other people or we haven't been enabled to be independent or speak up or voice our opinions. This doesn’t make violence inevitable. The fact is that states and territories usually rely very heavily on informal support to provide care because it saves them a lot of money. At the same time it also creates environments where we are at risk of being exploited and abused."

I don't need him in my life to help me survive.’ That was the first time in my adult life with children that I was supported to live independently and to be an independent woman and mother and single mum.

You know, that's not okay. This is violence and you don't deserve to live like that.’ Because we need that feedback loop. Often women are downplaying the severity of that violence in our own minds. And we're thinking, ‘Oh, it's not that bad, or I did all these things wrong, so therefore it's justified’.

But it needs to be more than just access. What if a woman doesn't have services or support to physically get to the refuge? And she has no funds or services to help her to stay in that refuge? The ramp can be the best ramp in the world, but without the means to support her in that environment, she can't go there, she can't get there, and she can't stay there. That’s where emergency funding comes in. The person needs to be able to hire support workers to help them with their day-to-day disability care needs. And then making sure they've got somebody to work with over a longer period of time to rebuild their lives. We also need a shift in community attitudes.

I'll be able to sleep better at night, everything will be fine.’ And then the memories came back, the nightmares came in and then the flashbacks and everything. I don't think it ever really leaves you. There's no end date to recovery. But I think back to where I was sitting on my bedroom floor crying because I didn't know how the internet worked. I left school early. I've since returned to education. I've started to realize that I am capable.

          "Influenza , or the flu, is both a seasonal and a pandemic virus.  Every year, mainly during the winter season, seasonal influenza infects as many as 1 billion people. This makes it one of the most common infectious respiratory viruses, after the common cold. Thankfully, the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System , or GISRS, monitors what viruses are circulating and twice a year recommends which viruses to target in the flu vaccine for the upcoming season.  The flu vaccine is the best way to prevent infection and may reduce symptoms if you do get the flu. For those who are more vulnerable to flu, what we call ‘high risk groups’, the vaccine can save your life. Good hygiene practices can also reduce the risk of infection (for more information, see the factsheet here ). Thankfully, although there are hundreds of millions of cases every year, the vast majority of these are not serious.  Nevertheless, WHO estimates that there are 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and between 290 000 to 650 000 respiratory deaths annually.",

          "On the other hand, pandemic influenza follows when a new virus is transmitted to humans from another animal and spreads. Unfortunately, the fact that influenza viruses are found in birds, pigs and other animals in the wild is why we cannot eradicate influenza (unlike, for example smallpox that is only found in humans and WHO was able to eradicate in the 1960s and 1970s thanks to a highly effective vaccine amongst other factors).  There will always be what are known as animal hosts. Most often animal-to-human (or zoonotic) infections cause sporadic or isolated infections in people, but not always. The WHO Global Influenza Programme has published a six-phase description of the pandemic process, from no infections in humans to sustained community outbreaks in two or more WHO Regions. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic similar to influenza viruses that caused pandemics in the past, and influenza viruses will most likely be the cause of future pandemics. Here we look at the past four influenza pandemics, which, in total, caused almost 60 million deaths.",

          "As we don our poppies and pay our respects on Remembrance Day or Veterans Day every year in November, to mark the end of the First World War, we should also remember those who fell due to the influenza pandemic just after the war.  In fact, more people died due to the influenza pandemic after the war (50 million) than died as a result of the war (17 million). Caused by the A(H1N1) virus, the intensity and speed with which the pandemic struck were almost unimaginable – infecting one-third (around 500 million people) of the Earth’s population at the time. It is believed that the virus was an avian virus passed on to humans from pigs.",

          "Between 1957 and 1958, an estimated one to four million people around the world died in an outbreak caused by the A(H2N2) virus. The virus was a combination of a virus of avian origin, probably from geese, and a human influenza virus. The pandemic started in Guizhou in southern China, but spread globally.  The initial outbreak was reported in February, spread to Hong Kong SAR and Singapore by April, and across south-east Asia by the end of May. By June it had reached the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The race was on to prepare the vaccine before the northern hemisphere flu season in October. A vaccine was prepared and this, combined with improved health care and the availability of antibiotics against opportunistic bacterial infections, saved hundreds of thousands – if not millions - of lives.",

          "The A(H3N2) influenza virus that caused the Hong Kong flu pandemic 10 years later was descended from the A(H2N2) influenza virus that caused the Asian Flu pandemic. The outbreak followed a similar spread. It reached the UK in August and in the rest of Europe, India, and Australia in September. United States troops returning from Vietnam brought back the virus in September, but it didn’t spread widely until December. Those who got sick often missed work, which even affected post and rail services in the UK. In the US, President Johnson was hospitalized with flu-like symptoms, and President-elect Nixon got the flu. Although it only took 2 months to create the vaccine after receipt of the first vaccine strain, influenza cases had largely peaked before the vaccine could be administered widely. The pandemic caused an estimated one to four million deaths. Unlike in the US, in Japan, Europe, and Australia the flu season the following year caused even more deaths. The H3N2 virus is still in circulation today as one of the viruses causing seasonal flu.",

Between 105 000 and 395 000 people are thought to have died. The virus was a new strain of H1N1 virus, the same virus that led to the 1918 Great Flu pandemic and the 1977 Russian flu outbreak. Although called swine flu, the virus is actually a combination of avian, swine, and human flu viruses further combined with a Eurasian pig flu virus.",
          "2024 and beyond: Preparing for the next pandemic",
          "Having a better understanding of the burden of influenza disease, including estimates of mortality and morbidity, supports informed decision-making on health policy and resource allocation. This applies to both annual seasonal influenza and to pandemic influenza viruses. Burden of disease estimates are crucial for strengthening national and global preparedness, prevention and control efforts.  For example, they can inform governments and vaccine manufacturers of the quantities of vaccine and other medical products needed, and of the potential health, social, political, environmental and economic impacts of the disease on the individual and society.",
          "As mentioned, WHO tracks seasonal influenza viruses and makes recommendations for vaccines through a large global network called GISRS . This network also monitors any other influenza viruses that could become pandemic viruses. It therefore acts as an alert mechanism.  GISRS also strengthens laboratory surveillance to prepare for and respond to outbreaks.  This network is planning to expand to other respiratory viruses of pandemic potential such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (a disease that is very dangerous for babies), SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), and other potential viruses that pose an epidemic and pandemic threat.",
          "Working alongside GISRS, the WHO Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework brings together stakeholders to implement a global approach to pandemic influenza preparedness and response.  It has, for example, signed agreements that have secured 10% of vaccine production (over 400 million doses) in the event of a pandemic.",
          "You can protect yourself from seasonal influenza by being vaccinated and practicing good hygiene, while WHO supports countries to prepare for, detect, and rapidly respond to the next pandemic virus."

          "As a country rich with traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) practices, Ghana is making steady efforts to improve evidence-based, quality delivery of TCIM in the country. We caught up with Dr Anastasia Yirenkyi, Director Traditional and Alternative Medicine, Ministry of Health Ghana, to discuss the TCIM experience in the country and future directions, to better serve the needs of communities.",
          "What has been Ghana’s experience in developing TCIM?",
          "Traditional medicine is based on knowledge that had been a part of faith and belief systems that people used throughout the time in Ghana to improve their health and well-being. Since 1960s, there has been a consistent political leadership in the country to develop policies and standards of TCIM delivery.",
          "In 1975, Ghana established a centre for plant-based medicine. We now have a centre of excellence for research and development of herbal medicines, working with universities. Many efforts have been made to provide professional trainings, and we have a very strong federation of Ghana traditional medicine practitioners. We have good policy and regulatory framework under the Public Health Act 851 mandated to control medical products including herbal medicines.",
          "Since 2017, we started pilots to integrate TCIM as part of primary health service delivery in the public health sector. Now we have 55 TCIM services integrated in the public health facilities. But we need to do a lot more. Not only in Ghana but also in the the whole African Region, we need to identify gaps and build bridges between the traditional and conventional medicine, to work together. What has been the experience in improving quality and safety standards of TCIM practices?",
          "Implementing the Public Health Act 851, we have been making efforts to register and accredit TCIM practitioners. We promote a common Code of Practice for TCIM. We estimated there are at least 40 000 practitioners of various TCIM practices in Ghana. At the Ministry of Health, we have registered up to 10 000 of them. This means we have a lot of work to do, not only in Ghana, but in all of our countries.",
          "TCIM practices are located at the centre of communities; people go to them because they know them, they speak their languages, know their customs and traditions. In many settings, TCIM practitioners provide the essential primary health care. In the past, they mostly used to operate in the private sector, so even educating them about the regulations and safety standards requires a lot of efforts. This also means we need a lot of support from partners and collaborators to invest in this work.",
          "What is the most important action we should take to improve delivery of TCIM?",
          "Building bridges between communities is much needed. We invite many conventional medicine researchers and doctors to events such as the African Day for Traditional Medicine, or conventions organized by the West African Health Organization. We learn so much from each other, there is so much missed opportunity to understand how different types of medicine can collaborate to help people get healthier.",
          "Equally, integrating service delivery focusing on patient-centred care is so essential. We need to promote referral services; for TCIM practitioners to say for example, if the patient requires urgent care from conventional medicine--let’s say, has a high blood pressure or symptoms of infectious diseases--to refer to the needed care in conventional medicine clinics so that patient doesn’t miss the required early diagnosis and care. At the same time, conventional medicine providers can refer to TCIM care if the patient expresses interest to access TCIM interventions and can benefit from it. This kind of collaboration and integration can help deliver a truly holistic care for people to achieve better health and well-being."

          "WHO is in the process of developing a Disability guide for action – a national strategic planning tool that provides a step-by-step guidance for countries to integrate disability inclusion in their existing health systems’ plans. The tool serves as the foundational resource to enable ministries of health to implement the recommendations of the Global report on health equity for persons with disabilities, and to support Member States to meet commitments on the highest attainable standard of health for all people, as outlined in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and World Health Assembly resolution WHA74.8 ."

          "Under the leadership of Minister of Health, Dr Vojislav Šimun, Montenegro became the first country in the European region to implement the WHO Disability guide for action and ensure persons with disabilities have equitable access to health services. To mark the start of the process, the Ministry of Health, with support from WHO, organized a high-level event in November 2023, attended by Minister of Health Dr Vojislav Šimun, Deputy Prime Minister for Labour, Education, Health and Social Policy Dr Srđan Pavićević, Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Montenegro Peter Lundberg, Head of the WHO Office in Montenegro, Mina Brajović, representatives from different governmental bodies, UN agencies, health service providers, civil society, and organizations of persons with disabilities.",
          "Dr Vojislav Šimun, said that he will work “tirelessly” to provide universal health care and access to every citizen. He mentioned: “Recently, the Government adopted the Strategy for the protection of persons with disabilities from discrimination and the promotion of equality, which includes a focus on the accessibility of health services for persons with disabilities and is dedicated to reducing discrimination and barriers in accessing health services. There are important steps that we have to go through and there is a lot of work ahead of us. Therefore, I welcome the efforts of the World Helath Organization to improving equity for persons with disabilities and the support they provide to the Government of Montenegro in this direction”.",
          "The Resident coordinator of the United Nations (UN) system in Montenegro, Peter Lundberg, sent a call for action: “Now is the time for change, we must speed up the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which promotes, protects, and ensures respect for the human rights of persons with disabilities”. Peter Lundberg also reiterated the strong support from the UN to Montenegro, “The United Nations supports Montenegro on this path and I am here to assure you that you are not alone in this task. Achieving health for all, including people with disabilities, will require partnership and collaboration. The United Nations team will be with you every step of the way”.",
          "The Head of the WHO Country Office in Montenegro, Mina Brajović, highlighted what is at stake if we do not advance disability inclusion in the health sector, “Regardless of what type of barriers we are talking about as obstacles for people with disabilities in achieving health care, they distance us from humanity, an inclusive society and prosperity”. Dr Brajović concluded: “The level of health care for persons with disabilities is a litmus test – a measure of our true commitment to achieving universal health care and creating a healthier and safer society for everyone”.",
          "As part of the process of implementation of the Disability guide for action, a working group was established by the Ministry of Health, comprising of governmental representatives from different ministries, persons with disabilities and their representative organizations, the Institute for Public Health, the National Insurance Fund, health service providers, the National Ombudsman, and UN sister agencies. The working group is regularly convened by the Ministry of Health to provide ongoing input and support during the process, making the implementation of the disability guide for action a highly collaborative process to promote meaningful progress in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities .",
          "In November 2023 , a comprehensive situation assessment on health equity for persons with disabilities in Montenegro was completed. This situation assessment was based on a report produced by WHO to identify the specific gaps and opportunities for disability inclusion in the national health system. It culminated with a successful two-day workshop organised by the Ministry of Health, supported by WHO, and attended by the members of the working group to discuss, complement, and agree on the findings of this report.",
          "Development of an action plan – A 2-day workshop on 19–20 February 2024, was convened by Ministry of Health of Montenegro to identify and rank the priority activities to make the country’s health system more inclusive inclusion. The identified actions are closely aligned with the national health sector priorities outlined in the National Health Strategy. The action plan will be finalized in April, when the implementation stage will commence."

          "The rehabilitation workforce is a diverse composition of occupations and specializations that provide interventions that optimize functioning and reduce disability. The effective coverage of skilled workers in the field of rehabilitation is crucial for providing quality care to those in need. However, many countries struggle with obstacles such as lack of institutional capacity, insufficient jobs for rehabilitation workers, and ineffective incentives for health care workers.",
          "To address these challenges, the Guide for rehabilitation workforce evaluation (GROWE) was launched in July 2023. GROWE provides a comprehensive and systematic approach to collecting qualitative and quantitative data to identify context-specific challenges and develop action plans to strengthen the rehabilitation workforce at national level. The evaluation focuses on economic and political context, stakeholder influence, workforce need, supply, demand and absorption, efficiency, competency and performance to provide information that can shape impactful workforce strategies. By considering the rehabilitation workforce as an interactive ecosystem of occupations, and adopting a comprehensive approach to evaluation, GROWE helps garner political will for investment and action.",
          "The Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation, a WHO Collaborating Centre, partnered with WPRO and the HQ Rehabilitation team and hosted the first GROWE training workshop between 27 and 29 February. The workshop aimed to provide potential GROWE implementers with knowledge and skills on human resources for health and its application to the rehabilitation workforce. It brought together 20 instructors and trainees from around the world, who were guided though theoretical and practical implementation of the GROWE tool.",
          "At the end of the workshop participants said that they had gained considerably from the training, and felt more confident in evaluating the health labour market, competency profiles, population needs and labour market failures analyses with respect to rehabilitation. Many participants will now be going on to implement GROWE in countries around the world.",

          "In December 2023, multiple partners 1 conducted an intensive 11-day course on rabies surveillance and control in the capital city of Cameroon, Yaoundé. This training brought together 25 professionals working in different sectors (human health and animal health) and countries (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo). After completing extensive online preparatory sessions in the preceding months, course participants gathered in person to put their theoretical knowledge into hands-on experience – in the classroom, the laboratory and the field. This covered different elements of a rabies programme including rabies control planning and management, data collection and sharing, diagnostics, post-exposure prophylaxis for exposed individuals, human rabies case management, mass dog vaccination, and community awareness and engagement.",
          "Photo credit: WHO/Deborah Nadal",
          "The course presented participants with the most common challenges that rabies-endemic countries experience.",
          "Challenge 1. Provision of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the emergency response to rabies exposure. It prevents the virus from entering the central nervous system, which would invariably result in death. Depending on the severity of the contact with the suspected rabid animal, PEP may consist of thorough wound washing, the administration of rabies immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies for quick passive immunization, and a course of rabies vaccination.",
          "Countries and their communities are faced with the unavailability of vaccines in remote areas and their unaffordability for low-income individuals. Participants visited the rabies clinic of the Centre Pasteur du Cameroun in Yaoundé, where health professionals guided them through the PEP process, explaining what to do for each of the three rabies exposure categories and demonstrating how to perform intradermal vaccination.",
          "Photo credit: WHO/Deborah Nadal",
          "Challenge 2. Mass dog vaccination is the most cost–effective strategy for preventing rabies in people and animals such as livestock because it stops transmission at its source. Moreover, it reduces the need for PEP, since 99% of human rabies exposures occur through rabid dogs.",
          "Photo credit: WHO/Deborah Nadal",
          "The course framed mass dog vaccination as a matter of human public health as well as animal health, bringing professionals of both sectors together in conversations on how to ensure that campaigns reach all at-risk communities, especially those who have many free-roaming dogs and live far away from health care facilities where PEP is provided. The training covered all aspects of mass dog vaccination, from dog population management to the different strategies to reach different dog groups, the implementation of campaigns and the practicalities of catching and vaccinating dogs (understanding dog behaviour, safely handling dogs, vaccinating puppies, etc.). Discussion also involved the important topic of cross-border mass dog vaccination campaigns, to ensure concerted efforts regionally and globally. Participants put this knowledge into practice in the field in the city of Mfou. There, local authorities had previously announced the 2-day campaign that involved door-to-door vaccination, central-point vaccination, and the vaccination of free-roaming dogs on the road and around a slaughterhouse.",
          "Challenge 3. Community engagement",
          "During the course, participants were invited to reflect on the socio-cultural aspects of rabies in Cameroon and their respective countries. They were introduced to the methods used in anthropological research and risk communication. Dr Deborah Nadal presented WHO’s position on rabies and One Health and the associated OpenWHO courses .",
          "At the end of the course, the enthusiasm and satisfaction of the participants were palpable, not only because of the knowledge gained but also especially due to the realization that dog-mediated human rabies can be eliminated if stakeholders at all levels work together. The importance of One Health collaboration and teamwork comes out strongly in the words of Alex Théodore Tonye, a human health professional working on cholera control who during this course approached free-roaming dogs for the very first time: “ As we say in Cameroon when we want to say goodbye: we are together .” His message is shared by Nathan Kutshi, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo: “ Whatever our problems and difficulties, we have decided to give our best by participating actively in this training so that we can put our knowledge to use in our communities to save human lives. Let’s be Rage Champions! ”",
          "is a crucial pillar of ZERO BY 30: the global strategic plan to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 . Communities need to be considered the main stakeholders of any rabies control plan implemented locally and, with them, it is necessary to understand their dog-keeping practices, identify the barriers to PEP and develop sustainable mass dog vaccination strategies.",
          "---------------------------------------------------- 1 The course was organized by the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the Centre Pasteur in Cameroon, the Directorate of Veterinary Services in Cameroon, the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Animal Industries, and the Ministry of Public Health, in collaboration with the Fondation Health Sciences eTraining, Lausanne University, Glasgow University, the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute and the Pasteur Network, with the support of WHO, the World Organisation for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control."

          "Workers surveyed in Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia and Tanzania said they appreciated the security of not carrying cash, the convenience of no longer having to travel to a disbursement site to receive their wages, and above all, the speed of payment – as short as half an hour after finishing work compared to waits of weeks or even months.",
          "The surveys, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, linked timely compensation to better morale and worker retention.",
          "“There is really a big difference in speed,” said Jean-Luc, a health worker interviewed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) at the end of a polio immunization campaign. “We finished the campaign mop-up yesterday and received a text notification the next evening. I’m going to pay my child’s school fees. Now we can relax.”",
          "Digital payments also save time and money for health campaign organizers, including the burden and expense of transporting large sums of cash and completing documentation.",
          "“When you have 300 to 500 volunteers to pay, doing accounts and signing receipts takes a lot of time,” said Saïdi, a polio team leader in DRC.",
          "WHO first used the new digital payments in polio immunization campaigns in Côte d’Ivoire. Although outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio were on the rise, vaccination campaigns were having trouble getting off the ground. In the first quarter of 2020, almost half the polio campaigns in WHO’s African Region were postponed, saw workers drop out, or suffered other detrimental effects stemming from delays in cash disbursements.",
          "As WHO and partners worked to develop the nuts-and-bolts aspects of a digital payment ecosystem (registering workers into a database, verifying their profiles with the mobile network operator and more) the benefits of a cashless approach became more apparent.",
          "\"There is substantial evidence that digitizing payments can support people, especially women, to gain access to financial services and increase control over their earnings,” said Maria May, Senior Program Officer, Inclusive Financial Systems, at the Gates Foundation. “Over the past four years, the World Health Organization has utilized the growing presence of mobile money across Africa to ensure that the courageous frontline vaccinators in polio outbreak campaigns are paid completely, quickly, and securely.”",
          "Alain Labrique, director of WHO’s Department of Digital Health and Innovation, said that “digital payments are one of the key pillars of Digital Health Public Infrastructure currently strongly encouraged within WHO’s guidance to member-states on Digital Transformation.” WHO views digital payments as a foundation for many more digital development activities, together with Data Exchange and Digital ID Infrastructure. He added “we are delighted to work with partners in the digital space and add our voice to this celebration of WHO's joining the Better Than Cash Alliance”."

          "Mr Telamukta lives in Chichalgondi, a remote village in Chhattisgarh, India. He had never sought medical attention for his swollen legs and breathlessness because he was simply too far away to visit a health care centre. One day, he noticed something different in his local Haat Bazaar community market, to which he travelled weekly to get his family’s groceries. A mobile medical unit was offering check ups and treatment.",
          "“On visiting this Haat Bazaar clinic, I was informed that I have diabetes and hypertension. Now I am feeling better after taking the medicines. Coming to this location has proven advantageous for me, as the doctors were able to identify the underlying issue of my condition. This is why I make regular visits here to get my medications,” said Mr Telamukta.",
          "In Chhattisgarh, populations living in remote and rural areas are unable to travel the long distances to health clinics and had limited opportunities to address their diseases and health conditions.",
          "Today, thanks to a strong primary health care (PHC) intervention by the State Government, about 18 million people now have access to mobile health clinics through weekly community markets known as Haat Bazaars. This incredible step to provide diagnostics and treatment free of charge to the entire population brings India closer towards achieving universal health coverage (UHC)."

          "The weekly Haat Bazaars of Chhattisgarh are a traditional form of barter system for the local population. People walk long distances to sell their forest or agricultural produce, buy household supplies, and assemble to exchange news and information. The markets are fundamental for commerce and provide many opportunities for social and cultural exchange between different communities.",
          "The Chhattisgarh State Government saw these markets as a great opportunity to bring PHC services closer to the people who need it most. In 2019, they launched the Mukhyamantri Haat Bazaar-Clinic Scheme. Today, hundreds of clinics operate in markets across Chhattisgarh, serving people who have never had access to healthcare before.",
          "With support from the UHC Partnership, WHO has been involved at multiple stages of policy design and implementation for the scheme in coordination with the Government of India. WHO provide technical support in coordination with health authorities in three districts to roll out the clinics, analysed the impact of the work on service delivery, and fed back findings to improve the initiative’s design and implementation.",
          "Over 3 years, more than 95 000 people have received health check-ups, and treatment where necessary. As of May 2022, a total of 1 888 clinics are in operation covering a population of 18 million people."

The clinic provides maternal and newborn care, immunization, treatment for common illnesses such as fever, scabies, cold, cough, diarrhoea, malaria, anaemia, and screening for noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cancers. When possible, patients can receive medications here or be referred to secondary or tertiary care.",
          "Mitanins are community-level frontline health workers who make home visits in the assigned areas and inform communities about the next scheduled Haat Bazaar Clinic and the services available. The mid-level healthcare workers, along with the Mitanins, also play a vital role in mobilizing pregnant women for antenatal care, and children for vaccinations.",
          "All services and treatment are provided free of charge. The health services are convenient, effective, and affordable to all. This means greater equity in access, and firmly places primary health care as the foundation of a stronger health system overall. This is a big step towards achieving universal health coverage (UHC), where everyone can access the health services they need without experiencing financial difficulty.",

          "One year ago, in the middle of winter, a series of devastating earthquakes hit both southern Türkiye and northern Syria, killing over 59 000 people — over 53 500 in Türkiye and 5900 in Syria. Tens of thousands more people were injured and thousands of homes and public buildings, including hospitals, were damaged or destroyed.  This was one of the biggest disasters in the region in recent times.",
          "The earthquakes required a massive health response. Despite the disruption to health services due to damaged infrastructure and transportation, health workers and volunteers worked day and night, providing first aid, wound and surgical care to people suffering from spinal cord injuries, loss of limbs, traumatic brain injuries, and bone fractures.",
          "In Türkiye, the national authorities coordinated a large number of medical evacuations and established field hospitals in the affected areas to provide care for the injured.",
          "In Syria, the earthquakes hit communities that had already been deeply affected during the 13-year long conflict-driven crisis, characterized by repeated displacement, disease outbreaks and a severely weakened health system. Increasing tensions within the country and the region continue to exacerbate the already precarious health situation of nearly 15 million people in need of health services across the country.",
          "Survivors struggled to get access to basic health services for the treatment of chronic conditions, as well as maternal, newborn and child health care. Mental health needs triggered by the initial event were heightened by thousands of aftershocks coupled with poor living conditions, in overcrowded shelters, where protection concerns and the risk of disease spread became higher. Damaged water networks and at least 125 health facilities, and untold numbers of medical equipment and devices, further disrupted access to basic services for affected populations in Syria. Heavy snow, rainfall and power cuts hampered humanitarian access while the lack of communications and fuel aggravated the situation.",
          "In the first days after the earthquakes, WHO mobilized support to life-saving trauma care for hundreds of casualties. WHO supported both Türkiye and Syria by delivering health supplies, sending experts for technical support, jointly coordinating the deployment of Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) to affected parts of Türkiye, supporting mobile health teams who provided health care services to affected populations in Syria, re-establishing and strengthening disease surveillance and outbreak response, and addressing mental health and psychosocial needs of the affected populations.",
          "Teams from WHO, deployed in the provinces highly affected by the earthquake, gather information for a rapid field assessment. Hatay, Türkiye. Credit: WHO / Tunc Ozceber A few days after the earthquakes struck, WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, accompanied by the WHO Executive Director for Emergencies, the WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Region and the WHO Representative in the country, visited the affected areas in Aleppo. Dr. Tedros then proceeded to visit north-west Syria,\r\nthe location of the greatest unmet health needs following the earthquake,\r\nbecoming the first UN principal to enter north-west Syria since the beginning\r\nof the conflict, 13 years ago. During these visits, WHO delegations met with\r\nsenior and local officials leading the response, health partners, communities,\r\nhealth and frontline workers, victims, and families. A few weeks later, WHO Director-General and the WHO Regional Director for the European Region also traveled to the affected areas of Türkiye, where they met communities, frontline workers and government representatives leading the response. The consequences of this large-scale disaster will last for many years to come, and the health needs of earthquake survivors remain high. Many people continue to live in temporary shelters, dealing with loss and mental health trauma. Those living with disabilities caused by the earthquakes continue to need rehabilitation care. In Türkiye alone, many thousands of people are estimated to have long-term rehabilitation needs. In Syria, the physical and psychological damage is still affecting millions of people. Nearly one year later, levels of depression and stress-related disorders have increased by 200% and 600% respectively compared to previous years across Syria. Today, WHO and health partners continue to deliver health services for maternal and child health, management of non-communicable diseases, prevention of outbreaks of cholera and other infectious diseases, physical rehabilitation, and mental health and psychosocial support. WHO is also focused on health system recovery, including replacement of damaged equipment and devices, repair of affected health facilities, and promotion of integrated disease surveillance. Both in the immediate and longer-term following disasters of this scale, disease prevention and control is critical and WHO efforts have included the control of infectious diseases and prevention of water-borne infections. Here are 6 ways that WHO has responded to the immediate and continuing health needs of the populations affected by the earthquakes in both Türkiye and Syria: 1. Over 6 million people were reached with emergency medical supplies for wound and trauma care in both countries. The initial response within Syria also included the procurement of medicines for trauma and surgery, non-communicable diseases, antibiotics, intravenous fluids and other important supplies with timely airlift provided by the WHO Logistics Hub in Dubai and subsequent dispatch of materials to public health facilities in affected areas. In north-west Syria alone, 252 metric tons of supplies were delivered through 25 cross-border deliveries from Türkiye.",

In Türkiye, a total of 38 national and international EMTs from more than 25 countries, have carried out close to 100 000 medical consultations. This represents the largest deployment of EMTs to a disaster zone in the WHO European Region in its 75-year history, with teams integrated into the ongoing health response to provide critical emergency care, surgeries, rehabilitation and access to primary-care services, while strengthening national capacities for preparedness and response.",

          "3. In north-west Syria, over 40 000 people displaced after the earthquakes are still living in reception centres as risk of flooding and a decrease in temperatures increase their vulnerabilities. WHO continues to support disease surveillance and outbreak response, through mobile health teams and clinics. Some 950 000 people were reached through household visits and awareness sessions targeting mental health, cholera and communicable disease in the aftermath of the earthquake.",

Pre-earthquake, about one in four people in Syria were living with a disability, compared to one in seven globally. In the months following the earthquake, total of 23 000 patients received rehabilitation consultations by health partners in north-west Syria. WHO supported 5 rehabilitation centres for inpatient rehabilitation services where each patient received intensive physiotherapy sessions alongside psychosocial support. WHO continues to support affected health facilities with rehabilitation supplies and services, as well as numerous equipment and devices, including radiology equipment, such as CT-scanners, MRI and X-ray machines. In total, nearly 470,000 people received outpatient consultations, and over 1 million mental consultations in Syria.",

          "5. In addition to the visible scars of the earthquakes, there are also invisible ones. People lost family members, friends, their houses and livelihoods. First responders, who tried to rescue their communities, even when there was no hope left, were heavily affected. Very early on, health workers started to detect symptoms of mental trauma in patients, such as shaking and fatigue, disorientation, tendency to burst into tears, fits of rage and also changes in sleep and appetite. This is why WHO immediately supported the mental health response in both countries, and continues to do so, through deployment of mental health experts, training of health workers and delivery of mental health and psychosocial services. WHO estimates that nearly 1 million people in north-west Syria or 20% of the overall population, suffer from a mental health disorder, while 230 000 people are estimated to suffer from severe mental health disorders. As part of WHO’s response to the earthquakes, mental health services were expanded at 75 hospitals, 51 reception centres and 84 camps, reaching a total of 170 000 people with psychological first aid.  At the same time, WHO Country Office in Syria also deployed more than 125 mobile outreach teams providing mental health services to affected persons in communities, in shelters and in schools. Overall, in Syria, WHO aided the scaling up of support to women, children and families experiencing gender-based violence and sexual exploitation and abuse. Women facing difficulties such as displacement, and domestic violence were supported and empowered to break the shame and stigma around disclosures.",

          "At the 154th World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Board in January, Member States convened to discuss the post-2023 strategic framework for polio transition.",
          "In their remarks, Member States commended progress so far and urged WHO to support countries to gradually transition and integrate the polio programme functions of immunization, surveillance, outbreak response and containment, which are vital to sustain a polio-free world. The objective is clear – to utilize the investments made in polio eradication to sustain progress and build strong, resilient and equitable health systems.",
          "Sustaining the essential functions of immunization, surveillance, outbreak response and containment",
          "Action on several fronts is necessary to achieve the three goals of the post-2023 strategic framework: to keep the world polio-free, minimize the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, and rapidly detect and control disease outbreaks. Building upon lessons learned from the Strategic Action Plan for Polio Transition (2018-2023) , the framework aims to tailor the process of polio transition to country context, considering local epidemiology and the ability of governments to fully finance their health systems.",
          "On the first goal, Member States overwhelmingly reiterated their support for a polio-free world. This will require concerted efforts in the countries where the virus remains and sustaining capacities to ensure that the world remains polio free, once eradication is achieved. Statements from Member States of the African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, the two regions where the polio programme maintains the highest footprint, endorsed the tailored approach set out in the post-2023 framework.",
          "On the second goal, Member States emphasized the need for the closer alignment of polio eradication and essential immunization goals as we approach the post-polio world. Member States urged greater programmatic integration at the country level, to reach the hardest to reach communities and broaden service delivery. Reinforcing routine immunization is a crucial step to close immunity gaps, which will in turn will help strengthen the overall health system.",
          "Regarding the third goal, experience shows that countries will need continued support from WHO and partners to detect and respond to disease outbreaks. Germany observed, “polio infrastructure has been a major asset in many countries; therefore we need to ensure that current monitoring and surveillance systems have sustained national financing in place, even after successful polio eradication”. France noted that sustaining strong surveillance, especially environmental surveillance, will be vital to protect vulnerable populations. In addition, several countries urged continued work to ensure that poliovirus materials are safely and securely contained after eradication, which forms one of the four strategic outcomes of the post-2023 transition framework.",
          "Monitoring, evaluation and accountability",
          "The post-2023 framework is designed to drive progress across these goals. To achieve the overarching global vision to use polio investments to build strong, resilient and equitable health systems, the Eastern Mediterranean, African and South-East Asia regions are developing tailored Regional Strategic Plans to support action in each priority country. Outcomes and milestones to achieve the goals will be regularly monitored through a robust monitoring and evaluation framework.",
          "Member States also reiterated the need to clarify accountability arrangements to prepare for the sunset of GPEI, commending the work WHO has started in this regard. Member States called for the close involvement of relevant actors across the global health architecture in this process.",
          "Echoing other Member States, Canada commended the work done far, and urged efforts to continue: “As we move through eradication, transition and certification, we encourage Member States and GPEI partners to support country-led processes, alongside strong, effective leadership from the WHO, to set countries up to succeed as they look to preserve historic polio systems and infrastructure.”"

The exhibition is a collection of works of photographers from six countries across Africa where Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are prevalent and aims, creatively, to raise awareness and engage policymakers across the UN system and its stakeholders, as well as the public on NTDs and challenges that perpetuate the diseases. UN system partners, including the UN Member States of the Group of Friends on NTDs, as well as civil society and the private sector joined the co-hosts on 30 January 2024 at an opening reception and a private screening of a documentary “The Fly Collectors” filmed in Senegal about the efforts of a group of men working towards freeing the communities near the Gambia River from River blindness. Mr Stewart Simonson, WHO Representative to the UN, highlighted the significance of the day as well as the crucial role of public-private philanthropic partnership in combating NTDs. He called on all stakeholders to Unite and to Act to Eliminate these diseases that affect the poorest of the poor."

          "How do people with long term diseases survive survival?",
          "Noma is a noncommunicable disease can start as just a pinch of pain inside a child's mouth yet, if left undiagnosed and untreated, it destroys flesh and bone, resulting in death or a lifetime of facial disfigurement.",
          "As a child Fidel Strub couldn’t understand why he got noma and no one else. The impact on his family was huge, no-one was untouched. He saw his family struggle financially to get him diagnosed, to get treatment in Burkina Faso, before being flown from his home to Switzerland for treatment. He found himself as a young child, in a strange land, re-learning how to eat, how to speak, avoiding mirrors, undergoing endless medical procedures, and learning to live with depression, loneliness and anger.",
          "“ It is not just about surviving, it is about learning to live. If I was to tell my story, it would not stop. There was so much trauma I barely made it .” Fidel Strub, co-founder of Elysium Noma Survivors Association and a noma survivor",
          "Noma destroys each person's face in a specific way, so while there is a common base procedure, there can be completely new procedures needed for each survivor. Depending on the deterioration of the face, each one must be constructed in a different way. Some cannot breathe, some cannot chew, many have no access to the experts that can help them do so. Fidel felt that he could not even choose a trauma to describe the impact, it was so multifaceted. Even today, decades later, ordinary actions like going for a dental check up mean his dentist must know his case in depth.",
          "Fidel Strub and Mulikat Okanlawon, co-founders of Elysium Noma Survivors Association Photo credit: Claire Jeantet – Fabrice Caterini / Inediz",
          "That specialization is part of the problem. Noma advocates, like Fidel, have worked hard to use meetings and events to connect academics, policy-makers, surgeons and other experts. Universities, doctors, dentists, and surgeons, all work on their own aspect of noma’s impact. A noma database to gather information and make that information accessible is one of the things he most wants to see.",
          "The true magnitude of noma’s impact, even the number of people who had or survived noma, is unknown. It is described as “one of the world’s most under-recognized health challenges” by WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Noma was added to WHO's official list of neglected tropical diseases in December 2023.",
          "Simply figuring out how many people have had noma is challenging. It is a rapid disease that kills quickly, and it strikes in areas of poverty where there may not be good health infrastructure. Affected children can be misdiagnosed, and those who die may never be diagnosed at all. The disease has a social stigma, as it primarily affects malnourished young children in regions of extreme poverty. Even after survival, the trauma is so severe that many do not survive survival. Fidel himself attempted suicide twice. His experience is that after the medical issues were solved, there was little understanding of the survival of its impact. Again, there is little data on how many survive the decades after medical recovery.",
          "“ Noma is more than a disease, it is a social marker of extreme poverty and malnutrition, affecting the most vulnerable populations .” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General",
          "The last figures issued by WHO are from 1998. Then there were an estimated 140 000 new cases per year, with a prevalence of 770 000, and a case fatality of 90%. There may be even good news concealed within the data: recent evidence suggests that the reported noma case fatality rate could now be less than 90%, and it is known that noma can be greatly reduced with early treatment.",
          "The struggle to survive noma can be constant and lonely. Fidel and other survivors have advocated for the recognition and elimination of noma for decades. He has worked on awareness building and fundraising, help to connect experts, and spoke with Bente Mikkelsen, WHO Director of Noncommunicable Diseases, at a side event of the World Health Assembly.",
          "Fidel Strub co-founder of Elysium Noma Survivors Association and Bente Mikkelsen, Director NCD Department, May 2023 Photo credit: WHO / Anne Kennedy",
          "It was an online noma conference in February 2021 that Fidel Strub felt the tide change. The event was dedicated to the discussion of noma. It felt to Fidel like a recognition. He and Mulikat Okanlawon, a noma survivor from Nigeria, co-founded the Elysium Noma Survivors Association after meeting at the World Health Assembly in 2022. Then the Government of Nigeria spearheaded action to have noma included in the WHO list of neglected tropical diseases.",
          "“ …now the fight can begin by combining the point of view of survivors with data while networking experts, humanitarian organisations, medical practitioners and researchers .” Fidel Strub, co-founder of Elysium and noma survivor",
          "The inclusion of noma to the list of neglected tropic diseases was recommended by the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Neglected Tropical Diseases in 2023 and fulfils the mandate on noma outlined by the resolution on oral health which was adopted in 2021 at the World Health Assembly. This classification will amplify global awareness, catalyse research, stimulate funding, and boost efforts to control the disease through multisectoral and multi-pronged approaches.",
          "The broader picture on noma is immense. We are missing data, we are missing chances to network experts and survivors, we are missing even the numbers impacted. But we are also missing preventions, cures and opportunities we have not yet identified.",
          "With survivors in the lead, the race is on to know, to understand, and to end noma.",
          "_____________",
          "Fidel Strub has been advocating on noma since 2017. He co-founded, with Mulikat Okanlawon, Elysium Noma Survivors Association, in 2022. Born in May 1991 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in 1994, he became sick with Noma. Following his recovery, he had 27 operations and many years of re-learning how to eat and speak. The mental toll of the illness was also extensive."

          "Madagascar is a large and beautiful island in the Indian Ocean. However, according to the World Bank (April 2023), the poverty rate is estimated to be 80.2% and approximately 77% of the population has no access to limited-standard sanitation. 1 In rural areas, 88% of the population lives on less than US$ 2.15 per day. Madagascar also faces many health challenges.",
          "Infection with the parasite Taenia solium is endemic in Madagascar, and causes disease with some of the highest prevalence of porcine cysticercosis noted globally. 2 Out of 114 districts, at least 53 have been identified as positive for taeniasis. This is not surprising considering the levels of poverty and sanitation, and that many backyard farmers keep pigs to support their livelihoods.  Despite lacking accurate data on the burden of the disease, neurocysticercosis (the main disease caused by infection with T. solium ) is assumed to be very high. The poor quality of data is due to lack of surveillance, of medical recording and reporting, the high cost of diagnostics and their limited access.",
          "According to Dr Jean Adolin Rafanomezantsoa, Chief of the Health Centre and officer responsible for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in Betafo district: “Although we have no official statistics data on the number of neurocysticercosis cases, many suspected cases come to the health centres for consultation. These people suffer from strong headaches, epileptic seizures or have undergone treatment for chronic symptoms.”",
          "Dr Sylvia Ramiandrasoa, an expert previously responsible for the taeniasis programme at the Ministry of Health of Madagascar, led a 3-year programme between 2015 and 2017. She said: “For 3 years we conducted mass drug administration covering around 70 000 people with the support of the WHO in the Vakinankaratra region. The programme was very successful in reducing the level of taeniasis but, one year later, the prevalence had increased to the original levels. That indicated to us that we needed to conduct a One Health programme involving interventions in pigs.”  She continues to provide her expertise in the most recent One Health project.",
          "Dr Diana Andria-Mananjara, a PhD candidate from FOFIFA (Centre National de Recherche Appliquée au Développement Rural) has been coordinating the One Health project locally from 2021 to 2023. This project was funded by the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund from the International Development Research Centre (Canada), led by the University of Melbourne (Australia); WHO was also one of the key partners. She explained that  “three ministries were involved: the Ministry of Public Health, which led the actions related to the mass treatment in humans; the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, which was responsible for the vaccination and antiparasitic treatment of pigs; and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific research, which assessed the effectiveness of this integrated approach. Bringing multiple institutions to work together is not always an easy task, as each of them has their own priorities, structure and thinking. Initiating new projects can also challenging, but we overcame those challenges, and the final evaluation of this One Health project showed very good results.  In August 2023, one year after the last mass treatment, we saw a big reduction of porcine cysticercosis from approximately 30% before the start of the project to 8%. This indicates a big decrease in parasite transmission and will result in less people being infected.”",
          "Dr Mihaja Rakotoarinoro, also from FOFIFA, worked alongside Diana. She remarked on the importance of the sensitization and awareness activities: “To be successful and combat, prevent and even eliminate the human disease, the involvement of the community is essential. We need to sensitize the community and make them aware of the effects of the disease, and encourage their participation in the mass treatment and, in the case of pig farmers, on the vaccination and treatment of pigs.”",
          "Dr Jose Nely is Head of the Department responsible for the fight against NTDs within the Ministry of Health in Madagascar. He has been working towards the integration of T. solium control with other programmes: “We are working on integrating the T. solium control programme with those for other diseases such as schistosomiasis. Both diseases use the same microscopy tests for surveillance (Kato-Katz) and the same drug for mass treatment, (praziquantel), providing good opportunities for synergies. This is not always easy as each programme has its own timings and priorities, but in the past couple of years we have been learning how to work together and it is becoming routine now, increasing the efficiency of both programmes.”",
          "Dr Nivohanitra Razafindrabe from the Veterinary Services of Madagascar, commented on the effects of the One Health project from the animal side: “The vaccination and treatment of pigs have had many benefits for pig farmers beyond reducing T. solium infection. We have noticed that vaccinated pigs grow faster and sell at good prices. In the butchers we have seen a clear reduction in the number of cysticercosis cases since the pigs were vaccinated and dewormed. But to achieve good results, it is important to involve the local authorities at fokontany level and conduct awareness-raising activities, such as radio broadcasts and posters.”",
          "Mrs Falia, a pig farmer from the Akazomirotra community, which has participated in the recent One Health project, commented: “We have taken part in the deworming medication against taeniasis and schistosomiasis distributed by the health centre and we vaccinate our pigs because when pigs are vaccinated there is no risk. In fact, I know someone who has cysticercosis. His treatment is very expensive, he complains about the cost of the medicines and he has to undergo several tests in town. That is the advantage of vaccinating pigs for human health.”",
          "Mr Justin, a pig farmer in Soavina, Betafo district said: “I hope this project will spread throughout Madagascar because it will benefit farmers and protect human health.”",
          "Very good progress has been made to control the diseases caused by T. solium infection in Madagascar, especially with the multisectoral approach, which must be encouraged; however, the results need to be consolidated and extended to the rest of the country with support from different partners in order to keep and accelerate the momentum, as Mr Justin rightly said!",

          "Dr Tep Bengthay, the Deputy Director of the Department of Animal Health and Veterinary Public Health and General Directorate of Animal Health and Production, is smiling proudly about this achievement: “It is an important element in contributing to the elimination of human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 in Cambodia and key to being replicated in all other provinces.”",
          "Cambodia achieved a great feat by successfully completing the largest government-led mass dog vaccination campaign to date. A prerequisite of the German Development Cooperation (GIZ) was that the Global Programme for Pandemic Prevention and Response, One Health should be implemented using existing government structures. All activities included the animal and human health sectors. Furthermore, close collaboration was maintained with the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Pasteur Institute of Cambodia and Mission Rabies as relevant actors in fighting rabies.",
          "Another key element to mass dog vaccination was the implementation of integrated bite case management (IBCM) in Battambang province. A formal agreement among the different sectors as well as several awareness-raising and training activities with local human and animal health care staff now ensure that a dog bite incident triggers investigations by both sectors. The Deputy Director of the Department for Communicable Disease Control at the Ministry of Health, Dr Yi Sengdouern, appreciates the progress of joint activities based on existing systems between the animal and human health sectors. Over a period of 10 months, investigators examined almost 1000 suspected rabies cases, with laboratory testing carried out on 25 dog samples. “The strengthened cross-sectoral collaboration including the workstream of IBCM is very important for Cambodia and has high potential to be scaled up – towards reaching Zero by 2030 for rabies in our country”, he said .",
          "A third essential pillar of the approach is increased access to rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) services, as currently only one third of Cambodia’s population lives within reasonable reach of a PEP centre. For the first time, PEP services have been made available at Kampot Provincial Referral Hospital and announced to the public. The Deputy Director of the Kampot Provincial Health Department, Dr Tann Chheng, highlighted the current successes of the improved PEP service in reducing the burden of expenditure due to direct and indirect costs: “This clearly contributes to reducing morbidity and mortality of bite victims!” Within the first 6 months of introduction, about 700 people who had suffered bites received PEP services .",
          "To underpin the pilot activities, support was provided at the policy level to develop national guidelines for rabies surveillance, prevention and control. Further, a joint study visit was made to Viet Nam by both sectors. “I am glad to join the study visit to Viet Nam together with my colleagues from the animal sector. I am particularly interested in learning from Viet Nam’s approach to how the sectors and the local authorities developed such great collaboration, coordination and communication at the community level,” said one of the participants, Dr Ouk Vithiea, Deputy Director of the Provincial Health Department in Battambang. Insights from Viet Nam’s national rabies control programme have strengthened networking between Cambodia and Viet Nam, particularly in anticipation of the upcoming regional ASEAN Rabies Elimination Strategy.",
          "Support for rabies diagnostics includes joint activities with the various laboratory trainings of the Pasteur Institute of Cambodia, and the development of the National Strategic Plan of the National Animal Health and Production Research Institute. According to the Director of the National Animal Health and Production Research Institute (NAHPRI), Dr Tum Sothyra: “The support from GIZ is in line with the overall goals of NAHPRI in strengthening and improving the diagnostic capability of NAHPRI to cover rabies and other zoonotic diseases including neglected tropical diseases. This capacity allows us to detect and respond to disease outbreaks in a timely manner.”",
          "All activities are accompanied by tailored awareness-raising efforts, including the development of a massive open online course on rabies for schoolteachers with the goal of enhancing their understanding of teaching rabies prevention to children.",
          "“The One Health approach strengthens cross-sectoral collaboration among sectors at national and subnational levels, which is required in order to be effective in fighting neglected tropical diseases including rabies”, added Dr Yi Sengdouern.",
