          "In her address to the 75 th World Health Assembly , the First Lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, highlighted the mental stress experienced by Ukrainians because of the war in Ukraine. She spoke of residents of Kharkiv – who had been living underground in the subway for three months while the city was being shelled – who could not “psychologically bring themselves to rise up,” leave the shelter and return to their homes.",
          "Ukraine’s current mental health situation is mirrored across other regions affected by protracted conflicts and war. One in five (22%) people who have experienced war or other conflict in the previous 10 years, will have depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. In applying these estimates to Ukraine, WHO expects that approximately 9.6 million people in Ukraine may have a mental health condition.",
          "Ensuring appropriate services are immediately available in complex emergencies will help to address a wide range of peoples' pre-existing and emerging mental health and psychosocial needs, as well as support the healing and rebuilding of affected communities.",
          "Transforming mental health systems in war-affected regions",
          "The war in Ukraine has placed additional pressure on an already strained mental health system, disrupting much needed mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services for people in need. However, vital work is already ongoing to strengthen the emergency response system and build up primary and community mental health care provision.",
          "Streamlining MHPSS emergency-response systems : Given the massive scale of Ukraine’s humanitarian response that drew support from over 270 organizations in the region, WHO worked to streamline MHPSS efforts. To ensure that the MHPSS response in Ukraine is evidence-based, equitable and makes effective use of limited resources WHO supported the development of a roadmap prioritizing actions that are urgently needed to address current MHPSS needs. Launched on 9 December 2022 by the First Lady and Ukraine’s Prime Minister, Denys Shmyhal, the operational roadmap will facilitate a humanitarian response built on existing structures, resources and innovations.",
          "“Alignment with this roadmap will ensure that the provision of mental health services for populations in Ukraine, as well as the development of the mental health system, will be conducted in line with the best global practices and will also contribute to the effective planning and distribution of all available resources in this regard. WHO is here to stay in Ukraine and will continue working with all our partners on strengthening mental health service provision,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO representative in Ukraine.",
          "The roadmap draws on a new innovative tool: the MHPSS Minimum Service Package which outlines the basic MHPSS activities that should be implemented in emergency settings across health, protection, education and other sectors. These activities include disseminating information to raise mental health literacy; providing early childhood development activities; supporting community initiatives that promote mental health; and supporting caregivers to promote children’s mental health.",
          "Strengthening primary mental health service provision: Recognizing that primary healthcare workers are the first point of contact in Ukraine’s health system, and as one of WHO's Special Initiative for Mental Health countries, WHO and the Ministry of Health mobilized the efforts of 14 partners to scale up Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) activities across the country. These activities are a valuable tool in increasing services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders, and their families.",
          "Since 2019, WHO and partners have trained more than 700 primary healthcare workers using WHO’s mhGAP Intervention Guide and its humanitarian emergencies edition to be able to recognize and respond to  common mental health conditions. To further scale up capacity building efforts, WHO trained approximately 120 health care workers to provide training, enabling greater outreach. As a result of these efforts over 10% of Ukraine’s primary healthcare staff is due to receive mhGAP training by the end of 2023. WHO is also working with local stakeholders to launch an online, self-paced, adapted version of the training, aiming to reach up to 50,000 primary health workers across the country.",
          "Credits: WHO Ukraine",
          "Expanding community-based mental health services: Originally launched in 2016 to respond to the mental health needs of internally displaced people in the east of Ukraine, Community Mental Health Teams (CMHTs) were rolled out nationally in 2021 through the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health. Today 90 CMHTs provide person-centered and recovery-oriented care to people with severe mental disorders, particularly for people living in remote-regions with limited access to mental health services. Oleksii Kostiuchenkov, a member of one of the CMHT said, “99% of those who reach out to us have been directly affected by the ongoing military conflict.” Since the start of the war in Ukraine, CMHTs supported by WHO have provided 23,000 consultations for 1,400 people with severe mental health disorders since the start of the war.",
          "“The work happening now during the acute response phase of the war will contribute towards strengthening Ukraine’s mental health system during the recovery phase,” said Dr Fahmy Hanna, a WHO technical officer for mental health. Efforts in Ukraine have already bolstered the capacity of health personnel and community mechanisms to provide quality MHPSS, and streamlined humanitarian responses in the country. This will ensure a stronger and more sustainable mental health system in Ukraine, and lead to better mental health for all Ukrainians."

          "Preventing infections and antibiotic resistance has been a major public health priority by French public authorities since the 1990s–2000s and continues to be so today.  France now has an advanced national infection prevention and control (IPC) programme that aligns with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended core components for IPC. The programme is implemented by key stakeholders in the field and coordinated by French public authorities. The programme has demonstrated progress over time and has set ambitious objectives for the coming years. How and where did they start? Several national plans for preventing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) have been implemented over the years, such as the 2009–2013 National Strategy for Preventing Healthcare-Associated Infections, the 2013–2017 National Patient Safety Programme and the 2015–2022 National Prevention Action Plan Against Healthcare-Associated Infections (Propias). Based on lessons learned, a new National Strategy for Preventing Infections and Antibiotic Resistance (2022-2025) has been developed, led by the Ministry of Health and Prevention, in collaboration with French national and regional health authorities as well as other ministries. This national strategy highlights the importance of: the equal promotion of measures for IPC and antimicrobial stewardship; the broad scope of IPC, within which both community-acquired and HAIs are included, as well as both bacterial and viral infections; and the implementation at all levels, particularly at the local level, with strong involvement of regional and territorial structures. The synergistic approach is implemented at the regional level to harmonize the 3 healthcare sectors (hospitals, medico-social facilities and services, and the community) by the Regional Health Agencies (ARS), which are responsible for mobilizing all regional actors involved on the topic. Two main actors provide support to the ARS: Centres supporting the prevention of healthcare-associated infections (CPias), responsible for the prevention of HAIs and the control of cross-transmission of infectious agents: They provide expertise and support, run networks of IPC professionals (IPC teams in hospitals and nursing homes) and perform investigation and follow-up of HAIs mandatory notifications. Centres for antibiotic stewardship (CRAtb): They carry out regional missions of expertise and support, including a strategic mission on antibiotic stewardship, and animation of networks of health professionals in charge of antibiotic stewardship activities (multidisciplinary teams and referents) in all 3 healthcare sectors. The ARS coordinate these 2 structures and ensure their synergy. The 2 structures collaborate, particularly in providing training and communication strategies, and also by establishing close collaboration between the IPC and antibiotic stewardship activities and teams. Dedicated national funding exists for the CPias, the CRAtb, the antibiotic stewardship teams and the IPC teams in nursing homes. In addition, some CPias take on missions of national interest piloted by the French public health agency (Santé publique France - SpF): surveillance (including infections associated with invasive devices, infections associated with interventional medicine, antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic consumption) or dissemination of data and tools for IPC and antibiotic stewardship, for instance. They are all part of the RéPias network (Healthcare-associated infections and antibiotic resistance prevention network). France has set ambitious targets for 2025, including drastically ramping up improvements with hand hygiene measures and continuing the promotion of vaccination as cornerstone elements of the strategy. Improving and investing in enhanced hand hygiene and environmental hygiene practices in health care facilities and long-term care facilities offer cost-effective options with health and economic benefits tackling HAIs and antibiotic resistance in France.  SpF is responsible for the national notification system for uncommon HAIs and emerging antimicrobial-resistant strains. It also conducts a national point-prevalence survey every 5 years on HAIs and antimicrobial treatments according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control protocol. This national strategy is focused on human health and therefore echoes to other strategies for the other sectors (especially the one developed for animal health, within which IPC is also a core component), all gathered under the umbrella of a One health AMR national action plan, following the recommendations set by WHO. The COVID-19 global pandemic provided a strong impetus and demonstrated that preventing infections and reducing the risk of transmission is possible if a change in behaviour is achieved. Behavioural change is also needed to promote antibiotic stewardship in order to expect a decrease in antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Success factors IPC and addressing antibiotic resistance are spearheaded and supported by governmental bodies at the highest jurisdiction level, making an essential contribution to achieving consistent implementation of targets by enforcement agencies and by the responsible players in medical institutions and in the community. The IPC strategy is implemented at the local level by expert centres and mobile teams that are close to the field and know the territories and their epidemiology, as well as their healthcare structures. It can best adapt the messages and intervention in conjunction with the regional health authorities. The ambition of the national strategy is to ensure a minimum ratio of infection preventionist, as stated in WHO core component one, and to go beyond as encouraged by these guidelines. IPC is promoted with a broad vision and linked, when relevant, with antibiotic stewardship strategies. Indeed, the French experience has identified that IPC and antibiotic stewardship measures have mutually beneficial, interdependent and complementary effects. Preventing the most common infections through vaccination and simple everyday protective measures, for instance, is also key to reducing HAIs, and protecting the effectiveness of antibiotics. France has therefore developed several indicators within this strategy that are carefully monitored yearly."

          "This national strategy is focused on human health and therefore echoes to other strategies for the other sectors (especially the one developed for animal health, within which IPC is also a core component), all gathered under the umbrella of a One health AMR national action plan, following the recommendations set by WHO.",
          "The COVID-19 global pandemic provided a strong impetus and demonstrated that preventing infections and reducing the risk of transmission is possible if a change in behaviour is achieved. Behavioural change is also needed to promote antibiotic stewardship in order to expect a decrease in antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections."

It can best adapt the messages and intervention in conjunction with the regional health authorities. The ambition of the national strategy is to ensure a minimum ratio of infection preventionist, as stated in WHO core component one, and to go beyond as encouraged by these guidelines.",

Preventing the most common infections through vaccination and simple everyday protective measures, for instance, is also key to reducing HAIs, and protecting the effectiveness of antibiotics. France has therefore developed several indicators within this strategy that are carefully monitored yearly."

          "In his medical practice in Santiago de Chile, family physician Diego García-Huidobro observed a worrying trend among families and children in recent years.",
          "“I would see parents for a health issue or a preventive check-up, and often observed issues around overweight and an unhealthy lifestyle. As they brought their children to the consultation, I noticed that many were overweight, too, and at risk of developing health problems”, Diego recalls.",
          "In 2016, more than half of pre-school children in Chile were reportedly overweight or experienced obesity , one of the highest rates among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Children who are overweight are more likely to remain overweight or develop obesity as adults, and they are at greater risk of developing noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and poor health.",
          "“As a family physician, I quickly realized that overweight and obesity are not just caused by individual behaviour. The school and family environments play a major contributing role. This is where families and their children interact, eat, snack, play sports or engage in physical activity the most, Diego recounts. With support from the city of Providencia, Diego teamed up with Oriana Diaspro, a sociologist and researcher, to develop the ¡Juntos+Saludables! programme, recruiting a team of dieticians, personal trainers, psychologists, and champions on-the-ground. Together, they designed a project to promote a healthier lifestyle and to reduce obesity amid children’s family and school environments. “¡Juntos+Saludables! emphasizes that we need to work together to be healthy. Our team works with the children to identify unhealthy behaviours and mental health issues. For families, we offer counselling for health and dietary questions in their homes or with a hotline. And in schools, we work with teachers and management to make healthier meals and snacks available, improve playground and sport facilities and introduce health topics into the curriculum”, Oriana explains. Diego’s and Oriana’s intervention demonstrates how holistic and inclusive health literacy approaches can effectively reduce childhood obesity, while engaging and empowering young people, their families and educators in a meaningful way. “A key success factor is that we recognize community members as experts in identifying and addressing their health needs, and families as the true champions of healthy behaviour”, notes Diego. After three years of pilot implementation, ¡Juntos+Saludables! significantly reduced childhood obesity in a study group and increased healthy nutrition, physical activity and mental health among students compared to other schools. “Our children have started to eat better, and we have stopped buying certain drinks at home because my daughter tells me they are not healthy. Now we drink water, that has never happened in my life”, reported a parent whose child participates in the programme. “The programme has become part of the school's identity. You can feel that it has generated change, and that change is felt and shared among students,” one school coordinator adds. Read more about the 2022 NCD Lab projects ¡Juntos+Saludables! Addressing obesity and Noncommunicable diseases through grassroots innovation More than a billion people worldwide are living with obesity. They are at higher risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke and cancer, and also more likely to experience mental health issues. The global rise in obesity particularly affects low- and middle-income countries, where the number of people living with obesity has doubled since 2010. Responding to these alarming trends, WHO’s Acceleration Plan to STOP Obesity supports countries in preventing and managing obesity throughout the life course, including through fiscal policies, regulations on food and beverage marketing, food labelling and public education and awareness. The NCD Lab is a platform launched by WHO’s Global Coordination Mechanism on NCDs (GCM/NCD) to crowdsource and promote grassroots innovation for NCD prevention and control. Accounting for local context and building on strong community ownership, bottom-up health initiatives often prove highly effective and have the potential to scale."

          "South Sudan has experienced protracted conflict, both before and since the\r\ncountry gained independence in 2011. In 2021, more than 8 million people\r\nof South Sudan’s population of 13 million needed humanitarian assistance\r\nbecause of conflict and violence, major flooding and the coronavirus disease\r\n(COVID-19) pandemic. With poor access to health services due to an acute\r\nhealth workforce shortage, inadequate health infrastructure and poor health\r\nservice utilization, the country has poor health indicators. 1,2 Its maternal,\r\ninfant and child mortality rates are some of the highest in the world and life\r\nexpectancy is low, at 56.5 years. 3",

In South Sudan, development assistance is crucial as government funding for health is low, at less than 2% of the\r\nnational budget, and out-of-pocket spending accounts for about 54% of\r\ntotal health expenditure, putting many South Sudanese people at risk\r\nof catastrophic health costs. Since 2020, SDG3 GAP agencies, including\r\nWHO, have been working with the Government of South Sudan to progress\r\ntowards universal health coverage and the health-related SDGs. Despite\r\nsome delays to progress due to COVID-19, key health sector coordination\r\nmechanisms have already been revitalized and SDG3 GAP agencies and\r\nother partners have begun to align more closely with the country’s primary\r\nhealth care (PHC) priorities.",

          "This case study was published on 8 December 2022 as part of the WHO delivering results and making an impact: stories from the ground report , which presents a snapshot of how WHO has delivered on its mission in countries and contributed to health outcomes across a wide range of issues during 2020-2021. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic has an ambitious agenda for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 – it seeks to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being across the life course, while undergoing economic, demographic and epidemiological\r\n    transitions. The country is preparing to graduate from least developed country status by 2026, and with this it will experience a decline in development assistance in the coming years. While the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has worked hard\r\n    to protect lives throughout the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the economic impact of the pandemic has been significant. The country’s gross domestic product is declining (it dropped from 4.7% in 2019 to −0.4% in 2020), debt\r\n    burden is increasing and budgetary space for essential expenditures is constrained. Against this backdrop and the Government’s goal of achieving universal health coverage (UHC) by 2025, strengthening the resilience and sustainability\r\n    of the health system is a priority. A mother with her child from a remote village in Xiangkhouang Province. © WHO Country Office in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic/\r\nYoshi Shimizu How did the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, with the support of the WHO Secretariat, achieve this? Over the biennium, WHO supported the review and update of the Health Sector Reform Strategy to guide the country (and partners’ support) on its UHC journey over the next decade. Using “backcasting”, one of the operational ways of working\r\n    from the WHO Western Pacific Region’s For the\r\nfuture vision , 1 WHO facilitated a process of identifying future health needs and strengthening systems approaches. This process showed the need of strengthening the primary health care (PHC) system to future-proof the national health\r\n    system for meeting the needs of an ageing population carrying a higher burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). With the Government’s commitment to strengthening PHC in alignment with the decentralization policy (the Sam Sang directive), the\r\n    Health Sector Reform Strategy provides strategic direction for strengthening PHC as a core foundation to reach hardto-reach populations. Moreover, the Reform Strategy aims to improve the efficiency, resilience and sustainability of the health system\r\n    in the context of donor transition and the pandemic in the country’s journey to achieve UHC. Through multisectoral action, the Reform Strategy also aims to empower subnational governments to strengthen health governance capacity and develop\r\n    integrated health services with primary care and essential public health functions. Recognizing the critical role that partnerships will play in facilitating implementation of the Reform Strategy, WHO supported the Ministry of Health to engage partners through a sectorwide coordination mechanism by cochairing the Health Sector Working\r\n    Group and supporting the alignment of development partners’ support with the Government’s priorities. WHO, the Gavi Alliance, the Global Fund, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and other agencies that are\r\n    signatories to the Global Action\r\nPlan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All (SDG3 GAP) , as well as members of the GAP sustainable financing for health (GAP SFH) accelerator working group, are providing coordinated support to the country in the area of health financing. WHO supported the Ministry of Health in developing the Health Financing Strategy 2021–2025 for the transition from donor funding to domestic financing, which was adopted in October 2021 in close coordination with key partners, such as the Swiss\r\n    Red Cross and the World Bank. The Health Financing Strategy aims to increase sustainability, accountability, efficiency and equity in the health system, explore innovative solutions to address health financing challenges and align development assistance\r\n    more closely with the priorities of the Government. It provides a framework for support from signatory agencies to SDG3 GAP and other partners. In line with the priorities identified in the Health Financing Strategy, WHO worked with GAP SFH and other\r\n    partners to explore how efficiency gains could be achieved across programmes, specifically at the PHC level, and how partners’ various efforts to introduce innovative financing mechanisms would help to address health financing challenges in\r\n    the country’s context. The new Health and Nutrition Services Access Project – jointly developed with the World Bank, the Global Fund, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and other members of the GAP SFH accelerator\r\n    working group – was an example of joint partnership to strengthen PHC through an innovative financing mechanism. WHO collaborated with GAP SFH partners and others to support the Ministry of Health in preparing the country for a smooth transition\r\n    from external financing to domestic financing by enhancing investment in PHC in alignment with the Health Sector Reform Strategy and the Health Financing Strategy. In addition, WHO provided technical support for the implementation of the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme, which was rolled out nationwide in 2016 with the exception of Vientiane Capital. WHO played a significant role in facilitating the National\r\n    Health Insurance Bureau in coordinating support from various partners for the NHI scheme. In 2019–2020, WHO conducted an assessment of the implementation of the NHI scheme, which identified key achievements, challenges and future priorities\r\n    for improving the efficiency, equity and sustainability of the scheme. Further, WHO and multiple partners – including the International Labour Organization, the Swiss Red Cross and the World Bank – supported the National Health Insurance\r\n    Bureau in conducting a costing exercise of the essential health services package and the NHI benefit package to provide critical data for the sustainability reforms of the NHI scheme. In line with the strategic direction of the Health Financing Strategy,\r\n    WHO supported the Ministry of Health in updating the NHI Strategy 2021–2025, which was endorsed in September 2022, as well as is working to “reach the unreached” (a thematic priority of the For the future vision ). WHO support\r\n    aims to enhance governance and financing mechanisms and improve implementation of the NHI scheme, specifically in ensuring financial protection for vulnerable populations.

Self-care interventions are evidence-based, quality tools that support self-care.",
          "In Nigeria, the uptake of contraception is low, with a 2021 UNICEF survey indicating that only four out of every ten women use contraception.",
          "To help address this, WHO has been working closely with Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Health using a people-centred, gender equality and human rights approach to provide wider access to sexual and reproductive health such as the self-administration of injectable contraception. This method is now being made available directly within communities through pharmacies, drug stores, and health facilities.",
          "Speaking about this approach, Dr Olumuyiwa Ojo, Technical Officer in WHO Country Office Nigeria, said it is crucial to Nigeria achieving universal health coverage, adding that WHO has supported critical policy changes that help create a safe enabling environment for the successful uptake of self-care.",
          "“Following the release of WHO’s guideline on Self-care Interventions for Health and Well-Being , the Government of Nigeria adapted and began to implement the guideline,” he explained. “WHO’s support also includes coordinating the implementation of a costed national plan for self-care interventions, policy mapping and building the evidence base through research.”"

It allows those living far from the health facility or who want confidentiality to have contraceptive cover when needed. It also reduces the cost of transportation, especially for those living far from health facilities,” she said.",

          "In several schools in Chile’s capital Santiago, students taking part in the Juntos Santiago project to learn about the health risks of overweight and obesity in a playful way, and win rewards for eating healthy or engaging in physical activity with their families.",
          "Together with their classmates, they play a classroom boardgame called Navigator, which tells the story of avoiding unhealthy habits and reaching the finish line symbolising good health. To win a challenge, children can bring healthy snacks from home. Barcodes on snacks can be scanned with a mobile phone application that automatically assigns points based on how processed food items are. Students can also upload pictures of healthy activities with their families to an online platform, and use pedometers to count steps and be more active.",
          "The rewards are then shared among all students in the class. They include infrastructure upgrades such as climbing walls and table tennis equipment, or fun activities like a day out at the community pool or local amusement park. The Juntos Santiago project uses an innovative gamification strategy that engages students, families, and teachers and puts preventing obesity and promoting healthier diets at the centre. “The children we work and play with are excited to learn about healthier dietary and lifestyle choices through a game, and prizes sponsored by the city offer them a real incentive”, says project lead Macarena Carranza Pérez-Tinao, a pharmacist and nutritionist who started this project. Chile has one of the highest rates of childhood obesity among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Recent studies show that over 50% of pre-school children in Chile are overweight and at increased risk of developing obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a young age. Ultra-processed foods such as sugary beverages, ready-made desserts and fast food are considered a main driver of the obesity epidemic. In many Latin American countries, sales of ultra-processed food have increased dramatically in recent years due to rapid economic, trade and labor force transitions and increasing urbanization. Starting in 2017 as a pilot project, Juntos Santiago has since grown to include nearly 7,000 students and proven effective to achieving healthy weight and reduced systolic blood pressure among students in participating schools. Participating students also measurably improved their consumption of healthy snacks and engaged in more physical activities. Read more about the 2022 NCD Lab projects Juntos Santiago . Addressing obesity and noncommunicable diseases though grassroots innovation More than a billion people worldwide are living with obesity. They are at higher risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke and cancer, and also more likely to experience mental health issues. The global rise in obesity particularly affects low- and middle-income countries, where the number of people living with obesity has doubled since 2010. Responding to these alarming trends, WHO’s Acceleration Plan to STOP Obesity supports countries in preventing and managing obesity throughout the life course, including through fiscal policies, regulations on food and beverage marketing, food labelling and public education and awareness. The NCD Lab is a platform launched by WHO’s Global Coordination Mechanism on NCDs (GCM/NCD) to crowdsource and promote grassroots innovation for NCD prevention and control. Accounting for local context and building on strong community ownership, bottom-up health initiatives often prove highly effective and have the potential to scale."

          "Persons with psychosocial disabilities frequently face stigma, discrimination and rights violations, including within and from the medical community, which reflects broader societal stigma. One doctor relates his personal experience here and how he uses it today to challenge stigma.",
          "When Dr Ahmed Hankir first experienced extreme psychological distress as a medical student in the United Kingdom in 2006, he delayed seeking help due to the shame and stigma of having a mental health condition.",
          "Exacerbating his distress was the added stigma of being a man of colour and a Muslim, which, with his mental health condition, made up what he calls a “triple whammy” of stigmas that he “internalized”. It led to him feeling\r\n        “dehumanised”.",
          "The stress and strains of working low-paid jobs to support himself as a student, and an outbreak of war in Lebanon, the country of his roots and where his parents were living, made matters worse. Meanwhile, he was living in a dilapidated house in\r\n        one of the most dangerous areas of Manchester.",
          "The intersectionality of these stressors – which added a “layer upon layer” – are often overlooked at the level of the individual, he said. Racism might be passed over. “It might be there is some gaslighting... so, you\r\n        know, you are not a victim of racism.”",
          "Hankir, who was born in Belfast when his parents fled the 1982 war in Lebanon, but later returned to Lebanon as a teenager, also said he had an identity crisis. “We want to be accepted, but I wasn't treated as British in the UK and I wasn't\r\n        treated as Lebanese in Lebanon.”",
          "Stigma “rampant” in the medical profession",
          "Yet it was in his own profession that he felt the stigma of mental health most deeply, which led to the delay in seeking help. He was “ridiculed” by fellow medical students and ostracised by his closest companions. When he sought help\r\n        from the person in charge of student support, a person who had the power to have him removed from his course, he was “psychologically tortured”. He was forced to temporarily interrupt his studies.",
          "“Stigma is rampant in the medical profession. Unless we address it, it will continue to destroy and devastate the lives of many. We’re just scratching the surface now - I don’t know an expert in stigma. There is a lot of ignorance\r\n        on how to deal with mental health,” he said.",
          "Not only is there ignorance, but there is also arrogance from health providers, some of whom look down on people with mental health conditions and psychosocial disabilities, he said.",
          "“It takes strength to accept that you might be a source of stigma. What we need is humility. But I’ve met inspirational, humble doctors who have contributed to my recovery and continue to contribute to my resilience.”",
          "“My lived experience is my superpower”",
          "Today, Hankir is a psychiatrist and he draws from his past: “My lived experience is my superpower. It’s a strength, not a weakness. It makes me more insightful, empathetic and driven.",
          "“When I'm working in frontline psychiatry and I'm providing care for a person in a mental health crisis at 2am, I often draw on my personal expertise more than my professional expertise especially when attempting to develop a rapport and 'therapeutic\r\n        alliance' with the person receiving care from me.”",
          "He believes that many of his peers have also experienced psychological distress, but have chosen to remain silent about it. “I’m honest and open about my experience of living with a mental health condition. More people are talking about\r\n        it. We normalize living with mental health conditions.”",
          "Ahmed has won multiple awards for his “Wounded Healer” presentation, including from WHO in 2022. Photo credit: WHO/ Michelle Funk",
          "Delivering the “Wounded Healer” presentation around the world",
          "Hankir is now renowned for his “ Wounded Healer ” presentation, which aims to debunk myths and humanize people living with mental health conditions through\r\n        blending performing arts and storytelling with psychiatry.",
          "The Wounded Healer also traces Hankir’s recovery journey. “Speaking out on stigma helps to reduce it,” he explained. More than 100,000 people in 20 countries have heard him speak. In recognition of his work, Hankir received the 2022\r\n        World Health Organization Director-General Award for Global Health, among other awards.",
          "He welcomes WHO’s Quality Rights Initiative, which takes an approach to mental health  grounded on a human rights framework that empowers, dignifies and humanizes people with mental health conditions.",
          "“Our human rights are being violated, regardless of time and place – high income country, low income country. Too many people feel like they have been brutalized,” he said. “When care is available, there are also concerns about\r\n        the quality of care.”",
          "He continues to face negativity from some psychiatrists, some of whom are “suspicious” of his success. “They accuse me of fabricating having a severe mental health condition. It is as if people living with severe mental health conditions\r\n        can’t recover or excel, and can only ever think of survival. I was miserable for many years. But now I am not just surviving, I’m thriving,” he laughed.",

To advance health equity for deafblind people, there is a need for models of care which are inclusive and people-centred, and consider the provision of care from the user perspective. In this article, a person who is deafblind describes his experience with health care and the “invisibility” that the community face.",
          "When Frank Trigueros visits a hospital, he braces himself for possible problems. It is not the medical care that concerns him as much the communication, as a person who is deafblind.",
          "“I cannot communicate. Normally I use interpreters to communicate directly with physicians. I cannot get around easily myself, so the interpreter guides me around to where the services are,” explained Trigueros, who was born deaf and\r\n            later lost his sight.",
          "In theory, communication is possible using a laptop with a braille keyboard, but this is time-consuming, he said. Health professionals usually want to work quickly, as do government officials, and even in conversations with his interpreters, they\r\n            can be impatient.",
          "“I have to ask them to slow down. I have been told: ‘I don’t have time to assist you’,” said Trigueros, speaking through an interpreter using a tactile sign language. “It makes my day when there’s no problem.\r\n            But generally speaking, it can get messy.”",
          "On one occasion in hospital, a doctor did not take the time to explain what drugs he needed to take and when. “He just walked away backwards. I was mad. I had to find someone else to help me,” said Trigueros, who is president of European\r\n            Deafblind and FASOCIDE, the Federation of Associations of Deafblind people in Spain.",
          "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic",
          "All too often, the reality is that the health system and government simply overlook the deafblind community. A case in point is the COVID-19 pandemic, when restrictions on movement failed to consider the needs of the deafblind community. Forced\r\n            isolation was a devastating setback to their independence, given their need for interpreters to communicate and move around the community. As they communicate through hand-over-hand signing, physical distancing effectively cut off communication.",
          "“We faced opposition to get interpreters. There was no understanding from health services or the public sector,” he said.",
          "“Interpreters were not even allowed in the emergency room [due to COVID-19 restrictions], even though we tried to explain we need them. Again and again and again, we had to explain who they are and why we need them.”",
          "Some doctors were empathetic, but the community cannot rely on “people’s good will” he said, adding it was “nerve-wracking” not to have the security of being able to communicate.",
          "“The need for interpreters was not thought of in the Covid-19 protocol. We should have been contemplated in the rules to begin with.” Deafblind organizations had to protest that they had been “forgotten”, as they\r\n                    have done on many other occasions previously.",
          "Frank at a conference, communicating with an interpreter using hand-over-hand signing. Picture courtesy of Frank.",
          "The system “does not care enough”",
          "Frank said that one example of how the community gets forgotten is the government’s health card – it does not state that a person is deafblind, although the card states other disabilities on it . Because his disability is not\r\n                    recorded in the system, Trigueros sometimes gets calls from health centres.",
          "“I’ve tried many, many times to tell them. I'm asking for a line on a card that would save me a lot of trouble. I don't think it's much to ask,” he said, adding that he was told that the software to produce the card did\r\n                    not allow for it.",
          "“It shouldn’t be that difficult to put right. It is not an issue of money. The system just does not care enough.”",
          "He said people who are deafblind were also not properly informed about COVID-19 restrictions or the virus during the pandemic. “We had to do their work of [the government of] informing [deafblind] people. I know of many who live\r\n                    alone and didn’t know about the virus,” he said, adding that the capacity of the non-profit organization he worked in was limited.",
          "Aside from the invisibility of the community and the lack of understanding, another issue is funding for interpreters for deafblind people, which is limited and uneven across the country, although funding is available for people with other\r\n                    disabilities. “We need funding to move around. We need to have agency in our lives,” said Trigueros.",
          "He added that he was “lucky” because he had a family. “There are [deafblind] people who do not have family, who do not have a support system. Imagine the lives of those who are live alone…,” he said. Some\r\n                    of them, he said, were in need of therapy. However, it was difficult to find a suitable professional with the knowledge needed to help them.",

She approached four health centres, but all refused her, saying her disability (related to polio as a child) would make the delivery “too complicated.”",
          "She was finally referred to a hospital. But when she arrived there, a midwife abruptly told her, without examining her, that she would be taken to the operating room for a caesarean section. The midwife, Coumba said, had made her decision by looking at her disability. “She saw my disability and automatically for her… disability means surgery. I was afraid,” she said.",
          "But behind the midwife, a voice assured her: “Wait for me! I’m going to help you give birth in a regular way.” It was a respectful health worker, who later helped Coumba get onto the delivery bed with a bench and then assisted her to have a vaginal birth, like most other mothers in the hospital.",
          "Roughly around an hour after the birth, a nurse came to move her to the resting room, but did not help her off the bed. Coumba fell and started haemorrhaging. She fainted. Two days later, she woke up in a resuscitation room. “The baby was doing very well. But me? I had a haemorrhage. I didn’t know where I was,” she said.",
          "Coumba, who was then just 22 years old, was later told by the head midwife not to have another child. “At that moment, I cried,” she recalled, with a sigh.",
          "Fighting for women with disability today",
          "Today, 22 years later, Coumba is an activist and city councillor in Pikine, a Dakar suburb, striving for disability inclusion. As president of the municipality’s commission for education, training and local languages, she ensures that children with disabilities study and have appropriate learning materials. As part of the municipality’s inter-commission, she ensures disability is taken into account in its other commissions, including health and the living environment, and also advises on the care of women with disability.",
          "Access to education was an issue for her when young. As a teenager, she had to walk holding her leg for more than one hour to reach her high school. “There was no bus. I didn’t have crutches or a prosthesis. I was limping, I was holding my leg to not feel the pain,” she recalled.",
          "“I lived through many experiences and that’s why I’m confident today. I can fight for disabled women. I also know that I can talk with the authorities,” she said, adding she engages with women’s groups, the association of Senegalese midwives, female lawyers and community groups.",
          "Coumba is an activist and municipal councillor today fighting for disability inclusion. Photo credit: Sightsavers/Sidy Camara",
          "Her birth experience still drives her activism today. She raises the situation of disabled women giving birth when she can, and sometimes helps individual women with disabilities on a personal capacity. “[If] someone calls me for the delivery of a pregnant disabled woman, I go to her home to offer my help for free,” she said.",
          "In her previous work with a disability organization, she encountered many other women who had experiences similar to hers. “A woman in a wheelchair can’t climb [onto] a delivery bed for the prenatal medical visit. All these issues make women [with disability] scared to marry someone and get pregnant,” she said.",
          "“See the person, not the disability”",
          "Although inclusivity is progressing in Senegal, there was still a need for change “from the bottom to the top of society” she said. She called for a goal to provide access to health centres to all people with disabilities, without them having to face problems. “Disabled people are afraid to go to the hospital. If they get sick, they stay at home, they take medicine bought in the street. We must make the hospital accessible.”",
          "She believes health workers need better training on how to provide equitable and respectful health services for people with disabilities. “Hopefully, the way they look at people with disabilities will change. It’s necessary to see the person, not the disability,” she said, adding communication with people with disabilities was very important.",
          "“Step by step, society will include people with disabilities. My dream is to make all delivery rooms accessible to disabled women… [and] have medical staff both skilled and kind. When the delivery room will be available for disabled women, I would say that I have reached my goal.”",

          "Priya Prakash and her team have been visiting schools around India since 2016. With the help of a team of qualified doctors, they offer e-health check-ups to assess children for more than 90 health parameters including weight, height, eye and dental checks. Parents and children can track the results online on an e-health platform and app and receive personalized health recommendations.",
          "Students from these schools are also encouraged to join and lead wellness clubs or engage in special modules such as the 21-day challenge encouraging children to build health and hygiene skills. Each enrolled student additionally benefits from a yearly US$ 1600 insurance cover, and HealthSetGo directly supports health centres in selected schools with medical staff.",
          "Priya Prakash is the founder and CEO of HealthSetGo, a school-based, data-driven health programme incorporating student leadership and innovative financing. Some 14.4 million children reportedly live with obesity in India. Of the more than 200 000 schools in the country, fewer than 2% have a health programme. Often, schools also lack the capacity, the know-how and the financial resources to promote healthier lifestyles, and educate young people on health risks, such as obesity and mental health issues.",
          "“When I was a student, I was strugglin with my health. I found it hard to access health information at school or from home”, she recounts. “With 400 million school children in India and many schools being run privately, I later realized there is a tremendous opportunity and a sustainable market to combine preventive health screening, education and insurance into an attractive package for students, families, and schools, and make health an integral aspect of children's lives.”",
          "Since its launch in 2016, HealthSetGo has made preventive health services and health education affordable and accessible for over 250 000 students in nearly 80 Indian cities. The programme partners with schools and with teams of doctors to provide health check-ups, raise awareness on healthy lifestyles and sometimes provide medical staff in selected schools.",
          "The project demonstrates how local, community-driven innovations that address NCD risk factors can be scaled to subnational and national levels to have a major impact in low- and middle-income settings.",

          "The global rise in obesity particularly affects low- and middle-income countries, where the number of people living with obesity has doubled since 2010. Responding to these alarming trends, WHO’s Acceleration Plan to STOP Obesity supports countries in preventing and managing obesity throughout the life course, including through fiscal policies, regulations on food and beverage marketing, food labelling and public education and awareness.",
          "The NCD Lab is a platform launched by WHO’s Global Coordination Mechanism on NCDs (GCM/NCD) to crowdsource and promote grassroots innovation for NCD prevention and control. Accounting for local context and building on strong community ownership, bottom-up health initiatives often prove highly effective and have the potential to scale."

          "Susan Onyango is a nutritionist working at the Marindi Sub County Hospital in Homa Bay County, western Kenya, where some 2500 people living with HIV regularly seek care. Among her patients and especially among women, she started to see a trend from undernutrition to overweight and obesity, often caused by an unbalanced diet.",
          "Venturing into the surrounding communities, she discovered most women were unaware that an unhealthy diet, overweight and obesity are major risk factors for hypertension, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. While providing the HIV/AIDS treatment regimens, the health services did not pay enough attention to nutrition, healthy weight, and preventing noncommunicable diseases.",
          "Many of the women that Susan spoke to had no say over their family’s farmland, as it was mostly men who decided on the use of the land prioritizing the more lucrative sugarcane farming. The women were missing the knowledge and opportunity to grow healthier produce, including different vegetables and fruits.",
          "Together with a small team from the hospital and a group of trained peer educators, Susan decided to tackle the issue through health education and hands-on training.",
          "“We use a multipronged strategy to address a complex problem with several root causes,” Susan reveals. “Once a month, we organize community health literacy sessions that equip women with knowledge on obesity, diabetes and hypertension prevention and management. In our community demonstration garden, we also teach women how to grow various crops in their own backyards and how to incorporate them into a healthy diet,” she explains.",
          "Susan’s project “The Healthy Woman” operates with the slogan “being proactive everyday, keeps obesity at bay”. With her support, a group of 30 women was able to better understand how to avoid unhealthy weight gain and associated health risks. They discuss and learn about energy, sugar and salt intake, physical activity as a part of their workday, and balancing meals with fruit, vegetables, legumes, and other healthy foods.",
          "The Healthy Woman used a unique, innovative strategy. It addressed the issue of unequal gender roles, closed gaps in integrated HIV and NCD services, diversified the local food systems and substantially improved the limited health literacy among local communities.",
          "In its pilot phase, the project notably enhanced the nutrition and food security of participating households, and several local health professionals and organizations now support scaling the activity to nine more groups in the community by contributing funds, seeds or farming expertise.",

          "Addressing obesity and Noncommunicable diseases though grassroots innovation",
          "More than a billion people worldwide are living with obesity. They are at higher risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke and cancer, and also more likely to experience mental health issues.",
          "The global rise in obesity particularly affects low- and middle-income countries, where the number of people living with obesity has doubled since 2010. Responding to these alarming trends, WHO’s Acceleration Plan to STOP Obesity supports countries in preventing and managing obesity throughout the life course, including through fiscal policies, regulations on food and beverage marketing, food labelling and public education and awareness.",
          "The NCD Lab is a platform launched by WHO’s Global Coordination Mechanism on NCDs (GCM/NCD) to crowdsource and promote grassroots innovation for NCD prevention and control. Accounting for local context and building on strong community ownership, bottom-up health initiatives often prove highly effective and have the potential to scale."

          "It was 26 November 2021 that WHO declared that the world was facing a new variant of concern: Omicron. It would go on to change the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "Emerging evidence was quickly shared by scientists from Botswana, Hong Kong and South Africa and discussed in a special meeting of WHO’s Technical Advisory Group for Virus Evolution (TAG-VE).",
          "Experts at the meeting worried about the large number of mutations present in this variant, which differed greatly from the other variants that had been detected so far. Early data showed Omicron’s rapid spread in some provinces in South Africa\r\n    and an increased risk of reinfection compared to the previously circulating variants.",
          "Just hours later, WHO declared this new variant a variant of concern: we were dealing with something new, something different, and something that the world had to quickly prepare for.",
          "WHO’s COVID-19 technical lead, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, records a video announcing the classification of Omicron as variant of concern. As soon as the variant was classified, staff rushed to inform and prepare WHO offices around the globe before the news became public. Photo: WHO",
          "The Omicron effect",
          "Omicron was quickly identified as being significantly more transmissible than Delta, the preceding variant of concern. Within 4 weeks, as the Omicron wave travelled around the world, it replaced Delta as the dominant variant.",
          "Countries which had so far been successful in keeping COVID-19 at bay through public health and social measures now found themselves struggling. For individuals, the greatest price was paid by those who were at risk of severe disease but not vaccinated,\r\n    and we saw hospitalizations and deaths rise in a number of places around the world.",
          "This graph shows reported COVID-19 cases in gray and deaths in blue; the impact of Omicron is clear. While Omicron was less severe compared to Delta, there were still a significant number of deaths due to this variant worldwide. The recent decline in COVID-19 testing around the world has meant that we are underestimating the true number cases, now more than ever.",
          "By March 2022, WHO and partners estimate that almost 90% of the global population had antibodies against the COVID-19 virus, whether through vaccination or infection.",
          "Overall, though, this new variant caused less severe disease than Delta on average. Scientists worked to understand why this was so. A number of factors likely played a role. For example, the virus replicated more efficiently in the upper airway, and\r\n    population immunity had been steadily increasing worldwide due to vaccination and infections.",
          "While vaccines reduced the impact of Omicron, they themselves were impacted: studies have shown that vaccine effectiveness against infection, disease, hospitalization and death waned (though at different rates) over time. However, protection against hospitalization\r\n    and death have remained high, preventing millions of people from dying.",
          "Health worker and long COVID patient Nazibrola Bidzinashvili looks through results from recent lab tests at her home in Tbilisi, Georgia. Georgia, like many other countries, saw a big wave of Omicron infections, that peaked at the end of January 2022. Photo: WHO/Hedinn Halldorsson",
          "The next variant of concern?",
          "Since the emergence of Omicron, the virus has continued to evolve. Today, there are over 500 sublineages of this variant circulating, but not one has been designated as a new variant of concern.",
          "So far, these sublineages of Omicron have much in common: they are all highly transmissible, replicate in the upper respiratory tract and tend to cause less severe disease compared to previous variants of concern, and they all have mutations that make\r\n    them escape built-up immunity more easily. This means that they are similar in their impact on public health, and the response that is needed to deal with them.",
          "If the virus were to change significantly – like if a new variant caused more severe disease, or if vaccines no longer prevented severe disease and death – the world would need to reconsider its response. In that case, we would have a new\r\n    variant of concern, and with it, new recommendations and strategy from WHO.",
          "A lab worker prepares samples at the National Public Health Laboratory in Singapore, part of the network of WHO reference labs for COVID-19. Countries like Singapore have played an important role in tracking the virus and sharing their findings with WHO and the larger global community. Photo: WHO/Blink Media – Juliana Tan",
          "WHO, together with scientists and public health professionals around the world, continues to monitor the circulating variants for signs of the next variant of concern. However, there is apprehension because testing and sequencing are declining globally\r\n    and the sequences that are available aren’t globally representative (most sequences are shared from high-income countries).",
          "WHO and partners also remain concerned that surveillance at the human-animal interface is limited, where the next variant of concern could come from.",
          "While it might be difficult to stop a new variant from emerging, quick detection and information sharing mean its impact on our lives can be minimized.",
          "WHO remains grateful to public \r\nhealth professionals around the world for their continued surveillance \r\nof the COVID-19 virus and the sharing of sequences and analyses.",

          "Since the Strategic Action Plan on Polio Transition was adopted in 2018, significant changes have taken place in the global health landscape. The recovery efforts from the COVID-19 pandemic, the renewed commitment to eradicate polio, and a sharper focus on strengthening essential immunization and the global architecture on pandemic preparedness and response for health emergencies represent fresh opportunities to integrate and transition polio expertise and infrastructure in polio-free countries to strengthen broader health systems.",
          "It is in this context that WHO regions and programmes are taking action on ten key recommendations of the Mid-Term Evaluation of the Implementation of the Strategic Action Plan on Polio Transition (2018 – 2023) , with a united and proactive strategy to sustain integrated functions and assets where they are most needed.",
          "At a recent Member State Information Session on Polio Transition, the Deputy Director General, Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, noted, “2023 is a critical year to build equitable and resilient health systems with primary health care at the centre, to strengthen the global health security architecture and to cross the last mile on eradicating polio.”",
          "“Polio transition is the thread which ties together all three of these agendas. Much progress has been achieved since 2018. We are now building on this firm foundation.”",
          "Overall, the evaluation found that the Strategic Action Plan provided a strong starting point for transition efforts. It helped establish governance mechanisms to ensure accountability and fostered collaboration across the global, regional and country level to integrate polio expertise into broader areas of public health, including immunization, disease surveillance and health emergencies. Meanwhile, the opportunities presented by a sustainable transition have gained prominence, underlined by the contributions of the polio workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "WHO’s management response to the evaluation aims to build on these successes and lessons learned. Specific actions include a shift towards regional ownership for local solutions adapted to the country context and the engagement of a wide range of stakeholders in transition discussions, including civil society. Efforts will be tied together through the development in 2023 of a global vision for polio transition, supported by tailored regional action plans and a strengthened monitoring and evaluation framework.",
          "Dr Jamal Ahmed, Coordinator of the Polio Eradication Programme in the African Region, explained, “The focus for the African region in 2023 is developing an overarching regional action plan that assesses activities currently supported by polio and develops a clear road roadmap for the mainstreaming of all activities into priority health programmes.”",
          "Dr Sunil Bahl, Regional Coordinator for COVAX, Immunization and Vaccine Development in the South-East Asia Region, where the polio and immunization networks are fully integrated, outlined plans to hold a regional workshop on transition in early 2023 to develop the South-East Asia regional action plan. The focus will be on mainstreaming core capacities to national governments, whilst ensuring financial sustainability.",
          "Dr Naglaa Ahmed, Polio Transition Focal Point for the Eastern Mediterranean Region explained, “the region is carefully balancing efforts to eradicate polio, respond to polio outbreaks and move ahead with polio transition to strengthen health outcomes.” The region aims to ensure a risk-based approach to transition in their action plan, with countries moving at different paces according to local epidemiology and health systems resilience.",
          "WHO will proactively implement the management response. Action has already been taken on multiple fronts. For instance, WHO is intensifying efforts to address the global backsliding in immunization coverage, especially in geographies with large numbers of children who have missed out on vaccine doses. The polio workforce is playing a key role in these efforts. Similarly, the experience of the polio staff in high-risk settings is proving vital to the success of new initiatives on integrated disease surveillance, together with efforts to strengthen the global architecture for health emergency preparedness, response and resilience (HEPR). Underpinning these efforts is the understanding that resilient health systems are vital to prevent outbreaks or resurgences of polio.",
          "Each of these new actions is a critical flagstone in the road towards a sustainable transition. Looking ahead to 2023, success will rely on continued efforts and a shared vision to use polio expertise and assets to the greatest effect in a changed global health landscape.",
          "All documents related to the Mid-Term Evaluation of the Implementation of the Strategic Action Plan on Polio Transition (2018 – 2023) are available via the WHO Evaluation Office ."

It started with just a handful of cases reported in the United Kingdom in early May 2022, but soon monkeypox was being reported in many countries, in rapidly increasing\r\n        numbers. By July, 90% of all laboratory-confirmed and globally reported cases were centred in Europe, leading Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe to state: “Urgent and coordinated action is imperative if we are\r\n        to turn a corner in the race to reverse the ongoing spread of this disease.” On 23 July, as countries around the world reported escalating cases, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the ongoing monkeypox outbreak\r\n        a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.",
          "Four months after cases in Europe peaked, we are at a critical moment in the outbreak, one that will define the disease’s trajectory in the region and beyond. During this outbreak, monkeypox cases have been reported in 43 of the 53 countries\r\n        in the WHO European region. Thanks to a combination of testing, surveillance, vaccination and changes in behaviour, cases of the disease among the group most affected by this outbreak, men who have sex with men (MSM), especially with those with\r\n        multiple sexual partners – have declined significantly. This decline is good news, but we cannot lose sight of our ultimate goal in Europe: to stop human-to-human transmission in our communities completely, and to sustain the elimination\r\n        of monkeypox through continued prevention, detection and response systems.",
          "Image: Overall number of cases of monkeypox, per date of notification, in the European Region. ©ECDC/WHO",
          "From the outset, as well as partnering with national and regional health experts, WHO/Europe has consulted and collaborated with MSM, recognising their knowledge and engagement as essential in the drive to control and eliminate monkeypox. This RCCE\r\n        approach has been instrumental to every area of the monkeypox response, from providing access to testing, to engaging people in contact tracing, to informing those who may be at higher risk about treatments and how to prevent spreading the disease\r\n        to others.

He recommends that those at risk for the virus be aware of the symptoms and limit close contact with others. ©WHO/Khaled Mostafa",
          "The summer season of festivals and events offered both the possibility of increased monkeypox transmission but also a powerful opportunity to bring information to those whose behaviours may make them more likely get monkeypox. WHO/Europe, alongside\r\n        the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), reached out to experts and representatives of organizations working with MSM, for help in creating a toolkit for health authorities and event organisers that includes technical guidance,\r\n        trainings, materials and ready-to-use and customizable tools to support them to prepare for large and mass gathering events.",
          "During the development phase of the toolkit for event organisers, it was critical to consult MSM representatives, including about which communication channels to use, who should communicate messages and which messages would resonate and engage event-goers.\r\n        When dealing with such a new outbreak, about which even well-intended messages could be considered stigmatizing, the insight they provided into the community’s perceptions, values, behaviour and trust was key to crafting effective risk communication.\r\n        The toolkit has become a valued resource, and has been customized, translated into multiple languages and shared all over Europe.",
          "Video: Steve Taylor, Director of European Pride Organisers Association, speaks at a WHO/Europe press briefing on monkeypox in June 2022.",
          "WHO/Europe has also supported civil society organizations (CSOs) with information and guidance throughout the outbreak with a dedicated network. CSOs are increasingly recognized as important partners to health authorities, and have proved\r\n        invaluable during this outbreak.",
          "One such organization is Milano Checkpoint, a sexual health service in Italy, staffed mainly by volunteers, that has built up trusted relationships and a close knowledge of the people they work with, some of whom are hesitant to use the formal health\r\n        system.",
          "Video: Milano checkpoint, a community-based NGO in Italy, offers sexual health advice and information. Outreach efforts like these are reducing the number of monkeypox cases and stigma. Some individuals came forward to share their experiences of infection with monkeypox. Their personal stories helped to start conversations, share health information and reduce stigma about the virus. “Having lived with HIV since 2016, I know how healing it is to hear other people’s stories. That’s why I wanted to share my story about monkeypox, still a relatively unknown condition. I didn't know anything about it when\r\n            I caught it. In the end, I don't want anyone to have this. I also want to show people that I am okay. Yes, it was severe, but I am better.” Image: Harun Tulunay is a sexual health worker who shared his experience of having monkeypox publicly as a way to create awareness. ©Harun Tulunay",
          "WHO/Europe has also helped disseminate good practice by sharing learnings from countries with creative and effective response strategies, such as the establishment of a rapid response team in Portugal, which was one of the first countries in Europe to show signs of stabilizing transmission.",

          "Right from the start, the rapid response team began a close dialogue with community-based organizations working with MSM, sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV testing and care centres, and bars and sex-on-premises businesses.  “This\r\n        alliance between health authorities, event organizers, community organizations and venues was crucial to our response,” says Dr Margarida Tavares, Director of the National Programme for Sexually Transmitted Infections and HIV Infection.

          "Real-life data on the effectiveness of preventive and post-exposure vaccination for monkeypox with available vaccines are still emerging and due to the limited number of available vaccine doses, prioritization of target groups is needed. Through\r\n            community engagement, countries need to devise effective ways to provide vaccination to target populations at highest risk, without generating stigma and discrimination. Vaccination is therefore not a silver bullet solution, but one tool in\r\n            the fight to reduce transmission. Although the dramatic decline of monkeypox cases in the European Region is extremely promising, we cannot be complacent or lose focus. If it has been, in part, driven by short term behaviour changes, then there’s a risk that we may see a\r\n            resurgence of the virus. Stopping widespread human- to-human transmission will require a dedicated focus, much more effective public health tools and a commitment to keep talking with, and listening to those who may be at most at risk from\r\n            monkeypox.

          "Dr Abdisalan Noor leads the Strategic Information for Response unit within WHO’s Global Malaria Programme. He is also the technical lead for the development of the new Global framework for the response to malaria in urban areas .",
          "Malaria is normally considered a disease that impacts people living in rural areas. Why are WHO and UN-Habitat now focusing on malaria in urban settings?",
          "First of all, we know that malaria is and will continue to be a major problem in rural areas. So today and into the future, malaria is likely to be concentrated among rural populations. Having said that, we are also seeing a rapidly urbanizing world in which most people in malaria-affected countries will soon be living in urban areas. If you take the example of Nigeria, which accounts for about a quarter of the global burden of malaria, nearly half of the population is already living in urban areas.",
          "Overall, we expect that well-planned urbanization will reduce the transmission of malaria through, for example, the destruction of aquatic habitats of mosquitoes and expanded access to health care. However, unplanned urbanization will likely result in a malaria disease burden that is disproportionately high among the urban poor; they are at greater risk of becoming infected, less able to access quality health services, and suffer the most from the impact of becoming ill. Approaches that work to reduce disease burden in rural areas may not work in urban settings, or may need to be implemented at a smaller, more targeted scale. The use of granular data, therefore, becomes essential.",
          "The invasion of mosquito species that adapt easily to urban environments may heighten the risk of malaria and other vector-borne diseases in these areas. WHO recently launched an initiative to stop the spread of one such species, Anopheles stephensi , in Africa.",
          "Taken together, the response to malaria in urban areas is one that needs to be driven by how we manage urban development itself, and then we can build other interventions on the back of that, especially when it comes to prevention."

        "heading": "Rate of urban growth of population in Africa and Asia",
        "content": [
          "What is the aim of the new framework, and who is the target audience?",
          "The new Global framework for the response to malaria in urban settings is designed to provide guidance to city leaders, health programmers and urban planners as they work to control and eliminate malaria in a rapidly urbanizing world. For each urban context, the strategic use of data can inform effective, tailored responses and help build resilience against the threat of malaria and other vector-borne diseases.",
          "Under the umbrella of the New Urban Agenda , which is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, the framework calls for strong partnership and a multi-programme approach. And, for this reason, WHO has collaborated with UN-Habitat to jointly develop and disseminate this framework. The framework was developed as part of a Memo of Understanding between WHO and UN-Habitat signed in 2021 aimed at improving urban health.",
          "Is there a specific intervention needed to address this issue?",
          "There is not one specific intervention for this area of work. The malaria response should be embedded into the broader urban development plan, as well as the broader urban health agenda.",
          "The framework acknowledges that malaria in urban areas must be part of the urban development discourse, and the malaria prevention response is built on the management of the urban environment. So, for example, adequate housing, piped water, better drainage and a cleaner environment contribute to malaria reduction in a much more fundamental way than some of our malaria interventions.",
          "And so, we are shifting the discourse and thinking around the urban malaria response to one that is critically multisectoral; it is a response that is very much led by urban governments, and not something that falls only within the purview of national malaria control programmes, whose role is to provide technical support to the overall malaria response.",
          "While some key interventions, such as diagnostics and treatment, are needed in urban as in rural settings, the framework focuses on challenges in providing access to quality healthcare – particularly for the urban poor. When it comes to prevention, mass distributions of bed nets and indoor residual spraying (IRS) in urban settings are not likely to be rational or cost-effective; there will need to be a move towards a microstratification approach in which data on malaria risk and its determinants at granular and operationally relevant levels are used to tailor interventions to the local context.",
          "Has WHO issued specific recommendations to control malaria in urban settings?",
          "First, it is important to differentiate between what WHO considers “recommendations” and the guidance provided in this framework. WHO recommendations are based on a strict process of trials and evidence  from other sources, which are then published in WHO’s consolidated guidelines .",
          "After WHO has published recommendations, the expectation is that they are adapted by countries to their specific context. Through the new framework, we are trying to: a) tap into the existing malaria recommendations and explain how they can be adapted for urban settings, and; b) emphasize the role that environmental management can play in controlling the built environment so that development in urban settings is geared towards “building out” malaria and other vector-borne diseases. Importantly, the framework highlights the need to integrate responses to both malaria and other vector-borne diseases in urban settings.",
          "What are some of the challenges associated with responding to malaria in urban settings?",
          "There are many challenges. We are dealing with a very clever set of vectors and parasites that cause malaria transmission. We are dealing with the challenges of social inequity – an issue found in both rural and urban settings. We are dealing with rapid and often unplanned urbanization in malaria endemic countries. And then, of course, we are dealing with a lack of financial and other resources.",
          "There are also challenges related to high levels of human mobility. As people infected with malaria move into urban settings, they can put a strain on local health systems and can also contribute to sustained malaria transmission within some urban communities. However, these imported malaria cases are often poorly captured in surveillance systems. Until the publication of this framework, there had been a lack of globally endorsed guidance on how to address malaria in urban areas; there was no clear guidance for countries.",

            "text": "But there are also major opportunities ahead of us.",
            "bullets": [
              "First, there is an increased recognition that the future of humanity is one in which urbanization will play a significant role. Models estimate that in a decade or 2, most of the global population will live in an urban environment. This has led to a need to start thinking about how to create healthy cities and healthy lives within those cities.",
              "Secondly, the urban environment is where most national economies are based; it is where you have some of the most highly skilled employees and a significant private sector presence. These skills and sectors can be leveraged to respond to a particular threat – in this case, malaria in urban areas. Urban settings are also increasingly becoming technological hubs, and innovation can be brought to bear on this particular challenge.",
              "Finally, there is a clear recognition that our current approach of doing the same things in both urban and rural areas will not work well in most instances, and we need new approaches."
            ]
          },
          "Are there other key messages from the framework that you would like to share with readers?",
          "This framework recognizes that the rate of urbanization is happening everywhere, and particularly in malaria-endemic settings. It is aligned with WHO’s call for interventions that are data-driven and tailored to the local context.",
          "The framework acknowledges that malaria prevention should be built firmly on a foundation of managing the urban environment holistically. As such, it recognizes the critical role played by urban governments and the importance of integrating urban malaria responses within the broader urban health agenda. And it spotlights the importance a multisectoral approach, with communities at the centre.",
          "We know that malaria transmission is often concentrated in pockets within urban areas; interventions and strategic approaches must be designed to respond to what is essentially focal malaria transmission in most settings.",
          "And we need to be cognizant of the fact that there are several other vector-borne diseases in urban settings that also have similar transmission patterns. We will achieve our most effective results if we integrate malaria responses with broader efforts to address these other diseases."

          "As part of WHO’s launch of a new antimalarial drug resistance strategy for Africa , we spoke with Dr Marian Warsame, an expert on this topic. A medical doctor by training, Dr Warsame wrote her PhD’s thesis on antimalarial drug resistance in Somalia,\r\n    worked for many years on malaria treatment and drug resistance trials in the United Republic of Tanzania, and, while with WHO’s Global Malaria Programme, helped countries in Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean implement better studies to monitor\r\n    changes in drug and treatment efficacy. This conversation has been edited for concision and clarity.",
          "First from a broad perspective, can you explain why this issue demands attention?",
          "Antimalarial drug resistance is very much an increasing concern in Africa. More than 90% of the global malaria burden – cases and deaths – occurs in Africa, and most of these cases involve Plasmodium falciparum , the parasite\r\n    that is quickly developing resistance to current drugs. This is especially troubling because we only have a limited number of antimalarial drugs today – called artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) – that can treat uncomplicated\r\n    malaria. So, if we lose those, we don’t have any other options and malaria could become uncontrollable.",
          "What is causing this drug resistance to spread in Africa?",
          "Unfortunately, several factors are facilitating a conducive environment for growing drug resistance in Africa today. These include the use of sub-optimal dosages and fake drugs, as well as the inappropriate use of current antimalarial drugs. The best\r\n    treatment for uncomplicated malaria is an ACT, which combines artemisinin and a partner drug. Monotherapy – taking only an artemisinin-derivative injectable for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum infection – has in fact\r\n    been banned. But even though there are guidelines in place against it, monotherapy is still very commonly practiced in malaria-endemic countries. This leads to drug pressure, which is the major contributing factor to the development of drug resistance.",
          "So, on the ground in Africa, we really have the perfect conditions for resistance to develop. As the genetics of the malaria parasite changes, drug-resistant mutations are produced that have a survival advantage in the presence of the drug over the sensitive\r\n    parasites. These new mutations are thus more likely to be transmitted and spread, particularly when you factor in population movement both within countries and across borders. It’s a perfect recipe for the spread of antimalarial drug resistance,\r\n    especially in places suffering from political or climate instability, or where many people are being displaced.",
          "So where are we seeing this spread today?",
          "Globally, resistance to artemisinin and to some of the partner drugs has been seen in South-East Asia in the Mekong region and in many places in Africa. Based on validated molecular markers that help us find and predict drug resistance, we have seen hotspots\r\n    of confirmed partial artemisinin resistance in Eritrea, Rwanda and Uganda, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist in other areas as well. Usually, studies are done at selected central sites, so the full scope of what we can see is\r\n    limited and the geographical extent of the spread is not yet clear.",
          "Can you tell us about the role surveillance played in detecting the emergence and spread of drug resistance in these countries?",
          "As part of WHO recommendations in place for malaria-endemic countries in the Horn of Africa, sentinel sites were established to regularly monitor the use of ACTs as first- and second-line treatments and to look for the known molecular markers associated\r\n    with antimalarial drug resistance.",
          "In addition, a network called HANMAT – the Horn of Africa Network for Monitoring Antimalarial Treatment – was created in 2004 that included Djibouti, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen from the EMRO [Eastern Mediterranean] region and\r\n    Eritrea, Ethiopia, and South Sudan of the AFRO [African] countries. Through this network, member countries have been supported on protocol development, technical support on data validation, data analysis, and report writing. Every year, HANMAT meets\r\n    to plan the next round of surveillance studies, and WHO provides up-to-date technical information if there is a new tool that needs to be covered or new molecular markers to be assessed.",
          "A decade ago, this system allowed for the timely detection of growing drug resistance to AS-SP [Artesunate + sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine],\r\n    which was then the first-line treatment for malaria in Somalia. We saw high rates of treatment failure with this combination due to, as we discovered from molecular markers, resistance to SP. This led to a change in Somalia’s treatment policy\r\n    in 2016 and the replacement of AS-SP with another combination of drugs, AL [artemether + lumefantrine]. We were also able to identify a new second-line\r\n    treatment, which was DHA+PPQ [dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine].",
          "This system has had other successes as well. It’s really very useful to have a regional surveillance system in place with technical and financial support to capture the emergence of problems like treatment failure and drug resistance wherever they\r\n    arise.",
          "What are some of the challenges that these countries face in terms of surveillance?",
          "While these countries have a surveillance system in place, they need WHO to help them keep up to date on evolving resources and information about antimalarial drug efficacy, new molecular markers discovered, and new tools developed. So, it’s good\r\n    to have a platform to help keep countries informed and to encourage adherence to WHO protocols.",
          "Sometimes, countries do a study without any treatment supervision. For example, one malaria treatment involves a twice-daily dose, and usually, doctors give the first treatment under supervision and then give the second for the patient to take at home.\r\n    But studies show that, under this system of unsupervised treatment, the second dose isn’t taken, or taken correctly, leading to treatment failure. This is a separate problem from drug resistance, and there are many confounding factors, many\r\n    of which can be mitigated by supervised treatment. That’s why it’s important to keep countries aware of the best protocols through the regional network.",
          "Countries also sometimes need critical support in gathering, managing, and storing data, through proper data entry and analysis, platform software, and other tools, so that it can be cross-checked and everyone can be sure scientific studies are being\r\n    done appropriately and effectively. Countries do their best, but it’s always good to ensure standard protocols are being followed.",
          "Countries face many other challenges too. Political instability in countries like Somalia, Sudan, or Yemen can lead to studies being postponed or even sites being abandoned. Some sites in Somalia, for example, are no longer accessible because of insecurity.\r\n    Funding is another constant issue – studies are often delayed or redesigned because of lack of money, since most of a country’s malaria budget usually goes to case management, drugs, spraying, and the like.",
          "Local capacity can be another bottleneck, especially in places when there is a high turnover of health workers. Formal training is needed to execute these studies well, especially in areas like malarial microscopy. I would encourage not just training\r\n    packages for each round of a clinical study but refresher training to help keep health workers up-to-date and give them the knowledge and tools to be effective at tracking malaria resistance.",
          "How worried should people be that malaria treatments are going to stop working?",
          "I don't think people should worry about losing ACT treatments in the very near future, because partial resistance to artemisinin does not impact the efficacy of the combination treatment so long as the partner drug remains effective. This is well established,\r\n    even in areas with high rates of artemisinin resistance and delayed parasite clearance. So, it's important to avoid unnecessary panic that increasing drug resistance will mean immediate and widespread treatment failure. But it is a growing problem\r\n    that needs to be managed and hopefully contained before it gets worse.",
          "Is there anything else you think our readers should know about this topic?",
          "I have a few important points that I want to underscore, yes.",
          "First, to avoid panic and confusion among health professionals and the public in general, the situation on drug resistance and treatment efficacy should be properly communicated at the country level, through media platforms like TV, radio, and local newspapers.\r\n    Otherwise, bad information will create chaos. People will hear rumors or reports about failing drugs and may make decisions that lead to bad outcomes, like using unnecessary injectable monotherapies that accelerate the development of drug resistance.\r\n    So, I think messaging is critical, and there needs to be good educational material available for all.",
          "Second, countries need to actually administer the bans on oral monotherapy for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria and encourage the rational use of antimalarial medicines. These bans exist but they are often not enforced, which is also speeding up\r\n    the spread of resistance.",
          "Along the same lines, I hope countries can work to strengthen surveillance of therapeutic efficacy. Because while molecular markers are very useful, ensuring treatment is supervised and monitored is critical for understanding how resistance is evolving\r\n    over time, and there is no substitute for high-quality data at the country level for understanding resistance’s spread.",
          "Finally, I would urge global malaria partners to recognize the importance of these surveillance efforts and help us accomplish this work. If countries don’t have the funds at the national level, we will need help from organizations like WHO, USAID/PMI,\r\n    and the Global Fund to support the monitoring of drug resistance and help ensure countries have the evidence to enact treatment policy changes when needed."

          "To begin with, sub-Saharan Africa holds the greatest burden of malaria, globally: approximately 95% of cases and deaths. And that's huge. So the problem of malaria in Africa itself is very important. Compounding this dilemma, Africa has in the very recent\r\n    past been faced with resistance to a series of drugs, including antimalarial drug resistance.",
          "We don’t have that many options for malaria drugs. As it stands, we just have artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for uncomplicated malaria. So, any threat to these drugs will really be devastating to the epidemiology of the continent\r\n    and could lead to lots and lots of cases and deaths, which we obviously want to avoid.",
          "Since 2015–16, malaria cases have already been on the increase in many African countries. So, the drug resistance we’re seeing is an additional threat that we must manage, even as we are trying to move in a more positive direction and return\r\n    to the progress we saw against malaria before 2015.",
          "Antimalarial drug resistance was also a problem in Africa in the 1970s and 1980s. How is the situation different now, and what can we learn from that earlier experience?",
          "The drug resistance today is a bit different because we are using better drugs – we are using combination therapies that are more expensive and more efficacious. In the 70s and 80s, we were using mostly monotherapies – one drug at a time –\r\n    such as chloroquine. Resistance to chloroquine spread through Africa. Many countries changed to SP [sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine] instead, and, because the situation is always dynamic, resistance to SP quickly emerged as well.",
          "In the past, it took quite a while – about 2 decades – for resistance to be clinically observed. What really drove and accelerated this resistance was the presumptive diagnosis and treatment of cases, meaning cases that were diagnosed and\r\n    treated based only on clinical symptoms, without a proper diagnosis. So, many patients who may not have needed these drugs were taking them. Secondly, most of these drugs were also being used for prevention. Pregnant women and even children used to\r\n    receive weekly doses of chloroquine. This caused a lot of pressure on the malaria parasites, and they eventually developed resistance to these drugs.",
          "Today, we have better drugs – ACTs, which combine 2 effective drugs – but there is still a risk of developing drug resistance. It is very important to recognize that, when the efficacy of one of the drug’s 2 components is weakened by\r\n    resistance, the second component is also affected. That second drug will become exposed, and thus the parasite is more likely to develop resistance against it as well. So what today is an effective drug combination for treating malaria could quickly\r\n    become ineffective if resistance is allowed to grow.",
          "So, what can we learn from this? First, the combination therapies we have today – especially ACTs – should be used in a very rational manner. We need to preserve their efficacy by using them to treat only the cases that really need them. The\r\n    good news is we now have effective diagnostics and tests introduced in the last 2 decades that can rapidly identify the patients that are really suffering from malaria and require ACTs for treatment. Second, we are trying to avoid the use of first-line\r\n    ACTs for prevention purposes. Because they are given to large populations of people who don’t necessarily need them, that increases the likelihood of developing resistance.",
          "And third, we need to continue to find even better ways of carrying out surveillance of resistance’s spread. As I said, drug resistance is a very dynamic process – it’s never going to end and we’re going to have face this issue\r\n    over and over again. So we need to strengthen surveillance of drug efficacy and employ new tools to do it smarter, like genotyping and molecular methods, across our health systems.",
          "South-East Asia is also seeing growing resistance to both components of ACT therapy – artemisinin and various partner drugs. What can the South-East Asian experience tell us about resistance in the African context?",
          "Well, South-East Asia has a different kind of setting in terms of the parasites transmitting malaria. What we noticed there is the prevalence of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite rapidly decreased despite the resistance that was described. So,\r\n    it shows that, if the drugs are used properly – alternating one after the other – and if the drugs that are showing resistance based on efficacy studies are replaced with more effective ones, you can still bring down the parasite prevalence.\r\n    The faster you can reduce that prevalence, the better off you’ll be, because you have fewer cases to deal with and less pressure on parasites for resistance to develop.",
          "In Africa, we can follow that same strategy in places where prevalence levels are going down. But we also have very high burden countries where the decrease in prevalence is very slow, because of the variability of the parasites. It will be important\r\n    in those areas to anticipate the problem by diversifying the use of ACTs – not using just one type of ACT for large populations – to make sure that we don’t create the conditions for resistance to flourish. We have seen in certain\r\n    areas that multiple first-line therapies can help reduce the pressure on the parasites to mutate and develop resistance. This can also help bring down prevalence, especially over the long term.",
          "A lot of work also needs to be done in Africa to ensure the availability of quality-assured drugs. At the moment, we very seldomly have our own drug manufacturing sites, and when we don't have a homegrown market supply of quality-assured drugs, supplies\r\n    can become very inconsistent and the population gets exposed to substandard treatments; this, in turn, can trigger resistance because the drugs do not confer complete clearance of the parasites. Instead, they leave some parasites circulating, and\r\n    those can easily develop mutations. So, our goal must be to strengthen the availability of quality drugs, fight against illicit sales of bad drugs, and improve communication so that people know the dangers of practices that will accelerate resistance.",
          "What else should we be doing to slow or stop anti-malarial drug resistance in Africa?",
          "I already mentioned the importance of increasing surveillance. There's a lot of data we do not have so we don’t even know how severe the problem is. If Rwanda and Uganda are registering high rates of resistance, it’s because they have good\r\n    surveillance systems already in place. In Cameroon, for example, where I've worked for almost all my life, some research teams have already started seeing a decrease in parasite clearance time for ACTs in certain sites. So even in Central Africa,\r\n    we know that if we increase surveillance, we are going to pick up more signs of growing resistance.",
          "So how do we solve the problem? We increase surveillance, and we make sure that once there is resistance, we rapidly change the drug we’re using. We also need to think ahead about what the new drugs and options can be. We shouldn't wait until we\r\n    have full-blown resistance before we start replacing them. So, we are looking forward and working with R&D partners on finding new drugs and exploring new ways of combining old drugs to make them more effective.",
          "I would also stress that we need strong regulatory environments. If we choose treatment guidelines and protocols that are better for certain communities, depending on their drug efficacy profiles, then we should enforce those policies. Sometimes good\r\n    policies are made but never implemented. We need regulation that ensures good quality products, good quality care, and health facilities; enforces guidelines; and helps everyone be aware of the dangers of using substandard drugs and the impact that\r\n    has on resistance.",
          "Should people be worried that ACTs are going to stop working?",
          "People should be quite worried, because we know that ACTs are the only drugs we have for uncomplicated malaria. So, if we do not have any other option, then what happens to our children when they are sick? We will have to give them drugs that are not effective,\r\n    and they will be ill for longer periods. We will have many more severe malaria cases and those will lead to more deaths.",
          "When we had chloroquine resistance, there were hundreds of thousands more deaths because children fell sick, couldn't get treatment in time, the malaria grew severe, and many of them died. If that situation repeats, we may see an increase in mortality\r\n    and in the number of days children must stay in the hospital. This should worry communities.",
          "Even if another treatment does get developed, it may be costly, so many vulnerable children and families may not be able to afford these new and effective drugs. All of this should get us thinking about how we can delay this problem of resistance as much\r\n    as possible. We should also work to get new, affordable treatment options on the market before ACT resistance becomes full-blown.",
          "Is there anything else you want to add?",
          "I want to repeat something I said earlier, which is this situation will always remain dynamic. Parasites will evolve and mutate, and resistance will continue to be an issue because we have large populations taking treatments. So we need to be constantly\r\n    thinking about how to stay a few steps ahead, and we have to help communities be disciplined about using effective treatments. Because it’s only in ensuring this discipline, and making good policies in good time, that we are going to prevent\r\n    the worst consequences of antimalarial drug resistance."

          "Implementing tobacco and smoke-free measures at the FIFA World Cup™ has been the goal of a unique partnership between FIFA, the Government of Qatar and the World Health Organization (WHO) to make the tournament healthy and safe.",
          "“Each of the three partners have long promoted effective tobacco control measures, while also raising awareness around tobacco health hazards,” according to Dr Rayana Bou Haka, WHO Representative to Qatar. “They have also backed the\r\n    implementation of a tobacco-free policy at FIFA sporting events. Still, evidence shows that successful tobacco-free mega sporting events depend on effective communication and enforcement of policies.”",

          "FIFA recognises that exposure to second-hand smoke and vapours is harmful. “The FIFA World Cup in Qatar will have a global audience of five billion people, which gives football a significant platform for social change,” said FIFA Head of Sustainability\r\n    Federico Addiechi. “For two decades, global tournaments have been played in tobacco-free environments, but it is a necessary step to strengthen the implementation of that policy in Doha in November and December and we are committed to do so.\"",

          "Since 2020, the city of Cape Town has been working with the Partnership for Healthy Cities to increase smoke-free compliance in public buildings and raise awareness about the harms of second-hand tobacco smoke.\r\n    Tobacco prevalence in South Africa is estimated to be around 20% of the adult population (aged 15+) 1 and causes thousands of deaths a year. Laws creating indoor and outdoor smoke-free spaces protect the health of non-smokers and can encourage smokers to quit. The country was one of the first in the world to ban smoking in public places in 2000 when it introduced its Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act. In 2009, the government banned smoking in partially enclosed public places such as covered patios,\r\n    verandas, balconies, walkways and parking areas. However, the city saw room to expand this scope, and improve compliance with the existing smoke-free laws. According to the 2016 South Africa Demographic and Health Survey, 25% of women and 43% of men in the Western Cape smoked cigarettes – both substantially higher than the equivalent national rates for the same year (8% for women and 37% for men). 2 To mark World No Tobacco Day 2022 (31 May), the city announced the introduction of new smoke-free\r\n    spaces, having amended a local workplace policy to ensure fewer places to smoke or purchase cigarettes within all buildings owned by the city. 3 In parallel to establishing new smoke-free spaces, the city authorities also launched a communication campaign throughout the city to raise awareness of the dangers of smoking. The campaign featured images of popular Cape Town locations, promoting a cleaner,\r\n    healthier and happier Cape Town. Cape Town’s overall objective is to reach 95% compliance with the national smoke-free law in public buildings, via both communications campaigns and additional enforcement efforts. In doing so they will be both\r\n    supporting national tobacco control efforts and protecting the health of the inhabitants of Cape Town and the environmental well-being of the city itself. The city hosted events at University of Western Cape and with several primary schools for the 2022 World No Tobacco Day, reiterating its theme of the environmental damage caused by tobacco. Tobacco products are the most littered product on the planet,\r\n    and it reportedly costs South Africa more than R2.3 billion every year to clean up discarded tobacco products. To highlight this issue, city activities included a clean-up campaign to remove litter from cigarettes on two of the city’s beaches.\r\n    There were also virtual and in-person events to promote public awareness about the environmental risks caused by tobacco products and the industry. The city of Cape Town originally joined the Partnership for Healthy Cities in 2017 to raise public awareness on the health risks of sugar sweetened beverages linked to a new national levy on these items. _______________________________________________ 1 https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/274512 2 https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/SR248/SR248.pdf 3 https://www.capetown.gov.za/Media-and-news/Cape Town creates more smoke-free city spaces"

          "Since 2017, the municipal health department has been working with the Partnership for Healthy Cities on ways to improve the availability of healthy food for citizens. Most notably this included\r\n    restrictions on salt consumption. In 2018 the city issued a new decree requiring restaurants in Montevideo to have at least 10 percent of their menu contain food items with no added salt.",
          "A healthy diet helps to protect against malnutrition in all forms, as well as noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer. 1 Yet in many countries, a lack of access to healthy food options, changing\r\n    lifestyles, rapid urbanization and increased production of processed foods can create environments where it’s hard to have a healthy diet. Many people now consume more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, which can increase\r\n    their risk of health problems, and do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary fibre such as whole grains.",
          "In Uruguay, NCDs accounted for 85% of deaths in 2016. 2 The city of Montevideo has a long history of pursuing healthy food policies, reflecting a national commitment to promoting healthier diets. The country has several policies in place to\r\n    promote healthier diets, including a national target for sodium intake, but progress has been mixed. In recent years there has also been a noticeable increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods with high levels of calories, fats, sugar and\r\n    salt.",
          "Following the successful introduction of the 2018 decree for less salt on restaurant menus, city authorities have been working to strengthen the provision of healthier foods through other means. On 30 June, 2022, Montevideo",
          "introduced a decree stipulating new nutrition standards for foods and beverages",
          "served and sold in the city’s 48 public institutions and hospitals.",
          "3",
          "The decree includes restrictions on the sale of unhealthy foods, such as bans on\r\n    advertising of ultra-processed foods.",
          "To support implementation of the new standards and encourage compliance, the city included incentives for the institutions involved. These include a form of tax relief: institutions that comply with the standards will not be required to pay the ‘tasa bromatológica’ that has been required by the city since 2007. 4 Workplace vendors can also win “Healthy Canteen” status if they take certain steps to make healthier options available to diners – a status which indicates their commitment to protecting people’s health whilst ensuring they are well fed. To achieve the designation of a healthy canteen, the institution must meet a list of requirements such as a menu based primarily on natural or minimally processed foods, no advertising of unhealthy foods, and the provision of water dispensers that are clearly visible and accessible for workers. 5",
          "An accompanying communication campaign has been launched to emphasize the importance of healthy eating in the workplace, and raise public awareness of the new decree and availability of healthier food options.",
          "The workplaces covered by these standards directly employ more than 8,000 people and serve many thousands more. It is hoped that the new standards will advance the city’s intention of making “the healthiest option the easiest option”\r\n        for its nearly 1.7 million residents. 6",

          "Sometimes necessity accelerates innovation.  An infection prevention and control (IPC) programme piloted in Cox’s Bazar in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to improvements in 120 health facilities around Bangladesh. Bangladesh turned the COVID-19 crisis into an opportunity for strengthening IPC using an approach cutting across the health system, involving staff at national, district and facility level, and including community health workers. How did the programme start? In Bangladesh, the COVID-19 global pandemic provided a strong impetus to develop the “National Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19”, as well as a national guideline on IPC for both private and public health care facilities. Since 2020, multisectoral and multi-stakeholder cooperation rapidly scaled up the implementation of IPC due to continued top level political and leadership commitment. WHO has supported the Government of Bangladesh to develop the IPC guideline and establish IPC committees both at district and “upazila” (facility) level to prevent and control health care-associated infections (HAIs) by setting policy and monitoring practices to reduce risks. These committees worked with defined objectives and workplans to oversee IPC performance in all the health care facilities across the district. IPC monitoring/audit and feedback in the spirit of improvement The government health sector, together with WHO, has also developed assessment tools and checklists to monitor IPC standards, using a monthly scorecard to enable the visualization of IPC implementation by each health care facility. These assessments are done in the spirit of improvement and used to identify gaps and breaches in adherence to guidelines, better aligning training initiatives to assure the best care delivery. First piloted in Cox’s Bazar, this programme has led to improvements in 120 health care facilities, which were assessed regarding their IPC preparedness and readiness. Findings have been shared at policy level and reviewed for further improvement. According to the use of an IPC scorecard, significant improvements were recorded in the following areas: IPC personnel (from 8% to 100%), training (from 22% to 100%) and monitoring (from 18% to 70%). The monthly scorecards displayed in health care facilities have been an incentive in promoting accountability and tracking progress of IPC measures. WHO, together with other health sector partners, has been working on developing a central dashboard for the visualization of IPC in health care facilities in the Rohingya camps, which could be accessed globally. This initiative is timely given the current development of a pool of IPC master trainers supporting eight divisions to roll out training in sub district facilities, scaling up monitoring including at community level. Bangladesh’s approach to IPC training A “Master Training and Education in IPC” programme for health workers and a “Master Training Programme for Monitoring and Auditing of IPC Activities and HAIs” were conducted at the national level and then cascaded to district hospitals, targeting 12 000+ health workers. The training consisted of theoretical and practical sessions on donning and doffing procedures for personal protective equipment and IPC practices aimed at preventing transmission of infections. The government of Bangladesh also prioritized the improvement of the infrastructure to provide a clean and hygienic environment, by ensuring the availability of appropriate IPC materials and equipment. Priority was given to establishing functional hand hygiene stations with clean running water, soap and alcohol-based handrub for all health care facilities and escalating the provision of personal protective equipment."

          "A unique strength of this programme is an efficient system for the surveillance of infections acquired during health care (health care-associated infections [HAIs]). After introducing this innovative system in 1997, Germany has seen significant reductions\r\n    in infection rates."

          "A voluntary and confidential national system for HAI surveillance – the Krankenhaus-Infektions-Surveillance-System (KISS) – started in 1997, with a small number of participating hospitals. KISS then grew from year to year and now consists\r\n    of several HAI surveillance components spanning a range of patient populations and areas: intensive care units (ICUs), neonatology, intensive care patients with very low birth weight, hematology-oncology patients, surgical patients, non-ICU patients with vascular or urinary\r\n    catheters and outpatients with ambulatory operations. Finally, components for hospital-based surveillance of multidrug-resistant organisms and for alcohol-based hand rub consumption have been introduced.",
          "Most German hospitals participate in at least one surveillance component and, since 2001, all hospitals perform surveillance for certain infection types which are relevant for their patients, according to the German infection protection act. The data\r\n    must be analysed and reported to staff, appropriate action taken and IPC measures implemented at the point of care based on the results. Compliance with these requirements are assessed by the local health authorities regularly.",
          "KISS demonstrated the tremendous benefits of ongoing surveillance activities and feedback to hospitals in combination with reference data, achieving significant reductions in infection rates, more specifically, a marked reduction between 20–30% of infections\r\n    in various surveillance periods in the components for ICUs, operative departments and neonatal ICUs.",
          "One of the biggest benefits of the national surveillance system has been the ability to use data for improvement and as a measure of quality performance for staff and institutions. Surveillance is a primary driver for reducing HAIs also due to the implementation\r\n    of evidence-based practices and appropriate tailoring of interventions in addition to feedback on the infection rates in comparison with reference data."

Annual meetings\r\n    are organized to present the latest data, discuss challenges and determine relevant actions based on new developments in the field.",
          "The quality of data feedback is fundamental in translating surveillance results into action, so data presentation and visualisation in tables and figures are continuously assessed and improved. Timely dissemination of the data\r\n    to those who will use them to prevent and control infections is also key.",
          "Training is important to ensure that HAI case definition criteria and protocols are accurately and consistently applied. KISS has conducted training on HAI diagnosis according to pre-set definitions by case studies, and tools\r\n    for periodically testing data accuracy are made available.",
          "Having an online data management system has been fundamental to handling the increasing number of participating hospitals and provide technical management and support and timely, regular data feedback.",

          "Raising awareness about mental illness, dispelling the stigma often associated with it, and encouraging people who experience stress and anxiety to seek help are key elements of the Sport for Health partnership between the World Health Organization and\r\n    the Ministry of Public Health of Qatar. The three-year partnership is using the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 as the platform to share important health messaging with a global audience.",
          "According to the WHO, depression affects more than 260 million people in the world while around half of all mental health conditions start by age 14.  Mental health is one of the health promotion pillars of the Sport for Health partnership, but both\r\n    MoPH and WHO have been working hard to raise awareness of mental health through dedicated campaigns delivering similar messages.",
          "“At WHO, we have been working since 2021 with FIFA on the # REACHOUT initiative which aims to raise awareness and reduce stigma, encourage people to seek help when they need\r\n    it, and take actions every day for better mental health. The support of past and current football players has been helping underline the importance of greater awareness around mental health,” said Dr Dévora Kestel, Director of WHO’s\r\n    Department of Mental Health and Substance Use.",
          "In Qatar, public attitudes to mental health continue to improve thanks to large-scale public awareness campaigns like the national ‘Are You OK?’ campaign. Launched in 2020, the initiative aims to encourage people to talk more openly about\r\n    their emotional wellbeing and has resulted in greater numbers of people seeking help from mental health services.",
          "An enormous amount of progress has been made in recent years to raise public awareness and dispel the myths and stigma that surround mental health. The Sport for Health partnership aims to build on this progress and use FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™\r\n    as a catalyst to raise awareness of mental health and to stimulate positive change. As the most watched sporting event in the world, the tournament offers a wonderful platform to promote health to communities across the globe.",
          "“The benefits of sport and physical activity on people’s mental health are well documented. Spending time exercising, being physically active with your friends and family and ensuring you get enough rest can boost your mental health and wellbeing,”\r\n    said Dr Samya Al Abdulla, Qatar’s Deputy National Health Strategy Lead for Mental Health and Wellbeing.",
          "But greater action is also needed, in terms of investment, on all fronts to increase understanding of mental illness and reduce associated stigma, as well as scale up services to treat mental disorders and ensure access to quality and affordable care.",
          "“We know that the fear of stigma is a key factor preventing many people from seeking help from mental health services,” said Iain Tulley, Qatar’s National Health Strategy Lead for Mental Health and Wellbeing. “To address this and\r\n    ensure people have easy access to confidential psychological support we have established a National Mental Health Helpline and this has been one of the most impactful developments in recent years within the Mental Health Service.”",
          "Tailoring services to meet the needs of the many communities can improve the health and wellbeing of citizens and residents. In Qatar, The health sector’s screening of craft and manual workers, with dedicated access to free and local clinics, has\r\n    been successful in providing psychological support to this population group. The Friendship Benches initiative, supported by WHO, the MoPH, FIFA, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, and other partners, is a practical example of this, with\r\n    32 benches – one for each of the FIFA World Cup competing nations – designed and built for raising mental health awareness during, and after, the tournament.",
          "Dr Khalid Saeed, WHO’s focal point for mental health in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, said the Sport For Health partnership is helping bring increased attention to the importance of mental health.",
          "“Mental and  physical health are inextricably linked and sports is a clear illustration of  the tangible links and  benefits which accrue from these” said Dr Saeed. “This underscores why mental health needs to be conceived\r\n    as more than a set of disorders. Mental health  underpins  all human endeavors and hence should be part and parcel of all developmental and humanitarian policies and actions.”"

By creating a fully student-led Model WHO, students learn how decisions are made at the Health Assembly.",
          "Secretary-General of WFUNA, Bonian Golmohammadi stated that “WFUNA is honored to join together with the World Health Organization to organize this unique experience for youth around the world. The global pandemic over the last two years has highlighted the important role WHO plays in addressing global health issues. The Global Model WHO should help increase the participation of youth in the work of WHO which is critical to achieving its goals.”",

          "The simulations of the Health Assembly will focus on topics currently on the WHO agenda. While some simulations are designed for university students who are currently enrolled in an academic programme leading to a degree in medicine, nursing or global health, other simulations are open to any interested high school or university student regardless of the disciplines they are studying.",

          "A primary objective of the MVIP pilot programme was to assess the feasibility of administering the recommended 4 doses of the RTS,S malaria vaccine to young children in routine use in African settings. When pilot introductions started in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi in 2019 there had never been a childhood vaccine for malaria, and its administration would require caregivers to bring their children to vaccination clinics for extra vaccine visits, with one near 2 years of age, later than for other childhood vaccines.",
          "More than 3 years after the launch of the malaria vaccine in pilot implementations, evidence and experience gained in the pilots have confirmed that the vaccine is safe, life-saving and feasible to deliver. The pilots also provided the opportunity to learn how to overcome challenges administering the 4-dose vaccination schedule to achieve good uptake and community acceptance.",
          "Across the 3 countries, challenges around the dosing schedule were similar, as were some of the interventions put in place to tackle them.  In this article, Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) officers from each of the countries share their reflections."

Across the board, visits to health facilities by EPI officers to witness vaccination in action and provide on-site training to health workers – known as supportive supervision—identified challenges and ways to rectify them.",
          "“Early on, we noted poor uptake of the vaccine in some facilities. When we went deeper through supportive supervision, and we went through scenarios with health workers of what they do if a child comes at a certain age [outside of the formal vaccination schedule] , we uncovered a lot of misunderstood information, so we had to come in and intervene,” said Mr Thomas Mavuto, Ministry of Health (MoH), Malawi ."

In the first few months of introduction, health workers were often unsure whether to vaccinate children coming late for their 1 st dose, or for subsequent doses.",
          "“There were missed opportunities for vaccination. In some areas, when a child came and was age 7 months, health workers would not give the vaccine,” said Dr Kwame Amponsa-Achiano, MoH Ghana .",
          "One reason for the confusion was that countries initially adopted schedules that emphasized specific ages for each dose. In trainings, health workers were instructed to vaccinate children who fit specified age brackets. One reason for emphasizing specific ages for vaccination was concern about available vaccine supply in the initial months: the fear was that if all children under age 1 were eligible for the 1st dose there would not be enough vaccine to meet demand. As this was the first real-world vaccine implementation, countries were unsure how much to deviate from the recommended schedule. The result was that health workers were less confident handling scenarios that called for flexibility. In response, the countries reviewed and revised communications and training materials for health workers to clarify guidance (see number 4 below)."

          "In Kenya, at the launch of pilot introduction, the recommended schedule for dose 1 was age 6 months. When decisions were made to ‘relax’ the eligibility and offer the 1 st dose to children up to 1 year of age, it took some time for health workers to become familiar with the change and implement it.",
          "“ When we first trained health workers, we told them the schedule was 6, 7, 9 and 24 months. But during implementation, after noticing missed opportunities for vaccination, we expanded the eligibility for the first dose from 6 months to before the child celebrates their 1 st birthday. The change introduced some problems,” said Dr Rose Jalang'o, MoH Kenya.",
          "With any new vaccine, health workers and caregivers need to get used to a new schedule. Countries should adopt clear messaging about the recommended schedule from the start and communicate consistently on how to catch up on any missed doses along the way, for example, that the malaria vaccine could be provided with a minimum of 4 weeks between doses.",

          "Shortly after becoming aware of some misunderstanding on the schedule, countries went back to the drawing board to ensure that information products, job aids and health messages for caregivers were as clear as possible.",
          "“ Despite covering this during initial trainings, which often include case scenarios, the original communication materials did not include information about what to do if a child presented late. We have since developed a very clear one-page document to guide health workers. We had to make it as precise as possible,” said Dr Jalang’o.",
          "In Kenya, the team decided to modify vaccination stickers to further reduce confusion. While child health book stickers to document receipt of doses initially were labelled 6, 7, 9 and 24 months, the team changed those to read dose 1, 2, 3 or 4, so there wasn’t any confusion if a child presented late for vaccination.",
          "Ghana and Malawi developed short educational videos for health workers that outlined the dosing schedule and how to handle scenarios that might arise when children came late. In Ghana, this included a virtual, interactive quiz distributed on messaging platforms that presented multiple situations and real-time feedback on the correct way to respond. These remote tools were particularly useful in the Covid-19 context when trainings and visits to communities were limited or put on hold.",
          "“We came up with messages that are tailored for health workers, particularly those responsible for screening children for vaccination. The caregiver might bring the child to the clinic, but the health worker might not offer that service to a child if the vaccinator cannot determine if the child should receive the vaccine,” said Mr Mavuto .",
          "Countries also noted the importance of collaboration between the EPI and national malaria control programmes to ensure that health messages, leaflets and posters include facts on malaria and how to prevent it as well as the benefits of the new malaria vaccine.",
          "“ The two programmes can leverage each other’s strengths during community engagements, communication efforts and media events. The malaria control team can use the existing EPI infrastructure as much as possible,” said Dr Jalang’o ."

          "“In Malawi the last vaccination visit…had been the 2 nd dose of the measles-rubella vaccine, which comes when the child is 15 months old. Caregivers were used to the last visit at that age, but now they had to come again when the child is almost 2 years old,” said Mr Mavuto.",
          "Today, WHO’s March 2022 position paper on the malaria vaccine recommends flexibility for country immunization programmes to determine the malaria vaccine schedule in ways that “optimize delivery, for example, to align the 4th dose with other vaccines given in the 2 nd year of life.”",
          "Following the WHO recommendation, and based on the country’s experience, Ghana recently decided to re-set its schedule for the 4th dose of malaria vaccine to age 18 months to coincide with the country’s schedule for dose 2 of the measles-rubella vaccine.",
          "“Based on our experience, I believe the first 3 doses won’t be a challenge, but for the 4 th dose, given that all 3 pilot countries are struggling somewhat on uptake of the final dose, other countries may be able to learn from our experience. If they can start 4 th dose administration from 18 months, or at an age at which most countries have other vaccines, I think that it’s better,” said Dr Kwame .",
          "Kenya is considering a similar change to its vaccination schedule. Malawi has decided to retain its schedule of 22 months for dose 4. Additionally, to promote increased uptake of all doses, Malawi has increased training to health workers to inform them that they should offer the vaccine to any child who presents for vaccination from 5 months of age and should maintain a minimum of 4 weeks between vaccine doses; furthermore, the MoH plans to take opportunities to inform caregivers about the vaccine and its schedule, including via community-based radio.  Looking forward, all of the pilot countries are considering ways to build on additional malaria vaccine visits to increase uptake of other child health services.",
          "“We are working to make parents aware that apart from malaria vaccination, they should come to the facility for normal growth monitoring and other services like vitamin A. We need to communicate that as a package,” added Dr Mavuto ."

          "Worryingly, the invasive mosquito has continued to spread to other countries in the African continent, with cases reported in Ethiopia and Sudan (2016), Somalia (2019), and Nigeria (2020).",
          "“Native [malarial] mosquitoes are thought to breed mainly in rural settings,” notes Dr Fitsum Tadesse, a lead scientist at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute who has been monitoring An. stephensi ’s spread in Ethiopia and helped draft a five-year national response. “But this new mosquito can breed in water storage containers,” he adds. “These\r\n    are typically common in rapidly expanding urban settings that have poor infrastructure and sewage systems, where people have to store water everywhere in containers.”",
          "Compounding the problem, many traditional anti-malaria tools are harder to implement against An. stephensi . “Its resting and feeding behaviour are quite different from other vectors,” notes Dr Delenasaw Yewhalaw, an entomologist at\r\n    the Tropical and Infectious Diseases Research Center of Jimma University in Ethiopia.",
          "“Most of the conventional intervention tools like IRS [indoor residual spraying] or long-lasting insecticidal nets may not work or may not be as effective to contain this species.” An. stephensi also exhibits an alarming resistance to most insecticides, he adds.",
          "Taken together, An. stephensi could pose a significant threat to Africa’s efforts to control and eliminate malaria. One study projected that the species could put an additional 126 million people at risk of the disease if allowed to spread unchecked. At the same time, much more research is needed to determine when, where, and how An. stephensi is\r\n moving across the continent.",
          "For one, it’s still unclear how and when this species originally arrived in Djibouti, and whether this was the only country where the vector entered the continent. And, while its presence strongly correlates with the rapid increase in malaria cases\r\n    both in Djibouti and in the nearby Ethiopian city of Dire Dawa, the extent to which An. stephensi might drive malaria surges in other African cities is unknown."

          "To help find answers to these questions, strengthen research and vector surveillance, and encourage a comprehensive response to this threat, WHO is launching a new initiative to stop the further spread of An. stephensi in the region\r\n    and determine if it can be eliminated from the areas it has already invaded.",
          "One critical component of this work will be to encourage collaboration across sectors and borders. “There has to be multisectoral and cross-border collaboration,” argues Dr Yewhalaw. “This is an urban malaria vector. Ministries of Agriculture,\r\n    Health, Education, Environment, Sanitation, Water Resources and Municipalities/City Administrations – all need to work together.”",
          "Another important part of this initiative, notes Dr Yewhalaw, is boosting awareness of An. stephensi in the cities and communities most at risk, especially those where conventional surveillance methods and interventions are hard to\r\n    implement. “People should be aware that the water they use for domestic purposes could be a good breeding ground for this invasive species.”",
          "A better understanding of the role and invasive reach of An. stephensi may also help scientists and public health officials track and trace its local mosquito relative Aedes aegypti , the species that is the primary vector\r\n    of arboviruses like dengue fever, chikungunya and yellow fever. Like An. stephensi , Ae. aegypti also travels far from home and shares the ability to breed in small pockets of standing water.",
          "“Whenever we look at the breeding sites for Anopheles stephensi , we’ve also seen that Aedes aegypti is there,” notes Dr Renee van de Weerdt, WHO Country Representative for Djibouti. “And that’s why, for us, in support of the Ministry of Health and other relevant parts of the Djiboutian Government, having joint vector control\r\n        interventions is important.”",
          "For Dr Ghasem Zamani, a malaria advisor with the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office, understanding and grappling with the rapid spread of An. stephensi will be critical to protecting against disease outbreaks, particularly in\r\n    urban settings in the coming years.",
          "“These vectors have been expanding their range for many reasons. Rapid ecological change, which includes human and environmental change, rapid urbanization, population movement, security issues, and increasing trade between countries – all\r\n    of these are changing the movement of goods, people, and vectors. It is not just An. stephensi coming to Africa, it’s also Ae. aegypti invading more areas than ever before.”",
          "With 40% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa living in cities, continued traveling by An. stephensi is especially worrying. “Djibouti is a gate, and An. stephensi will spread very quickly,” notes Colonel Abdi. “We\r\n    have large cities in Africa and it’ll be a big, big threat. And with climate change, I'm sure it will reach some other Western countries too. We should have a global policy.”",

          "Rabies, a zoonotic disease, is endemic in Ghana and the Ashanti region, in the south of the country is one of the worst affected. In rural areas, rabies cases often go unreported, as awareness of the disease is low and surveillance is sub-optimal. To reach the global goal of zero dog-mediated rabies deaths by 2030, different sectors have to work together and collaborate, employing a One Health approach.",
          "In pursuit of the Zero by 2030 goal, the School of Veterinary Medicine of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) supported the newly-established Animal Welfare League, in an outreach project on rabies and animal welfare to five rural communities in the Ashanti region in June 2022. Radio announcements informed the community members of the project, and free rabies vaccination was provided for over 270 dogs and cats. In addition, they visited 10 schools within the Nsuta township in the Sekyere Central District of the Ashanti region to educate pupils aged 5–15-years about animal welfare and rabies. Sessions focussed on the importance of animals to the ecosystem, responsible pet ownership, bite prevention and what to do in case of a bite The pupils had the opportunity to ask the veterinary students and staff of the veterinary school  questions related to animals and veterinary medicine. At the end of the programme, special exercise books were delivered to the pupils. The pupils were enthused with the visit and even requested  the veterinary  students to come back again the following year! “Children were really happy to learn better ways to live with their animals at home. They were taught about rabies, bite prevention and what to do in case of a bite – in particular where to get help - and not to rely on homemade remedies that may make the problem worse,” ( recalls Daniel Abiliba, the Director of the Animal Welfare League ). Education on rabies and dog vaccination are pillars of success Rabies is a deadly but preventable disease and it causes great suffering in affected communities. The students and staff from KNUST  Veterinary School are committed to preventing this disease from causing any further harm in  communities, through the organsiation of  similar campaigns. The vision of these students is to ensure  a world free of rabies in both human and animal populations. To achieve this vision,they carry out cost-effective animal vaccinations as a  way of preventing zoonotic disease-related devastation and rabies deaths in both humans and animals. “ When our communities know about rabies, how to be responsible dog owners, prevent dog bites, and  know what to do if they get bitten, the goal of Zero by 30 comes closer to reality. This would be a massive step forward for our communities, which would not only be relieved of this dangerous disease, but also become closer to their pets, and enjoy their company safely. People would not only see dogs as vehicles for the transmission of a deadly disease, which would increase welfare and pet ownership .” ( Ludwig Nii, a student  from KNUST ). KNUST University is a pioneer when it comes to implementing the One Health approach . 1 Veterinary and medical students attend lectures together for at least four semesters. Lectures are delivered by  professors who have specialised in various topics. The students conduct joint outreach activities, like the anti-rabies campaign organized by the Ghana Veterinary Medical Students.",
          "Association in July and August 2022. They also combine dog vaccination with rabies education, including bite prevention, as well as sessions on what practical steps to take in case of bites. To reach out to a wider audience with information on rabies, the students have made use of both social and traditional media for sensitization. The audience showed great interest in the discussions and called in to ask questions and further clarifications. The student’s social media platforms were also used to distribute flyers and publish posts about rabies. The Health sciences students association of the University also organized an inter-professional competition. During this  students from the nine different Departments of the College of Health Sciences (KNUST) teamed up to discuss solutions to global health problems such as zoonoses and neglected tropical diseases. The  relationship was  further strengthened  through social programmes  such as sports, debates  and dinner. One Health is crucial in the elimination of rabies. With access to vaccination for humans and animals, coupled with education and awareness creation in the communities,  we can together beat this ancient disease. The young people and future generations of professionals in Ghana are highly motivated and dedicated to the goal: ‘A world in which no one dies from rabies’. ---------------------------------------------------------------- 1 . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YMot19AdJ0"

In the public sector alone, we have opened ten new hospitals and 16 new primary health centers since 2010, significantly boosting capacity across\r\n    the system. This transformation has also been seen in our emergency medical services, with an expanded national Ambulance Service and the opening of the region’s largest Trauma and Emergency Center in 2019.”",

We have placed great importance on building a strong, highly skilled team of health-care professionals across the system to lead the delivery of high-quality care to Qatar’s\r\n    population. All football fans visiting Qatar for the FIFA World Cup can be reassured that, if needed, they will receive health-care services from Hamid Medical Centre teams on par with the very highest international standards,” added Dr Al Romaihi.",

          "”Now our plan is to build on best practices and recommendations from the FIFA Arab Cup™ in late 2021, and strengthen health emergency preparedness and ensure maintenance of precautionary measures for containing infectious diseases, including\r\n    COVID-19, to keep people safe and healthy,” added Dr Bou Haka.",
          "The MoPH and WHO have collaborated this year to run a series of training workshops and simulated exercises ahead of the World Cup. “When we support these kinds of simulation exercises, we typically think up and present something that might be likely to happen. When we do this, we always want to make sure that the simulated crisis is big enough to actually stress the system, something like a mass casualty event. This sort of exercise will identify areas requiring further strengthening,” said Gillian Dacey, who runs simulation exercises for WHO.",
          "WHO supports and encourages the use of simulation exercises as part of emergency preparedness planning because over the years, it’s become clear that structures need to not only be in place, but also properly functioning, in order to effectively\r\n    respond to health emergencies.",
          "The unique Sport for Health partnership aims to create a blueprint to protect and promote health at future mass gatherings. FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ represents a unique opportunity to develop a new approach to organizing mega sports events factoring in\r\n    lessons learnt from the pandemic and reinforcing sports and health as a pathway for recovery."

          "In a consolidated effort, multiple partners 1 have set up a comprehensive rabies course including an intensive 11-day program in Côte d’Ivoire, bringing together 25 animal and human public health professionals from Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Chad, and Togo.",
          "Course participants had already completed extensive online preparatory sessions, so this in-person program focused on turning that knowledge into action through hands-on practical experience.",
          "Key areas covered included strategic planning, access to PEP (post exposure prophylaxis for bite victims), mass dog vaccination and laboratory work.",
          "\" This international rabies training aims to foster the emergence of collaborations between young professionals from different disciplines and sectors, and from diverse African countries. It is expected that these actors will contribute to the strengthening of the One Health approach in their respective countries to achieve the goal of zero human rabies cases by 2030.\"",
          "Dr Madi Savadogo, Training facilitator and Head of Rabies Free Burkina Faso",
          "Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is administered to patients suspected of exposure to rabies virus and consists of thorough wound washing, passive immunization if indicated, and a series of vaccinations. Access to PEP is very limited in many countries, and it is also expensive.",
          "The course encouraged participants to discuss the present challenges in providing rabies PEP as well as practical solutions to increase access to care and PEP for bite victims. In Côte d’Ivoire, rabies is a priority disease and vaccination as well as human rabies surveillance are coordinated by the Antirabies Center of the National Institute of Public Hygiene. Participants visited one of 30 rabies vaccination units that specialize in providing PEP for bite victims.",
          "Dog vaccination is a key pillar of Zero by 30: the Global Strategic Plan to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 . The course urged all participants to see dog vaccination as a matter of human public health as well as animal health, with hands-on experience in planning and implementing dog vaccination campaigns and dog population management. Participants gained practical knowledge of dog behaviour, safe dog handling, different vaccination techniques and ways in which vaccinated dogs can be identified.",
          "Participants put theory into practice by taking part in a dog vaccination campaign led by local authorities in Bingerville. Dog owners were invited, via local radio announcements, social network messages and door-to-door communication, to bring their animals to local vaccination points.",
          "Gbohounou Fabrice Gnali, a participant in the course, working in the veterinary public health sector, recalled that ”the beginning of the campaign was timid, but after the word had spread many dog owners came on subsequent days to ask for a free vaccination against rabies .”",
          "The dog owners were provided with a certificate of vaccination, and many were also interviewed about their knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to rabies.",
          "In addition to this, participants helped to vaccinate free-roaming dogs across the locality. All vaccinated animals were marked with a ribbon collar.",
          "“ There are many dogs walking in the streets without being accompanied by their owners and we don’t know if they have been vaccinated or not. In rural areas, adults and children alike are not suspicious of dogs, whether they are vaccinated or not, and children tend to approach them; on the other hand, in urban areas, people are suspicious of dogs that do not belong to them .” Gbohounou Fabrice Gnali, DVM, Institut Pasteur de Côte d'Ivoire.",
          "At the central veterinary laboratory of Bingerville, course participants were able to compare and practice different diagnostic procedures and discuss the importance of data collection including standardized case definitions, minimum indicators and the global sharing of data. In many rabies-endemic countries, laboratory testing of animals infected with rabies remains rare, but post-mortem investigations are important to improve rabies epidemiological data and strengthen detection and surveillance.",
          "The course aimed to increase awareness and communication about rabies in Africa and emphasized the need for multidisciplinary approaches and intersectoral cooperation. Participants exchanged experiences from their respective countries and discussed the different problems and opportunities for rabies control in Africa, elaborating on strategic and practical solutions.",
          "Elimination of dog-mediated human rabies is complex but achievable. It requires sustained efforts to improve disease awareness, community engagement, responsible dog ownership, mass dog vaccination, cross-sectoral collaboration, appropriate wound management, and access to post-bite treatment (post-exposure prophylaxis). All these topics were covered, in an attempt to empower countries to get closer to the globally-agreed goal of zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030.",

          "The northern part of Namibia in particular has been identified as a rabies hotspot, and many rabies cases, both in humans and animals (dogs and livestock especially), have occurred there in the last years.",
          "© Dr. Rauna Athingo",
          "In 2006, Dr Rauna Athingo started working as a state veterinarian, responsible for disease control in the Oshana region – one of the regions in the north of the country where rabies is inflicting a particularly heavy burden. She was able to observe how vulnerable children were being exposed to rabid dogs and puppies in particular. At that time, she remembers, the Directorate of Veterinary Services did not have a strategy on how to handle rabies cases, and this made their work very difficult. Dr Athingo was part of a driving force in developing Namibia’s National Rabies Control Strategy, which provides guidance to all veterinarians and public health professionals in how to deal with rabies cases.",
          "“My vision is of a Namibia free from dog-mediated rabies, saving human lives and saving the livelihoods of farmers who also suffer as a result of mass livestock losses due to rabies.” – Dr Rauna Athingo, Chief Veterinarian for Animal Disease Control in the Directorate of Veterinary services, Namibia.",
          "Rabies is a prime example of a disease at the animal-human-environment interface: cases in dogs, humans and livestock are directly correlated. To make elimination of rabies possible, therefore, different sectors have to collaborate and work together.",
          "© Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI)",
          "In 2015, to do just that, and in an attempt to address the increasing number of rabies cases, Namibia started to implement a One Health approach. The relevant authorities identified the need for collaboration between sectors and completely changed their approach to rabies control, by improving coordination and collaboration as well as communication at the human-animal-environment interface. Representatives from various sectors, such as human and animal health, education, environment and academia, took part in the formulation of Namibia’s strategy. Many activities were implemented under the One Health approach, both nationally and also in cooperation with neighbouring countries like Angola.",
          "Commitments from both the private and public sectors enabled Namibia to work towards the global goal of zero dog-mediated rabies cases by 2030, increasing awareness among communities and improving accessibility to post-exposure prophylaxis, especially in children and poor communities, given that rabies has devastating impacts not only on health but also on livelihoods. The financial burdens for bite victims, for example, include direct travel costs, as a number of trips to a healthcare facility are needed to complete the post-exposure prophylaxis schedule, and also the loss of income that can result from exposure. As well as this, rabies exposure can inflict a heavy psychological burden on families, and dogs too can be associated with this traumatic experience, resulting in long-term fear for humans.",
          "Considering these economic, social and individual implications, controlling rabies at its source (i.e. the dogs themselves) is cheaper than providing postexposure prophylaxis. It also helps to empower communities – if community members understand the dangers of rabies, and ways to control it, they can contribute themselves to saving lives.",
          "Dr Athingo’s message is clear: “ Kick out rabies from Namibia – vaccinate your pet ”.",

          "For more than five years now, the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) has been supporting Namibia’s efforts to control rabies in various areas. Besides carrying out assessments, epidemiological analyses, and building capacity at the laboratory side, vaccination has been a particular focus.",
          "Currently, rabies elimination efforts rely on mass dog vaccination by the parenteral route, which means injecting a dose of rabies vaccine under the skin. Vaccination campaigns usually rely on owners bringing their dog to vaccination points. However, free-roaming and stray dogs are sometimes hard to catch and this means that vaccination targets, to control rabies in the dog population, may not be reached.",
          "To increase herd immunity, these free-roaming and stray dogs need to be specifically targeted by vaccination campaigns, and oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of dogs is one possible solution in such cases.",
          "“ With safe, efficacious and well accepted oral vaccine baits available, ORV has the potential to become a game changer in situations where parenteral vaccination alone cannot stop transmission within the dog population .” - Dr Conrad Freuling, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute",
          "Before using the vaccine in a larger field trial, colleagues from the FLI, in conjunction with the University of Namibia, tested the immune responses triggered by oral vaccine baits in local Thai and Namibian dog populations 1,2 .",
          "During a field trial in communal areas of northern Namibia, both veterinary staff and dog owners expressed their appreciation for this particular approach to vaccination. When it comes to oral vaccination, however, bait acceptance has to be considered. Dogs will only go for “tasty” baits. Fortunately for the trial, a great many dogs that were offered bait were interested. They ingested them and were then considered as being vaccinated 3 .",
          "ORV can complement current parenteral vaccination strategies and go a long way in making up for the lack of access to crucial parts of the dog populations that rabies elimination programs have to contend with.",
          "Dr Thomas Müller of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute said, “ The partnership with our Namibian colleagues has been and continues to be very fruitful. We are confident that the promising results from our field assessments of ORV will pave the way for other countries in Africa and elsewhere to integrate ORV into their rabies control programmes. ”",

Even in their comparatively mild seasonal form, respiratory diseases such as influenza (also known as the flu) kill hundreds of thousands each year.\r\n        When such diseases occur as pandemics, they inflict large scale societal and economic disruption, and cost lives. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that they can set back many of the hard-won health gains of the Sustainable Development Goals and\r\n        other aspirations of the World Health Organization and the international community to bring about the highest possible level of health for all.",
          "Today, seasonal epidemic outbreaks of influenza affect up to 1 billion people each year, causing 3 to 5 million severe cases and up to 650 000 deaths annually due to respiratory diseases. The number of influenza-related deaths is likely to be greater as more is learned about deaths related to influenza – for example, influenza-triggered deaths due to cardiovascular causes.",
          "\"Influenza is not a national issue; it’s not a national phenomenon – it’s a global phenomenon and you can’t work on it isolated in the country.\" - Dr Olav Hungnes, Director of National Influenza Centre, Norwegian Institute of Public Health",
          "The birth of the Global Influenza Surveillance & Response System",
          "Global health threats require a global response. In July 1948 – only 3 months after the adoption of the WHO Constitution and exactly 30 years after the devastating H1N1 influenza pandemic of 1918 – the World Influenza Centre\r\n                        at Mill Hill in London was established. The subsequently formed WHO Expert Committee on Influenza met for the first time in 1952 at an event now widely regarded as the birth of global influenza surveillance by the World Health\r\n                        Organization. The resulting early network consisted of the World Influenza Centre and 21 collaborating laboratories in 25 countries, primarily located in Europe and North America. Within a year, this network doubled in size and expanded into every\r\n                        region of the world. Today, 127 countries, areas and territories are able to detect, report and share data on circulating influenza viruses. Hill, London home to the World Influenza Centre",
          "The Global Influenza Surveillance & Response System (GISRS) conducts the laboratory testing that is the foundation of disease surveillance for influenza and other respiratory viruses. Through GISRS, countries share clinical specimens and virus samples for genetic analysis throughout the year to understand patterns of respiratory virus circulation, to identify new and characterize novel influenza viruses as well as other emerging respiratory viruses, and to form the basis for seasonal influenza vaccine compositions.",
          "\"I am proud to say that WHO, through its Global Influenza Programme, has been at the very heart of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System since its creation in 1952.\" - Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of World Health Organization",
          "In 2022, GISRS marks 70 years of countries working together to protect against influenza and other respiratory disease threats, in a model of global collaboration and cooperation. From the start, the GISRS network has been\r\n                    instrumental in detecting and controlling new influenza viruses with pandemic potential.",
          "In 1957, the GISRS network detected the emergence of a new influenza virus in Singapore – distinct from those previously circulating. The network worked swiftly to identify the previously unknown virus subtype – influenza A(H2N2) – and offered materials and knowledge to influenza laboratories around the world to test for the virus and inform vaccine development. The virus spread across countries through trade and transportation routes, and caused the deaths of over a million people worldwide. The 1957-58 pandemic also forged the key role of GISRS in global health crises through the establishment of global disease surveillance, virus identification, and strengthening of and collaboration among national laboratories and sharing critical information for pandemic response.",
          "Although originally conceived to address influenza, GISRS has served as a vital support for countries facing non-influenza respiratory disease emergencies. In addition to the influenza pandemics of 1957, 1968 and 2009, GISRS has coordinated the\r\n            world’s response to episodic human cases of infection with the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus since 1997, the first outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012\r\n            in some countries.",
          "Most recently, GISRS proved to be a pivotal global resource during the COVID-19 pandemic. National Influenza Centres – which collect influenza virus specimens and conduct preliminary analysis – became the primary hubs for testing and analysing\r\n        the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus that causes COVID-19.",
          "Countries leveraged the expertise and infrastructure of their National Influenza Centres to launch an immediate response to the COVID-19 pandemic and engage influenza surveillance systems to detect evolving SARS-CoV-2 viruses. For instance, in January 2020, the National Influenza Centre in Nepal became the first reference laboratory in the country for SARS-CoV-2 testing, making it possible for quick detection, testing and genetic sequencing of SARS-CoV - 2. In addition to expanding the\r\n                        capacities of its laboratory network, the country also integrated the respiratory disease surveillance system to monitor for both influenza and SARS-CoV - 2 viruses concurrently. Even crisis-affected nations were able to adopt existing respiratory disease surveillance and laboratory infrastructure for COVID-19 response. The first COVID-19 sample collected in Afghanistan was at an influenza sentinel site, from where it was shipped to the National\r\n                        Influenza Centre for confirmation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Laboratory technicians prepare respiratory samples for PCR testing for respiratory viruses at the National Influenza Centre, Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut, Lebanon. July 2022.",
          "SARS-CoV - 2 is just the latest example of respiratory viruses that have demonstrated beyond doubt their ability to infect humans and cause widespread outbreaks, and are a reminder of the looming threat of the next potential pandemic. As we celebrate\r\n        the first 70 years of this international collaboration on global health, the world needs GISRS more than ever.",
          "\"GISRS played a critical role in the COVID-19 pandemic and, as such, further concretized its important position in the global surveillance architecture.\" - Dr Sylvie Briand, Director of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention, World Health Organization",
          "There are several ways that the GISRS network supports countries and communities to tackle known and unknown respiratory disease outbreaks.",
          "Influenza virus sharing is an essential cornerstone of preparing the world against pandemics. Virus sharing allows for pandemic risk assessment, the development of candidate vaccine viruses, revising diagnostic reagents and test kits, and surveillance\r\n        for resistance to antiviral medicines.",
          "GISRS laboratories currently share around 20 000 influenza virus samples every year with WHO Collaborating Centres .

          "The GISRS network provides regular updates on the influenza situation through the analysis of laboratory and disease surveillance results reported to the WHO FluNet and FluID systems, respectively. FluNet is a web-based tool that allows National\r\n                Influenza Centres and reference laboratories to share virological data for tracking the movement and spread of viruses globally. The database links with the FluID platform to offer regional influenza epidemiological data to chart global\r\n                influenza trends. In 1997, the first year of its operation, WHO FluNet was notified of 12 000 influenza-positive specimens. By 2016, this figure had reached almost half a million. Between 2014 and 2019, the network tested an average of 3.4 million clinical\r\n                specimens annually. This figure surged to 6.7 million tests for influenza and 44.2 million tests for SARS-CoV-2 performed by National Influenza Centres in 2020 and 2021. Laboratory testing on this enormous scale allows the WHO to conduct risk assessments on the influenza situation and alert countries to the emergence of unusual virus strains. Data from these global platforms are made publicly available to\r\n                health policymakers to make informed decisions on managing influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Another publicly shared database is the GISAID Initiative, first launched in May 2008 as a tool for scientists to safely share influenza genetic sequence data after recognizing the threat of avian influenza viruses to humans. GISAID’s major role in the COVID-19 pandemic was providing a platform for sharing the genetic sequence data for SARS-CoV-2, including the first complete genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within 48 hours of its completion\r\n                through the EpiCoV database.",
          "3. GISRS provides the viruses for seasonal and pandemic vaccine production Influenza viruses evolve and circulate regularly. Members of the GISRS network play a unique and important role in tracking the global circulation and new strains of influenza viruses and all directly contribute to the development of appropriate\r\n            vaccines against seasonal influenza.",
          "Throughout the year, National Influenza Centres share a subset of the viruses they isolate with the WHO Collaborating Centres. These centres perform detailed characterization of the viruses received. The resulting information shared with the WHO\r\n                        and the GISRS network, informs the selection, development, and production of safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccines as well as the key reference reagents that are required for the regulatory approval for their use. Twice a year, the WHO makes recommendations on\r\n virus strains for inclusion in influenza vaccines per hemisphere (North and South) and flu season. Various vaccines are developed, targeting 3 or 4 strains of the virus predicted to be most commonly circulating in the coming flu\r\n                        season.

The WHO, through the PIP Framework,\r\n            brings together industry and other stakeholders and Member States to improve and strengthen the sharing of influenza viruses with human pandemic potential through the GISRS network, and to increase access to vaccines, antivirals, and other\r\n            pandemic-related supplies in developing countries.",
          "The objective of the PIP Framework is to improve pandemic influenza preparedness, response and protection by improving and strengthening GISRS as a fair, transparent, equitable, and effective system that allows all nations to share H5N1 and other influenza viruses with human pandemic potential; and have access to vaccines and other benefits.",
          "This support has helped countries to improve laboratory capacities such as in Togo , where the influenza laboratory at the Institut National d’Hygiene (INH) in Lomo was recognized as a National Influenza Centre in 2021, thanks to the support from GISRS, the PIP Framework and through\r\n            PIP Partnership Contributions. Hence, even as the nation prioritized responding to the COVID-19 pandemic with added demand on laboratory diagnostics, Togo’s influenza surveillance and pandemic preparedness capacities were strengthened\r\n            for the future.",

In addition, many PIP-supported countries were able to authorize COVID-19 vaccines within 15 days of the WHO issuing\r\n            an emergency use listing. Through its work in facilitating the global sharing of viruses and ensuring their detailed characterization, including for vaccine production, GISRS acts as a cornerstone of this landmark international endeavour.",
          "Partnership is the driving force of GISRS as it continues to galvanize collaborations with stakeholders in both the human and animal health sectors.

          "GISRS works with vaccine manufacturers and regulatory agencies every year to ensure that influenza vaccines and the necessary vaccine reagents are updated and available well before the start of each influenza season in a multi-faceted and time-sensitive process. WHO Collaborating Centres and specialized laboratories develop the high-growth candidate viruses needed for vaccine development and production. The WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories produce, calibrate and distribute diagnostic reagents based on antigens\r\n    (for developing antibodies) that are provided by vaccine manufacturers. Through this long-standing public-private partnership, GISRS ensures the timely development and release of vaccines to protect against influenza.",
          "Since its establishment in 1952, the GISRS network has expanded to 127 countries, areas and territories. The network now includes 158 institutions, including 148 National Influenza Centres recognized by the WHO in 124 Member States, seven WHO Collaborating Centres , four Essential Regulatory Laboratories , and 13 H5 Reference Laboratories .",
          "By monitoring and responding to influenza and other respiratory viruses that can cause seasonal epidemics, zoonotic outbreaks, and potential pandemics, GISRS has become an invaluable global public health resource. The GISRS network makes it possible\r\n        to track the global spread of potentially highly dangerous influenza or other respiratory viruses, and of mounting a meaningful response when the first signals of an impending epidemic or pandemic are detected.",
          "GISRS will continue to be at the heart of the WHO’s global influenza strategy which aims to reduce the burden of seasonal influenza, minimize the risk of zoonotic influenza and mitigate the impact of pandemic influenza.

          "In 1957, the GISRS network detected the emergence of a new influenza virus in Singapore – distinct from those previously circulating. The network worked swiftly to identify the previously unknown virus subtype – influenza A(H2N2) – and offered materials and knowledge to influenza laboratories around the world to test for the virus and inform vaccine development. The virus spread across countries through trade and transportation routes, and caused the deaths of over a million people worldwide. The 1957-58 pandemic also forged the key role of GISRS in global health crises through the establishment of global disease surveillance, virus identification, and strengthening of and collaboration among national laboratories and sharing critical information for pandemic response.",
          "Although originally conceived to address influenza, GISRS has served as a vital support for countries facing non-influenza respiratory disease emergencies. In addition to the influenza pandemics of 1957, 1968 and 2009, GISRS has coordinated the\r\n            world’s response to episodic human cases of infection with the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus since 1997, the first outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012\r\n            in some countries.",
          "Most recently, GISRS proved to be a pivotal global resource during the COVID-19 pandemic. National Influenza Centres – which collect influenza virus specimens and conduct preliminary analysis – became the primary hubs for testing and analysing\r\n        the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus that causes COVID-19.",
          "SARS-CoV - 2 is just the latest example of respiratory viruses that have demonstrated beyond doubt their ability to infect humans and cause widespread outbreaks, and are a reminder of the looming threat of the next potential pandemic. As we celebrate\r\n        the first 70 years of this international collaboration on global health, the world needs GISRS more than ever.",

          "Revising national disease surveillance budgets can come with unexpected challenges. One key hurdle is determining how surveillance systems can become more efficient, responsive and cost-effective through the integration of surveillance for different diseases.",
          "A new Planning and Budgeting Tool for Vaccine-Preventable Disease Surveillance in Priority Countries for Polio Transition , and accompanying user guide , developed by WHO’s Polio Transition Programme, aims to fill the gap. Using the tool, countries can more accurately plan and budget the appropriate level of financing required to sustain and strengthen integrated disease surveillance as part of their national health system.",
          "Claudio Politi, project lead, and Health Economist at the World Health Organization, explains, “Our project successfully builds on lessons learned from other costing tools. We set out to determine from colleagues in countries what the current issues were with costing and budgeting, and solve them through the creation of a user-friendly tool.”",
          "The project is one of the 2020 – 21 WHO Technical Products. Carried out under the umbrella of the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Partnership, which aims to build country capacity for health, the tool allows countries to identify the critical cost components of their surveillance systems and ensure the integration of these costs into their national budgets and strategic plans for polio transition and surveillance. The outputs resulting from the tool allow countries to advocate for the correct levels of domestic and external funding for integrated disease surveillance.",
          "Politi explains, “Polio transition refers to sustaining and repurposing the network and infrastructure set up to eradicate polio to strengthen broader health priorities, especially essential immunization, disease detection, and emergency preparedness and response. Surveillance is a particularly important aspect of transition, as it is vital to ensure that the surveillance systems developed by the polio programme are sustained in the long-term to detect polio as well as other vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs).”",
          "David Sulaberidze, an expert on public health financing, who supported the development of the tool and its piloting in countries, said, “Using our tool, countries can accurately document surveillance costs across the health system, and recognize opportunities to integrate activities, for instance across diseases, in order to achieve cost efficiencies.”",
          "“This is critically important to enable countries to effectively plan to strengthen the surveillance system in the long-term. The tool outputs also provide surveillance teams with the information they need to advocate for the timely allocation of budgets, to ensure the financial sustainability of the system.”",
          "To ensure the tool and user guide were fit for country needs, the team undertook piloting in 2021 with surveillance experts in Sudan and Karnataka State, India. In both locations, the tool was successful in assisting budget officers to create a more accurate and comprehensive integrated surveillance budget.",
          "Arun Kumar, National Professional Officer (Vaccine Preventable Disease Surveillance) WHO India, who participated in the piloting, explained, “Output from the tool allows for crucial comparisons of key budgetary information.”",
          "“Using the tool, we were able to clearly see the different budgetary lines necessary for effective surveillance. This is really helpful for our future planning purposes.”",
          "Naglaa Ahmed, WHO EMRO Polio Transition Focal Point, noted, “The methodology and tools can be widely applicable for polio transition countries, as well as countries aiming to integrate surveillance functions and move towards domestic financing. We are excited to look at the wider application of the tool in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.”",
          "Commenting on the tool, Ebru Ekeman, WHO Policy Lead for Polio Transition explained, “This is a strong example of transition in action – providing countries with the tools needed to ensure that vital assets are sustained in the long term, and are used in the most effective way to deliver stronger health systems and protect global health security.”",
          "“In particular, we have strived to align the tool with global and regional agendas for surveillance, such as the Investment case for vaccine-preventable diseases surveillance in the African Region 2020-2030 and the Strategy for Integrated Disease Surveillance in the Eastern Mediterranean Region , as well as the Immunization Agenda 2030 . We hope that the methodology, tool and user guide will be helpful for countries as they look to recover from the pandemic and bolster their surveillance systems.”",
          "For further information on the methodology and tool, contact Claudio Politi, politic@who.int."

          "In 2020 the global key population networks – including the International Network of People Who Use Drugs (INPUD), the Global Action for Trans Equality (GATE), the Network of Sex Worker Projects (NSWP) and the Global Action for Gay Men’s\r\n    Health Rights (MPACT) – were commissioned by WHO to conduct values and preferences research within their communities in relation to HIV, viral hepatitis and STI services. This research has been used to inform the development of the new\r\n    WHO Consolidated guidelines on HIV, viral hepatitis and STI prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations , launched on 29 July 2022 at AIDS2022 in Montreal, Canada.",
          "To celebrate the launch of these important guidelines for improving the health and rights of the key populations  in relation to HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs, INPUD reached out to several study participants from the community of people who use drugs\r\n    and asked them to briefly reflect on why the key populations values and preferences research is important and what the new guidelines mean in the context of their lives. Here are extracts of their responses:",
          "Why is it important to include the values and preferences of key populations living with and affected by HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs in the development of the WHO Key Populations Guidelines?",
          "“For people from marginalized and criminalized communities it often feels like no one’s really listening to the knowledge we have to offer. Involving key populations in the development of the guidelines was critical to ensuring that lived\r\n    and living experience was embedded within the guidelines – not just being asked to make some comments after the guidelines are already developed. That happens way too often and it is tokenistic.”",
          "“Involving the community is important for lots of reasons, including that peers are best placed to detect and identify stigma and discrimination. By making sure that the language of the guidelines is stigma-free and non-discriminatory, it establishes\r\n    the standard we expect from health professionals using the guidelines and providing services. It is a practical way to show why our community must be at the heart of these kinds of processes.”",
          "“Peers are clued into the real world settings of living with or being at risk of HIV, viral hep and STIs, where the clinical meets the real world. We will not achieve the elimination of HIV and viral hepatitis without the valuable perspective, insights,\r\n    and expertise of peers.”",
          "Workshop and training for key populations, Kenya, 2022 (© INPUD)",
          "Do WHO Key Population Guidelines such as these make a tangible difference in the lives of people living with and affected by HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs, including people who inject drugs?",
          "“As a trans person who injects drugs and is living with HIV, I feel empowered through the consultation process to inform the guidelines. I was able to contribute to the global response to HIV, viral hep, and STIs with something much bigger than\r\n    myself and my work at the community level.”",
          "“We are always talking about ways we can use policies and guidelines like these for our advocacy on behalf of people who use drugs. For example, we can use them to demand better services or human rights, but we can also use them to check against\r\n    current guidelines, services and programmes and advocate for improvements.”",
          "“Sometimes documents like these can seem far from our everyday lives as people who inject drugs, but if those providing harm reduction and other health services to people who inject drugs are aware of the guidelines and use them, it can really change\r\n    the way we experience those services by removing some of the barriers.”",
          "The 2016 WHO Consolidated Guidelines focused on HIV, the revised Guidelines will focus on HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs among key populations. Was this shift important in your view?",
          "“The shift beyond HIV to include viral hepatitis and STIs brings a more holistic perspective of the interactions between belonging to priority populations and various risk factors – HIV doesn't operate in a vacuum.”",
          "“A lot can be shared and learnt by collaborating across infectious diseases – at government, community, research, and clinical levels. Issues of human rights, criminalization, stigma, and discrimination all impact HIV, viral hepatitis and\r\n    STIs. The experience of stigma is a shared experience across the priority communities.”",
          "“Many of us are affected by multiple conditions and experiences and there are so many intersectionalities, as a queer woman of colour who injects drugs, it just makes sense to bring a wider lens to these issues rather than trying to put people\r\n    into narrow boxes.”",
          "What can be done to make people who inject drugs globally more aware of the new Key Population Guidelines?",
          "“Well, community conversations are always a good place to start.”",
          "“People who inject drugs are highly networked. It's important to consistently and constantly remind people who inject drugs about their inherent worth; we are beautiful human beings that deserve to be loved, have our human rights upheld, and be\r\n    treated with respect, understanding, and compassion. The guidelines support these key messages.”",

          "It was Helio Pereira and Bella Tumova who introduced me to GISN (Global Influenza Surveillance Network), the predecessor of GISRS. Helio had a huge collection of influenza viruses from lower animals and birds, and Bela had prepared rat antisera to the H2N2 pandemic virus. I asked Helio if I could come to the World Influenza Center at Mill Hill in 1966 to determine if any of these viruses might be related to the H2N2 pandemic.",
          "Working at Mill Hill we found that an influenza virus isolated from turkeys in Massachusetts in 1965 was serologically closely related to the 1957 pandemic H2N2 virus and shared the N2 neuraminidase. This finding provided some of the first information indicating the possible origin of genomic segments of pandemic influenza viruses of humans.",

          "Knowing that influenza had killed terns in South Africa in 1961, while walking on an Australian Beach with Graeme Laver in the late 1960s littered with dead muttonbirds ( Puffinus pacificus ), we jokingly postulated that they had died of flu. After returning to the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra we approached the head of the microbiology department with a proposal to sample the mutton birds on the Great Barrier Reef islands, where the birds nested and raised their young. The immediate response was “You have got to be joking... a scientific expedition my foot! More like a junket to take your family and friends on a holiday on the Great Barrier Reef!” The chairman was largely correct, but we did not give up trying to find support.",
          "We sent the proposal to Martin Kaplan at WHO, who was part of the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN-the predecessor of today’s GISRS) and a proponent of animal reservoirs of influenza viruses. We were delighted to receive a positive response and support of $500 for the proposal. The Australian National University decided that there was a scientific aspect to the proposal and provided a station wagon for traveling the 1,500 kilometers from Canberra to Gladstone, the nearest port in Queensland to the Great Barrier Reef Islands.",

It was then necessary to go back the next year to try to isolate the viruses. Once we had shown that the site of replication of avian Influenza viruses was the intestinal tract of birds, we realized that we had been sampling the wrong end of the bird. After much research we isolated multiple influenza viruses.",
          "Subsequent surveillance studies at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis Tennessee of samples collected from Canadian wild ducks and migratory shorebirds from Delaware Bay (ruddy turnstone, red knot) revealed that all known influenza A viruses (at the time)  including several new subtypes could be isolated from wild aquatic birds, supporting the notion that these birds are a natural reservoir of influenza viruses.",
          "The discovery of the natural reservoirs of influenza viruses in wild aquatic birds resulted from the wisdom and support of GISN and WHO. It is probable that the reservoir of influenza A viruses could have been elucidated eventually, but it was GISN, the predecessor of GISRS that “primed the pump” and supported surveillance in migratory waterfowl.",

When the National Institutes of Health of the United States of America issued a request to “elucidate the origin of pandemic influenza viruses” I established a collaboration with Professor Kennedy Shortridge in Hong Kong to survey the live bird markets. Shortridge isolated the viruses, and we identified all known subtypes of influenza A viruses and additional new subtypes mainly from the ducks in the markets. When a child in Hong Kong died of infection with an avian H5N1 virus in May 1997 we knew exactly where to find the virus.",

          "In sub-Saharan Africa, preventing and treating breast cancer is a pressing public health issue. Breast cancer survival rates five years after diagnosis stand at a dismal 40% in sub-Saharan Africa – as compared to over 90% in most high-income countries.",
          "In countries showing successful reductions in breast cancer mortality rates, most breast cancer patients are diagnosed at an early stage, when the disease is more likely curable. In sub-Saharan Africa, late-stage diagnosis and inadequate access to quality\r\n    breast cancer care lead to high death rates. Most women are diagnosed at advanced stages when treatment is difficult, costly and less likely to achieve a cure."

          "Illustrating the many barriers to accessing quality breast cancer treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, Dr Miriam Mutebi, a breast surgical oncologist in Nairobi reports, “A few years back, a patient of mine was diagnosed with breast cancer and had begun\r\n    her chemotherapy treatment, when she suddenly disappeared. She came back to me after six months overjoyed that she had finally saved up enough money for the remaining treatment. The local National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) has helped considerably\r\n    to increase the number of patients completing care, but more needs to be done to provide comprehensive coverage.” Paying out of pocket to access care routinely results in catastrophic health costs and financial hardship for families – leading\r\n    to treatment delays that make treatment less effective.",
          "Socio-cultural barriers further limit access to cancer treatment in sub-Saharan Africa: Women often lack agency to seek healthcare on their own. This situation is worsened by cancer myths and widespread stigma. “A number of  cancer patients\r\n    are abandoned by their partners or families after receiving a cancer diagnosis because of stigma,” said Dr Mutebi. “Cancers related to a woman’s reproductive system are often erroneously linked to sexual promiscuity or equated with\r\n    failure to fulfil one’s role as a caregiver – resulting in abandonment.”  These misconceptions amplify the socio-cultural barriers that deter women from cancer screening or completing their treatment once diagnosed.",
          "The WHO Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI) strives to address barriers in early cancer diagnosis through its first pillar: health promotion and early detection. This first pillar in the initiative’s three-pronged approach aims to reduce stigma\r\n    associated with breast health and improve public awareness of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer."

        "heading": "Closing the gap between diagnosis and treatment",
        "content": [
          "The initiative’s second pillar is to ensure timely diagnosis. Dr Mutebi explains how health provider diagnostic delays promote late-stage diagnosis: “a patient of mine, who also happened to be HIV-positive, came to me with stage four breast\r\n    cancer. She had been attending an external facility for anti-retroviral treatment for eight years with monthly visits to the institution and yet no one had ever discussed with her or screened her for breast or even cervical cancer for which she was\r\n    at higher risk.” Health provider delays contribute to poor prognoses for women with breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa.",
          "To ensure timely referrals for diagnosis, health workers must be trained to identify the signs and symptoms of early breast cancer. Dr Mutebi reports, “data shows that many patients in sub-Saharan Africa will on average see three or four health\r\n    providers, before receiving a definitive cancer diagnosis”. She shares another example of a patient: “a lactating mother was treated with antibiotics for months on end, for a worsening lump labelled as an ‘unresolving mastitis’,\r\n    while being falsely reassured that since she was breastfeeding, it  was nothing to worry about!” By the time the patient reached Dr Mutebi’s team, the tumour had progressed considerably.",
          "Every patient who visits a clinic provides an opportunity to engage in prevention education and timely interventions for cancer management. GBCI strives to minimize delays between the time a breast cancer patient first interacts with the health system\r\n    and when treatment starts. Through the initiative, countries will receive an evidence-based technical package that incorporates existing WHO cancer tools and products to strengthen health systems."

        "heading": "Employing a multidisciplinary approach to cancer care",
        "content": [
          "Relaying the importance of GBCI’s third pillar – comprehensive breast cancer management – Dr Mutebi shares how the kind of care patients received might depend on the type of clinician they first encounter: “If you saw a surgeon first,\r\n    you would blink twice and find yourself in the operating theatre. If you saw the oncologist, you were likely to receive chemotherapy first”.",
          "Cancer treatment requires the collaboration of multiple specialities to provide surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the correct sequence, as well as rehabilitation for women after treatment with palliative services to reduce pain and discomfort.",
          "Fortunately, Dr Mutebi sees growing recognition in the region regarding the need for multidisciplinary approaches to cancer management based on the concept of “personalised care where treatment is tailored to each patient”. There has been\r\n    an encouraging increase in the number of countries with national cancer control programs in SSA, that emphasize these important pillars of breast cancer care. More in-country investment in systems and health workforce is still needed to improve access\r\n    to these services for our patients.",
          "WHO supports governments to provide centralized services for breast cancer with the aim of ensuring that 80% of breast cancer patients undergo full-course multimodality treatment. Through GBCI’s three pillars – health promotion and early detection,\r\n    timely diagnosis, and comprehensive breast cancer management – WHO aims to reduce global breast cancer mortality by 2.5% per year by 2040."

The HRP Alliance hubs work with other institutions in low- and middle-income countries, to strengthen research capacity. Through mentoring, research education\r\n    and courses the HRP Alliance hubs promote institutions to take lead in SRHR research. Research education includes masters and doctoral training provided to international students from the larger HRP Alliance network. Courses focus on specific research\r\n    methods, dissemination of results, and knowledge translation. Participants include a wide range of individuals, from Ministry of Health to academia to ensure that strong, national evidence emerges and influences the implementation of sound public\r\n    health policy.",

We provide mentorship support to early career female scientists and we aim for HRP Alliance to also support scientists to continue their research after a PhD.  Combatting prevailing gender inequalities that too often reduce the career possibilities for women researchers is a priority ,”\r\n said Anna Thorson, Unit Head Research Leadership and Capacity Strengthening for SRHR at WHO/HRP.",
          "“ My colleagues and I are proud of what we have accomplished as women scientists and this has been a great opportunity, but it has come with a lot of sacrifice ,” Compaoré said. “ Looking ahead, I want to climb the professional ladder in SRHR, both in the sub-region and international level. There are not a lot women in positions of leadership, but we need this .”"

          "A new digital mental health intervention, Step-by-Step, developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) with the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) at the Ministry of Public Health Lebanon and other partners, was effective in reducing depression among Syrian refugees in Lebanon, according to a study published in PLOS Medicine .",
          "The study, a randomized controlled trial, supported by Elrha’s Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC), was conducted among Syrians suffering from depression and impaired functioning in Lebanon. It found that people who received the digital intervention with remote guidance from trained non-specialist helpers were significantly less depressed and had significantly better functioning after the intervention compared with those who received enhanced usual care in the control group. People who received Step-by-Step also showed improvements in symptoms of anxiety, post-traumatic stress, well-being and personal problems, with all improvements maintained at 3-month follow-up. This study supports results from a parallel trial of Step-by-Step with Lebanese and other populations living in Lebanon, which showed similar positive results.",
          "All of the 569 Syrian adults enrolled in the trial, which was completed in December 2020, were from Syria. The average age of participants was 31.5. The majority (58.3%) were women, and the majority were married (70.1%). Most had primary (32.0%) or secondary education (36.7%), and the majority were unemployed (58.7%). Half of the participants received the guided WHO Step-by-Step intervention provided as a hybrid app for iOS, Android, and web browsers, and half received Enhanced Care as Usual alone (consisting of basic psychoeducation and referral to evidence based care).",
          "A format delivered by trained non-specialist helpers in a digital setting",
          "Step-by-Step is a 5-session WHO digital intervention designed to treat depression through an internet-connected device, with weekly support (e.g. a 15 minute call or message) from trained non-specialist helpers. It provides psychoeducation and training in behavioural activation (e.g. doing more pleasant activities) through an illustrated narrative, with additional therapeutic techniques such as stress management, a gratitude exercise, positive self-talk, strengthening social support, and relapse prevention.",
          "Step-by-Step includes 5 illustrated story sessions with audio recordings of the text to support accessibility. Each session is divided into 3 smaller parts, which on average take a total of 20 minutes to complete. Every session unlocks after 4 days of completing the previous session to give enough time for the person to practice the skills and exercises they learned in the previous session. Users are recommended to complete 1 session (with all its 3 parts) per week.",
          "Potential for scale-up to other displaced populations with digital access",
          "Given the effect observed in the study on depression, functional impairment, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, subjective well-being, and self-identified problems, and that Step-by-Step can be provided by trained non-specialist helpers to communities of displaced populations that have digital access, the trial results suggest that the intervention can be part of an effective strategy to improve mental health among other displaced populations with digital access. Lebanon’s National Mental Health Programme aims to scale up mental health care in line with the National Mental Health Strategy but resources are limited. Based on these results and results of a parallel trial conducted with Lebanese and other populations living in Lebanon, Lebanon’s National Mental Health Programme have scaled up the intervention nationally so that it is accessible to all adults in the country.",
          "Substantial need for mental health support among refugee populations",
          "The number of forcibly displaced persons reached 89.3 million at the end of 2021 and is estimated to have further increased to more than 100 million , because of recent global events.",
          "The war in Syria has involved almost 6.8 million refugees. Lebanon, with a total population of close to 7 million, currently hosts about 840,900 displaced Syrians. After fleeing for safety, displaced people experience continuing difficulties, including unmet basic needs, language barriers, uncertainty about the future, social isolation, and discrimination. As a result, they are at risk of mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress.",
          "It has been estimated that 22% of displaced, war-affected Syrians in Lebanon suffer from moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Although depression and other common mental disorders are a leading cause of disability, the vast majority of displaced people do not receive treatment. This is especially true in low- and middle-income countries where only 1 in 27 people with depression are likely to receive evidence-based treatments and where less than 1 per 1000 displaced people seeks help from health services for common mental disorders. This study suggests that Step-by-Step can make a considerable contribution to addressing this treatment gap.",

The team also visited one of Baghdad's primary health care centres to witness first-hand the performance of immunization and other essential health services.",

As a result, all the lowest administrative units comprise PHC facilities, which\r\n    are fully funded by the State. Prevention, control and treatment of communicable and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are covered under the essential service package by PHC providers, regardless of the health insurance status of the user.",
          "Drawing on the country’s well-developed fiber optic connections and relatively high use of internet technology, the government started an initiative on “Expanding the use of mobile health technology at PHC towards UHC” in 2016 to reach\r\n    remote populations. This initiative is supported by WHO through the Universal Health Coverage Partnership and the Korea Foundation for International Health Care and Community Chest of Korea. It aims to serve hard-to-reach populations through improved\r\n    access to and quality of people-centred PHC services. Mobile health services have also expanded from 22 PHC centres in 2016 to 302 (56% of all PHC centres) in 2021.",

People living in remote, rural areas have benefitted from mobile health services accompanied by home visits, resulting in early detection and treatment.

New mobile health technology enables better screening of potential TB cases\r\n    to ensure early access to treatment. This is complemented by home-based DOT to ensure that a trained health care worker provides the prescribed TB drugs and follows the treatment of a patient, which has significantly improved continuity of treatment.\r\n    In 2021, with support from the Global Fund, 51% of TB patients were treated at TB dispensaries, 25% at facility and soum health centres, and 23% through home visits.

          "Despite mental health’s critical importance to our health and well-being, too many of us do not get the support we need. In 2019, an estimated one in eight people globally were living with a mental disorder. At the same time, the services, skills and funding available for mental health remain in short supply, and fall far below what is needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries.",
          "Several factors stop people from seeking help for mental health conditions, including poor quality of services, low levels of health literacy in mental health, and stigma and discrimination. In many places, formal mental health services do not exist. Even when they are available, they are often inaccessible or unaffordable. People will often choose to suffer mental distress without relief rather than risk the discrimination and ostracization that comes with accessing mental health services.",
          "High prices and harassment",
          "For Amira Ali Al-Jamal in Jordan, it was a combination of all these factors that prevented her from accessing support. “My experience with postpartum depression was severe and painful. I suffered for a long time and thought the solution might lie in psychotherapy but the term \"mental health\" was not used much in Jordan,” she says. “I was worried about being stigmatized,” she adds.",
          "Amira decided to visit a private mental health clinic but she wore the niqab, so that no one who knew her would see her. “Here I found another type of suffering,” she says. “High prices and harassment meant I couldn’t afford the care I needed and experienced relapses and setbacks. Eventually I decided to go a government mental health clinic but even here there were violations of human rights. We were all suffering but no one dared to speak. Recovery was slow.”",
          "Integrating care to improve access",
          "For most common conditions, integrated care by primary care staff trained in mental health can be preferable to specialist care because it helps to increase access and reduce stigma . It is also feasible, affordable and cost–effective, including in low- and middle-income countries. And it has been shown to deliver better health outcomes compared with usual primary health care.",
          "“When mental health care was integrated into a local clinic, I was one of the first people to get it,” remembers Amira. “A multi-speciality team gave me psychological treatment and community rehabilitation to support me to become an active member of the community.”",
          "Integrated care by non-specialists, including in primary care, forms the basis for WHO’s mhGAP roll out, which is being implemented to strengthen skills and scale up mental health care for priority conditions all over the world. Studies show this approve improves knowledge, attitudes and confidence among primary care providers; and leads to improved symptoms and engagement with care for people living with mental health conditions. It has also been shown to help reduce the treatment gap and increase effective coverage for priority mental health conditions.",
          "For service users, gaining access to integrated care can be life-changing. Amira remembers how it opened the door to 15 years of advocacy and action for her. “The clinic specialists believed in our abilities and we were invited by WHO to a workshop on human rights. I got to know a group of people with psychological disabilities like me who were stigmatized by society and we decided to establish an association. Our Step supports the rights of people with mental health issues to be included in the community. We have achieved a lot, including helping to produce Jordan's first national mental health strategy in 11 years.”",
          "Integrating mental health into primary care is a key strategy for advancing universal health coverage. Integrated services are also a critical component of the community-based mental health care advocated by WHO as an alternative to the institutional care that dominates so many mental health systems."

          "Workplaces can be places of both opportunity and risk for mental health. On the one hand, workplaces that promote good mental health and reduce work stress not only enhance mental and physical health but are also likely to reduce absenteeism, improve\r\n    work performance and productivity, boost staff morale and motivation, and minimize tension and conflict between colleagues. So action to protect and promote mental health in the workplace can be cost–effective.",
          "On the other hand, unemployment, discrimination in accessing or carrying out work, and poor working conditions can all be a source of excessive stress, heightening the risk of developing new mental health conditions or exacerbating existing ones. Such\r\n    negative working environments and experiences are the very opposite of what is needed for staff to do their work.",
          "A toxic work environment",
          "“I loved my work but I grew to hate it as I was working in a toxic environment,” says Larry White in Canada. “A lengthy and unpleasant matter at work was sending my mind reeling into panic attacks, anxiety, and depression. My doctor\r\n    said I had moderate to severe depression. I was unable to function at work for days [at a time].”",
          "Risks to mental health at work may be related to the nature of the work undertaken, the physical, social or cultural characteristics of the workplace, or opportunities for career development, among other things. High job demands, low job control, job\r\n    insecurity, low relational and procedural justice, bullying and low social support in the workplace are associated with a greater likelihood of developing mental health\r\n    problems.",
          "“Organisational changes made in my absence meant I started to dread my weekly work meetings,” explains Larry. “I felt like a target. My normal duties were being eroded and the authority of my role was diminished without any consultation,”\r\n    he says. “It made me ill just thinking about it. I felt like a target.”",
          "Employers and governments have a responsibility to promote and protect all people’s mental health at work. Yet work-related promotion and prevention programmes for mental health were among the least frequently reported by countries (35%) in the Mental health atlas 2020 . When Larry reached out to his professional association and human resources for help, no action was taken to support him.",
          "Exasperated, feeling cornered, and unable to function, Larry resigned. “Following my resignation my personal feelings blazed chaotically between mental anguish, lack of control, isolation, fear, sorrow, intimidation, disbelief, frustration, disappointment,\r\n    extreme worry, anger and, periodically, relief,” says Larry.",
          "Loss of employment is a known risk factor for mental health problems and suicide attempts. But so too are poor working conditions. It can be a hard choice to make. “The\r\n    happiness, optimism, and trust in others that used to define me are still mostly absent,” says Larry. But he has no regrets. “I chose to put my personal sanity and mental health first. In the end, I learnt a great deal about myself and\r\n    what is important to me. This opportunity for self-reflection is the unseen benefit.”",
          "Promoting and protecting mental health at work",
          "At national and international levels, a diverse range of employment laws and regulations can be used to establish an enabling environment for protecting workers’ mental health. This includes regulations on occupational safety and health, violence\r\n    and harassment as well as laws and policies on minimum wage, equality, health, safety, parental leave and flexible working.",

          "One of the biggest global crises in generations, the COVID-19 pandemic has had severe and far-reaching repercussions for health systems, economies and societies. Countless people have died, or lost their livelihoods. Families and communities have been strained and separated. Children and young people have missed out on learning and socializing. Businesses have gone bankrupt. Millions people have fallen below the poverty line.",
          "As people grapple with these health, social and economic impacts, mental health has been widely affected. Plenty of us became more anxious; but for some COVID-19 has sparked or amplified much more serious mental health problems. A great number of people have reported psychological distress and symptoms of depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress. And there have been worrying signs of more widespread suicidal thoughts and behaviours, including among health care workers.",
          "Some groups of people have been affected much more than others. Faced with extended school and university closures young people have been left vulnerable to social isolation and disconnectedness which can fuel feelings of anxiety, uncertainty and loneliness and lead to affective and behavioural problems. For some children and adolescents being made to stay at home may have increased the risk of family stress or abuse, which are risk factors for mental health problems. Women have similarly faced greater stress in homes, with one rapid assessment reporting that 45% of women had experienced some form of violence, either directly or indirectly during the first year of the pandemic.",
          "While mental health needs have risen, mental health services have been severely disrupted. This was especially true early on in the pandemic when staff and infrastructure were often redeployed to COVID-19 relief. Social measures also prevented people from accessing care at that time. And in many cases, poor knowledge and misinformation about the virus fuelled fears and worries that stopped people from seeking help.",
          "Fear factor",
          "Esenam Abra Drah lives with bipolar disorder in Ghana, where fear of the virus has been an unprecedented stressor to the mental health of many individuals. “I have many friends who had relapses in their mental health because of the increased levels of fear and panic,” says Esenam. “It was almost as if fear was contagious.”",
          "Esenam explains that most people are afraid to seek help because they think that if they visit the hospital, they might end up getting infected with COVID-19. “I myself did not go to the clinic for therapy for an entire year partly because of this fear,” she says.",
          "At that time Esenam, like so many others, was unemployed and did not have the funds for treatment. Even before the pandemic, cost of care was known to be a major barrier to people with mental health conditions seeking help.",
          "“I have been privileged to have a good system of support,” says Esenam. “My pensioner parents managed to make sure my medications were always refilled.”",
          "“But it is not the same for others,” she adds. “Some people could not afford treatment. It was and still is a very difficult time for a lot of people.”",
          "Recommendations for response",
          "Since the start of the pandemic, mental health service providers have tried to mitigate service disruptions, for example by delivering care via alternative routes when public health and social measures were in place. Community-based initiatives were often faster to adapt, finding innovative ways to provide psychosocial support, including through digital technologies and informal supports. And international organizations have also provided guidance, tools and resources to help responders, public health planners and the general public.",

          "Being able to make decisions about one’s life – including the right to choose one’s own mental.",
          "Health care – is key to a person’s autonomy and personhood.",
          "The United Nation’s Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) commits countries to recognizing that people with mental health conditions enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with everyone else. And yet involuntary hospital admissions, and care against the wishes of someone experiencing a mental health condition, are routinely and widely practiced across the world. This coercion is facilitated by laws and practices that give guardians of people with mental health conditions extensive substitute decision-making powers.",
          "Voices of experience",
          "Through substitute decision-making, people experiencing mental health conditions lose their rights to informed consent, confidentiality, privacy and communication with family members. Frequently, people end up in institutions and exposed to seclusion or restraint.",
          "People subjected to care without their agreement report feeling dehumanized, often with long-term effects on their mental well-being. Coercive practices undermine people’s confidence and trust in mental health services and can stop people from seeking help when they need it.",
          "Involuntary treatment can also amplify existing conditions. Alexandra M Schuster from the United Kingdom was diagnosed with a mental illness when she was seven. “Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I had no say in my own recovery: my own ideas of what would work well for me were often dismissed,” says Alexandra. “This lack of autonomy eroded my already-low self-esteem and worsened my mental illness.”",
          "By the age of nineteen, Alexandra says she was a shell of an individual. “Years of being forced into specific care pathways and bubble-wrapped by caring adults had shattered my confidence. I barely believed I was capable of making basic decisions, let alone helping myself.”",
          "Positive partnerships for care",
          "Respecting people’s autonomy can be challenging but it good practices around the world show that is it possible, especially by involving people in their own health care planning, assessment and management, for example through shared decision-making, advanced planning, supported self-management and person-centred recovery approaches to care.",
          "Empowering people to have control over their life and mental health care instils personal dignity, value and respect. It can increase self-esteem and confidence. It also gives people a level of choice and autonomy they may not have received otherwise.",
          "“Receiving autonomy over my mental health care was the greatest contributor to my recovery,” says Alexandra. “My current therapist sees me as a person rather than a mental illness. [When I first met her], she asked me about interests, wanted to know my work style, and was eager to work together to construct a pathway to mental well-being.”",
          "Meaningful engagement of people with lived experience builds trust and understanding among those providing and receiving care. The potential result is better therapeutic relationships and more equal and effective partnerships of care. Individuals and health care providers can work together to map out the options for care and select those that are most appropriate and acceptable.",
          "“We started small,” remembers Alexandra, “but with [my therapist’s] guidance, I gradually gained the confidence to make complex decisions about my health and well-being. Her willingness to collaborate with me, create care plans that suited me as an individual, while still giving me the space to make autonomous decisions, helped me build the confidence to thrive not only mentally, but in all other areas of my life. To this day, I attribute my recovery to her collaborative nature.”",
          "Moving from care that ignores people’s perspectives, priorities and human rights towards person-centred, human rights-based and recovery-oriented care that engages people as active participants in, rather than passive recipients of, care is one of the twelve key shifts needed to transform mental health for all."

          "Stigma, which is pervasive in the general population and in the health sector, is a major barrier to improved mental health services and self-care . It is present in homes, schools, workplaces, communities and even within the mental health care system itself. People will often choose to suffer mental distress without relief, rather than risk the discrimination and ostracization that comes with accessing mental health services. Stigma among primary care providers likely contributes to low rates of detection of mental health conditions in primary care.",
          "Stigma leads to social isolation and discrimination, which impacts a person’s ability to earn an income, have a voice, gain access to quality care, be part of their community and recover from their mental health condition. Around the world, people living with mental health conditions are frequently excluded from community life and denied basic rights. They are also discriminated against in the fields of employment, education and housing. In all cases, stigma and discrimination can adversely impact mental health and hinder people’s recovery.",
          "Suffering through stigma",
          "Angelica lives with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in Zimbabwe. She explains that there are very few psychiatrists in her country and that conditions like OCD are largely ignored. “For years I thought that maybe I was bewitched, or cursed, or possessed by evil spirits,” she says. “I had to go through this alone, because of fear of stigmatization. I could not even tell my husband. I was scared my loved ones would desert me. My church could not help. No priest understood what I was going through. There were no support groups in the whole country.”",
          "Angelica’s experience is all too common. “For the longest time I was afraid of speaking about my battle with mental health because of the stigma attached to it,” says Odireleng Kasale in Botswana. “The single-sided story of bipolar disorder in my community focused only on the struggles it caused, rather than how to overcome them. I was afraid, lonely and didn’t believe that healing was possible.”",
          "For others, like Lion Gai Meir in Israel, the stigma comes from health professionals rather than the community. “I’ve used various rehabilitation services over the years. and I have encountered ignorance and stigma. Some services were just unhelpful to me. Some actively harmed my recovery journey,” she says. “I’ll never forget the nurse in the psychiatric ward who chased me around when she caught me doing yoga in my room. It took me ten years to start doing yoga again,” adds Lion.",
          "Peer-led change",
          "Shifting attitudes and tackling stigma is not easy. But experience shows it is possible. Large-scale awareness campaigns can create positive changes in public attitudes. And approaches based on social contact with people with mental health conditions are known to be particularly effective .",
          "People with lived experience, including in peer-led organizations, can be important agents of change. Odireleng became a mental health advocate as part of her recovery. “I made a pledge to myself to use the lessons I’d learned to help others. I am passionate about encouraging people to begin their healing by overcoming stigma and speaking up openly about their mental health condition,” she says.",
          "Angelica similarly uses her lived experience to help others. She runs a support group through a nongovernmental organization that she set up in 2018. “We used to meet face-to-face once a month before COVID-19; now we meet online,” she says. “I also give talks on the radio and at local events. Our work has been featured in newspapers and magazines,” she adds.",
          "Better quality care",
          "Anti-stigma strategies can also be targeted at health workers and are an important component of efforts to improve the quality of care for people with mental health conditions. WHO’s QualityRights initiative for example develops and deploys training materials, toolkits, technical support and practical guidance to help combat stigma and discrimination and promote inclusion and recovery.",
          "For Lion, promoting person-centred services and practices that support recovery is important. “The difficult experiences I’ve been through and the ignorance I’ve encountered have also led me to lecture in therapeutic circles,” she says. “At first I was begging to be heard,” she adds “but slowly I have been invited to give more and more paid lectures. The need had probably existed for a long time. The therapists’ desire to learn and improve the existing therapeutic services fill me with hope.”",

          "On 3 November 2021, the Technical Advisory Group for Emergency Use Listing listed the Bharat Biotech BBV152 COVAXIN vaccine against COVID-19 for emergency use. The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has issued interim policy recommendations for the use of the Bharat Biotech BBV152 COVAXIN vaccine. This article provides a summary of those interim recommendations.",
          "Who can take this vaccine?",
          "The vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals aged 18 and above. In line with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap and the WHO Values Framework , older adults, health workers and immunocompromised persons should be prioritised.",
          "This vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.",
          "Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?",
          "Given the adverse consequences of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy, WHO recommends the use of BBV152 in pregnant individuals when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant person outweigh the potential risks. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.",
          "WHO recommends the same use of BBV152 vaccine in breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women. Data are not available on the potential benefits or possible risks of the BBV152 vaccine to breastfed children. However, as BBV152 vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, it is biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.",
          "Who is the vaccine not recommended for?",
          "The vaccine is not recommended for people younger than 18 years of age. Safety and immunogenicity data for under-18s are currently being generated but until such data are available, vaccination of individuals in this age group is not recommended.",
          "Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine should not take it.",
          "Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19 should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for ending isolation have been met.",
          "Anyone with a body temperature over 38.5°C should postpone vaccination until they no longer have a fever.",
          "Is it safe?",
          "SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on safety and efficacy of\r\n    the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and above.  The\r\n    WHO EUL process also evaluates the quality of manufacturing along with safety\r\n    and efficacy.",
          "Safety data is currently limited for persons above 60 years of\r\n    age (due to the small number of participants of this age group in clinical\r\n    trials). However, the trial data indicate that the vaccine has an acceptable\r\n    safety profile for this age group and WHO recommends the vaccine for use in\r\n    persons aged 60 years and over.",
          "BBV152 has been licensed for use in 23 countries globally;\r\n    however roll-out has been limited mostly to India where over 77 million doses\r\n    have been distributed and used. Vaccine effectiveness studies are being\r\n    conducted in India, and results will be available in the coming months.",
          "How efficacious is the vaccine?",
          "Vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 of any severity, 14 or more\r\n    days post dose 2, was 78%. Vaccine efficacy against severe disease is 93%. In\r\n    adults aged less than 60 years, efficacy was 79%; and in those aged 60 years\r\n    and over it was 68%.",
          "What is the recommended dosage?",
          "SAGE recommends the use of BBV152 vaccine as 2 doses (0.5 ml) given intramuscularly. The vaccine can be administered with an interval of 4 weeks. It is recommended that all vaccinated individuals receive two doses.",
          "If the second dose is inadvertently administered less than 4 weeks after the first, the dose does not need to be repeated. If administration of the second dose is delayed beyond 4 weeks, it should be given at the earliest possible opportunity.",
          "SAGE recommends that severe and moderately immunocompromised persons should be offered an additional dose of vaccine. This is due to the fact that this group is less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccination series and are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease.",
          "Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?",
          "A booster dose may be offered 4-6 months after completing the\r\n    primary series for the highest-risk groups, for example, older adults, health\r\n    workers, persons with comorbidities. In line with the SAGE Prioritization\r\n    Roadmap, WHO recommends countries should prioritize booster coverage amongst\r\n    higher priority-use groups before offering vaccine doses to lower priority-use\r\n    groups.",
          "The benefits of booster doses are recognized following\r\n    increasing evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against mild and asymptomatic\r\n    SARS-CoV-2 infection over time.",
          "Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?",
          "SAGE accepts two heterologous doses of WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series.",
          "To ensure equivalent or favourable immunogenicity or vaccine effectiveness either of the WHO EUL COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) or the WHO EUL COVID-19 vectored vaccines (AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD or Janssen) can be used as a second dose following a first dose with the Bharat COVID-19 vaccine dependant on product availability.",
          "Does it prevent infection and\r\n        transmission?",
          "Vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was\r\n    64%.",
          "As there is not currently sufficient evidence to date to\r\n    evaluate the impact of the vaccine on transmission, public health and social\r\n    measures must continue, including use of face masks, physical distancing,\r\n    handwashing, appropriate ventilation, and other measures as appropriate in\r\n    particular settings, depending on the COVID-19 epidemiology and potential risks\r\n    of emerging variants. Government advice on public health and social measures\r\n    should continue to be followed by both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.\r\n    SAGE will update this advice as information on the impact of vaccination on\r\n    virus transmission and indirect protection is assessed.",
          "Does it work against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?",
          "Vaccine efficacy against all variant-related COVID-19 disease\r\n    was 71% with an efficacy of 90% against Kappa, and 65% against Delta. In view\r\n    of these findings, WHO recommends the use of BBV152 vaccine according to the\r\n    WHO Prioritization Roadmap, even if currently recognized Variants of Concern\r\n    (VOC) are present in the country.  If new VOCs emerge for which vaccine\r\n    performance is compromised, these recommendations will be updated\r\n    accordingly. There are no data yet for Omicron.",
          "How does this vaccine compare to other COVID-19 vaccines already in use?",
          "It is impossible to compare the vaccines head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19.",

          "As the first COVID-19 vaccines arrived into Somalia, polio programme staff were in position. Drawing on years of experience working to tackle polio and other health threats, staff had taken on key roles in logistics, cold-chain management and monitoring to ensure the success of the vaccine rollout.",
          "Mohamud Shire, a WHO polio eradication officer working in the central zone of Somalia, explained, “Regional and district polio officers acted as supervisors of the vaccine rollout. Some of the polio health workers worked as COVID-19 vaccinators, whereas others were social mobilizers.”",
          "A new WHO report entitled, ‘ Role of the polio network in COVID-19 vaccine delivery and essential immunization: lessons learned for successful transition ’, underscores the value of the polio network as an agile and experienced public health workforce, able to pivot to support national health programmes to deliver COVID-19 vaccines, and strengthen essential immunization. The introduction of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 stretched country health systems, requiring all hands on deck to deliver vaccines to the most vulnerable. In this challenging context, hundreds of polio eradication staff led efforts in areas ranging from coordination and community mobilization, to training and surveillance. This work proves that sustaining these capacities is the way forward to build stronger, more equitable and resilient health systems.",
          "The polio transition process aims to sustain the workforce and infrastructure set up to eradicate polio to strengthen immunization programmes, protect against outbreaks, and deliver essential health services to communities. A 2020 report documented the outstanding contributions of the polio network to the emergency stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 5900 staff in the 20 priority countries for polio transition stepping up. The new report provides evidence of the role of polio staff to support essential immunization, and makes the case to transition their valuable skills and expertise to strengthen immunization programmes, building on the COVID-19 experience.",
          "In Sudan, 13 polio staff coordinated with partner agencies, trained vaccinators and provided comprehensive technical support for the COVID-19 rollout. In Nepal, 15 polio and immunization officers monitored the quality of COVID-19 vaccine sessions, whilst in India, polio and immunization Open Data Kit software was used to record data from more than 450,000 COVID-19 vaccination sessions. In Nigeria, at least 121 polio staff worked to sensitize communities to COVID-19, support trainings for the e-registration of vaccine recipients, and manage Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI). In these countries, this work builds upon historical contributions of polio staff to essential immunization, including working with national essential immunization programmes for the co-delivery of polio with other vaccines, and using electronic surveillance tools developed for polio eradication to detect other vaccine-preventable diseases.",
          "The report also details lessons learned from the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. One is the value of integrating polio functions into other health programmes. The pandemic response showed that with an integrated approach it is possible to achieve more with limited resources. For instance, in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the pandemic experience has led to the introduction of Integrated Public Health Teams , which bring together public health staff to provide broader services to communities.",
          "Another lesson is the value of transferable skills that can contribute to vaccination across the life-course. Polio personnel have specific strengths in childhood vaccination, but the pandemic has shown that their cross-cutting skills – including coordination, disease surveillance, monitoring, data management and microplanning – can be used to make progress towards global immunization goals. The pandemic has impacted rates of routine immunization, leading to an increase in numbers of un- or under-vaccinated children. Harnessing the skills of polio personnel, and integrating them into other programmes, is key to achieving the goals of the Immunization Agenda 2030 .",
          "The report further serves to emphasise that polio transition and polio eradication are interdependent, and must go hand-in-hand. In the context of ongoing polio outbreaks, the sustainable transition of functions in polio-free counties is a necessary step to ensure that health systems are resilient to future health threats, including poliovirus importations.",
          "To support these aspects, sustainable financing for the integration and transition of polio essential public health functions is vital. As of 2022, over 50 countries have transitioned out of GPEI support, but still require funding and technical support from WHO and other partners. Long-term domestic and international support is needed to ensure that the knowledge, expertise and lessons learned from polio eradication continue to serve populations. This is especially important as governments face long-term financial constraints on their health spending due to the pandemic.",
          "As we move towards health systems recovery, we must ensure that the polio infrastructure is transitioned in a sustainable manner, to support more resilient health systems."

          "At the 75 th World Health Assembly, delegates discussed progress made on the Strategic Action Plan on Polio Transition and reiterated their support for the way forward towards stronger, more resilient health systems.",
          "The session on polio transition planning and polio post-certification took place against a backdrop of efforts to bolster essential immunization following COVID-19 and strengthen health systems to respond to outbreaks. Polio transition, which aims to repurpose the polio network and assets for wider public health, is a key tool to sustain vital capacity in polio-free countries to strengthen national health systems.",
          "At the start of 2022, in a major step forward towards integrated health systems, over fifty polio-free countries transitioned from Global Polio Eradication Initiative support. WHO continues to provide technical assistance to these countries to sustain polio gains and to assist progress on broader health priorities, especially essential immunization, disease surveillance, emergency preparedness and response and primary health care.",
          "Member State interventions emphasised the importance of continued close collaboration between the WHO and its partners to ensure that eradication and transition go hand in hand. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, underlined this during his address to the Assembly, stating, “Over fifty countries have transitioned out of the support of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. We have proven that eradication and transition can, and must, go hand in hand. Each of us have a challenge ahead…for countries that are now polio-free, it is crucial to accelerate efforts to use the polio assets and infrastructure to build stronger and more resilient health systems.”",
          "Member States praised efforts to integrate polio eradication with other public health efforts, including thorough innovative approaches such as the introduction of Integrated Public Health Teams . Member States also emphasized the need to integrate and sustain sensitive surveillance systems for polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases, and strengthen essential immunization to reach under or un-immunized children. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, noted, “The transition from polio to integrated public health has been initiated, with core surveillance capacities being maintained in all our countries.”",
          "The World Health Assembly also took note of the Mid-Term Evaluation of the Strategic Action Plan on Polio Transition . The WHO’s management response to the Mid-Term Evaluation will help pave the way for the next chapter, by making the necessary adjustments to implement transition effectively in a changed public health context following the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "The Director-General and Regional Directors concluded their statements with a call to action. The passing of a resolution on the sustainable financing of WHO earlier in the World Health Assembly marks an important step towards retaining polio assets. Nonetheless, concerted efforts are needed to ensure that these essential functions can be sustained in the long-term, through predicable donor and domestic financing.",
          "Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa stated, “This is a critical year for transition, and I urge Member States to step up their efforts, including through political commitment and domestic funding. We have a collective opportunity and responsibility to leverage the polio gains for integrated public health.”",
          "WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari said, “We urge Member States to support this integration, mobilize resources, and ensure national ownership and sustainable domestic financing to fast-track polio transition. It is only through collective action and accountability at the national, regional and global levels that we will succeed.”",
          "The Director-General Dr Tedros emphasised the importance of continued commitment to sustain the polio functions. “For all partners and donors, please help us seize the moment to raise predictable funding for eradication and transition.”"

          "The World Health Assembly has set out the preparatory process leading to the fourth high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Many countries are still lacking the capacity to fulfil the commitment, as set out in paragraph 17 of United Nations General Assembly resolution 73/2, to provide strategic leadership for the prevention and control of NCDs. This can be achieved by promoting greater policy coherence and coordination through whole-of-government and Health in All Policies approaches. Doing so requires engaging stakeholders in appropriate, coordinated, comprehensive, integrated and bold whole-of-society action and response. The fourth high-level meeting will be convened under the auspices of the President of the United Nations General Assembly. It will produce a resolution and outcome document, to be negotiated by Member States under the auspices of two co-facilitators that will be appointed by the President of the United Nations General Assembly closer to the meeting, and an outcome document. The high-level meeting will also provide an opportunity for Member States to deliver statements and for Member States, nongovernmental organizations and private sector entities to engage in roundtable discussions. The preparatory process leading to the fourth high-level meeting includes meetings and consultations co-sponsored by WHO and relevant partners, which may serve as input into the negotiations among Member States on the “modalities” resolution and the outcome document. A full list of these meetings can be found on our ‘Road to 2025’ page available as a related link. The preparatory process may also contribute to the development of recommendations that may be included in the 2024 progress report of the United Nations Secretary-General to the United Nations General Assembly on the prevention and control of NCDs. “We are in a critical decade for NCDs. With 150 million expected to die from NCDs by 2030, we do not have a moment to lose. Providing technical support to WHO Member States to continue to deliver on existing commitments and mandates, including to progress SDG targets 3.4 and 3.8 and delivering the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2030 remains critical. The fourth UN High-level meeting for the prevention and control on NCDs will be a critical moment for world leaders to together make century-defining commitments to act on the world’s biggest killers” said Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Director for Noncommunicable Diseases, World Health Organization."

          "Delegates at the World Health Assembly have supported recommendations on how to strengthen policies to prevent, control and treat noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as cancers, diabetes, heart, and lung diseases, for people living in humanitarian emergencies. People living with NCDs in humanitarian emergencies need special attention and investment through a multi-sectoral all-hazards approach. This includes ensuring that NCDs are systematically included at every stage of the emergency cycle, across preparedness, response and recovery. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that 235 million people would need humanitarian assistance and protection in 2021. The number of people living with NCDs in natural and human-caused disasters is growing. This is particularly pertinent for people living with NCDs in Ukraine: in 2019, 92% of all deaths in Ukraine – more than half a million people – were the result of an NCD, with many more people still needing services for their NCD treatment and care. Attention to NCDs in humanitarian settings, as well as coordination among United Nations agencies, humanitarian responders and donors, is growing. Simultaneously, research on NCDs and COVID-19 and more broadly on humanitarian settings is increasing in scope and quality, providing a stronger evidence basis to inform policy and programme design. NCDs require particular attention during health emergencies NCDs have common characteristics that make affected people more vulnerable during an emergency. Emergencies appear to increase the risk of NCD-related complications, such as heart attacks and strokes, relative to normal pre-emergency circumstances. At the same time, COVID-19 continues  to have a disproportionate impact on people living with or at risk of NCDs, including disadvantaged groups such as forcibly displaced and refugee populations in humanitarian contexts. Often a consequence of health emergencies, the disruptions of essential NCD health services due to COVID-19 have been widespread. This is due to the shortage of medicines, staff, diagnostics, and public transport services, among other constraints. The recommendations build on operational guidance released by WHO in March 2020 on maintaining essential services during the outbreak, to support countries in mitigating the disruption of essential health services. Since 2017, WHO has deployed more than 7500 ‘NCD kits’ in over 20 countries and humanitarian hubs worldwide, including during the pandemic. Each kit covers 10,000 people for three months, helping address part of the unmet needs for NCD essential medicines and supplies during emergencies. At an annual value of US$ 3.6 million, it has become one of the most procured WHO standard emergency health kits. WHO is also supporting people living with NCDs in recent humanitarian emergencies. In Ukraine, this has included mapping the care continuity for adults and children living with cancer, work in Poland on the procurement of essential NCD medicines, and supporting a health system review in Moldova to monitor refugee health burden and bottlenecks in the country. Also recently, WHO has also deployed technical support in Armenia, to rapidly assess the rehabilitation situation and support the establishment of a rehabilitation coordination platform in Nagorno Karabakh. The Annex makes a full list of recommendations, both for strengthening NCD-related responses to COVID-19, and for acting on all hazards beyond the pandemic. Actions for the WHO Secretariat include review current WHO NCD-related responses in countries in emergencies to strategically improve technical assistance, develop a prioritized essential NCD health package to be guaranteed in health emergencies, and to strengthen WHO’s normative role and technical capacity. “Today’s decision recognizes the need to strengthen NCD responses, including to the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts, and the health emergencies of tomorrow, will provide much-needed benefits to support people living with NCDs affected by humanitarian emergencies. As we see in Ukraine, the toll of conflict on people living with NCDs is forcing families to make agonizing decisions about how to try and access the treatment and care they need. We must support people living with NCDs, by guaranteeing that NCDs are prioritized in emergency preparedness and response planning” , said Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Director for Noncommunicable Diseases, World Health Organization."

Six workstreams have been\r\n    established, covering vital areas such as access to essential medicines and health technologies, health promotion, and country work. Work has also been taken to implement the Global Diabetes Compact at Regional Office level.",
          "WHO has secured the assistance of leading experts to advise on diabetes technical matters, through the establishment of a Technical Advisory Group on Diabetes (TAG-D). We are also learning from people with lived experience of diabetes, acknowledging that\r\n    this principle will help ensure the Global Diabetes Compact focuses on areas where action is most needed. A global informal consultation and focus groups have been conducted with people with lived experiences of diabetes, yielding vital insights\r\n    on several topics including diabetes care, education, mental health and stigma associated with diabetes.",
          "In addition, 2 meetings of the recently formed Global Diabetes Compact Forum have been held, with more than 70 participating organizations from civil society, academic institutions, philanthropic foundations, and business associations. The Forum provides\r\n    an opportunity for the exchange of information and ideas that could be organized collectively for greater impact.",
          "Scaling up our impact in countries around the world",
          "The establishment of the Global Diabetes Compact and its associated coordination activities have brought added impetus to diabetes efforts within ministries of health around the world. Across the 3 levels of WHO, teams have used the opportunity to\r\n    support countries in their efforts, providing technical guidance and support advocacy.",
          "Over the past few months, WHO has secured funding for a 3-year project on the prevention and control of NCDs in primary care by prioritizing people living with diabetes in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.",
          "WHO has been working hard to integrate diabetes into primary care, using the WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable disease interventions (PEN) toolkit and HEARTS technical package. Mali is 1 of 7 countries in the African Region currently implementing\r\n    WHO HEARTS, including training health care workers on managing diabetes. In South-East Asia, WHO’s technical guidance on diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes (HEARTS-D), has been adapted into an online training module for stakeholders\r\n    responsible for planning diabetes services.",
          "Every year until 2031, the WHO Secretariat will also submit a report on the implementation of the recommendations to the Health Assembly through the Executive Board, on an annual basis and as a component on the report on NCDs."

Dr Al Hamad is the Chairperson of Geriatrics and\r\n    Long-Term Care at the Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar and has spearheaded the development of innovative programmes such as geriatric virtual clinics for older people and an urgent day-care unit. As a result of her outstanding work, there has been\r\n    a 20% increase in bed capacity in long-term care; mobile- and home-care services are now fully integrated; a dedicated web page for older people now provides information about healthy ageing; and community rehabilitation and memory clinic services\r\n    have expanded at the primary care level.",

Our goal is to provide safe, compassionate, easily accessibly care for older adults – with a focus on health promotion and community wellbeing, by working with other sectors and agencies. Even though we made\r\n    great strides, we face challenges, too. However, I have been fully supported by our ministry, my senior leaders and my organization. And I get support and blessing from our patients and their families, in the way they call me “a daughter of\r\n    Qatar”. I know there is a long journey but together we shall get there.”"

He has served\r\n    in multiple advisory roles in the context of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. His lifelong ambition is to reduce the prevalence of lung cancer in Thailand. He has devoted his professional life to tobacco control, resulting not only\r\n    in improved treatment and care protocols for patients, but also in an impressive array of tobacco control measures, including tobacco taxes and restrictions on tobacco advertising and sports sponsorship. Professor Vathesatogkit is a pioneer in advocating\r\n    for these measures and works across sectors, engaging the general public and developing and empowering networks.",

But when I volunteered to be involved in tobacco control in 1986, I was struck by\r\n    the efforts of the tobacco industry to perpetuate extreme human suffering caused by nicotine addiction, tobacco induced diseases and premature death. I felt a duty to take the challenge and build alliances in all walks of life in Thai society, to\r\n    fight this destructive epidemic and to extend it to other regions of the world. Although the tobacco control movement and measures in the last 35 years have reduced the projected number of smokers, tobacco use is still the number one preventable cause\r\n    of premature death in Thailand. Accepting this Prize, I pledge to continue my work on tobacco control, to fulfill my longstanding commitment to health, and to galvanize health professionals to join the fight for a smoke-free world. I believe it can\r\n    and will be done.”",

Dr Tomasz Darocha, an expert\r\n    in the field of extracorporeal therapy, and Dr Sylweriusz Kosiński, a specialist in anesthesiology and intensive care, launched the idea for establishing the Centre. The Centre has initiated numerous research and development projects to design modern\r\n    technological solutions – applications, devices and protective agents used in the diagnosis and treatment of hypothermia.",

This holistic approach enriches the understanding of severe hypothermia globally.",

Accidental hypothermia is a problem that humanity has been struggling with since the dawn of time. In the face of global warming, it may seem the\r\n    problem no longer exists. But it does. Unfortunately, hypothermia still kills people in every latitude. This award is not only a distinction for us, but also a challenge. We have not yet said the last word. Everything we have achieved so far is only\r\n    the beginning of what we can still achieve. This Award will enable us to have a greater impact on the health-care system. We have faced challenges but each of them only strengthens us as a team. We continue our work to raise public awareness of this\r\n    deadly threat.”"

His achievements in the field of HIV/AIDS prevention are outstanding, for instance the innovative, evidence-based policies he had built to reach groups\r\n    most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. He was a pioneer in designing, piloting and scaling-up outreach programmes among sex workers. He established China’s first needle-exchange programme and its first large-scale opioid replacement treatment. The impact\r\n    of these measures has been significant: today, drug users represent 1% of all HIV infections in China, while in 2004, they represented half.",
          "As a result of Dr Wu’s work, HIV testing is now a key prevention tool among all vulnerable groups, with about 300 million tests carried out in China in 2020. Dr Wu’s recommendations on outreach interventions for vulnerable groups have become\r\n    national policy. His work has been recognized in China and globally.",

I remember that back in 1991, in university, I was shocked finding out that some of the lecturers were men who had sex with men, while\r\n    others used drugs or lived with HIV. I want to thank professor Roger Detels and Professor Zeng Yi who taught me a non-judgmental and non-discriminatory attitude towards people at risk of HIV infection. I also thank all health professional outreach\r\n    teams and peer volunteers from key populations, who have worked together to promote HIV prevention programmes among sex workers, people who use drugs, and men who have sex with men in the past 30 years. Health promotion among key populations needs\r\n    to be continued. I will continue this very important work.”"

This issue has been even more critical during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic because people’s lives\r\n    and safety depended on receiving comprehensible information at the right time. Translators without Borders  developed multilingual, conversational chatbots to provide real time, reliable information on COVID-19 to the users in their own language.\r\n    The chatbots were developed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies  and Kinshasa Digital; and in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in partnership with Mercy\r\n    Corps.",

[i] This enables users to ask questions in their own words and receive relevant responses in the same language. These chatbots thus convey locally relevant, multimedia content to audiences, including those who speak marginalized languages or have lower\r\n    literacy levels. Furthermore, the responsible team analyses the questions users ask; the results of which support humanitarian responders to identify people’s information needs and tailor their communication efforts. The information is also\r\n    used to develop language models that can be used in a range of applications like machine translation as well as certain components of an interactive voice response solution for local languages."

[i] Most of the rural Malagasy population have low literacy levels and lack a functioning mass communication infrastructure\r\n    including access to radio, network coverage, and even electricity.",
          "Health information mostly travels by word of mouth, which is prone to misinformation and misconceptions. Being exposed to misinformation, especially during a health emergency like the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, has severe consequences for\r\n    the audiences’ health and well-being. To address the information void, the locally active nongovernmental organization (NGO) Doctors for Madagascar initiated a project named ‘Singing sensitization’. The project uses live music performances\r\n    to disseminate evidence-based health information to rural Malagasy communities.",
          "The project aims to raise awareness on health protection measures, educate the community on the risk factors of COVID-19, and debunk misinformation. Messages are communicated via songs in local dialects using a story-telling approach. Regular live performances\r\n    are organized at central marketplaces in remote villages. The performances are followed by question-and-answer (Q&A) sessions guided by health care workers to provide people with tailored and reliable health information."

The project aimed to map the local information ecosystem to identify information gaps and circulating mis- and disinformation to address them in a timely and targeted manner.",
          "Mercy Corps collaborated with Internews to build a rumour tracker tool and conducted a social media mapping exercise with community leaders to identify relevant media outlets. Identified channels were closely monitored through social media listening and\r\n    rumours were logged on a spreadsheet. Additionally, Mercy Corps team conducted community listening through forms that could be filled by the participating community leaders and health promoters. Those with low digital literacy could also submit rumours\r\n    through WhatsApp messages. Data collected was similarly logged in the spreadsheet. The Mercy Corps monitoring team met on a weekly basis to identify most common rumours that needed to be addressed. Besides social media scanning, the project team also\r\n    engaged with community leaders to get a better understanding of the information needs of the local communities. Based on these insights, evidence-based messages tailored to the respective communities were developed, particularly on vaccination. Messages\r\n    were shared and amplified through Mercy Corps and partner organizations’ social media channels. Community leaders and health promoters would also share the content in their own networks."

The toolkit specifically\r\n    addresses the coping needs of older people during the pandemic. It contains five large posters and an instruction manual for caregivers that can be printed out or used on screen. Using illustrations and short texts, each poster addresses one of the\r\n    following questions:",

              "Where can I get help if I need it?",
              "How can I cope with grief and loss?"
            ]
          },
          "The posters were developed in collaboration with a network of MHPSS technical working groups at country level and piloted with older adults from different countries, income groups and contexts, including humanitarian settings. The toolkit has been translated\r\n    into 14 languages and adapted into accessible formats for people with special needs, such as braille for visually impaired people. [i]",

          "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has vastly impacted the lives of children around the world – from isolating lockdowns and uncertainties to watching their loved ones fall ill and sometimes die from the disease. To provide coping support\r\n    and explain the science behind the pandemic to children, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings (IASC MHPSS RG), [i] co-chaired by the World Health Organization and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, produced a storybook called “My Hero is You: how kids can fight COVID-19!”. The book aims to help children aged 6–11\r\n    years to learn how to protect themselves, their families and friends from COVID-19, and support them in managing difficult emotions related to the pandemic.",
          "The storyline is based on the experience of 1700 children, parents, caregivers and teachers from 104 countries who shared how they were coping with the pandemic. The book tells the story of Ario, an imaginary creature, who helps children disseminate information\r\n    on COVID-19 to their friends, and teaches them to care for one another through these difficult times. The book was initially translated into six languages and is now available in 143 languages as well as in braille transcripts and sign language interpretations. [ii] Over 50 adaptations exist in creative outlets such as animations, puppetries, audio files and colouring books. [iii] The storybook, based on collaborative, evidence-informed efforts, is a unique resource to foster the mental health and psychosocial well-being of children everywhere amid the pandemic.",

          "In 2020, as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic progressed, the number of cases among health care workers in hospitals were rising. Since vaccines were still being developed, the most effective way to protect hospital staff was to equip them with\r\n    strong knowledge and skills in infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. To this end, Geneva University Hospitals, which operates eight hospitals in the Canton of Geneva, developed a serious online game called “Escape COVID-19\" directed\r\n    at health care workers to strengthen knowledge and compliance with patient care and safety protocols against COVID-19.",
          "The game consists of a series of scenarios. In each scenario, the player is reminded of choices related to COVID-19 IPC practices. For example: the player has to select the correct rules related to the use of gloves where options include ‘change\r\n    gloves for each different treatment requiring hand hygiene’, ‘don gloves as soon as you enter the room’.",
          "At the end of each question/scenario the correct answer is revealed together with an explanation of the recommended guidance. This is displayed irrespective of a correct or wrong response. The game has four different levels with the final one specifically\r\n    designed for the information needs of professionals working in high-dependency and intensive care wards. The health care workers who complete all levels receive a certificate.",
          "The game has two versions. One was designed to target health care professionals including physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, assistants, technicians and therapists. The other was designed for non-medical hospital staff such as stretcher-bearers and\r\n    housekeepers, who have close and regular contact with patients and therefore play a role in COVID-19 transmission."

Through the project, UNFPA has been working in close collaboration with WHO and the Ministry of Health and Population, leading to synergies in efforts and resources. These joint efforts have translated into real-world improvements,\r\n    with the impact being felt at the provider and patient levels. The availability of health care workers, and the safe care of pregnant women in hospital facilities had always been a challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the situation with the\r\n    risk of infection endangering both health care workers and patients. An early example was reported at Dolisie General Hospital, in the eastern part of the country, where the pandemic had impacted the hospital’s workforce and the quality of care\r\n    provided to pregnant women, requiring prompt action from SDG3 GAP partners (World Health Organisation, 2021).",
          "WHO’s leadership and the joint efforts of the SDG3 GAP signatory agencies and other partners enabled the challenges that came with the risk of COVID-19 infection and the management of pregnant women during a pandemic to be swiftly managed. WHO supplied\r\n    the hospital with key supplies and equipment, including protective equipment, and trained staff in infection prevention and control standards. Dr. Bernard N'Dala, head of the hospital’s gynecology and obstetrics department, noted that “the\r\n    delivery room for women suspected of being infected with COVID-19 and the equipment used to manage deliveries have been improved by the layout of the premises.” Dr Maurice Mpompolo, Director General of Dolisie General Hospital, noted that “these\r\n    new provisions have made it possible to limit the risk of infections between patients and staff and to reassure women before their delivery. The number of staff infections has dropped from 16 infections in March 2020 to 0 infections as of November\r\n    2021 and maternity ward consultations have increased by 2%.”",
          "At a national level, UNICEF has also been leading on key RMNCAH activities. The agency, in collaboration with WHO and UNFPA, focuses on a wide range of RMNCAH targets, including the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), and access\r\n    to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) to prevent life-threatening illnesses. UNICEF continues to support the government in scaling up PMTCT services through capacity building activities and by implementing point-of-care testing services. To date,\r\n    a total of 163 health care workers, including 96 midwives, have been trained in antenatal care and delegation of tasks in PMTCT services. This led to more than 31,000 live births being supported in key health districts, as well as a 139% increase\r\n    of the number of pregnant women tested for HIV from 10,491 in 2020 to 25,129 in 2021, and an increase in early HIV diagnoses of infants born to HIV-positive from 7% in 2020 to 10.3% in 2021.",
          "In addition, under the UN Development Assistance Framework and in collaboration the government, UNICEF has supported the supply of 21 water systems in key regions of the country, which provides safe drinking water to an estimated 13,354 people, including\r\n    over 7,000 women. UNICEF and other partners are also supporting the roll-out of community health initiatives to help expand access to key RMNCAH services in hard-to-reach areas. In the span of five months, this approach – carried out in two\r\n    peri-urban health districts of Pointe Noire currently without health facilities – has made it possible to ensure the management of 8551 cases of malaria, acute respiratory infections, and acute diarrhea (notably, 1141 cases of malaria, 1923\r\n    cases of cough/cold and 5487 cases of diarrhea)."

It has therefore selected these two accelerators as the focus areas for work with the “Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being\r\n    for All” (SDG3 GAP) partners.",
          "Collaborations between the SDG3 GAP Sustainable Financing for Health Accelerator (SFHA) partners and the Government have yielded outputs such as the costed Health Sector Medium Term Development Plan (HSMTDP) which was developed with technical, financial\r\n    and other relevant support from the World Bank, WHO, GFF, UNICEF and other partners. The HSMTDP was based on Ghana’s UHC Roadmap and will serve as a joint plan around which health partners and stakeholders coordinate their work. It will also\r\n    serve as the basis for determining priorities for the health sector and health investments over the next four years. Another output is the new PHC Investment Programme which aims to improve the quality, utilisation and equity of PHC services and is\r\n    being implemented by the Government with funding and support from Gavi, GFF and the World Bank.",

The HSWG which is led by the Ministry of Health,\r\n    supports country coordination by providing a platform for the various stakeholders (Government and partners) to interact and coordinate their activities as well as to identify strategies that can be used to improve the health sector in general.",

          "In 2013, the Government of Ghana established the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), with the goal of increasing access to basic health care services. While the scheme has expanded access to healthcare, it has also faced a number of challenges. Firstly,\r\n    only 54.4% of the total population is covered by the scheme, with the informal sector making up less than 40% of the membership. In addition, there is a gap in financing cost-effective preventive health services since the NHIS purchases mostly curative\r\n    services and the Ministry of Health funding for preventive health services is inadequate. Discussions on including preventive services are currently underway. Secondly, there are delays in reimbursement to service providers, which impacts their ability\r\n    to deliver service to the insured and results in co-payments by service users. Finance therefore remains a significant barrier to accessing healthcare: in 2019, an estimated 36% of health-care expenditure was comprised of out-of-pocket expenses. Consequently,\r\n    many people must make the difficult choice between either risking health-related economic hardship or not accessing care.",
          "In 2020, the Government of Ghana committed to achieving the goal of at least 80% coverage of essential health services and embarked on a highly ambitious health sector reform programme. A major part of this was the development of the Ghana Universal Health\r\n    Coverage (UHC) roadmap which set out a strategy and plan for achieving the goal. The roadmap includes six interventions which are focused on consolidating and optimising basic essential services; managing clinical and public health emergencies; improving\r\n    quality of care and information management; enhancing efficiency in human resource performance; undertaking institutional reforms for sector effectiveness; and strengthening health financing, health policy, and the health system.",
          "As one of the first steps in the implementation of the UHC roadmap, the Ministry of Health developed an Essential Health Services Package (EHSP) with the support of USAID, WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank. The national EHSP consists of an integrated set\r\n    of cost-effective interventions and services which the Government of Ghana is committed to making progressively accessible to the entire population of the country by 2030.",
          "While implementing the roadmap requires significant financial investment, financing is a major challenge in Ghana, with health spending in 2019 comprising less than 3.5% of GDP. In addition, donor funding has been declining since 2010 when Ghana moved\r\n    from low-income to lower middle-income status. Between 2015 and 2020, development partner funding for the health sector decreased by an annual rate of over 10%, and the proportion of the health budget represented by donor funding more than halved\r\n    between 2016 and 2020, going from 13.2% to just 6.3%. To address this reduction in aid and improve the country’s financial stability more broadly, the Government of Ghana has undertaken several initiatives, including the 2019 Ghana Beyond Aid\r\n    Charter and Strategy which aims to improve resource mobilization and management. However, like many other countries, Ghana’s financial situation has been further weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic which has curtailed economic growth and will\r\n    likely have negative implications for the availability of resources for the health sector.",
          "Given this context of tight fiscal constraints, the government has been working closely with SDG3 GAP agencies including Gavi, GFF, the Global Fund, the World Bank Group, UNICEF and WHO to finance and implement the UHC roadmap, through the Sustainable\r\n    Financing for Health Accelerator (SFHA). The process began in early 2020, when GFF proposed supporting operationalization of the UHC Roadmap through the development of an investment case for improving maternal, child and adolescent health. The Government\r\n    of Ghana, supported by UNICEF, however, requested the development of a costed Health Sector Medium Term Development Plan (HSMTDP) (2022-2025) for the entire health sector.",
          "As part of the process of developing the plan, a number of technical working groups were established to focus on different thematic areas including sustainable financing, clinical and public health emergencies and health service reorganisation. The government\r\n    and the SDG3 GAP partners then carried out a collaborative review of the previous health sector medium term development plan, to determine whether the objectives had been met and identify strategic shifts required. The review which happened concurrently\r\n    with the finalisation of the Ghana UHC Roadmap, referred to and was based on the roadmap. Based on the results of the review and the outputs of the various technical working groups, the health priorities for the next four years were determined, and\r\n    the HSMTDP was prepared. GFF, UNICEF, the World Bank, WHO and other partners provided technical, financial and other support throughout the development of the plan including its costing.",
          "Collaborations on sustainable financing among SDG3 GAP agencies are occurring in addition to the work on HSMTDP. Development partners have established a health financing working group, which meets monthly to discuss financing issues and donor support.\r\n    A resource mapping exercise co-led by the Government, GFF and the World Bank is also underway. The mapping exercise provides a baseline for understanding the financing currently available for health priorities, the priorities that are funded, and\r\n    where the money is invested. The exercise aims to identify funding patterns across key priorities and strengthen donor and government alignment around them. To date, the resource mapping for FY21 has been completed and a draft report for FY22-24 has\r\n    been prepared to inform the fiscal gap analysis for the HSMTDP. There is also an ongoing public expenditure review by the World Bank in collaboration with WHO to identify key health financing challenges of the country, as well as a fiscal space analysis\r\n    for supporting health financing in Ghana. The Government is also working with Gavi, GFF and the World Bank to fund and implement the PHC Improvement Programme which is focused on improving the quality, utilisation and equity of PHC services, and a\r\n    Health Financing Strategy is being developed as part of the operationalization of the UHC Roadmap with the support of WHO.",
          "All these collaborations and partnerships are yielding real results for people in Ghana by improving the Government’s ability to broaden the coverage of essential health services. In November 2021, the Government announced that that family planning\r\n    and the four most common childhood cancers would be included in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). In addition to advancing progress towards UHC, this policy will also contribute to reducing the risk of adverse maternal and reproductive\r\n    health outcomes and will improve the prognosis for  children who develop childhood cancer."

          "Alongside the work on sustainable financing, the SDG3 GAP partners have been providing joint support to the government of Ghana on PHC-related activities being implemented through the health sector working group (HSWG). One key output of this is the Network\r\n    of Practice with a model health centre programme which is being adopted as the model for improving PHC in Ghana. The Network of Practice is a key design feature of Ghana’s UHC Roadmap, and its goal is to reposition Primary Health Care as smart\r\n    care for everyone regardless of socio-economic status. The programme aims to improve the coverage and quality of preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative, emergency care and mental healthcare by ensuring that health services delivered\r\n    at the community and sub-district level are supported by and organised within the context of well-defined formal district health system. The programme was developed by the Government, building on experiences from the Primary Healthcare Provider Network\r\n    pilot implemented by USAID, and is now being rolled-out and scaled-up across the country. Thinking around how to further strengthen the programme is ongoing, notably with regards to identifying the most effective payment mechanism for the programme\r\n    and ways of improving its financial arrangements, as well as strengthening the Public Financial Management Systems including the fiduciary capacity of personnel at the sub-district level.",
          "The HSWG also strengthens linkages between SDG3 GAP partners and implementing agencies. This improves collaboration between the members of the group and allows their individual expertise and comparative advantage to be leveraged for identifying challenges,\r\n    solutions and strategies which can be used to support implementing agencies working to improve both PHC service delivery and financing. In addition to this, the working group serves as a platform for the various stakeholders to interact and coordinate\r\n    their multiple activities - the Ministry of Health has used the platform to discuss and seek input into its work on developing this year’s priority agenda, which was focused on health information systems."

As a group we learned things about health that we will put into practice and help others,” reflected a participant from Medio Queso, a remote vulnerable community in Los Chiles County, Costa Rica,\r\n    on participating in an SDG3 GAP-supported community PHC project. As in many countries, the COVID-19 pandemic strained Costa Rica’s health system, with investments initially going to hospitals leaving PHC mostly out of front-line responses. Health\r\n    inequalities heavily affecting indigenous, migrant and rural communities also affected Costa Rica’s capacity to cope with the emergency, including issues on mental health and violence disproportionally affecting women. A successful 2020 COVID-19\r\n    project 1 showed that many health challenges and broader determinants of health could be better tackled with stronger and more integrated community participation, in line with an intersectoral,\r\n    whole-of-society, people- and community-centered PHC approach. 2",
          "During this COVID-19 project, communities and local institutions together prioritized health issues to work on, even beyond COVID-19. Wide ranges of people were reached through social media and community sessions. Three areas were selected repeatedly: improving mental health, preventing GBV and violence against children and enhancing self-management of chronic non-communicable diseases. Typically, these issues disproportionately affect underserved and lower-income communities.",
          "WHO SDG3 GAP catalytic funds supported an initiative to build on the previous COVID-19 project, using community engagement for major transformation in these three priority areas by jointly implementing action plans with communities. Community leaders\r\n    were trained as ‘multipliers’ to share tools with communities specific to each priority area. Training these leaders relied heavily on virtual options, shown to be helpful in the previous COVID-19 project. Teams of PHC and municipal social\r\n    service workers supported community leaders to ensure sustainable and quality service delivery. High-risk and underserved groups, such as indigenous women and the deaf community, were sought out for their involvement to improve equity, and adapted\r\n    versions of training materials were made available for these groups.",
          "For GBV, community leaders were trained in sharing tools to recognize how violence against women and children increased because of the pandemic and how to work with communities to devise violence prevention strategies. Media campaigns on GBV prevention\r\n    and mental health promotion were produced to reach a wider audience. The mental health component of the project was adapted for young women in indigenous communities, intersecting with the GBV work.",
          "“It is important to keep on with the trainings to develop tools and empower women [who] already are willing to improve their conditions and hence… society,” noted one community participant. Following the GBV sessions, an adolescent\r\n    girl from the Cabecar indigenous group said that “I learned that a woman is worth more than she imagines, and that if she sets her mind to something in life, she can achieve it.”",
          "“The community support networks generated in the awareness and training processes on violence against women have constituted a protective factor for women who are in risk of GBV, both before and during the pandemic. These actions also contribute\r\n    to addressing women’s mental health, which is severely affected by GBV”, says Evelyn Durán Porras, Officer-in-Charge, UNFPA Costa Rica."

          "Somalia has turned to solar power in rebuilding a health system recovering from a protracted conflict that has taken a significant toll on its public health infrastructures.",
          "In January 2021, Somalia’s Ministry of Health, supported by the WHO Innovation hub and the WHO Country Office, piloted a solar-powered oxygen delivery system in Hanano General hospital in Galmudug state, working closely with a collaboration of thirteen development, humanitarian, and global health agencies under a Global Action Plan for SDG3 (SDG3-GAP). The collaboration seeks, among other things, to support countries in matching demand with the supply of implementation-ready innovations to accelerate progress toward the health-related goals of the SDG. The collaboration was further enriched by the expertise of the innovator behind the solution, Dr Michael Hawkes, and critical transition-to-scale funding from Grand Challenges Canada.",
          "The outcomes have been remarkable. The solar-powered oxygen system has come to symbolize life for Somalian children in a country where pneumonia accounts for at least one-fifth (15,160) of deaths among children under five years. For example, Abdiaziz Omar Abdi, a two-year-old child in severe distress, was admitted to Hanano hospital in March 2021 with oxygen levels of 60 percent, down from the required minimum level of 90 percent. Doctors immediately put him on oxygen along with ampicillin and dexamethasone medications. Abdiaziz would probably not have survived had he come in sick three months earlier. But three days later, his oxygen level was up to 90 percent, and he was discharged alive and well. “I came because my child was unwell, he was not breathing properly, he was not breastfeeding,” says relieved mother, Zahra. “Now he is breastfeeding. He is feeling well.” Moreover, Abdiaziz received the treatment at no cost.",
          "Solar Powered Oxygen Concentrator System, Hanaano Hospital. Dhushamareb, Galmudug, Somalia. ©WHO/Somalia Country Office. Abdiaziz is one of the hundred others who have accessed life-saving oxygen in Hanano hospital to bounce back to life from life-threatening medical conditions such as asphyxia, pneumonia, injuries, trauma, and road traffic accidents. The innovation has also significantly shortened hospital stay, with in-patient hospitalization averaging one day from five days pre-installation. The value adds from the innovation extends even further. For example, the solar-powered apparatus met electricity needs during frequent power interruptions to maintain the vaccine cold chain and strengthen other aspects of service delivery. An essential consequence is unlocking demand and improving healthcare seeking among catchment communities and populations. “Now, we bring our children to Hanano hospital to live and no longer die,” said Zahra, Abdulaziz’s mother. “This innovation has brought life back to this hospital; we now have people who come to our hospital from as far as 100 kilometres away”, says Dr Mohamed Abdi, the director of Hanaano hospital. “This is the first time I have seen how one timely investment can save lives. Last year, sadly, more than 180 patients died in the hospital due to a lack of oxygen. Many of them were children. This system will save many lives. If this innovation is used widely in Somalia, it can save the lives of at least 7 000 children who die needlessly from pneumonia”, he added. Solar oxygen systems have been shown as more cost-effective than other oxygen technologies, requiring minimal maintenance after installation due to their minimal moving parts. They are also easy to use with limited training for health care staff in rural areas. “The system is really easy to use for our healthcare providers and has drastically reduced the logistic and financial burden of always having to fuel our diesel generators”. Such a climate-conscious approach and the positive healthcare demand and supply effects indicate a vast potential to strengthen primary healthcare in off-grid and infrastructurally challenged settings, where most children’s deaths occur. Remarkably, Somalia is innovating in other ways. Faced with a relapse of vaccine-preventable diseases from disruptions caused by the COVID-19 crisis, Somalia's health sector at federal and state government levels worked with partners to experiment with innovative service delivery models to accelerate immunization coverage to vulnerable children with zero dose immunizations. The strategies include a combination of outreaches and mobile and fixed-post immunization models between November 2021 and February 2022. Past investments from SDG3-GAP partners, particularly GAVI, WHO and UNICEF, in strengthening Somalia's EPI and building community trust in vaccinations were critical preconditions that enhanced the rapid expansion in immunization capacity using the innovative service delivery approaches. From the existing immunization points across the country, capacity rapidly expanded to include mobile units, fixed posts, schools and even stadiums. Within two months, the campaign had covered the 54 districts in Somalia (and Somaliland) that had the lowest immunization coverage, the highest number of zero-dose children and districts that had reported outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Overall, the accelerated campaign reached 75 217 children with zero-dose immunization, 104 000 children vaccinated for measles, 82 000 vaccinated for polio, and 954 400 doses of COVID-19 vaccine. The lessons learned from the accelerated immunization campaign are informing a revision of Somalia's expanded immunization program and strengthening primary health care.",
          "Joining forces to take innovations to scale",
          "The solar-powered oxygen delivery and service delivery innovations for immunization are a few examples of Somalia’s approach to transforming its health system, and early successes have prompted increased calls to take such innovations to scale. But scaling such transformational products and services quickly enough would require extensive stakeholder alignment, which is traditionally challenging, given current locally and globally dispersed stakeholder networks.",
          "The SDG3-GAP partners are using an “Innovation Scaling Framework”, developed by the WHO Innovation Hub, to catalyze the scaling up and sustainability of effective health innovations to bridge this gap. The approach involves bringing together governments, partners, and innovation “aggregators” to identify and build supply pipelines for evidence-based, scaling-ready innovations that are already happening and showing impact. One example of this effort is the roundtable discussion on “Bridging oxygen access gaps in Somalia: towards building a resilient health system in fragile context”, organized by WHO in March 2022. Following the recommendations of the policy dialogue, SDG3-GAP partners conducted a joint assessment of the oxygen ecosystem at the primary health facility level in Somalia, which will inform the ongoing development of a road map and pooled funding mechanism for further scale-up at the primary health care level. The approach is already yielding results. For example, following the pilot in Hanano, the solar-powered oxygen system was scaled to four more hospitals located in Kismayo, Baidoa, Hudur Hospital, and Dhusamareb, with funding from the governments of Canada (via the ACT Accelerator) and the Italian government. On the eve of World Health Day 2022, the WHO Somalia country office commenced scaling up solar installation to provide electricity to 100 PHC centres, enabling optimal functioning and solving chronic power problems in a climate-friendly way. In addition, three Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants have been established, and another process is underway to jointly procure and distribute 200 portable oxygen concentrators across the country.",
          "WHO’s global health leadership and the trusting relationships between the SDG-GAP partners and the Government of Somalia, including the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Somalia, have been very crucial to these efforts. In addition, SDG-GAP partners are actively engaged in opening more pathways and funding mechanisms to move this innovation to scale.",

          "SDG3-GAP partners recognize that innovation must address needs and be accessible to the people who have those needs. To connect innovations with people who need them, SDG3-GAP partners are collaborating to deliver services more effectively and break through barriers to equitable access to health services. Partners working across humanitarian, development and peace-building efforts have adopted a nexus approach and agreed on a set of collective outcomes toward a more coherent, collaborative planning and implementation of such efforts. A notable outcome of this increased in-country collaboration is supporting the Government of Somalia to revise the Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS 2020), drawing on lessons learnt from the gaps in implementing earlier EPHS versions (EPHS 2009). In addition, they have jointly developed an implementation guideline and set up a coordination body for EPHS 2020 implementation. To provide further impetus, the World Bank is funding the Damal Caafimaad Project (2021-2026), which aims to improve the coverage of EPHS 2020 in select geographic areas while strengthening the stewardship capacity of Ministries of Health to coordinate and implement mid and long-term health system strengthening strategies. The project demonstrates vital elements of the nexus approach in taking a step from the humanitarian emergency approach to providing essential public services while strengthening governmental systems. WHO is also setting up a ‘Transition To Scale’ funding mechanism to enable countries to identify, test, and localize innovations into government programmes to sustain scale up products or service delivery innovations.",
          "The early and ongoing gains recorded to align and scale innovation varieties in Somalia are promising signs for its progress towards healthy lives and well-being for all. In addition, SDG3-GAP collaborations have emerged as critical to connecting innovations to the population that needs them, using EPHS as a vehicle. As they become established and institutionalized, such joined-up efforts increase optimism about Somalia’s progress towards healthy lives and well-being for all.",

To connect innovations with people who need them, SDG3-GAP partners are collaborating to deliver services more effectively and break through barriers to equitable access to health services. Partners working across humanitarian, development and peace-building efforts have adopted a nexus approach and agreed on a set of collective outcomes toward a more coherent, collaborative planning and implementation of such efforts. A notable outcome of this increased in-country collaboration is supporting the Government of Somalia to revise the Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS 2020), drawing on lessons learnt from the gaps in implementing earlier EPHS versions (EPHS 2009). In addition, they have jointly developed an implementation guideline and set up a coordination body for EPHS 2020 implementation. To provide further impetus, the World Bank is funding the Damal Caafimaad Project (2021-2026), which aims to improve the coverage of EPHS 2020 in select geographic areas while strengthening the stewardship capacity of Ministries of Health to coordinate and implement mid and long-term health system strengthening strategies. The project demonstrates vital elements of the nexus approach in taking a step from the humanitarian emergency approach to providing essential public services while strengthening governmental systems. WHO is also setting up a ‘Transition To Scale’ funding mechanism to enable countries to identify, test, and localize innovations into government programmes to sustain scale up products or service delivery innovations."

          "Sri Lanka has taken a proactive step through the Healthy Cities initiative to enhance its population’s overall quality of life. With support from UNICEF and WHO, this initiative is one of the first in South-East Asia to promote health, equity, and\r\n    sustainable development through a multisectoral approach. The Jaffna Healthy City Programme, for example, introduces opportunities for healthy choices such as increased physical activity, improved\r\n    hygiene and reduced waste production at city schools, workplaces, and public spaces. The programme follows the “PHC as a whole-of-society approach to health” including multisectoral action, empowerment of communities and a focus on primary\r\n    prevention.",

          "Like most countries, Sri Lanka has struggled to maintain its hard-earned Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) achievements due to the shift in priorities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. To support a comprehensive and resilient recovery, UNICEF\r\n    and WHO partnered with the government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and academia in Sri Lanka to initiate the Jaffna Healthy City Programme. An increasing trend of NCDs has been observed in Sri Lanka, attributable to life-style risk factors\r\n    such as unhealthy diet and weight, lack of exercise, smoking, alcohol and drug consumption, and stress. With strengthened collaboration, mutual learning and effective allocation of shared resources, the agencies helped to place health high on the\r\n    social and political agenda of the city. Currently, over 600 000 citizens have access to a healthier lifestyle with more exercise, improved mental well-being, more equitable educational opportunities, and improved environmental choices.",

UNICEF and WHO provided technical guidance on strategic approaches at regular meetings with\r\n    leads on developmental aid and health promotion, respectively. The agencies have been successful in initiating activities to create an environment conducive to health in schools, workplaces, and public spaces. WHO guided the needs assessment, prioritizing\r\n    actions based on its guidance for Healthy Cities, while UNICEF led school-based interventions.",
          "For the work in schools, the agencies supported revision of regulations at 10 schools with more than 8000 students and nearly 500 teachers to develop an environment more supportive of healthy choices. A programme to promote frequent engagement in physical\r\n    activities was launched. Water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities within these schools were improved, and workshops conducted to raise awareness on menstrual hygiene and puberty. This in turn empowered girls and women by addressing barriers to equal\r\n    opportunity for female students.",
          "At the workplaces, healthy eating habits and keeping physically fit was encouraged. Interventions in public spaces involved an effort to reintroduce the culture of cycling and reduce motorized vehicles as a mode of transport. Sustainable waste management\r\n    was promoted in all settings.",

          "The Republic of Niger is a landlocked country in West Africa that has faced armed conflicts and constant periods of severe drought. These challenges have negatively impacted the country’s health system, with Niger having among the worst maternal and infant mortality rates in the world. This situation has prompted the Government of Niger to commit to universal health coverage (UHC), drawing upon lessons learned from previous efforts to expand access to essential health services.",
          "In 2006, the Government initiated an ambitious free healthcare policy in response to the worst health outcomes, which consisted of providing free reproductive health and family planning services for women and a wide range of free health services for children under-five. Despite the early achievements of this initiative, the health gains were threatened by insufficient funding as only half of the resources needed for full implementation were mobilized up to 2011. Over the years, this led to the cumulation of unpaid healthcare bills and affected the ability of healthcare providers to deliver services. Additionally, by focusing on women and children under-five, the rest of the population had to bear very high user fees. WHO estimates that out-of-pocket spending accounts for more than 40% of the total health expenditure in Niger.",
          "Overall, the Government of Niger has struggled to increase resources for health, with health expenditure falling from 5.4% to 4.9% of GDP between 2007 and 2011. Between 2016 and 2018, health expenditure increased from 4.9% to 5.6% of GDP, but then stagnated at around 5.7% between 2018 and 2020.",
          "Prior to the operationalization of the free healthcare policy, Niger recognized the importance of coordination between health financing partners. In 2006, the Ministry of Health (MOH), the French Development Agency (AFD) and the World Bank created the Fonds Commun Santé (FCS) to help fund Niger’s health development plan. By 2020, this group had grown to include four additional international partners: UNICEF, UNFPA, Gavi and the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID). The funding challenges associated with the free healthcare policy were due to inadequate assessments and provision of necessary resources, highlighting the need for reforms to ensure sustainable financing for UHC and other SDG3 targets.",

          "Recognizing the importance and urgency of free healthcare to reach UHC in Niger, the Government has now initiated ambitious health financing system reforms. This is in part because external funding of health was highly fragmented, prompting the need for better coordination and alignment among partner agencies around health financing support and technical assistance. Learning from previous efforts such as the FCS, the country has worked to cultivate a strong culture of coordination among health partners. This is seen through Providing for Health (P4H), the global network for health financing and social health protection, which has been active in Niger since 2018. In 2021, P4H members and agencies of the Global Action Plan for Health Lives and Well-Being for All (SDG3 GAP) Sustainable Financing for Health Accelerator working group joined forces to recruit an in-country focal point to support and facilitate health financing coordination and action research with Government leadership and support.",
          "The recruitment process of the in-country focal point, including validation of common objectives and development of terms of reference, was facilitated by Gavi working with all health financing partners in Niger. Gavi’s mandate at country level as the official “co-rapporteur” of health financing partners was then handed over to the P4H-SDG3 GAP financing accelerator in-country focal point in January 2022. Embedded at the MOH, the focal point provides a key interface between MOH, and technical and financial partners. Its key role is to help coordinate health partners’ support on health financing and delivery on national health priorities, allowing the MOH to become “less agency centric”. The funding mechanism for this new position, previously led by WHO with AFD funding, has been transferred to the World Bank, with funding support from GFF and modalities for predictable co-financing of the position are being explored. These efforts help lay the foundation for more harmonized and joined-up support for Niger to achieve its ambitious vision for UHC."

Due to the P4H - SDG 3 GAP finance accelerator partnership, many partners are now excited and engaged to support the Government in health financing.

For instance, using a value for money (VFM) approach, GFF is responsible for resource mapping and tracking exercises, which would provide a broad view of which agency is financing what. This prioritization of resources and efforts across partners allows for “no duplication of activities and therefore, better targeted interventions, which would eventually improve more lives”, notes Moussa Bizo of the WHO Country Office in Niger. Furthermore, the VFM approach could yield additional benefits, for example, by allowing the Global Fund or Gavi to make more strategic investments in its funding of HIV, TB, malaria services and immunization services respectively. As the free healthcare policy covers these programmes, the financing reform would contribute to better operationalization of INAM, thus decreasing out-of-pocket spending by poor and vulnerable populations."

          "In 2018, Pakistan became a signatory to the UHC Global Compact to achieve UHC by 2030, and the development of a UHC essential package of health services (EPHS) is a critical element of Pakistan's roadmap to reach that goal, as outlined in its National Vision 2016-2025. Funded by the Canadian government and under the leadership of the Pakistan Ministry of Health, WHO is piloting the implementation of Pakistan's Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS) using a PHC oriented Model of Care, working closely with a collaboration of thirteen global health, development, and humanitarian agencies under a Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All (SDG3 -GAP). The pilot is being implemented in Islamabad Capital Territory and Charsadda districts (1 April 2021 - 30 September 2022).",
          "As Pakistan begins to operationalize the EPHS, the issue attracting the most attention is how to close the gap between available resources and the estimated cost of the EPHS. pending the expansion of the fiscal space to allow full implementation of the EPHS, Pakistan has approved the limited national Package for immediate district-level implementation at $12.98 per person per year.",

          "The Government of Pakistan, the WHO country office, with support from the WHO Office for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, co-hosted a policy dialogue forum PHC for UHC mission in March 2021 for stakeholders to review the status of PHC and sustainable health financing and advise on a model of care to ensure effective implementation of the UHC-Benefit Package. Participants included the federal and provincial governments, GAVI, GFF, Global Fund, UNAIDS, UNFPA, UNICEF, the World Bank, other local and international development partners, and civil society organizations. The mission concluded with a high-level national \"PHC4UHC\" Forum, where representatives from federal and provincial levels and SDG-GAP partners signed a Joint statement in support of enhancing PHC towards UHC in Pakistan .",
          "As signatories of this joint statement, the partners committed to align their approach toward \"PHC for UHC\" and work together to build a sustainable PHC model for integrated service delivery. Since then, SDG3-GAP partners have developed and implemented joint commitment and action plans. An SDG3-GAP Coordination Committee, led by the WHO Head of Mission, is constituted at the country level to align the support for PHC strengthening and sustainable health financing.",
          "SDG-GAP partners are collaborating to develop a national and provincial level health-financing framework and health-financing strategy for UHC to move the effort forward. The World Bank supports the strategy by conducting a health system financing assessment and a fiscal space analysis; the WHO is providing technical support & assistance (TA) for developing a health financing strategy, while GAVI, Global Fund and WHO are conducting cross-programmatic efficiency analysis of selected vertical programs (TB, Malaria, HIV/AIDS, EPI) to identify inefficiencies across the selected health programmes and their implications on the overall health system. In addition, the Global Financing Facility (GFF) supports the World Bank in conducting resource mapping and expenditure tracking (RMET), as well as detailed analysis of public financial management (PFM) at the district level. The RMET and PFM analyses will close data gaps in primary healthcare financing at the district level. The GFF, UNICEF, World Bank, and WHO have promoted political buy-in of the EPHS by developing a UHC investment case based on six priority reforms and coverage targets of critical PHC-based EPHS interventions. The investment case is estimated at US$ 17.40 per capita.",
          "Emerging opportunities being discussed to finance PHC-based EPHS include the upcoming National Health Support Project supported (NHSP) by the World Bank, GFF, GAVI, GFTAM and Bill Melinda Gates Foundation, building on the success of the National Immunisation Support Project (NISP) co-funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, GAVI, USAID and the World Bank. High-impact financing instruments for the World Bank's NHSP include Disbursement-Linked Indicator (DLI) mechanism to promote integrated programming with existing programs and promote equitable access in remote, marginalized areas. Such equity approaches have also been built into the review of the Federal Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) and the development of the Lady Health Worker (LHW) National Strategic Plan (2022–2026) with WHO and UNICEF support. The equity approach puts Pakistan on the path to reaching children with zero dose immunization in accelerated districts with the lowest coverage.",
          "SDG-GAP partners recognize that country ownership is essential for sustainable financing to be achieved for UHC. They have, therefore, engaged in broad consultation at the national and provincial levels to promote localization of the EPHS into national and provincial plans and budgets to move forward towards implementation. After the national endorsement of the UHC-Benefit Package/Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS) in October 2020, SDG3-GAP have engaged in broad consultation to localize the Package into provincial plans. As a result, as of May 2022, all provinces except Punjab have localized the EPHS within their plans and budgets.",

Therefore, SDG-GAP partners continue strengthening the capacity for collaborative learning towards generating and using knowledge to monitor and improve EPHS implementation. Part of the effort includes strengthening existing coordination platforms, especially assisting Pakistan's government in establishing a unified national health sector coordination mechanism. In November 2021, the National Advisory Committee (NAC) endorsed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to set up a new governance structure for the National Health Sector Coordination. The NAC also endorsed forming a dedicated national working group on Health systems. To further unify and align their support to government systems, SDG3-GAP signatories have also merged their two SDG3-GAP accelerator working groups in Pakistan (PHC and Sustainable Financing for Health) into a working group called the PHC Service Delivery and Financing group ."

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated PHC equity and resilience challenges, including in women’s health.",
          "Funds from the WHO SDG3 recovery challenge supported a collaborative project in Shamakhi led by the government with support from WHO and UNICEF. Three tranches of funding facilitated a PHC training fellowship for healthcare workers and students in Shamakhi, as well as national PHC workforce development.",

Azerbaijan has a disproportionately high maternal mortality rate in the WHO European Region with significant disparities between urban and rural areas. Dedicated safe spaces for women within PHC clinics have allowed women to talk and learn about specific issues related to their health. Participating fellows praised the project and some have remained working in PHC in rural areas.",
          "The project contributes to progress towards several Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicators and is integrated with the national PHC strengthening project known as PROACT-Care that is led by the government and WHO with collaboration from UNFPA and UNICEF and funded by international partners including the Universal Health Coverage Partnership."

          "“You never knew if you were going to survive,” recalls a man from rural Azerbaijan as he recounts painful journeys to the nearest functioning health facility while he was ill. 1 Providing high-quality PHC is one of the main challenges facing the Azerbaijani health system. PHC is the main entryway to healthcare, an important avenue for disease prevention, key to limiting health costs and in Azerbaijan’s polyclinic model covers some specialized outpatient treatment. For women, comprehensive PHC is critical to improving health outcomes across the life course and promoting health and economic equity in order to make progress on SDG indicators such as maternal and child mortality. Current gaps in PHC provision therefore negatively impact Azerbaijan’s population in multiple ways, with particular disparities in rural areas.",
          "Not far from the capital Baku, in the region around Shamakhi, over half the population is rural. PHC services here are either closed or barely used with a dire shortage of trained PHC workers, a lack of clinical equipment and crumbling infrastructure further limiting the care available. Healthcare workers trained in Azerbaijan tend to not seek employment in PHC or rural areas and workforce shortages have worsened in the last decade. When COVID-19 struck, the lack of resilience in PHC had damaging consequences for the wider health system.",
          "In light of these challenges, PHC has been identified as a key mechanism to strengthen Azerbaijan’s health system. To improve PHC resilience with local solutions, the PROACT-Care project was launched in 2021. 2 Building on PROACT-Care, a pilot to specifically improve PHC workforce development launched in July 2021 with support from WHO SDG3 recovery challenge funds.",
          "This pilot project funded 164 Shamakhi fellows to live in the area and learn, train in and deliver community-orientated PHC for 6 months. Fellows were selected from medical students, nurses and international experts with specialties including women’s health. The project supported PHC workforce development nationally with conferences and healthcare education training. Funding also supported an emergency care (EMC) week in collaboration with Turkey’s Ministry of Health and a diverse group of stakeholders. The importance of robust connections between EMC and PHC has been strongly illustrated in the pandemic.",
          "By building on PROACT-Care, fellowships were implemented quickly using structures already in place, such as well-equipped PROACT-Care mobile clinics. The project supported other PHC-strengthening work such as UNICEF’s universal-progressive home visiting programme, led by the Government of Azerbaijan with funding and technical support from UNICEF.  The home visiting programme also sought to increase access to PHC, providing home visit services for pregnant women and young children in Shamakhi between May 2021 and January 2022 3 by training and monitoring PHC workers, nurses and midwives, who worked in tandem with Shamakhi fellows.",
          "Taken together, the human impact of all these projects includes more PHC delivery for rural populations, reduced inequalities due to PHC service gaps, increased health literacy and better training for healthcare workers nationally to improve PHC for underserved populations in the short, medium and long term.",
          "“I am grateful to them for they have come and are serving us well. It is accessible for everyone,” recalls a woman seen in a mobile clinic. 4 Some women had potentially serious conditions referred for further investigation, such as breast lumps, illustrating the importance of PHC for prevention and early diagnosis. Healthcare workers discussed steps that women could take themselves, such as self-examination and contraception, boosting PHC resilience and health literacy.",
          "Travelling to remote populations in need, some fellows worked from the mobile clinics. Training materials were translated into Azerbaijani for wider reach. Fellows developed training modules themselves including in maternal and child health and conducted research, data collection and standards development. National development activities raised the profile of PHC and promoted PHC as a career path. The inclusion of student fellows helps to embed PHC awareness and experience in the next generation of healthcare workers. EMC week produced a range of implementation plans linking EMC improvement with PHC strengthening.",
          "Many fellows praised the Shamakhi project for increasing their interest in PHC, with a third of Azerbaijan fellows remaining to work in rural PHC settings. “I did not have an understanding of what primary healthcare was until I came to Shamakhi. Now I understand its importance,” one fellow said of the experience.",
          "Both PROACT-Care and the Shamakhi project involved GAP partner agencies UNFPA and UNICEF, government at multiple levels, universities and other Member States. UNICEF noted that “we value the strong partnership and coordination with WHO and UNFPA to build the capacity of PHC personnel, strengthen the overall PHC system, improve its resilience and preparedness, while supporting the Government to ensure its sustainability.”",
          "WHO SDG3 recovery funds supported expansion and acceleration of the Shamakhi pilot project, with 3 tranches of funding providing continuity that enabled the project to develop and progress. The training modules developed will be used from autumn 2022 and the fellowship model has been proposed for other rural areas, providing innovative ways to improve PHC workforce development and address workforce shortages. Partners including Azerbaijan’s government, the WHO country office and UNICEF are currently securing funding to support this rollout.",
          "Through its efforts to strengthen PHC, Azerbaijan is now in a better position to make progress on SDG3 indicators including maternal and child health and to accelerate the provision of resilient and high quality PHC for everyone in the country, regardless of where they live."

The damaging impact of such fragmentation is particularly evident in humanitarian emergencies. Despite advances in mental health reform, there are still challenges such as insufficient financing and service coverage. Mental health and social support needs have also increased due to emergencies such as floods, droughts, refugee migration from Venezuela - the largest displacement in recent Latin American history 1 - and the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Often, the most marginalized groups face the worst outcomes. UNICEF reports that “… MHPSS for children and adolescents remains a challenge aggravated by COVID-19 in the context of the Venezuelan migratory crisis in Roraima state… There are no specialized services in the state for this population and professionals in the local MHPSS network do not feel prepared to attend to children and adolescents, particularly migrant populations.” However, if responded to appropriately, emergencies can become opportunities to improve health systems. 3"

This approach calls for decentralized and people-centred mental health and social support responses that are adapted for local needs, integrated with PHC and that do not rely on specialist mental health services, which are often inaccessible or scarce in emergencies.

The 21 participating organizations included humanitarian and migration organizations, UN agencies and government at multiple levels such as the Ministries of Health and Citizenship and Municipality and State Health Secretaries from Boa Vista and Roraima, areas that have seen large numbers of Venezuelan migrants.",

Knowledge about the current availability of MHPSS is an important first step for coordination. A lack of quality research for the Brazilian context was revealed, particularly at population level and about non-specialized mental health support. Very few studies related to underserved groups, such as migrants and indigenous people. These findings serve as further justification for national-level MHPSS guidelines to focus on PHC, social care and mental health integration and equity. Finally, a mental health stigma awareness campaign was launched during the project implementation period, supported by PAHO/WHO Brazil and Foundation Mapfre, tackling a widespread problem that can stop people from seeking mental health support."

Concerns regarding mental health often are put in second place, which embraces not only clinical healthcare but also social connections. However, all these aspects contribute to the successful inclusion of this population... From the data and learnings gained with this mapping, we now have a more precise understanding of needs and the scope of action of organizations that provide MHPSS to the refugee and migrant population in Brazil.”",

Alongside work by the Brazilian government, other organizations and agencies, linkages between key actors have been formed, incentivized and harmonized that strengthen leadership, governance and intersectoral collaboration and coordination. All these efforts bring sustainable and long-term progress in integrating MHPSS with PHC to support people suffering during humanitarian emergencies, and for improving PHC, mental health and well-being more widely for all people in Brazil."

The RMS improved the timeliness and quality of mortality data notification from health facilities and the community and increased\r\n    the coverage and completeness of death and cause-of-death registration, which led to an enhanced understanding of the epidemiology of all-cause mortalities. This in turn contributed to the identification of risk factors associated with severe outcomes\r\n    of COVID-19 and improved the monitoring of longer term epidemiologic trends and the evolution of the virus.

Another\r\n    cause is inadequate coordination and collaboration among the various actors working at national and subnational levels as a result of the complexity of the development ecosystem, the multiplicity of actors, and devolution which means that county governments\r\n    have decision-making power and are autonomous from the national government. Every country needs real-time, accurate, reliable and disaggregated population level data on births, deaths, marriages and other key life events, as this ensures that it can\r\n    effectively plan, allocate and use resources, and evaluate and monitor progress, including progress towards universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Not counting people when they are born for instance, means that they\r\n    are likely to be invisible to key services, and they may face barriers to accessing health, education and other services. This in turn contributes to increasing inequities especially for those that are at risk of being left behind."

The initiative takes a two-pronged approach which focuses on improving coordination and collaboration among actors working on CRVS as well as strengthening the CRVS system and improving\r\n    the quality, completeness and timeliness of data.",
          "A key part of this involved the establishment in August 2020 of a UN Legal Identify Agenda (UNLIA) Taskforce by the United Nations Country Team (UNCT). The Taskforce - which includes SDG3 GAP partners UNDP, UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA, and UN Women - was created\r\n    to coordinate the implementation of UN Legal Identity Agenda (UNLIA) activities in Kenya. UNLIA advocates for a global life cycle model of legal identity \"from birth to death” and has prioritised CRVS improvement efforts as part of the ongoing\r\n    process of establishing a National Integrated Identity Management System (NIIMS). The Taskforce has supported a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening CRVS in Kenya. This includes a mid-term review of the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics\r\n    Strategy 2018-2023 which assessed the extent to which the objectives of the strategy had been met and identified gaps which could be used to inform the development of the next strategic plan. The review resulted in the development and validation of\r\n    a roadmap to operationalise the Kenya Partnership and Coordination Framework 2018-2030 that is now being implemented."

The Scope of Work Agreement also maps UN entities’ areas of interest as well as areas of possible partnership with the government.",

In June 2018,\r\n    as part of these efforts, UNICEF supported a ‘ Productivity Improvement of Civil Registration Services ’ workshop which aimed to review the Civil Registration ecosystem. At the workshop, the primary challenges in the user journey\r\n    from both the supply and demand perspectives were identified and an action plan was proposed to address the identified challenges with new technology. The action plan covered the following four thematic areas: modernization of civil registration,\r\n    digitization of records, review of the legal and policy framework, and capacity building and awareness creation. In addition, UNICEF supported a high-level multi-sectoral civil registration benchmarking mission to Estonia and Netherlands, with the\r\n    aim of exploring comprehensive end-to-end CRVS systems and the operationalization of unique identifiers. The agency has also supported civil registration activities in selected counties, often by working with schools and early childhood centres to\r\n    improve birth registration coverage. These activities typically include community sensitization components on topics such as birth registration.",

In addition to this,\r\n    it has procured key digital registration equipment, and it is training registrars to use the equipment as well as developing legal instruments and guidelines that provide the legal framework for the integration of the registration systems and ensure\r\n    data protection and privacy. In addition, UNDP is working with UNICEF to identify target counties and sub-counties where registration is below 50% and consulting extensively with the department of Civil Registration Services on how to make improvements.\r\n    In terms of the functional registry, UNDP supports the Independent Electoral and Boundary Commission with registering voters for every electoral cycle, when requested."

          "These efforts to strengthen partnerships and collaboration and improve CVRS and health data are having real impact for people and their communities. In June 2021, the Kenyan Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Health began implementing rapid mortality\r\n    surveillance (RMS) in six high COVID-19-burden and border counties, with support from its partners. These partners included UNICEF which led the development of the platform for collecting the data, and WHO, US-CDC and other UNLIA partners which provided\r\n    funding and technical support for the programme. The initiative aimed to generate timely, quality mortality data during the COVID-19 pandemic by streamlining, strengthening and improving the coverage and completeness of death and cause-of-death notifications\r\n    from the community and health facility levels. An interactive Mobile SMS platform for real-time death notification was set up using RapidPro software. Registration agents from health facilities and communities were trained on death notification and\r\n    a “Power BI” dashboard was established to aggregate and visualize the data daily.",
          "The results have been significant. For instance, by June 2022, about 31,000 deaths had been notified using the RMS system. The data, which was disaggregated, showed important details such as the fact that about 60% of the deaths were notified from the\r\n    communities, a third of the deaths were among the elderly aged >65, and a higher proportion of these were male deaths. This improved data collection and analysis led to enhanced understanding of the epidemiology of all-cause mortalities in the\r\n    six counties and contributed to better decision-making around both the COVID-19 response and health more generally.",
          "Another example is the implementation of the one-day service model for civil registration which allowed Mama Jane Chebeni to collect the birth certificates for her two school-aged children at the CRVS Office in Bungoma County in just two hours. Mama Chebeni\r\n    was delighted both with the speed of the process and the fact that her children will be able to stay in school now that they have their birth certificates."

          "Prevention of health care-associated neonatal sepsis through effective IPC is a priority for Viet Nam . In the context of improving the quality of skilled delivery and post-delivery care, the country’s main focus is on the national IPC programme, providing IPC guidance and training, good hand hygiene practices, and observation and attention to the built environment. In a pilot hospital, cases of probable and proved neonatal sepsis decreased by three quarters.",
          "Continued political and leadership commitment from the Ministry of Health in Chile has resulted in remarkable and sustained national IPC efforts since 1982. Having infection prevention and control measures implemented is mandatory by law for every facility since 2010. In 2020 94.3% of 174 public hospitals reported established IPC programmes and between 2000 and 2019, the national IPC programme documented an 80% reduction in the rate of health care-associated infections being monitored in the country.",
          "During the COVID-19 pandemic Kazakhstan boosted IPC capacities at a national level through rapidly establishing or strengthening all core components of IPC programmes, including extensive IPC training of front-line health workers and assessment and improvement of practices at the point of care in healthcare facilities. IPC has been included as part of the second direction of the national “Healthy Nation” strategic programme, which will be implemented by the Government during the next five years.",
          "In Bangladesh the COVID-19 crisis became the impetus for developing stronger national and health care facility IPC preparedness to outbreaks. The ‘National Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19’, as well as a national guideline on IPC for both public and private health care facilities were introduced, including by training 12 733 doctors, nurses and support staff. This was followed by a rapid scale up of IPC measures including hand hygiene.",
          "The Sultanate of Oman has used its national action plan on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as the entry point to strengthen infection prevention and control. They launched their National Policy and Action Plan on AMR in May 2016 and the national IPC programme is the coordinating body for the implementation of this plan with the other stakeholders through the National AMR committee. The  national system for AMR and health care-associated infection surveillance has recently reported that 46-73% of bloodstream infections due to resistant pathogens were acquired in health care. These data triggered action to increase education and expertise in infection prevention and control in health care facilities.",
          "Ghana has streamlined national IPC and WASH through linkages to quality-of-care programmes and a costed national strategy; this was reflected in strong national efforts such as the creation of a national joint IPC and WASH Taskforce in 2016, producing a national technical guide, and strong leadership and finances invested to support IPC and WASH in health care facilities.",

          "Designing and implementing policies to reduce the consumption of alcohol is a significant challenge globally. The situation is no different in Brazil. The country experiences the harmful effects of substance use in numerous areas. For example, the toil of alcohol consumption can be felt in the healthcare system and economy. It also has links to rates of domestic violence and road crashes.",
          "In an effort to make changes locally, Dr Ana Cecilia P. R. Marques, a psychiatrist and researcher at the Federal University of São Paulo, set out to develop a programme targeting alcohol consumption in the city of Tarumã. Located in the state of São Paulo, Tarumã is a small city with a population of 15,300 (1) . At the time of the programme’s inception, the city faced first-hand the effects of excessive drinking and drug use, mainly its association with increased violence.",
          "In 2007, Dr Marques and the city mayor, secretary of health, education and social services, and community leaders launched the programme Periscópio. As Dr Marques describes, by working across education, health, and the social welfare sector, Periscópio’s design “aims at reaching all Tarumã residents, from the foetus to the elderly”. The programme applies a range of evidence-based strategies and community approaches focused on prevention, education, awareness-raising and the reduction of excessive drinking and treatment for people affected by alcohol addiction.",

          "Since 2007, the Periscópio has undergone four phases of implementation, beginning with a local needs and resource assessment, then the design of tailored activities and an initial and further evaluation of performance.",
          "The implementation of Periscópio has relied on efforts across city departments of education, health and social welfare. For example, in the education sector, the programme has focused on reaching children, teenagers and young adults. As Dr Kaled El Sahli, Pediatric Psychiatrist affiliated with the programme, describes, “the objective is to converge in a well-tuned way, [for] health within the educational area.”",
          "The programme has also included the development of pro-active preventative measures in schools to identify and address childhood risk factors for drug misuse behaviours as adolescents. A multidisciplinary screening protocol was developed and applied in schools, with students receiving psycho-pedagogical therapies after being diagnosed by a training team as having mental, learning, behavioural and familial difficulties.",
          "In the community, inspections of the availability and ease of access to illicit products for individuals under 18 are carried out. The programme also includes frequent meetings with parents and other community members, such as bar owners, to build their first-hand capacity for delivering brief alcohol interventions.",
          "The Periscópio programme works to train teachers in schools to reach teenagers and young adults about the harmful effects of alcohol . Credit: WHO/Achocolatado Filmes",
          "The Periscópio programme is also active in reaching bar owners. As Tarumã bar owner Silvio da Silva describes: “I support the project workers going to bars and holding meetings with the owners. This visit the project workers are doing at my bar should, if possible, be done with each bar owner.” Credit: WHO/Achocolatado Filmes.",
          "Collaborations across stakeholders and the support of local authorities are among key factors contributing to Periscópio’s success",
          "The ongoing implementation of the Periscópio programme has benefited from the support of several layers of stakeholders, ranging from municipal authorities to city professionals in education, health, social assistance and the programme’s beneficiaries of various age groups and social strata.",
          "The programme has also withstood changes in city administration. Throughout, it has consistently benefited from the support of the mayors of Tarumã, so much so that in 2016, the programme was transformed into a municipal policy of “comprehensive care for users of alcohol and other drugs” (Municipal Law 1.199/2016 (2) ). In doing so, the programme is now a mandatory part of the pluriannual plan of the city, meaning it is included in the annual budget laws.",
          "Drawing from the experience of Periscópio, cities interested in implementing a similar programme should focus on identifying local priorities, building mechanisms for regular monitoring, and working across stakeholders in an integrated, whole-of-community approach.",

The NBW is a three-day event facilitated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), bringing together public health and animal health participants. The NBW objective is to analyze and improve the collaboration between the two sectors in preventing, detecting and responding to zoonotic diseases and other health events at the animal-human interface (food safety, food security, antimicrobial resistance). As an outcome of the NBW, a comprehensive long-term national Roadmap (NBW Roadmap) was developed, covering priority areas identified by participants.",

Due to challenges related to COVID-19, almost 70% of the activities are yet to be implemented. Considering that, an updated action plan for the One Health approach implementation (OH action plan), covering not only zoonotic diseases but also food safety and biosafety, was developed to be implemented by 2025. One of the important activities included in the OH action plan was to establish a coordinated government One Health mechanism or platform in Kazakhstan using the WHO-FAO-OIE Multisectoral, One Health, Coordination Mechanism Operational Tool (MCM OT). The collaborative government platform allows ministries (or agencies) to interact on a regular basis to support improved preparedness and response for health challenges at the animal-human-environment interface, including zoonotic diseases.

The National Project was approved by a decree of the Government of Kazakhstan in October 2021 with perfect timing to support the MCM OT pilot.",

          "Ethics and medical radiological imaging: a policy brief for health care providers stresses the importance of integrating ethics into the existing framework designed to protect people from harmful radiation effects during\r\n    medical procedures. The new brief highlights the need to put patients at the centre of health care and to deliver radiological imaging in an ethical way. The existing framework is based on two fundamental principles: justification of the procedures and optimization of radiation protection for both patients and health workers. Conformity with those principles was assumed sufficient to ensure ethical good\r\n    practice in medical imaging. But over the past 25 to 30 years, the use of ionizing radiation in medicine has greatly increased, prompting a growing recognition of the need to make explicit reference to ethics. Over the same period, stakeholders in health care have been placing greater\r\n    emphasis on patient-centred care. “The optimal balance between radiation benefits and risks must be ensured” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health. “Whenever radiological imaging procedures are proposed, only necessary\r\n    examinations should be performed, and patients should know they can expect appropriate, timely and safe services.” This lack of awareness of ethical standards, which has recently come to prominence, may have profound consequences for patients, raising the need for WHO and relevant partners to address it. “All patients have a right to ethical health care, including being informed about and involved in decisions regarding their diagnosis and treatment” said Dr John Reeder, WHO Director, Department of Research for Health. “Dignity, respect,\r\n    privacy and confidentiality should be maintained throughout their care.” While the policy brief is intended primarily to raise awareness among clinicians who request radiological imaging procedures and those who deliver radiological services on a day-to-day basis, WHO hopes it will also empower the hundreds of millions of\r\n    patients who need these procedures and services, and their families. Ultimately, it aims to spark an overdue cultural change in medical imaging and propel it closer to current general approaches to patient-centred health care delivery and safety."

          "Ever since Sir Ronald Ross discovered malaria parasites in an Anopheles mosquito in 1897, controlling insect vectors has played an increasingly important role in reducing the burden of the disease. For decades after World War II, indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides was the only weapon against mosquitoes and proved a blunt and reasonably effective instrument for protecting people inside their homes. Then, beginning in the early 2000s, insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) became a new addition to countries’ vector control strategies.",
          "Thanks, in part, to the wide deployment of these 2 WHO-recommended interventions, the world made remarkable gains against malaria in the period 2000–2015. But progress plateaued, and this troubling slowdown was exacerbated by COVID-19. According\r\n    to WHO’s latest World malaria report ,\r\n 2020 saw a rise in the global burden of malaria, with an estimated 627 000 deaths and 241 million new cases of the disease.",
          "Getting back on track, and meeting WHO’s targets of a 90% reduction in malaria case incidence and mortality rates by 2030, will require renewed global attention, increased funding, and continued research and development of new interventions, among\r\n    other actions. In the field vector control, researchers are working on several innovations that aim to enhance efforts to combat the disease."

Scientists are working to enhance pyrethroids’ lethality or find other more potent insecticides suitable for the treatment of nets.",
          "Several new types of nets are now being tested that include a pyrethroid (still a highly potent mosquito killer) and an additional chemical, sterilizing agent, or insecticide. One recent large trial in the United Republic of Tanzania suggested that the\r\n    new Interceptor G2 nets – treated with both a pyrethroid and chlorfenapyr, a different class of chemical not previously used for vector control – showed a marked improvement in preventing malaria over pyrethroid-only nets.",
          "“It’s really encouraging to see these results from a very robust clinical trial,” says Dr Hilary Ranson of the Department of Vector Biology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. But “there is a huge variation in mosquito\r\n    populations across Africa, and extrapolating from one setting to a whole continent is a big step,” she added. Another large trial of new nets in Benin should provide more results by the end of the year."

One company pitched the idea of attractive targeted sugar bait (ATSB), an outdoor\r\n    bait station to attract and kill mosquitoes.",
          "An ATSB station is the size of an A4 sheet, with small pouches containing a sugary matrix laced with insecticide. The bait is covered by a soft black membrane that allows mosquitoes to feed through while being protected against rain and dust. Two bait\r\n    stations are placed at a height of 1.8 meters on outside walls of every house, so they’re kept out of reach of young children and animals.",
          "ATSBs are currently being tested in Mali, Zambia, and Kenya and have already shown great promise, while being much less arduous than spraying. “Compared to IRS,” notes Mondy, “it is much simpler to train health workers to nail ATSBs\r\n    on the sides of houses.” Full results are expected by 2025."

          "Another innovation that could alleviate some of the burdens of indoor spraying is spatial repellents, which release volatile chemicals into the air that change mosquito behaviour. “With IRS,” says Dr Nicole Achee, a medical entomologist at\r\n    the University of Notre Dame, “mosquitoes have to lay or rest on a chemically treated surface” to be affected. But with spatial repellents, they “interact with chemicals in the air that have dispersed throughout the treated area.”",
          "Spatial repellents carry other advantages too. They can be distributed on a surface that is as small as a sheet of paper – no fire or electricity required. “This might be something you put in a box on a bicycle and easily deliver to a community,”\r\n    says Achee. They also last much longer than traditional repellents and don’t need to be frequently reapplied like topical anti-mosquito products. And like ATSBs, spatial repellents, once they have received a WHO recommendation, could be used\r\n    by anyone to protect against malaria and diseases such as dengue, as long as instructions on proper use are followed."

But when you have multiple interventions out there, it protects the progress that we’re making. - Dr Sunil Parikh, Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases, Yale School of Public Health",
          "Another new frontier is endectocides or drugs that, when ingested by humans, exert an effect on mosquitoes that bite them. Originally used to treat onchocerciasis , ivermectin – the most studied endectocide to date – also seemed to have an adverse effect on mosquitoes. “If mosquitoes were captured that had fed on people given ivermectin, they did not\r\n    survive very well,” says Dr Sunil Parikh, Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases at the Yale School of Public Health.",
          "For ivermectin to effectively control mosquitoes, however, humans would have to take a higher or more frequent doses than used for deworming. Pilot studies suggest that giving humans ivermectin more frequently might curb the mosquito population enough\r\n    to reduce malaria transmission, and other studies have found the drug can be safely taken at higher doses. Several larger studies are now under way to confirm those results and to investigate other potential endectocides.",
          "“What’s exciting about endectocides,” says Dr Parikh, “is that the person is essentially walking around with something in their blood that is lethal to mosquitoes that bite indoors, outdoors, daytime, night-time. So, you potentially\r\n    have an impact on mosquitoes of many different flavours and habits.”"

          "While field trials are still several years away, another intriguing new approach is genetic modification of mosquitoes. “Genetic changes are made specifically in the malaria vector to reduce malaria transmission,” explains Dr Mike Santos,\r\n    Director of GeneConvene, a global collaborative focused on genetic biocontrol technologies for public health.",
          "Once released into the wild, these genetically modified mosquitoes would pass on their changes to other malaria vectors. Dr Mamadou Coulibaly, principal investigator at Target Malaria, explains one such approach: “If you release a male mosquito\r\n    that has this gene drive technology, it will impair the fertility of the female when it mates, so there’s no progeny and the population is reduced.”",
          "The great advantage of gene drive approaches to vector control is their area-wide effect. Gene drive technology might someday play a particularly important role in hard-to-reach areas, where it may be difficult to deploy other malaria control tools as\r\n    effectively, notes Santos. Coulibaly agrees: “It doesn’t discriminate between poor and rich. Once the technology is employed, it can do the job wherever mosquitoes are.”",
          "For now, gene drive is being tested only in large-scale laboratory experiments. But Coulibaly hopes after further study it too can help stop malaria’s spread. “This is a new technology, and I cannot ask people to embrace it with closed eyes,”\r\n    he says. “But this is also an opportunity to save more lives.”"

So, novel interventions that address the growing spread of insecticide resistance and more “atypical” malaria vector behaviours are going to be really important to fill vector control gaps and therefore better\r\n    protect people from the bites of infected mosquitoes.",

Their widespread use has led to now-widespread increases in insects’ resistance to the chemicals commonly used in both interventions. They have also allowed mosquitoes that were historically secondary vectors, due to their different biting behaviours, to now become primary vectors,  playing a much more important role in malaria transmission.",

In the past, we’ve relied on fixed post distributions, meaning that\r\n    we distributed from a central point, with large numbers of people assembling to come and collect nets.",
          "With COVID-19 and the need to ensure the safety of our health care workers and of communities, we moved to door-to-door distribution of bed nets. While the approach is more expensive, it has allowed us to deliver prevention tools to hard-to-reach populations\r\n    that might otherwise not have accessed fixed distribution points.",
          "During our last bed net distribution campaign in 2020, we achieved very high coverage rates, which has translated into greater net use. The door-to-door approach has also allowed community health workers to engage with families more directly, and ensure\r\n    they understand why, and how, they should use bed nets. COVID-19 forced us to adapt, and that adaption led to positive outcomes, so we plan on continuing to use this approach.",
          "When it comes to seasonal malaria chemoprevention, what are some of the challenges you’ve faced, and how have you overcome them?",
          "In recent years, we’ve tested different methods to improve adherence to treatment. One of the greatest issues with chemoprevention is that while community health workers can observe administration of the first dose, the second and third doses are\r\n    given by the caregiver without supervision. As we’re not able to send community health workers to households that frequently to verify administration, we’ve worked to identify “leader” households to act as mentors within each\r\n    village, and whose role it is to remind parents or caregivers to give their children their second and third doses.",

Historically, that has been an issue in Cameroon, and we’ve been worried that reported incidence and mortality rates don’t reflect reality. Microscopy (a key\r\n    malaria detection tool) has been an issue because many technicians are not properly trained, which leads to mistakes in the way they prepare and read the slides. We also have had issues with the quality of microscopes themselves, and of the reagents\r\n    that are used to stain the blood sample to help with visualization of malaria parasites.",

This improvement is remarkable given that both countries continue to find evidence of P. falciparum malaria with partial resistance to artemisinin, the core component used in antimalarial medication.",

In many cases, they leverage support from existing village\r\n    malaria workers by expanding their roles to reinforce early diagnosis, vector control, and prophylaxis for at-risk communities, including targeted drug administration (TDA) and intermittent preventive treatment for forest goers (IPTf).

The “last mile” activities were launched in November 2020 and\r\n    cover the five provinces where malaria transmission still occurs. That year, the country recorded 961 P. falciparum cases. By the end of 2021 the country broke its own records with only 341 P. falciparum cases.",
          "Although the recent activities have seen promising results, the building blocks for better community dialogue on malaria elimination have been years in the making. The success of the last mile was contingent on villagers in high-risk areas agreeing to\r\n    increased testing, regular fever screening, and in some cases, taking preventive antimalarial medication. This expansion meant that village malaria workers needed to gain recognition as reliable sources of malaria care services in their communities.",

To ensure this, village malaria workers were selected for their ability to foster trust and establish themselves as the first point of contact for\r\n    anyone who thought they may have contracted the disease.",

          "“I needed to find a way for village malaria workers to understand the importance of increasing testing to make test positivity rates meaningful. I asked them to imagine that a guest arrived in their village, and the first house they see is a yard\r\n    with weeds. If they only visit this house, they might say that the village has a weed problem. But if they visit every garden, they’d see that all the other houses are flourishing with vegetables and the yard with weeds is an anomaly.”",
          "Chenda explains that this example helped the village malaria workers understand that by visiting every house (or by testing every person), they could show a more realistic picture of the presence of weeds (or malaria) in their village. Two months after\r\n    Chenda shared this analogy with all the village malaria workers in his area, the province saw an increase in malaria testing from 8000 to 10 000 tests per month."

What quickly emerged was a picture of highly distinct communities with complex epidemiological and cultural influences that were having an impact on malaria transmission.",

          "In humanitarian crises, such as those ongoing in Afghanistan,\r\nEthiopia, Yemen, and more recently Ukraine and neighbouring countries, the scale\r\nof the need, coupled with the severe shortage of mental health specialists,\r\nmeans that other means of providing mental health and psychosocial support are\r\nrequired.",
          "Psychological interventions can be effectively delivered by non-specialists such as community workers, when they receive training and supervision. However, training and supervision may vary in quality, which can lead to less effective care.",
          "Ensuring high quality and effective psychological support",
          "To ensure quality in training and supervision, WHO, in partnership with UNICEF, developed the Ensuring Quality in Psychological Support (EQUIP) platform. EQUIP guides trainers and supervisors on how to change their existing programmes into competency-based approaches. A competency-based approach uses role plays and assessments of skills to ensure that helpers not only have the knowledge but also the skills needed to deliver quality support.",
          "“Since 2019, the EQUIP project has collaborated with multiple organizations around the world to develop a competency-based approach that can be applied to training of psychological interventions, ” said Dr Mark van Ommeren, whose team is leading the EQUIP programme at WHO. “Through the EQUIP project, tools were developed that are needed by trainers and supervisors to ensure trainees are highly skilled and competent in helping people with depression and anxiety.”",
          "Rozane El Masri, a research coordinator with War Child Lebanon, evaluated the use of EQUIP in training helpers of adolescents affected by armed conflict. She reported that the EQUIP approach significantly enhanced training outcomes. “EQUIP enables trainers to really zoom in on what our trainees need. We understand what areas we need to focus on during training and tailor our sessions accordingly,” she said. Use of EQUIP in Lebanon with non-specialist helpers supporting children and adolescents led to a 17% increase in skill levels compared to standard training approaches. Trainings in Peru and other countries have shown similarly meaningful results.",
          "Launch of digital training for greater accessibility",
          "Before the pandemic, EQUIP was largely delivered by in-person training. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the training increasingly moved online. Carla Mirea Sandoval Zapata, a community health worker in Lima, Peru, associated with Socios de Salud (Partners in Health), benefitted from the online resources during the pandemic. Carla said: “I was able to support my neighbour who lost her husband to COVID-19 and was dealing with profound grief. She has now started to slowly get back to her routine and engage with her family members. I’m grateful to have these skills that enable me to support my community, particularly at a time when the mental health of so many people has been impacted.”",
          "Today, WHO and UNICEF are formally launching the digital version of EQUIP, making the platform freely available to support trainers and supervisors. This will considerably increase the accessibility and quality of psychological interventions. In so doing, training programmes around the world will be better positioned to deliver skilled helpers to improve mental health and reduce suffering."

          "RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) is the first vaccine recommended by WHO for\r\n use against a human parasitic disease of any kind. If introduced widely, it could save tens of thousands of lives each year. The Government of Malawi was the first to launch the vaccine in a landmark pilot programme in April 2019. In this Q&A,\r\n    Dr Mike Chisema, Malawi Ministry of Health, reflects on the pilot experience and how coordination with the national malaria programme was a key factor for success.",
          "Q: On 6 October 2021, WHO recommended the first malaria vaccine for children at risk. What were some of your first reactions?",
          "This was an important decision, a time to celebrate and appreciate Malawi’s role in reaching this point, and what we’ve achieved as a country. The reaction in Malawi was very positive, and people welcomed the inclusion of the malaria vaccine\r\n    as an additional instrument that can support progress toward malaria elimination, as it reduces illness and child deaths from malaria in endemic countries, including in high-burden ones like Malawi.",
          "Q: What’s been most notable about Malawi’s experience with the RTS,S malaria vaccine to date?",
          "The collaboration between the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) and the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) during the pilot was a success, and that of the evaluation partners (led by the University of Malawi College of Medicine). Normally,\r\n    as the EPI, we meet quarterly with technical working groups, bi-annually with the Malawi Immunization Technical Advisory Group (MITAG), and then we have some meetings with committees aligned to different vaccines. For the malaria vaccine, we were\r\n    constantly in touch with the NMCP and other stakeholders and this helped us remain vibrant in our implementation.",
          "The introduction of the malaria vaccine provided an opportunity to expand and diversify our approach to immunization delivery more broadly, as other routine immunization services were able to benefit from whatever was being done for the malaria vaccine\r\n    pilot. Even the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines benefited from these synergies.",
          "Q: How did the routine immunization programme benefit from the pilot?",
          "First, we were able to expand the country’s entire immunization supply chain. Sometimes you find that you can hardly get the vaccines to the people, perhaps due to lack of resources, but here we had an opportunity to improve our systems, and to\r\n    make sure districts were not stocked out of any vaccines. We never had any stock outs of the malaria vaccine because there was massive communication with cluster facilities and districts. Second, regarding vaccine safety, the reporting of adverse\r\n    events following immunization improved quite a lot, not just for the malaria vaccine but also for routine immunizations.",
          "The pilots had an impact on the delivery of immunization trainings. We learned so much about how to provide education tools to health care workers, improve information, education and communication activities, as well as about risk communications and community\r\n    engagement—and we’ve been able to apply all of these lessons learned to other routine immunizations.",
          "Q: We hear about COVID-19 impeding progress against other diseases. How did the malaria vaccine experience support the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines?",
          "Overall, it’s about the support and knowledge we gained. WHO provided both technical and financial support, and in the course of doing that for the malaria vaccine, they also supported the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out, which was very powerful. We are\r\n    very lean when it comes to human resources, and now we had this extra support for the delivery of the malaria vaccine pilot, as well as other vaccines.",
          "The malaria vaccine pilot offered an opportunity to find new ways and means to get into the communities and mobilize them to demand the vaccine. That made it easier when COVID-19 vaccines were introduced.",
          "Solutions to challenges we faced along the way were not just coming from within the country, they were coming from across the region and the globe. That was very helpful. - Dr Chisema",
          "Q: What lessons from the pilot would you share with other countries interested in the vaccine?",
          "The burden of malaria is not just felt by health care providers, it’s also felt by communities. We have a role to play in providing communities with the information they need to make informed decisions about the vaccine. Countries\r\n    should also recognize that there is likely to be high demand for this vaccine. In Malawi, we saw communities demanding the vaccine both where it was being provided, and in neighboring clusters, which was very good in terms of demonstrating the vaccine’s\r\n    acceptability.",
          "Countries will still need to go through the normal process of introducing a vaccine, and they should not take any shortcuts. Good ground preparation is very important: to make sure the vaccinators are informed, well trained and oriented. Countries need\r\n    to make sure their supply chains and data systems are robust and in place, and that they are coordinating with relevant stakeholders – including the malaria control programme, the health education sector, people managing community engagement,\r\n    influential and political leaders, and chiefs and traditional authorities. Countries should maximize every opportunity to provide the beneficiaries of the vaccine with details about the malaria vaccine and engage them in the process.",
          "Q: What is level of interest in the vaccine and what are you hearing from national and local leaders and communities?",
          "The reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, even before the WHO recommendation. If anything, people would have loved for this to happen earlier. When the recommendation was announced, for most leaders this is what they had been looking for. The big\r\n    question now is how to manage the cost of the vaccine, how to secure funding, and how soon the vaccine can be available, knowing the anticipated global supply challenges.",
          "Q: With the WHO recommendation and also Gavi funding for broader deployment , what happens next in Malawi?",
          "We now have direction from the senior management at the Ministry of Health to expand introduction of the vaccine as financing for procurement of doses of vaccine becomes available. Next we will need to write proposals to Gavi and demonstrate how we will\r\n    roll-out the vaccine. These are all questions we’re still trying to address.",
          "We understand that the RTS, S supply will likely be constrained for some years. WHO is coordinating the development of a framework by expert advisers that will guide allocation of the limited vaccine doses. We appreciate the efforts of global and African\r\n    partners to look for means to increase access, so we may reap the benefits of this life-saving vaccine.",
          "Q: What additional support might Malawi need to integrate this vaccine into the national malaria control plan?",
          "We still need strategies to target immunizations between 5, 6 and 7 months of age, knowing that most children will have received most other vaccines by then, and mothers might not have a reason to come back to the health facility. We need those strategies\r\n    in place until mothers get used to it and it becomes routine. We will also need strategies to maximize and optimize vaccine uptake in the second year of life.",
          "Q: Is there anything else you would like to add?",
          "It’s not always easy to introduce a vaccine, but we must do our best, especially considering the public health impact of this malaria vaccine. It’s important to acknowledge the support we received from the senior leadership of the Ministry of Health and from international partners, at all levels. Solutions to challenges we faced along the way were not just coming from within the country, they were coming from across the region and the globe. That was very helpful."

          "13 March 2022 – An important milestone in integrating four key public health programmes was reached last week in Khartoum, Sudan. Staff from four critical areas of state-level health care – poliovirus eradication, immunization, health emergencies, and health system strengthening – met to operationalize their work across all 18 states in Sudan as integrated public health teams. This is a vital step in the polio transition process and in moving towards integration to serve the health needs of people and communities.",
          "“This is a critical development for Sudan, which was responding to a poliovirus type 2 outbreak in 2020 and 2021. After a strong response by national authorities with support from WHO, UNICEF, and other partners, the country is looking to integrate disease surveillance functions and improve immunization for all vaccine-preventable diseases. WHO policy direction in Sudan is to support in building a resilient health system to advance universal health coverage and address health security threats,” says Dr Nima Abid, WHO Representative to Sudan.",
          "A polio transition mission took place in December 2019, led by members of the Regional Working Group on Polio Transition, WHO headquarters’ Polio Transition Team, and the Polio Transition Independent Monitoring Board. As an outcome, a comprehensive plan was developed to operationalize the integrated public health teams approach in Sudan as an interim measure to sustain WHO support for essential polio and other public health functions.",
          "“In the operationalization of integrated public health teams, the functions of technical field staff of polio, health emergencies, Expanded Programme on Immunization, and health systems strengthening are broadened in a way that each technical staff covers all the priority public health functions defined by the country,” explains Dr Mohammad Taufiq Mashal, Medical Officer at the WHO Sudan Country Office, working on polio eradication and transition.",
          "The WHO field technical officers’ network, which includes 18 health emergency-supported officers, 13 polio officers, and six health system officers, will be transformed to make a network of public health officers, with integrated functions in areas of disease surveillance, immunization, and outbreak response.",

          "Like many farmers in Uriri Sub-county, Migori County, Kenya, Omulo used to cultivate tobacco. But no longer.",
          "He is now passionate about his family’s shift to grow alternative crops, confident that their hard work will be the foundation for a brighter future for themselves and their community.",
          "\"I regret planting tobacco for so many years! I wish I knew of other alternatives earlier,\" says Omulo",
          "Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that an estimated 36 000 farmers still produce tobacco leaf, primarily in the Nyanza and western provinces, with some farming in the central and eastern provinces.",
          "But Omulo says many farmers in Uriri Sub-county are now angry because of the poor prices the tobacco companies are paying them.",
          "And it’s bad for the health: a tobacco farmer who plants, cultivates and harvests tobacco may absorb as much nicotine as found in 50 cigarettes in a single day.",
          "It’s also destroying the environment. Tobacco farming leads to depletion of water sources, large-scale deforestation, soil erosion and contamination of the air and water systems.",
          "And it means there’s less land to grow crops to feed people.",
          "\"You have to work hard on the tobacco farms, and you do not know how much you are going to gain because the prices are set by the tobacco companies. This is done on purpose so they can gain more! They also set up so many grades on the crop that it makes it impossible for you as the grower to estimate the yields,\" Omulo said. Farming the crop is labour intensive. Many tobacco farming families in this region have children who continue to miss classes and eventually drop out of school.",
          "WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) are now collaborating on an alternative livelihood project, working with farmers like Omulo in Migori County to use the collective purchasing system within the United Nations and create an enabling and supportive crop production and marketing ecosystem that incentivize farmers to move away from tobacco farming.",
          "\"Over the last few months, we have seen long-time tobacco farmers planting alternative crops like high-iron beans in fields where tobacco once grew – a tremendous achievement in the world of tobacco control. The former tobacco farmers report better health, education gains for their children and increased wages.\"",
          "- Dr Vinayak M Prasad, Unit Head, No Tobacco (TFI) at WHO",
          "According to the Ministry of Agriculture, 330 farmers out of 400 targeted in Migori County have now transitioned successfully to high-iron beans farming.",
          "Many girls in this region previously opted for early marriages as a result of poverty, but \"now there are more children in high schools as they can afford to continue with their education,\" says Omulo."

          "There's a whole fascinating world that exists underneath our feet that we don't see, therefore we don't relate.” Erin Brockovich, environmental activist",
          "The only time many people really think about groundwater is when things have gone terribly wrong— when they hear about community wells drying up or when toxic chemicals have leached into the groundwater, causing long, arduous walks to distant water supplies or cancers that appear after years of exposure.",
          "The reaction is one of horror and sympathy. They look at the water in their glasses differently for a moment. Then they forget.",
          "But it’s important to remember that groundwater provides half of all water used by households worldwide, a quarter of all the water drawn for irrigated agriculture, and one third of the water supply required for industry.",
          "This year’s World Water Day aims to make groundwater more visible.",
          "The launch of the UN World Water Development report sounds the alarm on the many current and impending threats to groundwater, exacerbated by climate change and ever-growing demand — and therefore to the health and wellbeing of billions of people — and challenges to its safe use.",
          "But there are also solutions to these threats that deliver outsized health benefits. It’s time for the world to make good its commitment to fulfil the 2030 sustainable development goal of ensuring universal access to water, sanitation and hygiene.",
          "Protecting groundwater",
          "Improving sanitation management can have a profound impact on drinking-water quality from both surface and vulnerable groundwater sources, particularly when sewage or excreta contaminate drinking-water sources.",
          "Progress on safely managed sanitation needs to accelerate at least four times (many more in some regions) and include greater focus on its impact on groundwater. Efforts must include the application of  sanitation safety planning, a risk-based approach for sanitation systems to assess, prioritize and manage public health risks along the entire sanitation chain (i.e. from toilet, containment-storage/on-site treatment, conveyance, treatment to end-use/disposal) and recommended in WHO’s Guidelines on Sanitation and Health.",
          "It’s also vital to address threats like over-abstraction and climate change, both of which are responsible for reducing groundwater levels, and thus groundwater quality and quantity.",
          "Detailed guidance is available to support the management of groundwater sources used for drinking water, including water safety planning, a complementary approach to sanitation safety planning, applicable to drinking-water systems, from catchment to consumer. Water safety plans are recommended as the most effective approach to ensure the consistent delivery of a safe and acceptable drinking-water supply in WHO’s Guidelines for drinking-water quality.",
          "It’s important to contain naturally occurring chemicals such as fluoride and arsenic , that could be harmful to health at elevated concentrations.",
          "Excessive exposure to manganese from groundwater could be another concern. In these updated Guidelines, the manganese fact sheet has been revised with an updated risk assessment, recommended concentration limits, and expanded risk management advice. More detailed information can be found in the manganese background document for the drinking-water guidelines.",
          "Improving sanitation",
          "Strong government leadership and investment in resilient drinking water and sanitation services will also help protect groundwater. The WHO and UNICEF State of the World’s Sanitation report charts an ambitious way forward to achieve universal access to safe sanitation, presents case studies and highlights challenges, successes and best practices. A companion publication on drinking water will be published later this year by WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank.",
          "Currently, 2.2 billion people have limited access to safe drinking water, and by 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas.",
          "As climate change (and its hydrological impacts) makes itself increasingly known and as population growth and increased industrialization magnify existing threats to aquifers and watersheds, it’s increasingly important to highlight the link between groundwater and health - and to take steps to protect them both."

          "This year the Go.Data team will shift from a reactive to a proactive approach. Their strategy will focus on preparedness, embedding the platform into national training programmes and making the software universally available as a fully open-source product. This activity will be conducted under the forthcoming Open Source Programme Office within the new WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence in Berlin. This approach will promote further ownership and equitable access to Go.Data, while ensuring sustainability and integration within existing health information infrastructures.",
          "\"Every year, governments in many countries need to respond to several new or recurrent outbreaks, sometimes with limited resources, and almost always without advance notice of what is coming,” says Sara Hollis, an epidemiologist in Emergency Event Response for WHO. “If the tools and systems for contact tracing are already in place, you can act quickly and decisively as soon as the signal is received.”",

          "Vaccination has been an instrumental tool in the global fight against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. As of 20 December 2021, globally 4.385 billion persons were vaccinated with at least one dose, which is less than 60% of the world’s\r\n        population. [i] While most of the world’s population is deprived of equitable access to vaccination, in some countries, including the United Kingdom, vaccine hesitancy remains a barrier\r\n        to achieving high vaccination rates. The Francis Crick Institute partnered with London-based Poet In the City to introduce a novel approach to encourage vaccination through art and poetry. After being vaccinated, people share their immediate experiences\r\n        on postcards. These personal expressions are transformed into poetry by Poet In the City’s creative artists. The resulting poetry is displayed outside the centre to reduce fear and concerns linked to the vaccines and educate the public on\r\n        the benefits of vaccination as perceived by peers. The initiative also provides gratification to the vaccinated population as it shares their voices and recognizes their contribution to the wider community and global scientific effort."

The team\r\n    of volunteers engage in science translation work in addition to their day jobs.

The team also transparently cites scientific references from reliable sources, which clarifies\r\n    misinformation and, importantly, facilitates users in their future information searches. Audiences are able to submit questions on the website and receive answers from the team's dedicated experts.",

Facebook is the team’s primary social media platform, where new content is first posted. Articles and posts are cross-published\r\n    across all five channels and are amplified as the audience shares them within their own networks. Content is published on a daily basis to offer readers a consistent and steady source of information on the COVID-19 pandemic. The posts are short, practical\r\n    essays on topics high on the public agenda such as risk assessment, protective measures, testing, mental health, and information hygiene. The project also sends out a bi-weekly email newsletter with posts that are particularly timely."

          "Founded in 1952, the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System , or GISRS, is celebrating its 70 th anniversary.",
          "In the years leading up to GISRS’s founding, memories of the devastating impact of the great influenza pandemic in 1918, which led to as many as 50 million deaths, were still vividly present. The human influenza virus had been isolated in 1933, and the first vaccines had been licensed only a few years earlier in 1945 in the United States. GISRS was created to protect people against seasonal and pandemic influenza: a global problem needed a global solution. The image below shows a nurse taking a patient’s pulse in an influenza ward at Walter Reed Hospital, Washington, District of Columbia, in the United States of America.",
          "Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. (cph 3a39569)",
          "1918",
          "In 1952, only 25 countries had WHO-designated Influenza Centres in place and were able to report laboratory and epidemiological data to WHO, with other observer laboratories co-operating in various regions. The image below shows Professor J.D. Verlinde, from the Institute for Preventative Medicine at Leiden, Holland at his work-bench. The institute was one of the influenza centres collaborating with the World Influenza Centre in London.",
          "1950",
          "Laboratory investigations after influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968 found that the novel pandemic viruses acquired 2 or 3 gene segments from an avian influenza virus and the remaining 5 or 6 segments from previously circulating human influenza A viruses. This finding shed light on the importance of influenza viruses circulating in animal reservoirs, particularly in aquatic fowl and pigs. The image below shows test-tube cultures in which respiratory viruses are grown. Samples were flown to the World Influenza Centre as soon as an outbreak of influenza occurred in any part of the world.",
          "1968",
          "During the 1960s and 1970s, the quality of influenza vaccines improved and their use increased predominantly in industrialized countries. WHO, based on the work by GISRS, began recommending viruses for inclusion in annual seasonal vaccines in 1973.",
          "The GISRS network also continued to expand: by 1973, WHO had recognized 62 National Influenza Centres, of which 6 were in the African Region, 14 in the Region of the Americas, 2 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 30 in the European Region, 3 in the South-East Asian Region, and 7 in the Western Pacific Region.",
          "The image below shows a nasal spray of live flu vaccine.",
          "1976",
          "New laboratory methods continued to be developed in the 1980s and 1990s. Molecular biology opened unforeseen opportunities to intensify the analysis and characterization of influenza viruses.",
          "In late 2003 and in 2004, avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses caused human cases in connection with large outbreaks in poultry in several countries in Asia. The image below shows analysis being done in Indonesia.",
          "2005",
          "Between 2009 and 2010, a new A(H1N1) influenza virus emerged and led to a pandemic causing an estimated 100,000 to 400,000 deaths, with children and young adults most affected.",
          "To improve pandemic influenza preparedness and response by improving and strengthening GISRS, an exemplary international instrument was unanimously adopted in 2011: the Pandemic influenza preparedness framework ( PIP Framework ). The PIP Framework supports the sharing of influenza viruses and the equitable and timely access to vaccines and other benefits.",
          "Testing for antiviral resistance also became a routine task in GISRS laboratories, as it became clear that viruses had become resistant to some anti-influenza medications.",
          "The image below shows the preparation of viral RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) samples by public health professionals at the Nepal Government laboratory for influenza diagnosis.",
          "2010",
          "As of January 2022, GISRS has grown to include 148 National Influenza Centres, seven WHO Collaborating Centres, four Essential Regulatory Laboratories, and 13 H5 Reference Laboratories. Between 2014 and 2019, GISRS tested an average of 3.4 million specimens every year. This surged to 6.7 million tests annually for influenza and 44.2 million tests for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and 2021. GISRS shares around 20 000 influenza virus samples every year to WHO Collaborating Centres, updates the weekly influenza situation based on laboratory and disease surveillance in the WHO FluNet and FluID systems directly or via regional platforms, and distributes timely risk assessments and alerts to countries.",
          "Although GISRS was built to address influenza, it also serves as a critical resource for countries handling non-influenza emergencies. In the COVID-19 pandemic, GISRS has made significant contributions from the start. For example, GISAID, a long-term partner of GISRS, published the first SARS-CoV-2 sequence data hours after it became available. In many countries, National Influenza Centres of GISRS readily became primary hubs for national COVID-19 testing and response. Importantly, GISRS has been conducting integrated sentinel surveillance of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 to guide public health response to the two public health problems concurrently.",

          "In 2021, WHO recommended the first malaria vaccine , RTS,S/AS01, for children at risk, followed by a decision by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to fund malaria vaccine roll-out in sub-Saharan Africa. Together, these two decisions pave the way for broader roll-out of this new vaccine.",
          "Three WHO experts – Dr Mary Hamel, Dr Richard Mihigo and Dr Akpaka Kalu – provide updates on next steps for RTS,S, and how WHO and partners are supporting the vaccine’s wider roll-out.",
          "Q: Dr Hamel, you lead the malaria vaccine pilot programme that informed the WHO recommendation for the first malaria vaccine. Can you share some reactions to the recommendation?",
          "The recommendation is a historic breakthrough – after more than 60 years of research and the efforts of thousands of people, we finally have the first malaria vaccine, which has the potential to reach millions of children and save tens of thousands of children’s lives annually. It is also a breakthrough for child health – the pilot introductions showed that this vaccine can substantially reduce severe malaria and all-cause mortality when provided through the routine child immunization clinics.  If introduced widely, the addition of this vaccine to other recommended malaria control tools will result in millions of malaria cases averted and can help get malaria control back on track.",
          "The leadership of the Ministries of Health in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, and their decision to participate in the pilot malaria vaccine introductions, were instrumental in generating the information necessary to support the WHO recommendation of the malaria vaccine.  The pilot implementations are only possible with the generous contributions from Gavi, the Global Fund and Unitaid.  I also want to recognize the important contributions of the evaluation partners who have evaluated the vaccine introduction, health workers, and key partners such as PATH, UNICEF and GSK.",
          "The pilots will continue in the three countries through 2023 to understand the added value of the 4 th vaccine dose and to measure the longer-term impact on child deaths.",
          "Q. And do you have key updates to share on next steps for the vaccine?",
          "Since October, another key milestone for the malaria vaccine was achieved – international financing of vaccine doses for country implementation was secured when on 2 December 2021 the Board of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, approved funding for the malaria vaccine programme . The initial investment of US$ 155.7 million will support malaria vaccine introduction, procurement and delivery for Gavi-eligible countries in sub-Saharan African in 2022-2025.",
          "Design for the Gavi malaria vaccine programme is underway, with WHO and partners in support, to streamline the procurement process and expand introduction of the life-saving vaccine as rapidly as possible. We understand that Gavi aims to open applications for country-level procurement of doses sometime in the third quarter (Q3) of this year.",
          "Q: Dr Mihigo, as the lead for child immunization in Africa, can you tell us what to expect on malaria vaccine supply and demand in the region?",
          "Demand for the malaria vaccine from endemic countries in Africa is expected to be high. It is an unfortunate fact that supply of the vaccine is expected to be insufficient to meet demand in the coming years. A recent WHO-commissioned study found that vaccine supply will likely be constrained through the medium term (potentially 4-6 years) unless additional investments and timely actions are taken.",
          "Q. How will the limited malaria vaccine supply be allocated in the coming years?",
          "In response to the situation, WHO is coordinating the development of a Framework to guide global decisions about malaria vaccine allocation and help inform national decisions about vaccine prioritization while supply is limited. The Framework will be based on best available scientific evidence, shared values, input by expert advisers and broad consultation with affected countries and communities and other malaria vaccine stakeholders.",
          "The target date to complete the framework is the end of the first quarter (Q1) of this year.",
          "Q: Given the constrained supply, what is being done to expand production of the malaria vaccine?",
          "WHO and partners continue to support efforts to accelerate malaria vaccine access and a healthy malaria vaccine market. Achieving this vision will demand robust investments and new public and private partnerships to increase manufacturing capacity swiftly.",
          "In January 2021, GSK, Bharat Biotech of India, and PATH announced the product transfer of the RTS,S antigen to Bharat Biotech, which will become the sole supplier of the vaccine no later than 2029 (GSK will continue to supply the AS01 adjuvant). The product transfer is an important step toward ensuring the long-term, sustainable supply of the vaccine to meet expected demand.",
          "WHO and partners are exploring other ways to increase malaria vaccine supply – for example, in support of the development of new and next-generation malaria vaccines that could increase access.",
          "Q: Dr Kalu, as a malaria expert for the Africa region, what guidance can countries expect from WHO to guide their use of the vaccine to reduce malaria illness and deaths?",
          "The WHO recommendation and position on the RTS,S vaccine is now published in an updated WHO position paper on the malaria vaccine ( Weekly Epidemiological Record, 4 March 2022) and as part of WHO Guidelines for malaria , an online platform called the MAGICapp .",
          "WHO guidance for malaria control is moving away from a “one-size fits all approach” to apply an optimal mix of tools that fit the local context and can generate the most impact – the malaria vaccine is an additional tool for countries to consider as part of their national malaria control strategies.",
          "WHO is also developing an operational manual on the sub-national tailoring of malaria interventions that will include the RTS,S vaccine, and a malaria vaccine implementation guide will inform planning for vaccine introduction in countries.",
          "Q: Thank you very much Drs Hamel, Mihigo and Kalu. As we look to the future of the RTS,S malaria vaccine, any closing words you’d like to share?",
          "Dr Hamel : This malaria vaccine is a big step forward in the fight to reduce malaria illness and death, but there is more to do. The vaccine can only reach its full potential if it reaches children at risk.  This means accelerated increased supply is of utmost importance.  WHO is working with partners to find ways to increase access to this vaccine and to facilitate development of future vaccines, while supporting research and development (R&D) for other innovative malaria control interventions.",
          "Dr Mihigo : The community demand for the malaria vaccine is a bellwether for what we expect to come – caregivers want this vaccine for their children and will bring them for vaccination. The malaria vaccine is a positive step for child survival and malaria progress through the existing immunization platform.",
          "Dr Kalu: African children are at highest risk of dying of malaria – one child died of malaria every minute, in 2020. The long-awaited malaria vaccine will benefit Africa, which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease, if we can deliver it to the children who need it. We must seize this opportunity to help get malaria progress back on track and improve child health.",
          "With thanks to the WHO experts: Dr Hamel leads the MVIP and malaria vaccines, Dr Kalu is the Africa region lead for malaria control, and Dr Mihigo is the Africa region lead for immunization."

As the Russian military offensive began, the family decided their shelter was insufficient and prepared to flee. ©UNICEF/Aleksey Filippov Supported by donors, WHO takes prompt action to bolster health services in Ukraine WHO has sent large shipments of medical supplies to Ukraine and released US$ 5.2 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to respond to the country’s urgent health needs. WHO shipments have arrived in Poland bearing 76 metric tonnes of emergency health supplies bound for Ukraine. The shipments included supplies for surgery, trauma and health care, along with freezers, refrigerators, ice packs and cool boxes. “WHO is on the ground, working with our partners to respond, to assess the impact of the conflict on the health of Ukraine’s people and its health system and to deliver essential medical supplies from our hub in Dubai,” WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week as the crisis unfolded. WHO is also exploring solutions to maintain the country’s supply of medical oxygen and other life-saving treatments, amid disrupted supply lines. The money in WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies comes from 24 donor countries whose pooled contributions allow WHO to respond quickly to disease outbreaks and emergencies – often within the first 24 hours, a critical time in a crisis. Created in 2015, the Fund is one of WHO’s most powerful tools for responding in acute health emergencies.

Ukraine is facing a shortfall in medicines and supplies, including medical oxygen and intensive care unit beds, and needs urgent support for its health workforce. WHO has published an appeal outlining the health needs and related costs arising from the crisis, noting that casualties have been reported across the country and are expected to rise. “Emergency Medical Services, surgical departments and intensive care units are likely to become overwhelmed with trauma patients,” the appeal says. “Essential health services have been disrupted and are collapsing and jeopardize the treatment of chronic/non-communicable diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.” Medical oxygen supplies are dangerously low in Ukraine, WHO leaders warn “You can’t be put on a waiting list for oxygen. You can’t stand in a queue for oxygen,” Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, told a briefing last week. “Oxygen saves your life right now.” Above: a makeshift perinatal centre in the basement of a medical complex in Kharkiv. ©UNICEF/Oleksandr Brynza Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (WHO Director General) and Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge (Director of the WHO Regional European Office) have called for critical medical supplies to safely reach those who need them and are working with partners to establish safe transit for shipments through Poland. “The oxygen supply situation is nearing a very dangerous point in Ukraine,” the two leaders said in a joint statement on 27 February. “Trucks are unable to transport oxygen supplies from plants to hospitals across the country, including the capital Kyiv. The majority of hospitals could exhaust their oxygen reserves within the next 24 hours. Some have already run out. This puts thousands of lives at risk.” The joint statement notes that medical oxygen is crucial for patients with COVID-19, injuries, trauma, sepsis, complications of childbirth and numerous other conditions.

          "Malaria and health commune worker Ly Thi Nhieu had just delivered a baby in the early morning hours before she joined the Hanoi-based team from the National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology and Entomology (NIMPE) for a malaria supervision trip in Pa U commune in Viet Nam's north-western Lai Chau Province. The trip involved taking blood samples from the villagers to detect malaria. As the acting director of the Pa U commune health centre, staying on call 24-7 has become a daily reality for Ly. The 36-year-old health commune worker has been working and living on-site for over 10 years, providing care for residents of the mountainous province bordering China.",
          "Ly took on the new role as a health commune malaria worker in January 2021. She juggles these tasks on top of her existing duties which include managing the health centre, midwifery, and spearheading public health programmes on methadone therapy, HIV\r\n    prevention and reproductive health. As a malaria worker, Ly has been supporting the NIMPE with arranging malaria testing sites. She also makes monthly visits to malaria villages herself to conduct periodic tests. Since it takes at least 3 hours by\r\n    motorbike to reach the villages, each trip is often combined with other tasks such as routine immunizations for children and expectant mothers.",
          "Health worker Ly Thi Nhieu at her health station in Pa U, Lai Chau Province, Viet Nam © WHO/L. Pham",
          "Today, the destination of Ly and the NIMPE’s malaria supervision trip was the isolated Xa Ho village. Xa Ho is accessible by a single dirt road characterized by tight turns and flooded paths. Located in one of the most isolated regions in Viet Nam,\r\n    it has been largely untouched by the COVID-19 pandemic. The NIMPE has been making regular visits to Xa Ho where malaria is affecting the local La Hu hill tribe. Their slash-and-burn agricultural practices, coupled with substandard living conditions\r\n    and low literacy rates have made them particularly vulnerable to malaria outbreaks.",
          "Women and children are at the highest risk of contracting malaria globally. However, in the Greater Mekong subregion men constitute the highest proportion of malaria cases. Men are more likely to contract the disease because they often work in high-risk\r\n    areas such as forests, mines or plantations where malaria is still prevalent. In 2021, men made up 78% of all malaria cases in Viet Nam. Women’s active involvement in malaria programmes enhances the design and implementation of interventions\r\n    such as community engagement, prevention, vector control and treatment.",
          "Observations from the Greater Mekong subregion show that targeting women during community engagement activities supports compliance in malaria treatment, vector control and prevention. This may be linked to the fact that women are often the primary caretakers\r\n    of malaria patients in their households.",
          "Health worker Ly Thi Nhieu collects data from villagers undergoing malaria rapid diagnostic tests © WHO/L. Pham",
          "Accompanying Ly is Vu Thi Anh Tuyet, a Senior Technician from the Epidemiology Department of the NIMPE based in Hanoi. Following in her father’s footsteps, Vu started working at the NIMPE after graduating from Dang Van Ngu medical college. The college\r\n    is aptly named after the medical doctor who made a substantial contribution to malaria control during the Viet Nam war. After 2 decades of screening malaria infections in Viet Nam’s hard-to-reach endemic areas, Vu believes the key to malaria\r\n    elimination is raising public awareness. She recalls visiting some forested villages during the early 2010s when half the population was infected with malaria. Compared to that period, she has observed how concerted efforts to control and eliminate\r\n    the parasite have led to a remarkable reduction in malaria across the country. From 2018 to 2021, malaria cases reduced by 90% .",
          "Although Vu spends most her days scrutinizing microscopic slides in her laboratory she also regularly travels with the NIMPE’s supervision teams to find malaria cases in remote villages like Xa Ho. As a Senior Technician, Vu recognizes how important\r\n    microscopic analysis is for detecting malaria. In places like Xa Ho with a high prevalence of asymptomatic cases, rapid diagnostic tests can fail to identify malaria. “If no parasites were found on the field, we have to examine the slides within\r\n    the shortest possible time when returning to the lab [in Hanoi]. If there is any parasite, the local team must then be informed so they can take timely action measures,” says Vu. These actions prevent parasite reservoirs and relapses.",
          "Vu Thi Anh Tuyet, a Senior Technician in her laboratory in Viet Nam © WHO/L. Pham",
          "Despite ongoing challenges which include the high occurrence of asymptomatic infections, the long distances patients need to travel to health centres, and a failure to adhere to treatment, Vu is cautiously hopeful about a future without malaria. She remarks\r\n    that communities relying on forests for their livelihood will be the first to benefit from malaria elimination as it will improve their quality of life and productivity. “The most effective indicator of improvement is people's awareness,”\r\n    says Vu without hesitation. Thanks to communication efforts in the local language, Vu notes that knowledge of malaria prevention among the La Hu hill tribe has improved. For example, now there is at least one bed net in almost every household. Vu\r\n    links these successes to the efforts of Ly and commune health center staff; without their coordination and perseverance, malaria interventions in the far-flung corners of Viet Nam could not have taken place: \"They serve at the frontline of endemic\r\n    areas and are the driving force behind the radical cure for all patients.\"",
          "Nay Ho Quy, 9, daughter of a village health worker, sits in front of her bed net in Gao Village, Phu Yen Province, Viet Nam © WHO/L. Pham",
          "In Viet Nam, WHO has been working with the National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology and Entomology (NIMPE) and partners to support the country’s malaria elimination efforts. WHO’s malaria work in Viet Nam and WHO’s Mekong Malaria\r\n    Elimination programme are made possible with contributions from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The interviews were collated by Ha\r\n    Dao and Linh Pham."

          "It was a special day on Abemama Island when community leaders gathered in the ‘maneaba’, the meeting house at the heart of every community in Kiribati. Tekinano Karereiti, a primary health care worker, was facilitating a discussion about mental health. Community dialogue, the practice of listening and talking to each other on important issues, is deeply grounded in the history and culture of the Pacific Islands and this was a good opportunity to raise awareness of an increasingly important issue for islanders.",
          "“Mental health is an issue in Kiribati because of stigma, there is a lack of understanding. People believe mental health is a spiritual issue and needs to be treated with magic,” Tekinano explained.",
          "Daily life of Kiribati. ©WHO/Yoshi Shimizu",
          "The session focused on what could be done to prevent mental illness, how to look after your own and others’ well-being, and what community leaders can do to identify and refer people who need support to the mental health team on the main island of South Tarawa. Community members play a central role in helping improve understanding of and managing mental health issues in the country.",
          "In Kiribati, a country with a population of just over 119 000, communities experience many stressors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. Strict control over entry to the country and measures to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 have resulted in lost income and separation from loved ones, which has taken its toll on the population.",
          "Rising sea levels as a result of climate change have caused more frequent flooding, meaning the few edible plants that grow on the atoll die and the fresh drinking water wells become very salty. This has led to food and water shortages on the outer islands, leading people to move to the main island, which has subsequent issues of over-crowding and economic hardship.",
          "The village meeting was part of a series of mental health awareness-raising sessions and trainings provided by the Ministry of Health in Kiribati and based on WHO’s mental health gap action (mhGAP) programme . The series was made possible through a WHO Division of Pacific Technical Support facilitated mhGAP Training of Trainers course, supported through the UHC Partnership .",
          "Following the trainings, the Ministry of Health has seen a reduction in the referral of people with chronic mental illness to the mental health department at Tanguru Central Hospital. Going forward, the mental health team plans to continue building resilience in communities to support mental health."

          "In Rwanda, the ‘land of a thousand hills’, reaching the nearest health facility usually means a long walk that, until recently, took an average of 95 minutes. Although the walking time was halved to 47 minutes in 2020, it is still a challenge\r\n        for many people to access health care in a timely manner. Through an innovative approach that brings greater numbers of health posts close to communities, the Government aims to further reduce walking time to under 25 minutes by 2024. The health\r\n        posts serve as an interface between community health workers and health centres. Here, health workers provide essential primary care services and make referrals to hospitals for specialized services, ultimately strengthening the foundation of\r\n        the health system and improving the way people receive the care they need. The health posts have also contributed to an effective national response to COVID-19, with communities still able to access basic care despite the crisis.",

          "Belize City, Belize, February 18, 2022 (PAHO) – As part of the ‘Smart’ Health Care Facilities in the Caribbean Project, funded by the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (UK-FCDO),\r\n        four (4) critical health facilities, spread across the country were upgraded and officially handed over to the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoHW). These ‘Smart’ facilities are the last four of five health care facilities selected\r\n        in Belize to become safer, greener, and more resilient to natural disasters and climate change. The health facilities have new safety measures as well as green technology and improved patient flow allowing efficient and effective delivery of care during disasters, generating operational savings, and reducing disaster losses making it ‘Smart.’\r\n        The ‘Smart’ facilities include three polyclinics, one mental health facility, and one community hospital. Isabel Palma Polyclinic in San Antonio Village, Toledo District Independence Polyclinic in Independence Village, Stann Creek District Cleopatra White Polyclinic in Belize City, Belize District San Ignacio Community Hospital in San Ignacio Town, Cayo District Palm View Center in Belmopan, Cayo District (previously handed over in 2021) The safety upgrades included the improvement of its hurricane and earthquake structural resilience, stormwater drainage, fire safety, electrical network, water supply, telecommunication and infection control, as well as replacement of damaged roof\r\n        frames ceilings, floors, doors, and windows The green upgrades included the installation of rainwater harvesting and additional storage, energy-efficient LED lighting, solar water heating and ~45KW in photovoltaic power systems, generators, more efficient AC cooling, ventilation and waste management,\r\n        as well as improved water fixtures, plumbing and drainage. all aimed at lowering the operating expenditures and boosting contingency measures by providing backup power and water in emergencies The functional upgrades included the installation of disability access ramps and handrails expansion of storage with appropriate cabinetry, renovation of the laboratory and pharmacy and some construction of additional indoor and outdoor bathroom facilities\r\n        and washing facilities. Handover ceremony of newly retrofitted San Ignacio Community Hospital in Belize. Tour of the newly retrofitted San Ignacio Community Hospital in Belize with Hon. Kevin Bernard, Mr. Haylock of Gutierrez & Associates Architects for design works, Dr. Noreen Jack, H.E. Claire Evans, and Acting Deputy Regional Manager of Western\r\n                Health Region - Lily Guerra. PAHO/WHO Representative to Belize, Dr. Noreen Jack, highlighted: “It is my pleasure on behalf PAHO/WHO to formally hand over to the MoHW the newly retrofitted San Ignacio Community Hospital. The objective is to enhance the protection of health\r\n        facilities from disasters and climate change providing safer, resilient and greener health facilities to capable of delivering care in disasters, generating operational savings with enhance of energy efficiency and reducing disaster losses in\r\n        the Caribbean. We thank the United Kingdom for their support through the partnership with PAHO/WHO both in Belize and the wider Caribbean. We also thank the staff of the MoHW for their collaboration, both the Planning Unit and NEMC for accompanying\r\n        this project at every stage. We are happy that we have reached this significant milestone and look forward to completion of the retrofitting works as part of this project and other similar projects using the Smart Health Facility Concept.” British High Commissioner to Belize, Her Excellency Claire Evans OBE, told the participants: “I am delighted to be here for the handover of these upgraded critical health facilities and see their transformation. Our UK grant is instrumental\r\n        in supporting Belize’s efforts to reduce disaster vulnerability of vital public buildings and boost its climate resilience. It has also provided a helpful platform for risk reduction planning within the health sector. COVID -19 has further\r\n        highlighted the importance of disaster preparedness and contingency measures at health facilities for staff and patients. The improvements will require careful and timely maintenance in order that they continue to operate and deliver their services\r\n        most effectively for the people of Belize.” Minister of Health and Wellness, Hon. Kevin Bernard, shared his appreciation: “On behalf of the Government of Belize and the MoHW, we extend our most sincere gratitude to PAHO/WHO, the retrofitting works as part of the PAHO/WHO Smart Health\r\n        Care Facilities in the Caribbean Phase II Project. Likewise, we acknowledge with gratitude, the UK-FCDO - they have been funding the retrofitting works. The UK-FCDO has been an essential sponsor of these activities. These are the projects and\r\n        the moments which make a real difference in the lives of our people. As the Minister of Health and Wellness, it gives me pleasure to be a part of this historic occasion as we witness first-hand the benefit of a real collaboration for the benefit\r\n        of our people.” The £46.3m Strengthening Health Facilities in the Caribbean (Smart Hospital) project is currently implemented in seven countries: Dominica, St. Lucia, Grenada, Saint Vincent and The Grenadines, Belize, Guyana, and Jamaica.

          "A treatment centre that can be set up within hours, a kit to convert a regular vehicle into an ambulance, ultra-cold chain and solar energy technologies, and a basecamp for emergency responders. These are all ideas that could speed up emergency response and save lives.",
          "To this end, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) launched INITIATE 2 in 2021, to strengthen partnerships among emergency responders and humanitarian agencies and to develop innovative solutions that can be quickly deployed in health emergencies.",
          "A Field Hospital in Ghana, managed by WFP staff to care for humanitarian workers who may contract COVID-19 in the course of duty. Facilities like this will be turned over to the Government, including generators, pre-fabricated offices, and mobile ambulances. ©WFP/2020/Michael Dakwa",
          "The first project being rolled out under the initiative is a rapidly deployable infectious diseases treatment centre. This centre will be able to provide for high-quality care for a range of diseases through all stages of an outbreak.",
          "Once the specifications are validated, a prototype of the centre will be tested and fine-tuned, to be eventually used in a large-scale emergency simulation exercise. During the simulation, logisticians will be trained on how to deploy and dismantle the facilities; while health responders will be trained on their use and management.",
          "The initiative will leverage the existing infrastructure of the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) in Brindisi, Italy which hosts a dedicated humanitarian training centre and the UNHRD Lab, a research and development unit where innovative emergency response products are developed and tested.",
          "In 2021, WHO hosted a training on Ebola Disease case management in Côte d'Ivoire, during and in response to the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in neighbouring Guinea. ©WHO/2021/WCO Cote d’Ivoire",
          "“INITIATE 2 combines the expertise and the experiences of WHO and WFP and their partners, to create standardised technical solutions to support relief efforts – with a holistic and inclusive focus on people, skills, and technology. Partners complement each other’s needs with their own unique and specialised capacities or resources in this new out-of-the box approach,” says Dr Ibrahima Soce-Fall, WHO Assistant Director-General for Emergency Response.",
          "INITIATE 2 enables humanitarian actors to gain and share knowledge, and translate these skills in local communities to improve country-level emergency response. It builds on the integrated, end-to-end technical and operational capacities of the COVID-19 Supply Chain System , also led by WHO and WFP.",
          "WFP staff member working with a member of the Cote D’Ivoire Medical Store inspecting supplies for distribution and treatment in the local community. ©WFP/SAPH/2021",
          "It also creates a space for innovation to grow, as partner organisations can propose their own projects and ideas and benefit from their collective expertise, and from their dedicated resources.",
          "WHO develops the standards on emergency response and preparedness, provides technical guidance, develops the health components of trainings, and prepares the teams to be deployed in times of emergencies. WFP supports the design, development and sourcing of the prototypes and makes available the space and the facilities for innovations and trainings.",

          "Partner organisations in INITIATE 2 will have an active role in developing the technical specifications and bringing their respective sectoral expertise into, the training content. These partners include ALIMA , Bring Hope Foundation , CUAMM , DG ECHO , FAO , FDFA Switzerland , GOAL , IOM , ICRC , IFRC , IRC , IMC , Medair , Medical Aid Films , MSF , Samaritan’s Purse , Save the Children International , UNICEF , USAID , and Word Vision International .",
          "“It’s about using collective knowledge and expertise to find solutions that will work across a range of settings and that will support the needs of the community of health and humanitarian partners in future health emergencies,” says Alex Marianelli, WFP Director of Supply Chain. “COVID-19 showed us just how much we could achieve when we all rallied together to respond, and it’s in this spirit that we want to build further on this collaboration through the INITIATE 2 project.”",

          "This holistic and collaborative approach creates a fully end-to-end process that will support readiness, response and resilience. “Working with our partners, we will be able to empower international and national technical experts and emergency responders for a lasting positive impact in the communities we serve,” says Dr Fall."

          "COVID-19 has brought significant change and uncertainty to people’s lives. Family illness and bereavement, unemployment, school closures and lack of physical contact with family and friends can all lead to increased stress and mental health conditions such as depression. At worst, depression can lead to suicide, which tragically takes the lives of more than 700 000 people each year.",
          "Suicide: a significant public health issue",
          "Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Bhutan, a country in South-East Asia, realized that suicide was becoming a serious public health issue. Despite being renowned for introducing the term “Gross National Happiness” in 1972, suicide is the sixth leading cause of death in Bhutan. Furthermore, for every four suicide deaths in the country, only one attempted suicide is recorded. This is an indication of significant under-reporting, given estimates that, globally, there are more than 20 suicide attempts for every suicide. In 2015, Bhutan’s Ministry of Health established a multi-year National Suicide Prevention Programme to address this significant public health issue. The country’s Suicide Prevention Action Plan (2018-2023) includes strategies to increase detection of suicidal ideation and respond to ideation and suicide attempts.",
          "At the start of the pandemic, Bhutan had few human resources for mental health, with only two practising psychiatrists and a handful of trained psychiatric nurses and clinical counsellors. Anticipating the mental health consequences of the pandemic and the disruption to mental health services, in March 2020, the Ministry of Health set up, with guidance from the WHO team based in the country, a National COVID-19 Mental Health and Psychosocial Response Team to address mental health and psychosocial needs across the country.",
          "Large-scale training: central to scale-up of mental health and suicide prevention services",
          "Training is a core component of scaling-up services for mental health and suicide prevention. During 2020-21, Bhutan’s Mental Health Response Team trained more than 20 000 frontline workers and community volunteers across Bhutan in identification of risk factors for suicide, how to provide basic psychosocial support to community members in distress and how to make referrals. WHO Psychological First Aid+ (PFA+) guide were adapted and used during these training programmes. The Response Team also conducted over 200 webinars on suicide prevention, mental health, and substance abuse management. Participants shared that, following the training, not only were they able to identify risk factors among community members, but they had also learned to recognize signs of stress in themselves and knew when to seek help.",
          "In addition to frontline workers and community volunteers, 140 first responders  ̶  district doctors, mental health workers and clinical counsellors  ̶  were trained to manage self-harm and suicide effectively. Funded by WHO, the initiatives included a training-of-trainers programme on suicide prevention and management, with a focus on strengthening Bhutan’s national suicide case registry.",
          "The Response Team also organized a training workshop for media representatives in November 2021 to encourage responsible reporting of suicide. The team developed and disseminated ‘Media Guidelines for Responsible Reporting of Mental Health and Suicide’ during the workshop.",
          "These initiatives implemented in Bhutan are in line with WHO’s LIVE LIFE implementation guide for suicide prevention in countries . The guide, released in June 2021, recommends four key strategies for reducing deaths by suicide: limiting access to means; interacting with the media for responsible reporting of suicide; fostering socio-emotional life skills in adolescents; and early identification, assessment, management and follow up of anyone who is affected by suicidal behaviours.",
          "Reviving a crisis helpline",
          "In addition to capacity-building initiatives, Bhutan’s Mental Health Response Team revived a crisis helpline, staffed by trained mental health professionals. More than 1500 people dealing with mental health problems, alcohol and drug use issues, domestic violence and self-harm have already received support through the helpline. The Response Team has also re-established links between services and referral pathways, enabling helpline callers to access clinical treatment and care when needed. In addition to five dedicated counselling helplines at the national level, 22 other helplines are now available in districts and Thromdes (municipalities) across Bhutan.",
          "Reflecting on the Response Team’s activities, Dr Chencho Dorji,  a practicing Bhutanese psychiatrist supported by WHO, noted that “the pandemic provided a unique opportunity to adopt new policies and implement mental health programmes that hadn’t been attempted before, enabling mobilization of human resources for mental health. Moreover, increased accessibility, convenience, and the anonymity provided through telephone counselling encouraged many people to seek help and follow up with treatment  ̶  opening the door for scaling up online and telepsychiatry services and suicide prevention in the country.”"

          "In late January 2022, Member States at the 150 th Executive Board underlined their support for WHO’s work to transfer polio workforce and assets in polio-free settings to serve global health priorities.",
          "Over fifty polio-free countries transitioned out of Global Polio Eradication Initiative support at the start of 2022, marking a significant shift towards using polio assets in an integrated manner to strengthen health systems. Polio capacities in these countries have been integrated into other WHO programmes where they will help to make progress on broader health priorities, especially essential immunization, disease surveillance, emergency preparedness and response and primary health care.",
          "Already, the polio workforce provides a backbone of support to the public health system in many countries. As we move closer to the goal of global polio eradication, Member States at the Executive Board stated their strong support for the direction of travel taken by WHO to ensure that functions in polio-free settings are integrated and sustained.",
          "The transition of the polio workforce and assets is tailored to country and regional context, and takes a cautious, risk-based approach. In her remarks, the Regional Director for the African Region, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, noted that transitioned polio personnel in the African Region have “extensive knowledge and skills [that] will also continue to benefit other public health interventions.”",
          "Several Member States articulated that sustainable financing of the WHO is vital to retain polio assets. Delegates also provided guidance to WHO’s work in this area, highlighting the need to have robust monitoring and evaluation, strong governance, and build on the contributions of the polio network to COVID-19 response and recovery to achieve greater integration between programmes.",
          "The Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Region, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, noted, “This year is the time for intensifying our work to make polio transition impactful. We must capitalize on the impressive progress of the past year and make the most of the opportunities to build greater integration into our public health programmes.”",
          "In her remarks, the WHO Deputy Director General, Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, underlined the important interlinkages between the polio eradication and polio transition agendas. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is currently intensifying eradication efforts where the virus still remains, whilst transition moves ahead in polio-free settings. It is crucial that both progress hand-in-hand, to ensure that a polio-free world is achieved and sustained, and health systems are bolstered.",
          "Dr Jakab ended the session by emphasising the importance of continued commitment and sustainable financing to maintain the transitioned polio functions. “To keep the polio assets where they are most needed, we also need Member States’ full political and financial commitment, including domestic funding.”"

          "Every year, cancer is estimated to cause more than 17 000 deaths in Mozambique. Many of these deaths are happening too early: cancer accounts for almost half of the country’s \"premature deaths\" (dying before the age of 70) for noncommunicable diseases.",
          "As a result, cancer is a critical barrier to Mozambique achieving SDG target 3.4, to achieve a reduction in premature mortality by 2030. And the need for achieving SDG 3.4 will only become more urgent, with the number of Mozambicans with breast or cervical\r\n    cancer expected to double from current levels by 2040.",
          "Despite the high burden, many countries don’t include cancer in the set of health services and products they agree to provide for their population for free – commonly known as a universal health coverage \"benefit package\".",
          "To date, this has been the case in Mozambique.",
          "Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy for cervical and some other cancers are only available in certain areas of the country – though efforts are underway to increase capacity. A lack of reliable cancer registry data remains an area for improvement,\r\n    and as of 2021, only one quarter of eligible women had been screened for cervical cancer in the last five years.",
          "Tobacco smoking – a leading cause of cancer – is declining among men and women, and dietary behaviours are improving among younger people, but other risk factors for cancer, such as consuming alcoholic beverages, obesity and pollution rates\r\n    remain stubbornly high or are worsening. And despite at least five billion people globally now being covered by at least one of WHO’s live-saving \"MPOWER\" measures to address the worldwide tobacco epidemic, Mozambique is among a minority of\r\n    countries that has not fully adopted any measure.",
          "Building a national plan for cancer",
          "Recognizing the importance of a comprehensive national plan to reduce the cancer burden, the Ministry of Health in Mozambique has been working with WHO to develop and cost its National Cancer Control Plan.",
          "The National Cancer Control Plan is, however, just the latest step in recent action to help support people at risk of, or living with, cancer in Mozambique. Recently, national screening, early diagnosis and pre-cancer treatment programmes have been established\r\n    nationwide for breast and cervical cancer. National guidelines for early detection and cancer management are being designed, as they have been for pathology services, and HPV vaccination is now included in Mozambique’s vaccination schedule.",
          "As such, the Plan is part of the Ministry of Health’s commitment to “redouble efforts” to reduce new cancers, by “preventing risk factors and reducing the gap in access to care by strengthening the health system” .\r\n Specifically, the Ministry identifies raising awareness, access to vaccination, screening, the early detection of cancer, strengthening diagnostic and treatment capacity, and palliative care as key opportunities.",
          "The National Cancer Control Plan has been developed by expert consultations from different clinical and non-clinical areas of cancer prevention and control, to ensure that cancer needs are being addressed according to the local context. The Plan has been\r\n    championed by the First Lady, Her Excellency Isaura Nyusi, with this political priority being key to planning, partnership mobilization and implementation.",
          "Developing the investment case",
          "A core part of developing the Plan has been exploring and prioritizing the costs, and resulting benefits, of adopting different \"best buy\" policies for cancer. To do so, the Ministry of Health, with WHO’s support, is conducting a health impact analysis,\r\n    and designing an investment case for cancer care that reflects the specific needs of the country.",
          "Together, this analysis will map out how new policies and programmes will save lives and improve livelihoods, while the investment case sets out why investing in cancer is effective, cost-effective and equitable. In doing so, it mirrors a recent global analysis by WHO, that finds investing US$ 1 per person in preventing and managing NCDs could save seven million\r\n    lives annually, and that the quicker investments are made, the quicker they pay themselves back again and again.",
          "“Mozambique’s development of a cancer impact analysis and the investment case will constitute an entry point to better leverage cancer prevention and management at primary health care level and advanced care level” , says Dr\r\n    Raquel Dulce Mahoque of WHO’s Mozambique Country Office. “This can help ensure that everyone can have access to cancer care, wherever and whenever they need it, without financial hardship.”",
          "The National Cancer Control Plan is designed to complement the country’s wider integrated NCD plan, that also sets out how people should have access to high-quality and compassionate palliative care. Increasing cancer within national plans for universal\r\n    health coverage would also increase the reach of this care for free to more people who need it."

          "COVID-19 showed that the world was unprepared to cope with a surge in medical waste — but it also presents an opportunity to fix a problem that has huge implications for mitigating climate change, fighting pollution, and creating resilient health systems.",
          "When COVID-19 reached Lao People’s Democratic Republic in early 2020, the country faced a waste problem — the volume of hazardous waste from its response to the pandemic, including masks and other personal protective equipment, quadrupled\r\n    from 0.5 kilograms to 2 kilograms on average per person per day.",
          "But it also saw an opportunity. By then, the government and various sectors were years into efforts to shore up Lao PDR’s health system against climate impacts that were already making themselves felt — among them longer and lengthier dry\r\n    periods that affect water quality and quantity, depriving rural healthcare facilities of water needed for adequate hygiene and sanitation for four to five months a year.",
          "Since 2014, the Ministry of Health had been prioritizing the development and implementation of water, sanitation and health (WASH) policies and strategies and basic health facility environmental standards and health care waste management regulations.",
          "But, many other countries, Lao PDR faced challenges accessing funding for their climate and health plans.",
          "“ WASH has had challenges as it require an investment for infrastructure and regular operation and maintenance. During 2020, funding to support COVID responses globally has created opportunities to fund investments in issues such as WASH that are both longstanding national priorities and important components of the pandemic response ”,\r\n said Dr Phonepaseuth, Director General, Department of Hygiene and Health Promotion, MOH, Lao PDR.",
          "The funds unlocked by the pandemic led to rapid expansion of Lao PDR’s WASH and waste efforts and the introduction of a comprehensive package of interventions for making hospitals “safe, clean, green and climate resilient”. WASH and\r\n    environmental health indicators were integrated into regular health systems monitoring. This allowed for rapid identification of gaps and for the health sector and healthcare facility managers to be held accountable for maintaining adequate WASH services\r\n    and promoting sustainable technology solutions.",
          "One significant, climate-related intervention was the installation of 76 autoclaves, which use less energy than incinerators and do not emit harmful pollutants (for example, dioxins and furans), coupled with equipment for safe segregation and storage and the training, supportive supervision and ongoing monitoring necessary for long-term sustainability.",

          "Like other developing countries, we face challenges to manage many different types of plastic waste, masks, PPEs, vaccination waste and laboratory waste. The volume of waste increased, and tonnes of waste was generated from quarantine and isolation places,” Dr Phonepaseuth said."

          "Unlike many countries, however, Lao PDR had a head start in tackling its share of what would quickly balloon into a global mountain of pandemic-related waste that exposed weaknesses in waste management infrastructure and systems.",
          "A new WHO report provides a conservative glimpse of that mountain, based on a United Nations initiative to level the playing field as much as possible (especially for smaller, developing economies) by pooling procurement of lifesaving PPE for the COVID-19 response. The initiative distributed one and a half billion units of single-use PPE, weighing about 87,000 tonnes — all of which is presumed to become waste.",
          "But the estimate leaves out the PPE classified as “reusable”, such as face shields and gowns, as well as any PPE procured privately or outside of the initiative, and any of the extra masks used by the public. It also excludes the over 140 million test kits also shipped by the initiative, with the potential to generate 2,600 tonnes of non-infectious waste (mainly plastic) and 731,000 litres of chemical waste (one third of an Olympic size swimming pool). It also excludes the 8 billion of doses of vaccine that have been administered globally, which produces waste in the form of glass vials, syringes, needles and safety boxes for disposal.",
          "The scramble to meet PPE needs was understandable: early in the pandemic, health care worker infection rates were four times greater than that among the general public, making it a matter of life-or-death.",
          "Unfortunately, far less attention and fewer resources were dedicated to supporting safe waste management for this PPE, other necessary infection prevention and control requirements and mitigating climate change and adverse environmental impacts from waste, especially plastic waste.\r\n    With 30% of the world’s health care facilities (60% in the least developed countries) unequipped to handle existing waste streams, the surge in biomedical waste put at risk the safety of healthcare workers and others involved in processing\r\n    waste, such as millions of informal waste workers, as well as communities living near waste facilities; threats included needle stick injuries, infections, and pollution from open burning of waste (for example, the majority of plastic in COVID-19\r\n    test kits). It also posed a grave threat to the environment.",
          "Most countries built on or repurposed existing resources and processes — or they innovated their way through. The WHO report draws on 11 case studies, including Lao PDR’s experience, distilling a number of solutions that exist, including reducing PPE through safe and rational use, eco-friendly packaging and shipping, the development and use of safe and reusable PPE (for example, gloves and medical masks), the use of recyclable or biodegradable materials, investment in non-burn waste treatment technologies, reverse logistics to support centralized treatment and recycling, and more local and regional production and just-in-time shipments.",
          "\"A systemic change in how health care manages its waste would include greater and systematic scrutiny and better procurement practices,\" said Dr Anne Woolridge, Chair Health Care Waste Working Group, ISWA and Chief Operating Officer, Independent Safety Services Ltd.",
          "There is growing appreciation that health investments must consider environmental and climate implications, as well as a greater awareness of co-benefits of action. For example, safe and rational use of PPE will not only reduce environmental harm from waste, it will also save money, reduce potential supply shortages and further support infection prevention by changing behaviours."

          "Safe and rational use of PPE can yield tangible rewards, as the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom found through its campaign to reduce unnecessary glove use — one of the report’s case studies.  Overuse of gloves was a longstanding problem even before COVID-19, resulting in missed opportunities for hand hygiene, unnecessary financial costs and adverse environmental impacts, and, in terms of volume, made up the greatest proportion of PPE waste of all items procured by the UN COVID-19 global system.",
          "Gloves Are Off: Safer in our hands” campaign, which began in 2018, focused heavily on education and training of nurses and as many staff groups as possible (healthcare assistants, porters, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, pharmacists, the hospital’s school staff) across the Trust, reinforced by monitoring and quarterly feedback to staff with information on infection rates, gloves/plastic and occupational health referrals for sore hands.",
          "Most healthcare workers found reducing glove use to be a logical change once the research and evidence was presented to them,” Nicola Wilson, Practice Educator at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London. “The education where the team not only taught the topic, but engrained the ‘Gloves Are Off’ into IV practice worked best. Empowering our nurses to think about the key principles and to risk assess themselves worked to give them confidence in their decision making as to when gloves were required,",
          "The campaign led to a reduction of 21 tonnes of plastic compared to the year before its implementation, “the weight of three and a half Tyrannosaurus Rex”, and a fall in glove orders of over 4.3 million, saving the hospital a whopping £108,330 — as well as, incidentally, healthier hands from the reduction in glove use — with no resulting rise in infections.",
          "Anxiety in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic caused staff to return to previous habits of overuse of gloves and PPE among staff. Having established the campaign a year previously, the trust returned to these principles once prompted by supportive national guidelines.",
          "When it comes to responding quickly to a crisis, fortune favours the prepared. The COVID-19 waste challenge and increasing urgency to address environmental sustainability and climate change requires strong systems that safely and sustainably reduce and manage health care waste — including through strong policies and regulations at all levels, regular monitoring and reporting, behaviour change support and workforce development, and increased budgets and financing — structures and that need time and resources to be built and established.",
          "Lao PDR had already laid the groundwork to take that opportunity, through its ongoing national, multi-agency efforts at the crossroads of healthcare and climate adaptation and mitigation. COVID-19 served as a catalyst to scale up existing efforts by focusing political leadership and effective national partner coordination on COVID-19 financing for sustainable waste solutions.",
          "Lao PDR’s early national, multi-agency efforts at the crossroads of health and climate primed it to unlock financing for sustainable waste solutions when COVID-19 hit. Photo: Ministry of Health, Lao PDR",
          "Its experience also shows just how intimately linked everybody’s mandates are, and, two years into the pandemic, the world is starting to reflect on how future health-threatening crises could be tackled.",
          "COVID-19 exposed the cracks in the system at a crucial time in the race towards the 2030 Global Goals. Waste management is linked to many of the goals, not least Good Health and Wellbeing (Goal 3), Clean Water and Sanitation (Goal 6) and Responsible Consumption and Production (Goal 12). It is clear more radical and immediate actions are needed to address climate change. Mitigation demands a closer look at the carbon contributions from established processes, including whole-of-life product and waste management; pollution is a growing problem; and climate-resilient healthcare systems addressing safe and sustainable management of health care waste.",
          "Countries, regions and cities are looking to build back better. At the recent UN climate change conference, COP26, a diverse group of 51 countries, including low and very high carbon emitters, committed to creating climate-resilient health systems; 45 also committed to transforming their health systems to be more sustainable and low-carbon, Lao PDR among them.",
          "COVID-19 has forced the world to reckon with the gaps and neglected aspects of the waste stream and how we produce, use and discard of our health care resources, from cradle to grave,” said Dr Maria Neira, Director, Environment, Climate Change and Health at WHO. “Significant change at all levels, from the global to the hospital floor, in how we manage the health care waste stream is a basic requirement of climate-smart health care systems, which many countries committed to at the recent UN Climate Change Conference, and, of course, of a healthy recovery from COVID-19 and preparedness for other health emergencies in the future."

Christopher Tufton, Minister of Health and Wellness on Thursday, January 27 at the newly upgraded St. Ann's Bay Health Centre.",
          "The upgraded facilities, which were completed in 2021, are the St Ann's Bay, Albert Town, Darliston, Gayle, Norman Gardens, Windward Road, Yallahs, Sydenham and Cumberland Road health centres.  The other health facilities to be retrofitted under this project include the Port Antonio Health Centre (expected to finish in February 2022), Santa Cruz Health Centre (expected to finish in Q3 2022) and Mandeville Health Centre, which is expected to start in February and finish in Q4 2022.",
          "Mr. Ian Stein, PAHO/WHO Representative in Jamaica stated, “This is a very important day for PAHO/WHO and the United Kingdom as we hand-over nine health care facilities across the country, including this ‘Smart facility’, the St. Ann’s Bay Health Centre. Since 2016, PAHO/WHO has been implementing this UKaid project in Jamaica in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Wellness, which reinforces that sustainability of health facilities must be enhanced to ensure continued service delivery immediately after the impact of hazards, such as hurricanes, when communities need healthcare most.",
          "He continued, “the technical cooperation provided by PAHO/WHO is integrally linked to the disaster risk reduction priorities of the Americas and Jamaica’s Climate Change Policy Framework which will enshrine ’Smart’ standards in the new construction and retrofitting of health facilities. In summary, SAFE + GREEN + MAINTAINED = SMART”.",
          "“Our UK grant is instrumental in supporting Jamaica's efforts to reduce disaster vulnerability of vital public buildings and boost its climate resilience. It has also provided a helpful platform for risk reduction planning within the health sector. COVID -19 has further highlighted the importance of disaster preparedness and contingency measures at health facilities for staff and patients,” said British High Commissioner to Jamaica, Judith Slater.",
          "For his part, Health and Wellness Minister, Dr. the Hon. Christopher Tufton, stated the programme is much welcomed as the public health system continues to adjust and respond to the changing health profile and needs of the population.",
          "“The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to bear in a most significant way, the need for the vulnerable among us to protect themselves from diseases and ailments and for persons to take the necessary preventive steps to guard against becoming vulnerable.”",
          "The £46.3m project is currently being implemented in seven countries: Dominica, St Lucia, Grenada, Saint Vincent and The Grenadines, Belize, Guyana and Jamaica.  Jamaica received an allocation of £8million or USD11 million. The project is funded by UKaid through its Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in the Caribbean and implemented by PAHO in close collaboration with the Ministries of Health of the selected countries."

          "“I was born in a very remote district where health facilities were not available. I witnessed many pregnant mothers dying because there was no health care facility at my village or on the way to hospitals, located more than 50 km away. I decided\r\n    to become a midwife and serve the women and children in the villages. I love my job and attend numerous institutional deliveries, and have contributed to the reduction of maternal mortality,” said Ayesha.",
          "However, these vital health services that save the lives of many in the community have come under severe threat. The Sehatmandi programme is the backbone of Afghanistan’s health system, providing care for millions of people through 2 331 health\r\n    facilities. Since the Taliban gained power, major funding for the programme has been withdrawn. As of 15 January 2022, the country has received funding to help cover immediate needs for the early part of the year. More funds are needed to urgently fill remaining gaps and to support the country's health system in sustaining the delivery of essential services.",
          "The primary care facility in the village is vital, serving 58 000 people including 13 340 women of childbearing age and 11 600 children under-five. Importantly, it provides emergency obstetric care, including Caesarean section services. Without this,\r\n    women would have to travel far, and put themselves and their babies at risk.",
          "Due to a lack of funding, staff in the health facility have not received their salaries for months, the clinic is faced with shortages of medicine and supplies, and patients are not able to access the essential health services they need. If this facility\r\n    closes down, increasing ill health and mortality is inevitable. The facility’s struggles are not unique."

In August 2021, when the Taliban took over Kabul, donors found\r\n    it impossible to provide financing through the new regime, and major funding was withdrawn. Previously funded by the World Bank, the European Commission, and USAID, there are now serious challenges to continuing these vital primary health care services.",
          "The population is also suffering due to a recent drought that has affected crops and livestock. This, combined with rising food prices and the collapse of public services, led to acute food insecurity for nearly 19 million people in September and October\r\n    2021."

As a result, more mothers, infants and children will die of reduced access to essential\r\n    health care. WHO is determined to work with partners in identifying a sustainable solution with the support of donors to maintain and scale up the lifesaving interventions when needed in the country,” said Dr Luo Dapeng, WHO Representative in\r\n    Afghanistan",

Since then, polio teams have been assisting with COVID-19 vaccination. Their contributions – including to vaccine logistics, social mobilization, surveillance, training and data management – demonstrate their wide skillset and their ability to help make progress on broader health priorities.",

Staff balanced this work with resumed polio vaccination campaigns, which were paused to protect against possible spread of COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic.",

The polio transition process aims to leverage the skills, relationships and reach of the polio workforce in an integrated manner to make progress on a range of health priorities - especially essential immunization, vaccine-preventable disease surveillance and emergency response. The indispensable work of the polio workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic shows that sustaining this network is a good investment for national and global health priorities.",
          "Dr Eshetu Wassie, a National Polio Officer in Ethiopia, explains that the polio workforce is well positioned to assist with reaching health goals.",
          "“The polio experience has helped to bring the WHO workforce together, as COVID-19 required a multisectoral response. This was easier to organize through the polio platform, which was used to bringing partners together.”",
          "Polio staff have undertaken a wide range of tasks. In",
          "Nigeria",
          ", ensuring the availability of both COVID-19 and polio vaccines has reduced the number of visits families need to make to health facilities, whilst in Cameroon, polio staff have developed communications and advocacy materials to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake. In many countries, the polio workforce have supported the collection of data on Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) for COVID-19, and have used their experiences in polio eradication to help coordinate effective rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in different contexts.",
          "In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the polio workforce in Somalia helped to rollout COVID-19 vaccines throughout 2021. Mohamud Shire, a Senior Polio Eradication Officer in Somalia, explains, “Some of the polio volunteers worked as vaccinators, whilst others were social mobilizers. Regional and District Polio Officers were supervisors of the vaccine rollout. And it helped that communities know and trust us.”",
          "In the South East Asian Region, the integrated immunization and surveillance networks used their experience of introducing new vaccines, including Inactivated Polio Vaccine, to help ensure a smooth rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines. In India and Nepal, support provided by the network has included capacity building, campaign monitoring and contributing to guideline development. In Bangladesh, polio and measles campaign microplans were used to conduct a successful pilot of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. In Indonesia and Myanmar network support included dissemination of guidelines and cold chain monitoring.",
          "With populations in low-income countries around the world still un- or under-vaccinated against COVID-19, and health systems under severe strain, the continued support of the polio network is likely to be critical to recover from the pandemic. Looking ahead, Dr Jiel Jiel underlines the importance of transitioning and sustaining the polio workforce in polio-free contexts so that they can contribute to health systems recovery, “If we were not present, it would be more difficult for the health system to reach the vaccine coverage that is desired.”",
          "“WHO staff have built up our skills, we have institutional memory and you can rely on us to produce results.”"
