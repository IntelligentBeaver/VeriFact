          "In February 2020 some countries were already fighting COVID-19, and after China Iran emerged as one of the first COVID-19 epidemic countries, quickly surpassing infection rate of other countries at that time. Operating in a vastly different\r\n    context than China or Italy, health officials had to think and work quickly to design early detection methods, communication strategies, and lockdown policies.",
          "“There were not many examples from other countries,” said Dr Christoph Hamelmann, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative to the Islamic Republic of Iran. “China, for example, is so culturally different, that we couldn’t\r\n    respond in the same way. Many things had to be developed right here in the country.”",
          "With the situation rapidly evolving on the ground in Iran, including the first COVID-positive employee on the team, the WHO country office had to brainstorm and devise its own standard operating procedures – often weeks ahead of headquarters. In early March , WHO experts travelled to the country and met with national stakeholders and health officials\r\n    to plan and to scale up the response to the escalating epidemic; prioritize areas for implementing control measures; and pinpoint measures to strengthen the response in areas that had not yet been affected. There was no time to waste, also in terms\r\n    of further cross-border spread between countries in the region and beyond.",
          "Scaling up the emergency response",
          "The most immediate priorities were early detection, isolation and treatment, implementing effective contact tracing, and ensuring a strong system of risk communications in a context rife with misinformation. Since the very beginning and up until now,\r\n    WHO continues to strengthen the COVID-19 testing capacity of the national laboratory network and provides them with thousands of PCR tests. The Organization also navigated logistical hurdles and global scarcity in personal protective equipment (PPE),\r\n    and delivered 3 shipments of masks and face shields, gloves, shoe covers, and other supplies to the virus-battered country. Additionally, WHO delivered shipments of medicines for Iran’s participation in the Solidarity clinical trial , one of the world’s largest studies to identify effective COVID-19 treatments.",
          "WHO donated PCR Molecular Detection Kits to the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Research Center of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences at Mofid Children's Hospital to be used in a study conducted in collaboration with the Robert Koch Institute on the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in children, Nov 2020. ©WHO Iran Country Office",
          "Given that misinformation about COVID-19 was evolving as quickly as the virus itself, risk communications was another crucial element that WHO had to put in place. This was important to ensuring that any information vacuum – since the virus was\r\n    so new, and sometimes, information was simply not available – was not filled with harmful rumors. Early on, for example, media outlets reported that hundreds in Iran died from drinking methanol alcohol after reading false information on social\r\n    media that it was a coronavirus cure. However, as Dr Hamelmann pointed out, misinformation is not specific to Iran, and is a global phenomenon that requires a comprehensive response strategy.",
          "“What kept me up was providing a really good and thought-through communications strategy that supported health literacy and empowered the population,” said Hamelmann.",
          "WHO Iran team package posters of ICERP, the Iran COVID-19 Response Project, to be sent to target facilities receiving medical and diagnostic equipment under the project, November 2020. ©WHO Iran Country Office",
          "Before the pandemic, the WHO country office did not have a communications officer, but now, there are six people working with the Ministry of Health on risk communication strategies. With WHO acting as a neutral player in a highly politicized environment,\r\n    its role helps add credibility and enhances people’s trust in health information. The team works in tandem with the WHO regional office and headquarters to develop locally relevant communications materials, including technical guidance, myth\r\n    busters, and videos featuring demonstrations of preventive measures such as hand-washing, avoid closed and crowded environments or physical distancing.",
          "Navigating economic sanctions",
          "Another obstacle that Iran has had to face in its COVID-19 response is unilateral economic sanctions which are also affecting the health sector, even before the epidemic started. While the WHO country office – together with other agencies of the\r\n    UN country team – are supporting the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) to mitigate the impact, even the timely implementation of more than US$80 million which the country office has received for COVID-19 emergency procurement\r\n    for life saving medical and laboratory equipment from a range of different donor countries and the MOHME is made more difficult under such conditions, in addition to the anyhow stressed global market conditions with much higher demands than supplies.\r\n    WHO supports the country by directly communicating with suppliers and purchasing state-of-the-art equipment and essential supplies on the global market.",
          "The sanctions have also had a severe impact on the economy.",
          "“Iran has a lot less fiscal room to go through a lockdown,” said Dr Hamelmann. “The country had to open earlier because it was not sustainable to remain closed. Even now, there’s very little option to go to complete lockdown if\r\n    we hit another COVID-19 peak.”",
          "When the pandemic hits home",
          "Before getting infected with COVID-19, Dr Hamelmann was already contemplating whether to work from home or go in the field, where he says his work is more effective.",
          "“I prefer to schedule meetings in places where I can meet people who most need our work like hospitals and homeless centers,” he said, “People need to see my face—not just in ministry meetings but out there in the community. I\r\n    need to engage not just centrally in Tehran but also within the provinces.”",
          "When he got sick, he immediately knew it was COVID-19. “It had a certain kick against you that you knew was not normal,” he said.",
          "At home in isolation for two weeks, he continued to work 12 hours a day to keep up with the office demands, answering emails until midnight, and editing the country’s daily COVID-19 situation report, which is distributed to international representatives\r\n    in Iran; key officials and academics in the country; and UN agencies and a broad network of partners in Iran, the region and beyond. He says he keeps a close eye on that daily update because one miscommunication could create much concern and negative\r\n    repercussions in a very sensitive and politicized environment.",
          "Dr Hamelmann now has hope that he can support the response beyond the office. When he learned that China was using convalescent plasma therapy to treat coronavirus patients, he decided to donate his antibody-rich blood to the Iranian Blood Transfusion\r\n    Organization. It’s important for WHO representatives, he says, to “walk the talk.” He hopes that with his example he can encourage others who have overcome COVID-19 infection to donate blood for plasma therapy.",
          "“I want to make sure that people in the public and our counterparts see that we aren’t just sitting behind desks writing policies and giving speeches, but that we engaged practically with very tangible impact for all people living in Iran,”\r\n    he said.",
          "The winter ahead",
          "Starting end of November 2020, Iran had to re-institute again tighter restrictions in public life including evening curfews for all non-essential movements in major cities. Restaurants and entertainment areas were closed again. These restrictions are\r\n    showing positive impact, but the pressure on the health sector, the economy and the livelihoods of many citizens remains.",
          "The country is now looking ahead to the vaccine. More than eight Iranian companies and universities are currently working on a COVID-19 vaccine. While Iran doesn’t face the same level of poverty some other countries face, sanctions create other\r\n    problems that threaten equitable vaccine access for its 80 million people for example through restrictions of transferring Iranian investments into the COVAX facility as a self-financing member.",
          "“While our whole team at the country office is still working around the clock to meet the high demand for technical and procurement support in the national emergency response, the support to ensure that people living in Iran will have timely access\r\n    to an affordable vaccine of high quality and safety standard has already become a new additional major focus of our work,” said Dr Hamelmann. “I am very grateful for the high motivation and dedication of all the team members in our country\r\n    office. Of course, like everybody who works on frontline in this fight against COVID-19, we have periods in which we feel exhausted after 10 months of emergency operations. But we know that others are suffering even more and at the end we draw our\r\n    energy from contributing to tangible impact in saving lives and safeguarding health as much as possible.”",

          "More than 30,000 refugees and migrants from different regions around the world participated in the first ever survey to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental and physical health as well as their ability to work and support themselves.\r\n    They were asked to grade the impact on a scale from 0 (nothing at all) to 10 (extreme). The average impact assessment reported was 7.5.",
          "“Refugees and migrants live and work in often-harsh conditions with inadequate access to health, housing, water, sanitation and other basic services,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “It is vital\r\n                    for all countries to reduce barriers that prevent refugees and migrants from obtaining health care, and to include them in national health policies” More than half the respondents across different parts of the world say that COVID-19 brought about greater level of depression, fear, anxiety and loneliness.  One in five also talked about a deterioration of mental health and increased\r\n                    use of drug and alcohol. Limited access to information due to language and cultural barriers, coupled with the marginalization of refugees and migrant communities, place them amongst the hardest to reach populations when information is disseminated.

          "Undocumented migrants are often excluded from national health programmes or social protection schemes that could facilitate access to health and social services. Many do not seek health care, including for COVID-19, due to financial constraints or fear\r\n    of deportation.",
          "Photo: WHO/ Blink Media - Martyn Aim",
          "The report underlines the need and importance of including refugees and migrants in inclusive policy responses to COVID-19. The aim is to draw of the findings of the survey to expand research and evidence gathering from across the world to better understand\r\n    how the pandemic has created increasingly difficult living conditions for refugees and migrants."

          "The work started with a WHO-supported mid-term review of progress in implementing the country‘s Health Personnel Development Strategy and development of a Regulatory Framework for the Registration and Licensing of Healthcare Professionals in close collaboration with development partners. Later, WHO provided support in improving the health sector’s human resources information system - the Health Personnel Information Management System. In 2020, through collaboration with the Ministry of Home Affairs, WHO supported the Ministry of Health to develop new guidelines for incentives for human resources for health as well as job descriptions for healthcare workers. These aim to provide clear guidance on roles and responsibilities at each level of service delivery.",

With support from WHO and other partners, the Government has also made great efforts to prepare the health system for early detection, testing and clinical management.",

          "Ms Suchitra Goala, 45, is a community health worker (CHW) in Karimganj District in Assam, a state in northeastern India. She is what is known locally as a ‘COVID-19 warrior’. Since the pandemic took hold in March 2020, she has been supporting her local community in the COVID-19 emergency response. In India, CHWs are called accredited social health activist (ASHA), and they serve as the link between communities and health care facilities.",
          "“Being a community health worker and a COVID-19 warrior, I am so proud that I have been contributing in my best possible way to support my fellow villagers during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is so heartening to share that I could ensure the home quarantine of 45 people, who returned to my village from other states after the lockdown relaxed. I participated in the Assam Community Surveillance Programme when I visited house-to-house in my area as a part of active community surveillance,” Suchitra said.",
          "Testing, tracing and treatment through the increasing network of primary health care (PHC) centres are crucial to the national response to COVID-19. WHO, through the UHC Partnership , was already working closely with Assam State health authorities to strengthen PHC centres across the state when COVID-19 struck. The PHC network has provided a solid base, not only to make progress towards universal health coverage (UHC), but also to tackle the challenges that COVID-19 brings to communities."

Community health workers or accredited social health activists visited door-to-door to list potential cases and link them with team members to conduct screening on the following day.",
          "The response to this first phase was encouraging. With support from WHO, the State decided to carry out a second phase. Intensive testing was carried out at potential hotspots, like market areas, interstate truck and bus terminals and parking lots.",

This intensive testing approach was instrumental in identifying many COVID-19-positive patients, making timely treatment and isolating the patients possible.

          "As countries face increasingly complex health challenges, Community Engagement has become a powerful global public health tool to support behavioral change. In north-east Nigeria’s Borno state, the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners currently leverage CE to prevent attacks on health care and protect the delivery of essential health services. Since 2009, the north-eastern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (BAY) in north-east Nigeria have been facing one of the most severe humanitarian crises in the world. An estimated 5.6 million people 1 are in need of health interventions in BAY states, where insecurity issues, movement restrictions and funding gaps have severely crippled the health system. The ongoing conflict has also led to an escalation of attacks on health care and heavily restricted humanitarian access altogether. Health facilities are regularly attacked, vandalized, looted or burnt down and over 30 000 health workers across the region\r\n    face constant risk of being assaulted, abducted or criminalized for providing care to opposing parties. Since January 2020, 23 attacks on health care have been reported in north-east Nigeria via WHO Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA) 2 . Impacting health facilities, transport, supplies as well as the safety of health workers and patients, these have not only reduced the ability of health systems to deliver services\r\n    to those most in need, but have also created important barriers to health access. A destroyed health facility in Borno, north-east Nigeria, 2016. © WHO / S. Zimble 2016 The impact of attacks on health care In complex emergency contexts, every attack has a dramatic impact on communities. “In Borno state more than 40% of health facilities are non-functioning or too damaged to provide health services to the population, so when a health facility is damaged\r\n    or burnt down up to 50 000 people are at risk of losing access to all essential services.” said Dr Kazadi Mulombo, WHO representative to Nigeria. “Communities living in remote areas where no health facilities are functional may also lose\r\n    access to mobile health teams, forced to interrupt services due to security concerns. These attacks not only compromise the health of thousands but also cause significant losses of government, humanitarian agencies and donors’ resources.” Under such security-compromised conditions – and mindful of local counter-terrorism laws – introducing protective measures against attacks became essential to the delivery of health services. Since 2018, the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners\r\n    have adopted community engagement (CE) approaches in Borno state to secure protection for their own teams as well as grassroots health workers. Mobile teams set-up make a makeshift clinic under the shade of threes. © WHO / A. Clements-Hunt 2017 Preventing and protecting health care from attacks Communities are key actors in the prevention of attacks and protection of health care. Lessons learned in the Democratic Republic of the Congo showed that inviting communities to take ownership of the health services delivered in their area is paramount\r\n    in preventing attacks on health care. By nurturing ties with different communities, health care providers not only improve safe access to services but also establish long-lasting trust in the health response. The Ministry of Health, WHO and partners apply three good practices across their CE activities: Health care providers work with and through local communities, not only by informing them but also involving them as an element of health care delivery; Community leaders are involved early to foster the community’s ownership of health service delivery, starting from the decision on whether to set up a project in the area, where and how; Health care providers choose not to know affiliations to ensure equal access to health care for all parties, regardless of their personal affiliations, and adhere to health and medical ethics as far as possible. As a result, communities in Borno state are playing a critical role in protecting the health services that operate for their benefit. Community members have been seen acting as sentinels in front of health facilities, alerting health workers of pending\r\n    attacks, and even creating human shields in front of health facilities. “Health facilities are for us, for treatment of our children” said a community elder “We will protect them from bad people who want to attack them, who want\r\n    to damage them”. In addition, communities have also started providing disease-related data for surveillance databases and alerting health workers to potential outbreaks of infectious diseases, including malaria, cholera and hepatitis. However, securing ‘community engagement’ is an ongoing investment, rather than a one-off event. Consensus exists on the need to maintain regular engagement with members of the community, including weapon-bearers, as opposed to reaching out\r\n    to them solely during crisis. Health care providers need regular engagement to grasp how group dynamics differ in each context, and how to formulate their messages with impact. This calls for regular, consistent efforts being made to reach out to\r\n    communities, in moments of stability as well as instability. Engaging communities in Borno state could not have been achieved without significant efforts from health workers, local leaders and donors working to end attacks on health care. Moving forward, the WHO Country Office in Nigeria aims to strengthen its\r\n    engagement with youth to further promote the dissemination of information and volunteerism in community services. Continuing its work for the prevention of attacks and protection of health care, WHO encourages further investments in capacity building and sensitization of communities to the impact of attacks on health services that operate for their benefit. 1 Nigeria: Northeast Response – Health Sector Bulletin N°10, October 2020 2 Dashboard – Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care . Accessed 9 December 2020."

Nurses left the island and the remaining health staff became overwhelmed.

A strong and resilient health system is essential for effective public health measures of testing, tracing, isolating and treating persons with COVID-19 to slow the spread and prevent community transmission. So far, Dominica has managed to prevent community transmission through its effective public health measures, including the actions and support of the CHWs who continue to be at the heart of the COVID-19 response.",

          "With more than 100 vaccines currently in various trial phases and some reaching the pre-approval stage or being authorized for emergency use, accurate science reporting has never been more important. Journalists play a vital role in informing the public on science, specifically vaccine, developments, in an unprecedented period of scientific publishing.",
          "The situation is constantly evolving but there are some general guidelines that should be followed whenever possible.",
          "Don’t just report the topline",
          "Read the full study or report before publishing an article about it. The findings in a study’s summary may not be truly indicative of the full study’s findings. Medical journals are reviewing and publishing reports faster than they normally would , so knowing how to read them critically is crucial to accurately reporting their findings.",
          "Don’t report based only on a press release. Always read the full study or research report.",
          "Don’t trust data automatically",
          "Be aware of and willing to question stakeholders and data collection methodology. Request the raw data where possible and always include the details of the research methods in your reporting.",
          "Use trusted and reliable sources",
          "Reporting is only as good as its sources. Be sure to use expert and knowledgeable sources to inform your stories on COVID-19 and vaccines.",
          "When reporting on a new vaccine or study, consult your country’s science media centre for expert evaluations of the latest developments.",
          "State the source",
          "When reporting on scientific studies, reports, case numbers and vaccines, name the source of the information to show credibility and allow readers to search for more information on the topic.",
          "Define the terms",
          "Although certain scientific words may be used frequently in reporting on COVID-19 and vaccines, it is important to define scientific terms in every article, or link to a glossary of terms that will allow the reader to educate themselves.",
          "Use clear language",
          "Most readers will not be familiar with scientific language. Some terms can be defined within the article but make an effort to frame explanations in simplified terms so that readers across all levels of comprehension will understand.",
          "Explain the stage",
          "Some research may show exciting results based only on a preliminary set of data. Check whether a report or study has been peer reviewed and make sure your writing states which stage it is in. Early-stage research should not be reported as equal to a peer-reviewed paper from a science journal.",
          "Report the numbers",
          "There are dozens of vaccines in various stages of development at any given time. When reporting on a vaccine or study, it’s important to specify the size, numbers tested, and time period of the trial.",
          "Disclose the side effects",
          "No vaccine in history has progressed through clinical trials and pre-approval as fast as the recent COVID-19 vaccines. Clearly stating the possible side effects of any given vaccine will help inform the public and ease their reservations as will reporting on any side effects experienced by participants in a vaccine trial.",
          "Use appropriate imagery",
          "Choice of illustration in articles about vaccines is important. Vaccines are not something to fear, so avoid such visuals as crying babies, anxious-looking patients and oversized needles. Ensure that illustrations represent all readers by showing a range of people working on, administering and receiving vaccines.",
          "Don’t forget demographics",
          "Not every vaccine will be equally effective across all populations. When reporting on the efficacy of a vaccine in clinical trials, note the demographics of the participants in the trial. This information can usually be found in Table 1 of reported studies.",
          "Remind everyone of the benefits of vaccines",
          "Reporting on potentially effective COVID-19 vaccines is vital for informing those who already plan to be vaccinated, but with misinformation rife during the pandemic, don’t forget to inform readers of the importance of all vaccines.",

          "COVID-19 vaccines are finally within reach, with several breakthroughs on the horizon. This is good news at the end of a difficult pandemic year.",
          "But even after we have overcome the imminent challenges of sufficient supply, efficient rollout and equitable access, a range of well-designed programme strategies will be needed to drive acceptance and uptake.",
          "In addition to the sheer magnitude of the coming vaccination effort, the vaccines will be new and are likely to be only partially effective for a yet unknown period of time.",
          "There may be so-called adverse events rightly or incorrectly attributed to the new vaccines, and countries will set different safety thresholds before offering the vaccines to their populations.",
          "Given the limited supply in the short to medium term, vaccines are likely to be prioritized for health workers at high risk of acquiring or transmitting infection and older adults.",
          "Eventually vaccination efforts will expand to target diverse populations not typically reached with immunization programmes, both across and within countries.",
          "But research has shown that it is not enough to provide information on vaccines to encourage their uptake.",
          "The WHO Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Behavioural Insights and Sciences for Health has published a report outlining the factors that drive people’s behaviour when it comes to vaccines: an enabling environment, social influences, and motivation.",
          "It recommends addressing those drivers to encourage communities to accept and take up vaccination.",
          "First, we must make it easy, quick and affordable to get vaccinated, especially for the large proportion of people who are not deliberately avoiding vaccination.",
          "What might seem to be reluctance, resistance or even opposition, might actually be a response to the burdens or inconvenience of getting vaccinated.",
          "Immunization rollout plans need to consider factors such as the convenience of location and time, associated costs, and the quality of the experience of being vaccinated.",
          "For instance, if the default in schools is to vaccinate all students, with the provision of allowing those who object to opt out, then vaccination rates will likely be higher than if the default is to provide vaccination only to those who opt in.",
          "Making vaccines easily accessible in safe, familiar and convenient locations, such as “drop-in” clinics that are near where people often go, can also encourage uptake.",
          "This should be accompanied by targeted, credible and clear communication from trusted sources demonstrating that getting vaccinated is important, beneficial, easy, quick and affordable.",
          "Health systems must be prepared to reduce barriers to supply, service delivery and quality of services, in addition to ensuring that health care and community workers are well trained and well supported.",
          "Second, we need to harness social influences, including from trusted community figures.",
          "By making vaccine uptake “visible” to others, through clinics in prominent public places or by enabling ways for people to signal that they have received the vaccine – on social media, in news media or in person – we can contribute to making the social norm more salient.",
          "Showing that health professionals are being vaccinated can lead to greater acceptance and uptake by the general population.",
          "Amplifying endorsements from trusted community members can also help.",
          "Third, we need to increase individual motivation through open and transparent dialogue and communication about the uncertainty and risks, but also the safety and benefits of vaccination.",
          "Some may be hesitant toward vaccination due to beliefs that they have a low risk of infection, others may have concerns about the safety of vaccines, while others may be hesitant because of religious values or lack of trust in the health system.",
          "This pandemic has been accompanied by an overabundance of information and misinformation, an ‘infodemic’ on a global scale.",
          "People are inevitably exposed to misinformation, rumours and false conspiracy theories, which may erode their confidence in vaccination.",
          "Developing trusted sources, fact-checking and responding to misinformation through dedicated dashboards are some of the strategies suggested to manage infodemics.",
          "Vaccine acceptance and uptake may also be undermined by COVID-19 vaccines being not fully effective, meaning that people will have to continue to engage in preventive behaviour (e.g. mask wearing and physical distancing) even if and after they have been vaccinated.",
          "It will be important to manage expectations and ensure that those who have been vaccinated do not stop adhering to protective behaviours and expose themselves and others to risk.",
          "It is important to build trust in COVID-19 vaccines before people form an opinion against them.",
          "This should involve using trusted messengers to help navigate the COVID-19 information landscape and building confidence in the vaccine development process through transparency and managing expectations.",
          "Communicating consistently, transparently, empathetically and proactively about uncertainty, risks and vaccine availability will contribute to building trust.",
          "This article summarizes key recommendations from the report “Behavioural considerations for Acceptance and Uptake of COVID-19 Vaccines” developed by members of the WHO Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Behavioural Insights and Sciences for Health, chaired by Professor Cass Sunstein, with the support of Elena Altieri and Melanie Kim from the TAG secretariat."

          "“Young people are less at risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19 but will be the most affected by the long-term consequences of the pandemic, which will shape the world they live and work in for decades to come,\" said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"The WHO Youth Council has been set up to hear the voices and experiences of young people, and to harness and expand their energy and ideas to promote and protect health for all.”",
          "The Youth Council brings together young people from health and non-health backgrounds from all over the world to provide advice to the Director-General on global health, and other health and development issues.",
          "It’s a place where the Director-General and WHO Leadership can engage directly with young people.",
          "The Youth Council will serve as a platform for designing and incubating new initiatives and for maintaining and expanding existing meaningful youth engagement initiatives of WHO.",
          "The Council members belong to youth advocacy movements from around the globe.   Members are expected to meet several times a year to discuss issues that matter to their peers and community.",
          "As WHO would like this Council to be youth-led, an inclusive and diverse initial group will define the modalities. The design of the WHO Youth Council is underway in collaboration with youth representatives from diverse organizations, including student health organizations, young health professionals organizations, other health-focused youth NGOs, non-health youth NGOs as well as major groups on children and youth.",
          "When this core group meets in the coming week, they will define the criteria and selection of final membership taking into account diversity and inclusion and propose terms of reference."

In Kyrgyzstan, WHO conducted a survey at three international airports and four ground crossing points to determine the level of implementation of prevention measures on the ground.",
          "Airport staff and ground staff were asked to complete a self-assessment questionnaire based on a checklist of key questions and considerations. The survey was designed to assess knowledge and equipment needed for responding to COVID-19 transmission risks, as well as to provide advice on how to reduce those risks among travellers, aircrew and ground staff.",
          "The assessment observed all measures taken at the points of entry. These included the reporting and referral of travellers suspected to have COVID-19 infection, initial patient care, and the use of risk communication materials advising inbound travellers on when and where to seek medical care if needed. An updated national action plan will seek to address any gaps and improve the management of suspected COVID-19 cases.",
          "The questions and considerations for the checklist are based on WHO’s interim technical guidance issued in the context of COVID-19, as well as technical guidance released by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for the COVID-19 pandemic. They are also aligned with the core capacity requirements of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) core capacities for airports.",

          "WHO recently launched a new alliance to combat misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other health emergencies in Africa. The Infodemic Response Alliance (AIRA) will coordinate action and pool resources to promote accurate lifesaving information and debunk dangerous practices. Digital platforms have been inundated with COVID-19-related information since the pandemic began in late 2019. A large proportion of this information is inaccurate and misleading and continues to be shared by social media users as well as offline intentionally or unknowingly every day. Fact-checking organizations in Africa say they have debunked more than 1000 misleading conspiracies around unproven treatments, false cures and anti-vaccine messages since the onset of the pandemic. The Africa Infodemic Response Alliance will work collaboratively to counter false information around COVID-19 vaccines and complement on the ground public health awareness raising and community engagement efforts. It also aims to support individual African countries in developing tailored infodemic management strategies, including analyzing trends and behaviours, recruiting specialists and refining systematic engagement strategies rooted in research and analytics. This initiative puts into practice key recommendations on infodemic management that were developed by over 1 300 experts from across disciplines in early 2020 under the auspices of WHO’s global Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN). WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response .

          "In a busy intensive care unit in Eka Kotebe General Hospital, Addis Ababa, Dr Samuel Getnet, 28, a newly-recruited young and energetic physician anxiously monitors the mechanical ventilators, an indispensable form of life support for COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress.",
          "“I never thought my professional journey would bring me to the place where I'm today—at the center of COVID-19 pandemic management team—treating and caring for the most severely ill patients who critically need my support and care. Despite the challenges and risks, I am grateful for the opportunity to serve my people at this critical time,” he said.",
          "Dr Getnet is a general practitioner who came on board as part of the surge capacity planning for human resources announced by the Ethiopian Ministry of Health in February 2020. Before starting his duty in the intensive care unit, he received in-person training from the World Health Organization (WHO), with practical sessions taking place in the hospital. The topics he covered include case management, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), infection prevention and control (IPC), and the application and use of mechanical ventilation. He also benefited from online WHO resources such as Open WHO.org .",
          "Since the beginning of the pandemic, WHO, through the UHC Partnership , has been supporting the Government and Ministry of Health to increase the number of health workers and improve their skills in order to provide emergency care for COVID-19 patients, prevent new infections and maintain essential health services. This work builds on the existing Ethiopian health workforce extension programme, the community health programme and other strategic investments already made to strengthen the health system.",
          "More health care workers are needed for the national response",
          "Ethiopia is one of the 57 countries in the world with a chronic shortage of health workers. To help urgently address this, WHO’s support has been largely focused on helping the Human Resources for Health Directorate of the Ministry of Health and the Ethiopian Public Health Institution to forecast needs, map, recruit, train and deploy health workers in response to the pandemic.",
          "WHO initially provided support in estimating the health workforce necessary for acute and intensive care over the course of the pandemic. Using results from a simulation tool, the Government then made plans to recruit 45,000 health care providers of different professional categories in addition to the 104,506 health professionals currently working in the health system.",
          "No health without health workers",
          "WHO has been working closely with the Ministry of Health and the Regional Health Bureau to ensure availability and access to health workers not only for COVID-19 related care but also the maintenance of essential health services.",
          "Following the initial cases of COVID-19, there was a drop in the utilization of essential health services. To provide practical guidance to reorganize and safely maintain access to quality, essential health services at national, regional and local levels, WHO assisted the Ministry of Health to develop and roll-out its Implementation Guide for non-COVID-19 essential health services in Ethiopia. This was done with support from the UHC Partnership, one of WHO’s largest initiatives for universal health coverage (UHC). The Partnership works in 115 countries to help governments accelerate progress towards UHC through funding from the European Union (EU), the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Irish Aid, the Government of Japan, the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, the United Kingdom - Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office  and Belgium.",
          "To boost the motivation of health workers and improve their working environment, the Ministry of Health has put in place other measures for which WHO has provided technical support. These include a life and health insurance scheme, preparation of a special allowance for health workers, extra funding to high-load hospitals, guidelines and protocols for isolation, quarantine and treatment of health workers.",
          "WHO has been supporting frontline health workers to increase their capacity to respond rapidly and efficiently to COVID-19 while also protecting their own health. This includes technical support for updating IPC measures including water and sanitation guidelines, a risk assessments checklist and guidance for detention centres and sporting events.",
          "The COVID-19 crisis sends a strong message that resilient health systems can only be achieved with a strong health workforce. Protecting everyone requires urgently addressing health worker shortages, investing in their capacity building and ensuring that their work environments enable them to serve in the best way they can.",

          "900 free HIV self-testing kits were sent to 120 locations across Bulgaria, thanks to a pilot project of Single Step Foundation with support from WHO.",
          "A pilot project conducted in Bulgaria has shown that more people get tested for HIV when self-testing is available. In situations where testing is based in health-care institutions, it can be a challenge to encourage some people to come forward.",
          "Teodor Paunov poses for a portrait at his home in a suburb of Sofia, Bulgaria, on 20 November 2020. After seeing an advertisement from Single Step Foundation about HIV self-testing, Teodor ordered a test to check his HIV status. © WHO / Blink Media — Nikolay Doychinov",
          "“The worries in my community I think come from that many of them are still hidden, not just from their families but also from themselves,” said Teodor Paunov. “And also, the idea that it might happen to someone else, but it will never\r\n    happen to me, so why would I get tested, I am fine.”",
          "Community-based testing is a good way to overcome those barriers, but it can be labour intensive. Self-testing can be less expensive, and the pilot project clearly shows the role it can play. The findings are especially relevant to health authorities\r\n    working hard to maintain essential services during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

          "Testing for HIV is a critical public health intervention because it is the first step towards treatment and care. With current antiretroviral treatment, people who test positive can expect to live a healthy life with HIV without passing it on to anyone\r\n    else.",
          "The population groups in Bulgaria who are most vulnerable to HIV infection include gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people. Despite progress in recent years, many MSM and transgender people in Bulgaria are not aware\r\n    of their HIV status and are reluctant to seek testing at health institutions due to fear of potential stigma.",
          "A simple saliva test with results in 20 minutes",
          "The pilot project was conducted by local nongovernmental organization Single Step Foundation . Momchil Baev, Sexual Health and HIV Manager for the organization, said, “We offered\r\n    MSM and trans people the opportunity to test for HIV completely for free, confidentially, in the comfort of their home, without having to visit a health centre or meet anyone. We used an approved oral test method, which detects antibodies to the HIV\r\n    virus in saliva. It is easy, convenient and reliable. A swab is rubbed along the gums, then immersed into a reaction solution, and the result is available after 20 minutes.”",
          "Momchil Baev, Sexual Health & HIV Program Manager for Single Step Foundation, works in his apartment in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 20 November 2020. © WHO / Blink Media — Nikolay Doychinov Over the course of the campaign, the NGO sent out 900 free HIV self-testing kits to 120 locations, in all 28 districts of the country. The campaign was promoted on social media under #endHIVbg and benefited from Single Step Foundation’s partnership\r\n        with Grindr, one of the world’s largest social networking apps for gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people.",
          "Single Step placed full-screen notifications that would appear when users opened the Grindr app, as well as direct inbox messages within the app to all Grindr users in the country. Users were then prompted to order an HIV home test online by clicking\r\n    through to the Single Step website, where they could fill out a questionnaire and order a test kit. Tests were delivered by post free of charge.",
          "“Providing support during the COVID- 19 protracted crises is giving hope to many people in need of a healthier and safer future,” said Dr Skender Syla, WHO Representative in Bulgaria. “The WHO team in Bulgaria is impressed with the dedication,\r\n    hard work and positive energy of all engaged in HIV self-testing initiative.”",
          "Ivan Dimov, Founder and Chairman of Single Step Foundation, at The Steps, the social enterprise of the foundation, in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 19 November 2020. “We offered the community a solution that works in a very easy and effective way, and we reached them via a channel that reaches the majority of our target group.” © WHO / Blink Media — Nikolay Doychinov",
          "While working as a performer this summer in Sunny Beach, Bulgaria, the ad for home testing caught Paunov’s attention, so he ordered one. Paunov typically gets tested twice a year but this year, due to COVID-19, he said there was nowhere to get tested.",
          "“I am a proponent for sexual health generally, especially amongst my queer friends and acquaintances,” Paunov said. “I think it’s right for us to get tested and to be healthy and responsible to ourselves and our partners respectively.”",
          "Concerns about how support would be provided to someone who tested positive were answered by setting up a dedicated support phone line, staffed by a sexual health and HIV manager. Twelve positive results were reported to the phone line in the initial\r\n    pilot campaign and another 15 and counting in its second round in 2020. Callers were referred to a follow-up test at a medical testing centre to confirm the result. All the people affected received treatment and now have an undetectable viral load.",

          "“For some of the guys with a positive result, it was rather difficult to cope with the sad news,” explained Baev.",
          "Many of the men were from rural areas with very limited access to quality information, community services or medical care. Single Step provided support and guidance until they were able to access treatment and start dealing with the diagnosis.",
          "“In such a hard moment it’s important for a person to understand that the HIV diagnosis is in no way a death sentence,” Baev said. “Secondly, it’s not a punishment for their way of life and HIV can happen to absolutely anyone.”",
          "Valuable behavioural insights",
          "Questionnaires before and after testing have provided valuable insights into the service and how it has been received. 1574 MSM and trans people from 164 towns and villages responded and many did not know their HIV status.",
          "The project revealed an important difference between the capital and provincial areas — 68% of MSM and transgender individuals living in smaller cities were not aware of their HIV status, suggesting that HIV testing options are not as accessible\r\n    outside the capital. HIV self-testing can bridge that gap. The pilot project also showed that 68% of those unaware of their status never or rarely use a condom, one third of all respondents (31%) had never been tested for HIV, and 71% prefer home\r\n    HIV testing over traditional methods.",
          "Teodor Paunov walks through a field in a suburb of Sofia, Bulgaria, on 20 November 2020. © WHO / Blink Media — Nikolay Doychinov",
          "“This pilot project has shown that there is strong demand in the community for HIV self-testing in Bulgaria,” said Dr Masoud Dara, Coordinator for Communicable Diseases at the WHO Regional Office for Europe. “It also shows how self-testing\r\n    can help expand testing services to reduce inequalities between rural and urban areas.”",
          "Since 2016, WHO has recommended that HIV self-testing be offered as an additional approach to traditional HIV testing services. However, not all countries in the WHO European Region have taken full advantage of the possibility.",
          "The Bulgarian Ministry of Health is currently developing a new national HIV prevention and control program for the period of 2021–2025. Baev and WHO Public Health Expert Dr Michail Okoliyski say it is critical that self-testing services combined\r\n    with PrEP, PEP, and free STI testing are included.",
          "“The timely inauguration of the new National HIV Programme would be a very important factor for the successful implementation of all preventive and treatment activities which will help end the AIDS epidemic, ” Dr Okoliyski said.",

The course strengthened the skills and knowledge among staff who completed the previous two levels of training on tracking COVID-19 case contacts. This adds to three existing courses supported by WHO to provide community volunteers and public officials information and guidance for the detection, monitoring and tracing of cases and contacts. With an unprecedented need to track contacts, an activity that requires a large number of people to learn new skills quickly, WHO has supporting the COCYTC since its inception, providing technical support in designing, planning, advising, convening and disseminating training materials. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response .

          "A large part of Bhutan’s success in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic—with zero deaths, zero infections among health workers, low overall infection rates and high patient recovery—despite having the world’s two most populous countries and high case rates in its vicinity can be attributed to WHO’s work in the country.",
          "Bhutan, with WHO’s support, acted early and took bold and decisive steps while implementing core public health measures to detect, test, trace, isolate and treat cases. The country has been scaling up capacities of health workers, hospitals, laboratories and ensuring that the delivery of essential health services are not affected even in times of lockdown.",
          "Leading Bhutan’s fight against COVID-19",
          "When we recently talked with Dr Rui Paulo de Jesus, WHO Representative to Bhutan, it became clear that the country’s record in the fight against COVID-19 was the result of diligent preparation and a timely response to the COVID-19 health emergency.",
          "“Even before COVID-19 outbreak emerged, WHO made efforts and invested a significant amount of funds to enhance preparedness for both natural disasters and disease outbreaks.” Emergency preparedness and response is one of the eight flagship programs in the WHO South-East Asia Region and its importance is emphasized in every workplan, explains Dr de Jesus.",
          "Leading WHO’s activity in Bhutan, he traces the country’s successful COVID-19 preparation efforts all the way back to 2018 when the country underwent a joint external evaluation of its emergency readiness.",
          "WHO has worked closely with the Royal Government of Bhutan to set up a health emergency operations centre as well as a WHO emergency operations centre. Another example of preparation was investing in equipment such as Medical Camp Kit (MCK) tents which can be deployed within hours if there is disruption in providing services in health care facilities. So far, one way the tents have been used is as flu clinics to treat patients with respiratory disease symptoms to prevent them from mixing with other patients and spreading infectious diseases including COVID-19. The clinic also serve as screening site for COVID-19",
          "Medical Camp Kit training in Bhutan",
          "Looking ahead",
          "In November 2019, WHO in collaboration with Ministry of Health conducted a simulation exercise at the Paro International airport. The scenario was a passenger arriving from abroad with a suspected case of a “coronavirus disease”. One month later, “the original Wuhan outbreak was identified and hit us”, he said.",
          "That exercise involved national authorities including armed forces, police as well as civil aviation, customs and food safety authorities, flight crews, health officials and a volunteer group called Desuung which was initiated under the patronage of his Majesty, the King of Bhutan. The exercise allowed all participants to identify areas of improvement.",
          "Even before the pandemic was known to the world, WHO and Ministry of Health in Bhutan have been working towards strengthening laboratory capacities including upgrading the Royal Centre of Disease Control from biosafety level from ll to lll by providing equipment and building the capacity of staff. This work continues and has been a critical part of Bhutan’s COVID-19 preparedness and response.",
          "Another early key activity was assessing the readiness of the health system and availability of health workers. Using protocols provided by WHO, Bhutan assigned and trained workers to lead the frontline response. Training on donning and doffing personal protective equipment was crucial and was carried out on a weekly prior to the first case so it would become second nature, says Dr de Jesus.",
          "A point of pride for the WHO Representative is that the Organization is the only one listed as part of the Technical Advisory Group for the COVID-19 response. The advisory team provides a daily analysis of the epidemiological situation. In the initial days of the outbreak, the WHO country office played a crucial role in updating and sharing the latest technical guidelines and strategies to design a timely national response with the Ministry of Health.",
          "Other WHO activities have included supporting the development of the health emergency contingency plan, conducting joint evaluations.",
          "When the very first case was identified in March, the team was ready to move very quickly. The lab results came at midnight. By 6 am all the primary contacts were identified and isolated and put in quarantine.",
          "One of WHO’s major contributions to keeping COVID-19 at bay in Bhutan was its timely delivery of personal protective equipment and funding support.",
          "The Organization’s work has received praise from Bhutan’s Prime Minister and Health Minister.",
          "In its response to a pandemic with the severity COVID-19 WHO is not alone. Its partners include the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Population Fund and other agencies.",
          "The WHO country office team in Bhutan was recognized by the UN system in Bhutan and awarded the UN Certificate for “Facilitating delivery in the time of COVID-19”.",
          "Worth the investment",
          "No country in the world can be 100% prepared for a public health threat, says Dr de Jesus. But if there is anything to learn from Bhutan, it is that early preparedness is the first step toward winning the battle. “It is now evident to all of us that it is worth to invest in emergency preparedness in all aspects. As WHO, we need to continuously review our readiness because the COVID-19 pandemic is not the last one.”",
          "While Bhutan’s forward-looking preparation has helped stop the country from being overwhelmed by the pandemic, a one-size-fits is not appropriate for every country, the Dr points out. Aspects like geography, income, social determinants of health and other factors must be considered.",
          "Echoing WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Dr de Jesus believes that the response to a global crisis like COVID-19 must be “an all of government approach and an all of society approach”.",
          "While the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, Dr de Jesus’s messages of readiness and working together are more important than ever.",

In coordination with NTP, WHO is providing human resources, technical and logistic support to strengthen the national response on TB control in the district. The program includes early TB detection of drug sensitive and drug-resistant (DR) Tuberculosis and timely and quality treatment to all patients.",

          "The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland represented by the British High Commission, Suva, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with WHO to strengthen partnership in the Pacific. As part of the agreement, the UK is providing additional funding of £1.8 million to provide critical assistance and build on work already underway to strengthen COVID-19 preparedness and response capacity across eleven Pacific Island countries. Although the Pacific has not yet seen severe outbreaks, all countries remain vulnerable and widespread community transmission can still occur unless strong prevention, control and treatment measures are in place. The UK is therefore providing funding for critical medical equipment to contain and mitigate the virus across the region. WHO will provide technical support related to the use of this equipment. The donation will help procure critical medical equipment such as ventilators, patient monitoring systems with ECG monitors and portable X-ray machines for Fiji, the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response .

These measures and more are detailed in the newly launched “Guidelines for the application of non-pharmacological public health measures in populations in vulnerable situations in the context of COVID-19.”",

Recommendations are made on identifying the groups most impacted by these interventions and their barriers to adherence, along with suggestions on how to adapt the interventions so populations are protected.",

It calls on policy makers to address the unintended effects of interventions such as business closures that leave informal workers without pay. Likewise, some of the public health recommendations – such as telling people to wash their hands frequently when they have little or no access to clean water and soap - have proven difficult for them.",

          "She offered her house as a venue for Project PrEP’s mobile clinic teams during South Africa’s hard lockdowns during the first wave of COVID-19. Her daughter and niece have started using PrEP, and Dorothy plays an active role in ensuring they\r\n    stay on PrEP – because as she puts it, “they have this option to prevent HIV and, as mothers, we must encourage them to do so”.",
          "Dorothy’s message to parents is “Let’s talk to our kids. Let’s not let what happened to us, happen to our kids”. Dorothy talks to parents and young people about the empowering benefits of PrEP in ensuring an HIV-free generation,\r\n    and encourages those who are living with HIV to disclose their status to their loved ones, so they can make informed decisions about their own lives and enjoy the support and encouragement of their families. Dorothy continues to welcome the mobile\r\n    clinic to her home to enable more young people in her community to access PrEP and other services for sexual and reproductive health.",

The group also provided more detailed guidance on how to adapt the global recommendations to countries in the WHO European Region.",

          "WHO, in coordination with the Ninewa Directorate of Health, has established an isolation unit at Hamam Aleel Field Hospital in Ninewa to treat suspected and confirmed cases of internally displaced COVID-19 patients. The unit will also serve to limit COVID-19 transmission in camps for the internally displaced in the governorate. The unit is composed of two wards, each of which has five rooms with a total capacity of 20 beds. The referral services have accordingly been strengthened to facilitate the transfer of patients from camps to the isolation unit and from the unit to other secondary health facilities where advanced medical intervention is required. The current COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed the fragile health system in Ninewa where almost all secondary health facilities have been damaged and over 75% of hospital bed capacity lost during the five-year internal conflict which erupted in the governorate in 2014. WHO extends its appreciation to the Government of Kuwait and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for their generous contributions which have supported the establishment of this unit. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response .

          "WHO and Germany’s Federal Ministry of Health have donated a portable X-Ray machine to the Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital Authority (KHMHA) for use at the COVID-19 Critical Care Unit. As a follow-up to a ventilator that was delivered to the KHMHA recently, this donation also represents efforts to strengthen the capacity of the country’s health system to save lives during and the pandemic and beyond. The machine will not only improve the ability of medical staff to manage COVID-19 cases, but it will also reduce the risk of cross-contamination of staff and other non-COVID-19 patients. While traditional film radiography continues to be effective for diagnosis, digital x-rays allow for the electronic manipulation of images in order to improve definition, which provides better image quality. As opposed to traditional x-rays, digital versions do not require development in a dark room, decreasing processing time and the use of resources. Additionally, the use of digital x-rays allows for easy storage, retrieval, and sharing of high-quality images. Digital x-rays facilitate monitoring of a patient’s progress, improve clinical decision-making, As the number of cases of COVID-19 increases in Belize, the portable X-ray machine will increase efficiency, allowing for quicker diagnoses, while improving patient safety with fewer retakes and decreased radiation exposure during the clinical care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The support being provided by WHO through procurement of vital hospital equipment is intended to enhance the hospital’s capacity to manage patients with COVID-19 and will also contribute to expanding the health system’s capacity to respond to disasters and pandemics in the future. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19.

          "To increase diagnostic capacity in response to COVID-19 pandemic, WHO, with funding from the European Union (EU), donated supplies to South Sudan’s National Public Health Laboratory. The supplies included materials and reagents that support real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a test platform for COVID-19 viral detection. The supplies will be sufficient to support testing for over 500 COVID-19 samples per day for the next two months. Detection of patients with COVID-19 symptoms is essential for patient care and isolation in designated facilities and to screen close contacts for asymptomatic infection and disease as part of outbreak response. Thanks to the generous contribution of the EU, the introduction of diagnostic techniques and increased testing will enhance the capacity and effectiveness of South Sudan’s fight against COVID-19. The laboratory has contributed significantly to the COVID-19 response through support to communicable disease surveillance, outbreak detection, contact tracing and management of confirmed cases.

          "As a health surveillance assistant, Chrissy Taula knows her small community of Mngwere, Dedza district, Malawi well. For the past 12 years, she has immunized children against vaccine-preventable diseases, advised families on exclusive breastfeeding and infant nutrition, educated families about family planning methods, and measured children to ensure their growth is on track.",
          "“I really enjoy being able to go into the community and interact with the families,” says Taula, who became a health surveillance assistant after years of seeing people in her community suffer from ill health. “With me, families are free to express their mind and their views.”",
          "Though Taula serves as the first level of care in her community, she’s limited in the care she can provide to families, especially small and sick infants aged up to two months.",
          "Up until three years ago, whenever she saw an infant who was breathing rapidly, not feeding well, and having a fever – all potential signs of a bacterial infection or pneumonia – she’d refer the family to the district hospital for treatment. However, few families would seek care due to the cost of travel and treatment or concerns about quality of care. As a result, many infants died.",
          "Serious bacterial infection is a leading cause of newborn mortality worldwide, contributing to an estimated one in five deaths in the first month of life. In Malawi, approximately 12 000 (46%) of an estimated 26 000 under 5 deaths in 2019 occurred in the first 28 days of life. Most of these deaths are from preventable or treatable causes, including infections like pneumonia.",
          "Treating infants at the community level",
          "To support health surveillance assistants like Taula provide care to small and sick infants in low-resource settings, WHO released a Guideline for managing possible serious bacterial infection in young infants when referral is not feasible in 2015, and worked with UNICEF to advise countries to implement it at first-level health facilities. The guideline recommends a simplified, outpatient antibiotic treatment regimen for managing possible severe bacterial infections and fast breathing in young infants.",
          "Tadala Kabanga, a health surveillance assistant in Dedza district, Malawi conducts a child health assessment in a village clinic shelter. Photo courtesy of Malawi Ministry of Health .",
          "However, before the Ministry of Health in Malawi would implement the guideline nationwide, they wanted to understand the feasibility of delivering a simplified treatment through the country’s health surveillance assistants, and whether families would accept the treatment. Working with WHO and Save the Children, the Ministry of Health conducted a pilot programme from February to November 2017 in first-level health facilities to train health workers to assess, classify and identify treatment for sick infants under 2 months of age.",
          "At the time, the district that Taula came from was also introducing a new community-based maternal newborn care package, that included training health surveillance assistants to counsel families on newborn danger signs during pregnancy and postnatal home visits, and to assess and refer sick young infants.",
          "When infants with signs of possible severe bacterial infections were identified, health workers were guided to treat the infants with two injections of gentamicin for 2 days in the hospital, plus oral amoxicillin for 7 days, if referral was not feasible. However, if the infants only had fast breathing, they were treated with oral amoxicillin for 7 days at home without referring to a higher facility, and health surveillance assistants followed up with families through home visits on days 3 and 6 to ensure treatment adherence.",
          "The study found that more than 90% of infants recommended for outpatient treatment completed their treatment, and that families accepted the outpatient treatment due to the reduced travel time and costs associated, as well as the follow-up by the health surveillance assistants. The Ministry of Health is now planning to further study feasibility in more districts and expects to scale-up implementation of the guideline throughout the country.",
          "“Our findings showed that treatment for the most vulnerable babies can be increased at the lowest level of care in Malawi,” says Humphreys Nsona, Programme Manager for Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses Unit in the Ministry of Health in Malawi. “Apart from increasing access to treatment, this study showed that preventative health programmes should not be standalone programmes. Rather, they should be harmonized and integrated into care at the community level.”",
          "“By increasing quality of care at the community level, we have a better opportunity to achieve Sustainable Develop Goal 3 and further contribute to reducing newborn mortality in Malawi,” he continues.",
          "Referral for hospital care continues to be the preferred method for the management of neonates and young infants with possible severe bacterial infection in settings where it is accepted and available. However, WHO’s guideline for treating infants with fast breathing pneumonia without referral is essential to saving lives in low-resource settings and reduces overcrowding in hospitals.",
          "“Prior to training, parents would come to me with their sick babies, but I didn’t have the skills to treat them. All I could do was refer them to the hospital,” says Taula. “Now, through this training and guidance, I am able to assess the children, identify their problems, and manage their treatment at the community level.”"

          "The state of Uttar Pradesh continues to be one of the high-burden states in India. Being the country’s most populous state, with a population of nearly 200 million, its fight against COVID-19 has been particularly challenging. When the cases surged after the lifting of restrictions, as part of its surveillance response activities with support from WHO, the state government put in place a mechanism to evaluate the status and quality of contact tracing to guide decision making for an informed public health response. The WHO National Public Health Surveillance Project (NPSP) team of medical officers along with 800 field monitors undertook a massive exercise to assess the status and quality of contact tracing amongst the 58 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 75 districts across the state. The WHO surveillance medical officers (SMOs) and sub-regional team leaders (SRTLs) conducted training for all the field monitors on the interview process and questionnaire. The WHO field monitors also strengthened public health education through advocacy about necessary infection prevention and control measures. The WHO team provided technical support to the state government to boost contact tracing efforts and strengthen capacity of field teams through training. Field monitors assessed the quality of contact tracing of 58 000 COVID-19 positive cases in 75 districts and found that 93% of the high-risk contacts were contacted and tested. This exercise helped the government in strengthening contact tracing in 17 districts where more than 12 000 high-risk contacts were missed for testing. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response .

          "Sitting under the shelter of her home in Port Vila, Sera is one of more than 25 000 people in the Pacific Island State of Vanuatu who lives with diabetes. On average across the State, 1 in 11 people are living with the condition.",
          "Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. It is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower\r\n    limb amputation.",
          "Sera has lost sight in her right eye due to her condition. Lower limb amputation is also common among people living with diabetes in Vanuatu.",
          "In 2019, 61 people in the country lost all, or part of, their lower limbs from amputations needed because their diabetes was not adequately controlled. Such operations are largely avoidable, and they cause considerable distress to patients and families\r\n    alike. They are also considered unacceptably frequent by the Government of Vanuatu."

          "With its population scattered across 83 islands, reaching everyone in Vanuatu who lives with a noncommunicable disease (NCD), such as diabetes, has been both a long-standing ambition and a logistical challenge. To help achieve this goal, WHO has worked\r\n    with the Government of Vanuatu to introduce a package of interventions to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases through the primary health care system.",
          "This package, known as \"WHO PEN”, sets out the best-practice care for people living with type 2 diabetes in low-resource settings. Having reliable access to insulin is a core part of the recommended pharmacological approach; adherence to oral medication,\r\n    physical activity and healthy diets is not enough.",
          "Acting on diabetes forms a core part of Vanuatu’s national health sector strategy. Alongside WHO PEN, Vanuatu’s “Fight Sik Suka” initiative seeks to reduce the incidence and impacts of diabetes through national media campaigns,\r\n    programmes for healthy villages and schools, and efforts to increase community-based screening.",
          "As part of these efforts, increasing access to insulin is a crucial piece of the puzzle. When asked why insulin is important to her care, Sera is clear: “Diabetes is taking its toll on my life. But I know that insulin is keeping me going.”\r\n    It also encourages her to consider other aspects of her health: “When I depend on insulin, I have to know what I’m eating, and how can I survive in a day.”",
          "Rose, who lives with diabetes, would prefer to be able to control her condition from home Credit: WHO/T. Bayandorj",
          "Across town, Rose is another Vanuatu resident who requires ongoing care from nearby health services for her diabetes. A major challenge for her is the continual visits to hospital. Although being able to self-monitor blood glucose is only one element\r\n    of managing diabetes, for Rose, having the equipment at home to enable her to do that would have made a difference: “In order for me to stay home and test myself, I need access to a blood glucose machine. Otherwise, I spend lots of the money\r\n    I have on bus fare to come to hospital. If there was an opportunity to be given a machine, I would certainly like to be taught how to use it.”",
          "For Sera, the visits to the health clinic create another challenge  ̶  fatigue: \"When I visit the NCD clinic, sometimes I feel really tired and I have to hang onto my carer who takes me through. I get tired, and I only wish I could receive my\r\n    medication at home.”",
          "The supply of medication is crucial. As Rose tells us, the demand for insulin across Vanuatu means she is only able to access small quantities at a time: “If it was possible to provide more than one bottle of insulin at a time, it would make my\r\n    life much easier. My medication works, but I can only get so much at a time, around one month. I cannot get more because there are so many people on those drugs. It would be good to have more supplies, so I could stay home, and save money rather than\r\n    have to come back and forth, back and forth.”",
          "Sera and Rose’s testimonies highlight why strong primary health care that integrates care for NCDs is so important. Ensuring equitable and local access to medicines can lead to better patient care, and less need for expensive treatment to treat\r\n    painful complications.",
          "Despite the challenges of living with diabetes, Sera keeps a positive mindset: “ Whatever diabetes has done to my life, I have to accept it in some ways. I’m enjoying life. I had better not let it slip through my fingers. I've got\r\n    to grab hold of it, and count every day as a blessing.”"

          "At the opening session of the resumed 73rd World Health Assembly, the Director- General bestowed the WHO Director-General’s Health Leaders Award for outstanding leadership in global health to Her Royal Highness Princess Muna Al-Hussein of Jordan (HRH) for her “dedication and service to health and humanity” and her “tireless support over six decades for nurses and midwives”.",
          "HRH Princess Muna is a renowned figure for her role in global health and social development. As a WHO patron of nursing and midwifery in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, Vice President of the Royal College of Nursing of the United Kingdom and an honorary adviser for WHO Collaborating Centre for Nursing Development in Jordan, HRH has been a passionate advocate for health workforce development and strengthening. She has taken a special interest in developing nursing and midwifery to enhance the quality, equity and efficiency of health care, particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.",
          "She set up the Princess Muna College of Nursing in 1962 as her early commitment to the provision of quality nursing and the advancement of nursing services, practice and education.  She is the founder and president of the Jordanian Nursing Council, which was established in 2002.",
          "HRH is a recipient of six honorary doctoral degrees and a number of international awards for her leadership role in advancing health and welfare globally and her contribution to the nursing profession, including the Honorary fellowship from the UK Royal College of Physicians in 2014, the Honorary Fellowship of the Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery of the Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland, in 2015 and the Sigma Theta Tau International Archon Award in 2007.",
          "She is also former Commissioner to the UN High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth and Champion for the Nursing Now Campaign.",
          "The Director General also conferred the WHO Director General Award to the Kingdom of Tonga’s Nurses’ Choir, who “lifted our spirits and touched our hearts”, through their video performance at the opening of the Assembly, to mark the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife.",
          "2020, as the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife has been a critical year for millions of nurses and midwives. The COVID 19 pandemic has exposed the underlying issues within healthcare systems, including shortages of nurses and midwives. Many nurses and midwives have suffered and even died."

          "So far Pakistan has fared well in its fight against COVID-19. In a country with over 212 million inhabitants, to date roughly 303 000 cases have been recorded and the curve of new infections has flattened since its peak in May and June.",
          "For a developing country facing other crises, this has been a welcome relief.",
          "At the heart of the country’s battle has been Dr Palitha Mahipala, WHO Representative and Head of Mission, originally from Sri Lanka and based in Islamabad, who has been working around the clock seven days a week since the beginning of the pandemic.",
          "“WHO focuses on different aspects of the COVID-19 response in each country. But in Pakistan, the Organization has been involved on every level and has had a significant impact”, says Dr Mahipala.",
          "WHO had been working on many fronts in Pakistan during the pandemic even before the country recorded any cases.",
          "Policy engagement and expert support",
          "Dr Mahipala acknowledges that he wouldn’t be able to lead WHO’s crucial work without the support of Pakistan’s Ministry of Health, with whom he meets “every day or every other day”.",
          "Working with the Government on high level advocacy and policy dialogue is the first level of WHO’s multi-faceted approach to fight COVID-19 in Pakistan.",
          "“What are the measures the government is taking? What is the highest level of commitment we can have?” These are some of the questions that drive the doctor’s work in the policy area.",
          "Technical assistance is another area of WHO’s work plan.",
          "“From early January, the moment WHO headquarters sent us the technical guidance, I was working the same day with the Minister of Health on our response strategy. At that time, we didn’t have a single case. We didn’t have testing capacity.\r\n    The first thing we did was to draw up a national action plan according to the pillars identified by WHO,” says Dr Mahipala.",
          "On 23 April 2020, Pakistan launched its Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan ,\r\n prepared by WHO, as a global online event and platform where it was able to raise US $595 million from donors around the world. The plan and the funds got Pakistan off to a strong start in its fight to stop the spread of COVID-19.",
          "Strengthening points of entry and testing",
          "When Pakistan didn’t have any cases of the new coronavirus, and neighbouring countries such as Iran were recording high numbers, controlling points of entry was crucial. WHO played a strong role in trying to slow the arrival the disease.",
          "In mid-January, WHO and the Ministry of Health began screening potential cases and distributing information pamphlets about the risk of the disease to arriving passengers at Islamabad airport. To protect airport staff, WHO provided training and distributed\r\n    personal protective equipment (PPE). After working on securing Islamabad airport, Dr Mahipala and WHO teams assessed and strengthened other airports as well as isolation and quarantine centres with the Ministry of Health.",
          "When asked about Pakistan’s biggest gaps, Dr Mahipala says that in the beginning of the crisis Pakistan could only test about 200 people per day. But WHO quickly helped the country ramp up its testing capacity.",
          "“Within six to eight weeks we were up to 30 000 tests per day. We expanded that further and now we can do more than 50 000 tests per day,” he says.",
          "Once again WHO was involved in all the areas of strengthening Pakistan’s testing capacity. WHO obtained tests, supported the hiring and training of staff to carry out testing, and assessed labs all over the country. The Organization has also been\r\n    providing staff with PPE, transporting test samples and adding PCR machines to the country’s testing system.",
          "Protecting frontline health workers",
          "Dr Palitha honouring and appreciating front line healthcare workers for their hard work, commitment and dedication in catering to the need of COVID-19 patients",
          "WHO has been committed to protecting frontline health workers throughout the crisis and Pakistan is no exception, although sadly there have been casualties.",
          "At the time of speaking, Dr Mahipala says that he knows of more than 6 000 doctors, nurses and paramedics who have been infected as well as some deaths.",
          "To support those who also work to protect the rest of the country population, WHO and the Ministry of Health created the WECARE program, which so far has trained 100 000 health care workers on safety practices. In addition to training, the program supplies\r\n    PPE and motivational support through videos, TV and radio programs.",
          "Acknowledging the crucial role of health workers, Dr Mahipala says: “We need to recognize them as frontline heroes looking after patients and putting their lives at risk.”",
          "Another stream of WHO’s work in Pakistan is research and development, which has involved undertaking large scale studies of COVID-19 cases by staff in Pakistan and supported by WHO colleagues in Geneva. “That will add knowledge not only to\r\n    Pakistan but also globally,” the doctor points out.",
          "Success factors",
          "The groundwork WHO and Pakistan have laid on combatting other diseases has been a decisive factor in limiting the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak so far.",
          "From the beginning of the crisis, polio staff carried out surveillance and provided training to frontline health workers. “The polio infrastructure we have and related campaigns were fully utilized for COVID-19,” says Dr Mahipala.",
          "WHO Director-General Dr Tedros  Adhanom Ghebreyesus had previously commended how the country capitalized on its previous work on polio: \"Pakistan deployed the infrastructure built up over many years for polio to combat COVID-19. Community health\r\n    workers who have been trained to go door-to-door vaccinating children have been utilized for surveillance, contact tracing and care.\"",
          "This success has also helped WHO in Pakistan raise further funds.",
          "With cases at a low level, another problem is arising—complacency among the population in cooperating with public protective measures.",
          "In the current phase of the outbreak, Dr Mahipala and his colleagues are focusing more on communications as a key  aspect of the response.",
          "“We really built on communications channels we set up for polio. Radio penetration is high and so is social media, which we were already using for polio.”",
          "Mobile phone communications has also been key. “Here even people who have barely anything have a mobile phone, or more than one,” he explains.",
          "WHO has also worked with religious groups and scholars to get their messages out in Pakistan.",
          "Despite relative success in the fifth most populous country in the world, COVID-19 has been a formidable challenge.",
          "Dr Mahipala realizes how fortunate Pakistan has been so far and recognizes the dedication of the people who have helped tackle COVID-19.",
          "“There are people who are totally steadfast devoted, who haven’t been home since January.”",
          "But the work goes on, he says.",
          "“We change our strategy as the pandemic evolves. We change our plans as cases rise and fall.”",

          "Rapid antigen tests are typically used outside of laboratories at the point of care. The turnaround time for these tests is short, 10-30 minutes, and therefore they are useful for the detection of infected contacts in an outbreak setting where urgent decisions need to be made. They can be used to screen for high-risk individuals who require urgent management in locations like emergency rooms. They can also be used to monitor trends in community epidemiology, especially among healthcare workers or other exposed cohorts.",
          "In the current context, Sri Lanka plans to use this as a fast and efficient contact tracing test to manage the current cluster and for screening high-risk groups beyond the cluster. The use of rapid antigen tests is in line with WHO technical guidance and will allow the country to detect individuals with COVID-19 early and take the necessary steps to reduce transmission. A testing strategy that includes the use of rapid antigen tests to complement the current capacity for PCR testing will lead to the more efficient management of the current cluster and beyond.",
          "WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19.

However, by February, the country had already started to strengthen its surveillance system and national network of laboratories. It also doubled its capacity to provide health services,\r\n    getting more equipment into hospitals and enough qualified health personnel to meet the population’s needs. Without the participation of the general public in terms of hygiene and self-protection, it would be impossible to stop the spread of\r\n    COVID-19, leading Colombia to quickly call on its citizens to take action.",
          "Building stronger health systems with the people",
          "It was clear that the best way to reach the Wayúu people was through primary health care services, located close to home, that connect and appeal to their own culture. The department and the local health authorities agreed to promote primary health\r\n    care adapted to the characteristics of the territory and the current situation, and with the effective participation of the community. Along with better infrastructure, equipment and medicines, there is a call for trained health personnel with deep\r\n    personal knowledge of the local Wayuunaiki language and cultural practices.",

According to an NHS Digital report, around half of the approximately 11.5 million people in the UK that lack digital skills are aged over 65 years.

When asked about their preference for receiving such information, 92% said they preferred paper-based information sent to the home; of those who had access to the internet, 83% still preferred to receive paper-based information. Over 66 000 copies were distributed in May 2020 in the Greater Manchester area, whilst a national version of the booklet was also produced. A further 9 local areas in the UK and Northern Ireland have created localised versions. In total,118 000 copies of Keeping Well at Home have been printed to date, with digital adaptations of the booklets produced internationally, including in Australia and Canada. Digital copies were made available of the Greater Manchester version and national versions, for easy download and print.

There was a real advantage in amplifying the voices of older people within communications aimed at this age group, and it was found that short quotes from older people made the booklet seem less formal or official, and easier for readers to engage with. The evaluation also highlighted the benefit of bringing together key information on different topics in one place for older people. Feedback showed that readers would have liked additional content on fraud and scams, home hazards and finance.",

          "During the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory testing capacity is crucial. Since the beginning of the outbreak in the Philippines, the WHO country office, with support from a grant from European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) has worked closely with both the Department of Health (DOH) and local governments to ensure establishment and accreditation of testing laboratories across the regions. ECHO has has provided valuable funding to WHO to carry out inspection and assessment of laboratory capacities to test COVID-19 samples. In May 2020, there were 23 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) laboratories in major regions. By 19 October, there were already 112 laboratories operating in all regions that were able to test samples. Thirty-five licensed cartridge-based PCR or GeneXpert laboratories are now operating in all regions except Western and Eastern Visayas. With the increase in licensed labs, WHO and DOH worked to provide competency and proficiency training. The WHO team specifically responded to the need for lab proficiency in COVID-19 diagnostics in Zamboanga City in Mindanao, where a large cluster of infections were recorded between June and July. WHO also provided the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) and five other subnational laboratories with reagents, test kits, extraction kits and other consumables. With a new surge in cases in the South, WHO has continued to provide support on many levels. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19.

But beyond that, Entraide Nantes has continued to flourish in the intervening six months - as a virtual “platform” on the Municipal website and Facebook, promoting a much wide array of providing social, health and economic activities to promote health and well-being for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic – and beyond."

First, the city put together a core group of volunteers and created a central municipal registry for the swelling number of city residents requesting basic food aid support, along with a Facebook group, Nantes Entraide .  Distribution points for food aid were then organized across the city. For people who could not get out on their own, home-based distribution was also organized in collaboration with the Red Cross.",
          "At each food distribution site, a city “Information Point” was also created, where people coming to receive the emergency food aid could be referred to the available municipal health, welfare and social services, for further support going forward.  Numerous local organizations participated in the effort alongside municipal workers providing various sorts of organizational and logistics support, including the local chapter of the Red Cross, local food aid, social welfare Associations,  Rosa Parks high school, and residences for adults with disabilities. All in all, it is estimated that while the actual food aid cost only about 30,000 Euros, City in-kind investments in the two-month project totalled around 500,000 Euros."

          "COVID-19 has been a severe test to Mongolia's emergency preparedness system. On 10 March 2020, the country was shaken by the news of its first confirmed case of COVID-19. Yet long before the first case was announced, the government and the public had\r\n    readied itself for such a scenario. Starting on 6 January 2020, a multi-sectoral incident management team with more than 70 officials from 21 agencies covering health, transportation, border control, law enforcement, state administration, emergency management, communications, information\r\n    and more worked in unison to contain the potential spread of the disease. The foundations of the shared strategy were solidarity, early preventive measures, multi-sectoral partnership and a culture of continuous improvement, supported by WHO. Ten months later, Mongolia has recorded no deaths from the virus, 346 imported cases and no local transmission. Mongolia’s approach has been based on lessons from outbreaks of SARS in 2003, H1N1 in 2009 and seasonal influenza, using WHO’s Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies (APSED) to prepare for the next pandemic.\r\n    It focused on extensive testing and contact tracing, a well-prepared health system and a high level of community awareness of measures to protect and promote health. Determined to make every effort to keep COVID-19 out, in early May 2020, Mongolia organized a large-scale national simulation exercise to test its response preparedness. The simulation exercise identified major gaps in the system and reinforced the need\r\n    for continuous improvement. Aware that the global pandemic is not yet over, Mongolia, with support from WHO, is doing its best to prepare for a better future with everyone acting in solidarity. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response .

          "During the COVID-19 pandemic, smokeless tobacco has become an even greater public health concern than usual. Chewing tobacco products such as gutka, khaini, zarda, paan and paan masala, induce salivation and trigger the urge to spit. The act of spitting can facilitate the spread of infectious diseases, potentially including COVID-19. Another risk associated with smokeless tobacco, is the contact of fingers with the lips or nose during use, which may increase the possibility of virus transmission.",
          "The decision was made not only to reduce the spread of COVID-19 but also to improve the health of the population through reduced use of tobacco products.",
          "Like many countries, India’s urban centres have faced the largest COVID-19 outbreaks across the country. In May, five cities: Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Thane, made up almost 50% of the national total case count.",
          "On 15 March, before the first reported case in Gujarat and well before the existence of the national directive on smokeless tobacco to contain COVID-19 issued under the Disaster Management Act, Gujarat Chief Secretary Anil Mukim introduced a ban on spitting on roads and in public places. The action was punishable by fine of 500 rupees and once the new order was implemented by the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (AMC), it resulted in 1244 persons fined on the very first day of enforcement. The AMC built on this measure by increasing the fine to 1000 rupees from 23 March, and issuing police FIRs (first information reports) to those who refused or failed to pay the fine.",
          "“With over 200 million smokeless tobacco users in India, the pandemic presents an opportunity to further strengthen tobacco control policies and interventions to prevent avoidable diseases and deaths,” says Dr Roderico H. Ofrin, WHO Representative to India.",
          "These measures follow efforts in recent years to prioritize prevention of tobacco-related cancers and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in Ahmedabad. As one of 70 cities in the Partnership for Healthy Cities —a global network supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with WHO and Vital Strategies—the city had already conducted a population-based household survey of NCD risks prior to the onset of the pandemic. The data from the survey will allow the city to target highly prevalent preventable diseases with evidence-based programs."

          "When residents of Oakland, California were urged to contain the spread of COVID-19, overnight the city saw a new demand for space in which to be active while remaining socially distanced. Lakeside paths and public parks became overcrowded and the City of Oakland Department of Transportation (OakDOT) received calls from local advocacy groups and city officials to close streets surrounding these popular areas. In response, in April 2020 city authorities transformed 21 miles of streets into pedestrian corridors to keep residents safe.",
          "How? The City of Oakland used a community mapping exercise (recently carried out to update the city’s cycling plan) that included expanding existing neighbourhood bike routes to improve options for walking and cycling through the city. Vetted by engineers, partner agencies, city officials and with the input of 3500 local residents, the plan set out a network of 21 miles of mainly residential “slow streets” that avoided bus routes and high traffic zones, roads that intersected with public transport routes, and roads that were key routes for emergency services.",
          "The city rented cheap, small-scale signs and barriers to notify drivers that they could not enter these roads, while local maintenance workers and a self-organized community group regularly checked the streets to ensure that signs and barriers remained in place and were not damaged. The city also entered talks with Google maps to advise drivers not to take routes that had been cordoned off. Community feedback, via surveys, has been carried out to get public input and perception, and to date the majority of feedback has been positive. Whilst data on traffic impacts on adjacent streets is not available, as of August 2020 there had been no fatal or severe pedestrian or cyclist-related crashes on any of the Oakland Slow Streets. 1",
          "How might this initiative contribute towards a “better normal” of city life post pandemic? Slow Streets – an initiative that reflects the city’s commitment to promoting safe active transport and physical activity – has received an overwhelmingly positive response from locals and has prompted the City of Oakland to prioritize infrastructure that supports safe access to essential services, particularly for streets with the highest level of traffic collisions. The city also intends to focus on strengthening the Slow Streets network for marginalized and disadvantaged communities most affected by the pandemic. As movement restrictions lessen and business and social activities resume, the City of Oakland is exploring options for making a subset of the changes permanent where evaluation shows that they are meeting community needs.",
          "Local data on COVID-19 cases and deaths by race and geographic area showed that residents living in East Oakland, and communities of colour, were disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Reaching out to these communities is now a high priority for the programme in order to better understand their health and transportation needs.",
          "Quote: “This adaptation to our Slow Streets programme shows that we’re not only acting swiftly to meet urgent COVID-19 transportation and health needs of our highest risk communities, but we’re also listening and adjusting. We’re not afraid to try new things and learn from both the positive feedback and the critiques.” Oakland’s Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland.",

          "In Samoa, memory of the tragic measles outbreak in late 2019 has galvanized communities’ commitment to keep themselves safe from COVID-19, using traditional resources and a holistic approach. In early 2020, health authorities in Samoa became aware that if the coronavirus arrived, health facilities and health workers could be overwhelmed. High rates of non-communicable diseases including cancer, diabetes and heart disease means that many people would be extremely vulnerable to the virus. It is a similar situation for several other Pacific countries and areas which, as of October 2020, had not had a single COVID-19 case: American Samoa, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Pitcairn Islands, Tokelau and Tuvalu. Seeing that Samoa, a country of 195,000, needed to pull together as one, the Ministry of Health (MoH), the Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development. Supported by WHO, through the Delivering as One UN initiative, it developed a community engagement strategy to boost health beyond the pandemic. Other partners included the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, disability advocacy organization Nuanua O Le Alofa, suicide prevention organization Fa’ataua le Ola, the Samoa Red Cross Society, and the Adventist Development and Relief Agency International (ADRA). WHO supported the multi-sectoral approach to implement the strategy, trained health workers and engaged with matai (customary village leaders), district nurses already engaging with communities, and grass roots committees. Educational toolkits based on WHO messages on COVID-19 were adapted to the Samoan context and translated. They reinforced the practical steps everyone should take to keep safe, such as washing hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and physical distancing, and delivered hygiene kits. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response .

          "But this year from March to July the way of life has drastically changed in Uganda with COVID-19 restrictions including a nationwide shutdown to slow the spread of infection, prohibition of private car use and public transportation, curfews, store closures and the banning of gatherings. With these measures, Kampala’s ‘rush hour’ streets became deserted and its markets went quiet.",
          "The effects of national shutdown are felt more deeply by disadvantaged groups. The vast majority of residents in Kampala make their living through informal employment which often means they rely on daily trade to feed themselves and their families.",
          "Now, taking a data-based and equity-oriented approach to the COVID-19 response, city authorities have been assessing the susceptibility of local communities to the impact of the virus. They have been collecting data on how COVID-19 impacts equity to guide decision-making and use of limited resources.",
          "In Greater Kampala, over 87% of total employment is informal, according to the Uganda Bureau of Labour Statistics. During the pandemic, informal workers have experienced a high risk of loss of income and livelihood, as well as COVID-19 infection due to trading with close person-to-person contact. Moreover, 50% of residents in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area live in slums, comprising only 16% of total land, presenting additional challenges to health protection measures such as physical distancing and stay-at-home orders.",
          "Kampala's COVID-19 Vulnerability Framework measures exposure in transport hubs, shopping centres, population density, and transactional offices.  It also takes into consideration adaptive capacity, meaning the resources available to the community and to the households in the community. This includes food security, level of income and access to healthcare. And finally, it measures susceptibility, determined by population age and pre-existing medical conditions.",
          "These data points generate the COVID-19 Vulnerability Index, an interactive map displaying COVID-19 vulnerability by parish.",
          "In parallel, as a member of the Partnership for Healthy Cities —a global initiative of WHO, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and Vital Strategies— Kampala received support to implement a surveillance system to track COVID-19 incidence across its population. The system leverages contact tracing data to forecast the likelihood of new cases and clusters similar data trends for further analysis. This real-time data helps city authorities gear limited resources to communities that will be most impacted by COVID-19.",
          "“In the face of rapidly changing conditions, data and scientific evidence are the backbone of the public health response during the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Dr Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, WHO Representative in Uganda. “There is an urgent need for both local and national authorities to collect data on the acceptability, impact and effectiveness of public health and social measures for COVID-19, and particularly how key measures are affecting subpopulations living in vulnerable circumstances.”",
          "Data gathered will not only help even out inequalities but also help to inform preparedness for reducing the impacts of future health emergencies."

At the height of the restrictions, Limerick’s Community Call was dealing with almost 1000 calls a week from older and vulnerable citizens.",
          "Limerick City and County Library partnered with local mental health and community health care services to provide books and other materials to patients in acute units at hospitals, and to care facilities for vulnerable people to support positive mental health during isolation. The Limerick Age Friendly Programme also linked with a local tutor from Age Action (a national charity) to provide training to older people. Age Action has a suite of resources to support older people to go online. These ‘How to’ guides cover everything from video conferencing to emailing and using the internet. The Age Friendly Programme Manager contacted each member of the Older People’s Council Executive Committee to offer them the remote one-to-one tutoring from Age Action.",

Certain streets were closed to vehicular traffic at certain times during the week to encourage active transport, and traffic was reduced on other routes on a pilot basis. “Parklets” (small, urban parks) were built while a new cycle lane on Shannon Bridge was introduced to encourage more sustainable modes of transport."

It involved more than 180 employees as well as volunteers.  The initiative covered the municipal area of Milan, with its 9 districts being served by 3 logistics hubs and 10 temporary food hub distribution sites. Weekly food aid packages were distributed through the 10 sites until the end of the Covid-19 emergency.",
          "As the Covid-19 crisis unfolded an increasing number of Milan’s citizens, particularly the poor, people with limited mobility, and older people, started experiencing a significant worsening of their access to good-quality food. Containment measures, indeed, together with closures of several associations and charities, triggered a systematic, city-wide intervention. The Food Aid System – Dispositivo di Aiuto Alimentare initiative was promoted and coordinated by the Municipality of Milan in collaboration with many public, private and charity partners.",
          "Those included: public -owned companies such as Milano Ristorazione, AMAT, and SoGeMi; the Protezione Civile of Milan; the Milan Red Cross; as well as non-profit organizations, food banks and charities – Banco Alimentare della Lombardia, Caritas Ambrosiana, IBVA, QuBi Program and Cariplo Foundation. The private sector contributed through both monetary and in-kind donations, and the public promptly responded to a dedicated fundraising campaign."

A University of Lethbridge funded organization, Lethbridge Public Interest Research Group (LPIRG), helped create a Facebook COVID-19 Support page where 3,000 community members offered each other help with things such as picking up medications, offering rides, lending each other house supplies, etc. This support page also included daily updates with information and support from the COVID-19 leadership group, as well as other key information from local, provincial, and federal government initiatives (e.g., about the Canada Emergency Response Benefit).",
          "Other programmes created included volunteer wellness checks and the delivery of food bank hampers to older people. Restaurant suppliers and local hotels had a surplus of pre-ordered food that they gave to the food bank.  The food banks coordinated food distribution to any social service agency that required food. Local food programmes delivered 15–25% more meals to community residents than before the pandemic. The school system worked with family organizations to provide activity packs and resources for families as well as meal and grocery deliveries where necessary. Several organizations worked together to help homeless people and our low-income population through food deliveries and setting up a clothing and furniture bank. And because there was limited mobility for people with disabilities during the pandemic, all of the services listed above were provided in partnership with disability services. It is expected that health outcomes have improved significantly due to all these organizations working together so closely."

The global need to respond quickly to the mobility challenges associated with COVID-19 has seen governments around the world similarly take advantage of the flexibility of Ciclovía-type initiatives, and their potential to enhance the function of city streets as public spaces. As of July 2020, at least 92 cities in 20 countries on 3 continents had expanded sidewalks and bike lanes by making them wider, longer, and better connected; had implemented new everyday Ciclovía programmes; or had expanded their current programmes as part of strategies to support physical distancing and traffic safety.

The “Let’s beat COVID-19 together” campaign ran for six weeks on TV, radio and on Facebook. The mass media campaign came together in a very short period of time, when the urgency of the COVID-19 crisis in Myanmar had become clear and Yangon was put under strict stay-at-home orders and a curfew.",
          "“What we have seen in other countries is that the number of cases can grow very fast,” said the Union Minister for Health and Sports, Dr U Myint Htwe. “If we change our behaviour, we can slow the growth of COVID-19 cases down and limit the number of deaths in Myanmar. Therefore, it is important that people know what to do to keep themselves and others safe. The mass media campaign is meant to spread this information widely.”",
          "The campaign, supported by the Partnership for Healthy Cities , aims to provide timely guidance, create positive behaviour change and promote solidarity during the pandemic.",

          "Taking note of the high social media usage and accessibility in the country, a #LetsBeatCovidTogether Facebook page was created. It was an integral part of the media campaign, posting interactive, informative pictures and short videos about symptoms and protective measures. It also featured videos of the steps the government was taking to control the disease.",
          "In addition, a public service announcement (PSA) was designed for television that included information on social distancing and other protective measures such as wearing a mask when going out and frequently washing your hands. This message was broadcast regularly.",
          "Advertisements with informative infographics in local newspapers were published to cater to people who did not have access to television or the internet. Care was also taken to make the campaign inclusive and accessible to those with low or no literacy skills and those who do not speak Burmese as their first language.",
          "Following the launch of the national mass media campaign in April, the dedicated Facebook page has garnered over 90,000 followers, 160,000 post interactions and an online reach of 3.5 million. Two radio stations have aired four public service announcements on protective behaviour on high-rotation. The television message was regularly aired on the MRTV state channel. Three national newspapers have each printed six campaign infographics for months alongside approved text on how to stay safe.",
          "Communication during the COVID-19 pandemic is complex due to the breadth of stakeholders with diverse needs and the rapidly changing landscape of the outbreak. Adding to this challenge is the concurrent “infodemic” - an overabundance of information, some of which can be misleading or harmful. To tackle the spread of misinformation, public health and government agencies must consistently track falsehoods and counter them with evidence-based guidance.",
          "Myanmar’s People’s Health Foundation continues to examine how it can tackle the COVID-19 infodemic by engaging with print and online media outlets, acknowledging their role in educating and informing the general public and influence in behaviour. External agencies have been provided with the text of official health messages, as well as a bank of government-approved infographics. There has also been a deliberate call to media agencies to use approved language.",
          "“Evidence has shown a large majority of COVID-19 cases occur in urban and peri-urban areas which are densely populated. The campaign is great example of using media effectively to advance health literacy, crucial in this pandemic and beyond,” says Dr Stephan Paul Jost, WHO Representative to Myanmar. “It is so important to tackle false information and empower society to take protective measures, now and in the time ahead.”"

          "The WHO Regional Office for the Americas (WHO/PAHO), in partnership with the United Kingdom Government, and the United Nations Multi-Partner Trust Fund, has delivered over 80 000 antigen rapid diagnostic COVID-19 tests to the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MOHW). The delivery was part of a large COVID-19 response package worth over US$ 1 million that included nine oxygen concentrators and over 350 000 pieces of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) consisting of N95 respirators, along with face shields and medical masks.",
          "New antigen rapid tests will slash COVID-19 results processing time down from days to just 30 minutes. After appropriate training, private labs and regional health centres will also be able to perform tests at the point of care, which will decentralise testing, reduce the burden on national laboratories and increase Jamaica’s testing capacity.",
          "WHO and UNAIDS delivered also recently PPE to enable key community organisations to continue to provide essential support and services to some of Jamaica’s most vulnerable populations while protecting staff against COVID-19.",
          "Supplies included face shields, surgical masks, hand sanitisers, liquid soap and infrared thermometers were distributed to seven community organisations that address the needs of disadvantaged children and adolescents, people living with HIV, the transgender community and those requiring legal assistance. Relief packages were calculated to support each organisation and its staff for the next six months.",

          "This year, Africa was declared free of wild poliovirus , a testimony to the outstanding work of thousands of health workers and their supporters over many decades.",
          "Despite this, 2020 may be the toughest year polio eradicators have ever faced. In the last eight months, immunization services have taken a devastating hit. An estimated 80 million children under one may have missed critical vaccines. Vaccine-preventable diseases – including polio – have spread in the most vulnerable contexts. This year, new outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio have been detected in the Eastern Mediterranean and African regions, including in Yemen, Sudan and South Sudan.",
          "WHO is working closely with national Governments to urgently respond to outbreaks and repair immunization systems affected in the early months of the pandemic. In the context of a significant budget shortfall and increased costs of delivering health interventions due to the pandemic, outbreak response for both polio and measles will require additional funding and urgent action.",

          "In September, he took part in the first immunization campaign to resume in Somalia since COVID-19 arrived in the country. All children who took part in the campaign were offered deworming tablets and vitamin A in addition to measles and polio vaccines. Delivering multiple services is crucial in the context of ongoing polio and measles outbreaks in Somalia, and low overall population immunity.",

          "Concerned about the risk of crowded public transport during the COVID-19 outbreak, the capital of Peru is strengthening its cycling infrastructure with almost 50 km of emergency cycle lanes and additional parking.",
          "“This is an initiative that we needed not only as a preventive measure for COVID-19, but also to help our citizens choose a healthier and more eco-friendly alternative,” said Lima Mayor Jorge Muñoz . “It also goes hand in hand with our Yo Respeto (I Respect) campaign which promotes road safety.”",
          "Lima is better known for its back-to-back traffic and packed micros and combis (buses and vans) alongside its ceviche, but it may soon be known for its cyclist culture as well. On 4 May, work commenced on 46 km of emergency cycle lanes and additional cycle parking. When deciding on which roads to temporarily reconfigure, Lima prioritized routes which would connect with their existing 227 km cycle network and facilitate access to public services such as hospitals. Across the city, twelve locations were selected to benefit from parking infrastructure, each with the capacity for 20 bicycles. By August, over 13 km of new cycle lanes were open for Lima residents.",
          "“While Improving walking and cycling networks has been a key WHO recommendation for general health pre-COVID-19, it is great to see its added value during the pandemic,” said Rubén Mayorga, acting PAHO/WHO Representative in Peru.",
          "Road safety was also given top priority as the city opted to protect two-way bike lanes with vertical bollards, rubber humps, painted markings, separating the cycle lanes from the roadway, and dedicated traffic lights.",
          "The city is already making moves towards long-term change beyond the emergency. In June, the national Ministry of Transport and Communication of Peru accelerated the approval of national legislation which promotes and regulates the use of the bicycle as a sustainable mode of transport. In Lima, the city authorities are evaluating the success of their measures and planning to make their emergency cycle infrastructure a permanent feature. Their experience has shown that with the right political will and policy landscape, mobility habits can be shifted to deliver long-term benefits in both population and environmental health.",
          "Lima’s COVID-19 response has also included a three-prong project with the Partnership for Healthy Cities , a global initiative funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, in collaboration with the WHO and Vital Strategies.",
          "“COVID-19 containment measures are not always about restrictions, it can also about introducing new facilities and creating more freedom for citizens, as Lima proves,” said Mayorga."

          "Leveraging lessons from their experiences during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, the capital city of Sierra Leone, Freetown, has been providing its most vulnerable residents with food packages so they can stay safe and healthy in quarantine.",
          "“Food insecurity is a risk to COVID-19 containment because people can’t stay home if they have nothing to eat. On top of that, the pandemic has made access to high-quality nutrition even more difficult than usual,” says Mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr. “That’s why the Freetown City Council has been working with partners to bring healthy, nutritious food to its citizens during the pandemic.”",
          "Around 30% of Freetown’s 1.2 million residents have an available family income of less than 1 USD per day and 47% do not have direct access to running water. In Sierra Leone, the sheer scale of the food insecurity challenge was highlighted in a national survey carried out in April, where only 12% of respondents answered they could gather food for one week or more, while 60% said they could not sustain ‘lockdown’ or movement restrictions for more than three days at a time.",
          "In April during a national three-day order to stay at home, the city government provided emergency food packages to 6000 households in three informal settlements. These donations supplemented national government provisions, whilst also helping and encouraging residents to follow quarantine measures.",
          "Through an urban farming initiative, the city is also supporting sustainable access to nutritious food while building resilience to future crises. During the ongoing pandemic, communities in informal settlements will be supported to grow their own vegetables, beginning with training individuals and youth groups on planting, watering and composting. Work is underway to make water available outside of rainy season.",
          "As a member of the Partnership for Healthy Cities – a global initiative by Bloomberg Philanthropies, the World Health Organization and Vital Strategies – Freetown has also shared early experiences and lessons learned during the pandemic response with other cities in the region and globally.",
          "Sierra Leone is already one of 25 countries identified as at risk of significant food security deterioration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP).",
          "The number of people facing acute food insecurity in these countries is predicted to almost double to 270 million before the end of 2020 without an acceleration of protection programmes.",
          "Food security is worsening during COVID-19 as a result of household purchasing power declining from loss of income and remittance, and disruptions to food production and supply chains. There is also concern that overwhelmed governments, increased political instability and aggravated conflict dynamics caused by the pandemic will exacerbate the situation further.",
          "“Cities like Freetown, facing the dual crisis of acute food insecurity and the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside the prospect of further deterioration of food insecurity, must preserve and strengthen existing nutrition programmes,” says Dr. Steven V. Shongwe, Acting WHO Representative in Sierra Leone.",
          "“Freetown is a good example of local government considering new social protection measures to protect vulnerable populations who are at increased risk of economic hardship due to the pandemic, which may negatively impact access to healthy food at a time when it is most needed.”"

          "In the early phase of the pandemic, many African countries lacked adequate COVID-19 testing capacity. In recent months however, governments across the continent have ramped up diagnosis, which is crucial to understand the scale of COVID-19 infections and guide public health measures against the virus.",
          "Benin is one country that has boosted its COVID-19 response with increased testing. Starting with a single test lab in the capital during the beginning of the pandemic, it now has 13 laboratories capable of testing for COVID-19, covering all of its 12 departments.",
          "A range of strategies have boosted Benin’s COVID-19 response. Triage and testing centres have been set up across the country’s 77 communes as well as in health facilities, airport and land border crossings. Mobile testing teams also carry out diagnosis in government and private company offices, while a hotline provides access to COVID-19 information and assistance.",
          "WHO has supported the government throughout its efforts to step up testing in the country thanks to a US$ 30-million grant from the World Bank and other partners. In addition, WHO and its partner organizations have supplied reagents, sample collection and testing kits as well as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to boost the COVID-19 response.",
          "In Gabon , with over 60 sample collection sites and a network of laboratories, the country has tested nearly a tenth of its 2 million people for COVID-19. The government has been steadily expanding diagnosis through mass testing and decentralization. The country has added laboratories (15 across the country) and sample collection centres across the country and set up a high-capacity laboratory in Libreville capable of carrying out up to 10 000 tests a day.",
          "Since July, Gabon has been conducting more than 2 000 tests daily compared with around 200 tests per week earlier in the year.",
          "With the support of WHO and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 50 lab experts were trained on COVID-19 testing and biosafety. They later trained more than 80 technicians working in COVID-19 testing centres.",
          "In Senegal , at the onset of the pandemic the country’s Institut Pasteur was one of only two laboratories in Africa able to test for COVID-19. A three-pronged strategy has shaped the country’s approach to increasing COVID-19 testing to tackle the disease. Senegal has focused on delivering test results within 24 hours once samples are received by the laboratory and created a digital platform through which health workers and travellers can receive test results. In addition, Senegal has decentralized its COVID-19 response to its districts, cutting down substantially on test transportation delays.",
          "WHO, the Islamic Development Bank, and the government have worked together to make this possible.",
          "In Zambia , The Government of the Republic of Korea in partnership with WHO donated COVID-19 test kits valued at US$ 200 000 to strengthen the government’s national pandemic response.",
          "The roll-out of new WHO approved antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests for the novel coronavirus in Africa will significantly boost testing capacity and marks a game changer in the continent’s fight against COVID-19.",
          "WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response .",

          "At a time when essential health services across the world were disrupted due to the COVID-19 outbreak, health authorities of the Pakkred Hospital in the Nonthaburi Province of Thailand prioritized protecting the vulnerable population, while maintaining essential health services for patients with chronic conditions. Health authorities in the Pakkred District used technology to establish communication lines between hospitals, health centres and health workers for better coordination and to reach out to the larger community. A fast-track one-stop service was set up for vulnerable groups. This helped reduce the time spent by the patient at the hospital from 2-3 hours to under one hour. Home care visits, teleconsultations and drive-through medicine pick-ups for NCD patients are two of the new patient-centred practices adopted by the hospital. Health care workers at Pakkred Hospital say they want to continue these good practices even after the pandemic, particularly multiple channels of communications with patients.",

Drawing on their experiences in the country’s polio eradication work, more than 300 polio team members are now helping to strengthen disease surveillance in communities and health facilities as well as contact tracing and data management.",
          "South Sudan’s polio experts have honed their skills since 2014 when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared polio a public health emergency of international concern in several African countries. The critical work of the polio response in South Sudan and across the continent led to Africa being declared free of wild polio in August of this year.",
          "This success came after overcoming many challenges including the displacement of populations, difficult terrain, and accessibility to communities, with air transport the main mode of movement in some areas, which thus increases the operational cost of campaigns and surveillance. While South Sudan faces the same challenges in its battle against COVID-19, they are more easily navigated with strategies already developed to fight polio. For example, mobile phone applications originally developed for health workers to use during the polio outbreak response were adapted to help the polio responders trace COVID-19 contacts.",
          "Polio specialists are also keenly aware of the need to juggle attention to all priority diseases despite the public’s focus on the pandemic. Thanks to the network of responders from partner organizations and WHO, there have been only 55 deaths reported and 2 817 cases in 24 South Sudan counties to date.",

With support from World Health Organization, village health teams across Kampala and neighbouring Wakiso district have received specialized training in surveillance and community outreach to better convey safety messages. In the capital Kampala, there are more than 4000 volunteers in the various health teams. Their job is to communicate to people in their neighbourhoods about any outbreaks, how to avoid them, what signs and symptoms to look out for, and what to do if they fall ill or see people with symptoms. Community involvement is crucial to the success of preventive measures such as handwashing, wearing masks and physical distancing. To gain the trust of villagers it is important to have a village local come to distribute free cloth masks, answer questions and demonstrate correct hand hygiene. The use of village health teams to communicate information within villages will also be useful in responding to other outbreaks.",

Since the start of the pandemic in Afghanistan, WHO has supported the Ministry of Public Health by establishing laboratories, training technical staff, and providing essential equipment and supplies to expand testing across the country. WHO’s support has been focused on nine pillars, guided by the COVID-19 ONE UN Health Response Plan.

The COVID-19 national laboratory network can be further strengthened by assessing laboratory capacities using WHO’s COVID-19 Laboratory Assessment Tool. With the return of more than 550 000 Afghans from the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan, greater effort needs to be placed on increasing cross-border collaboration between Afghanistan’s neighbouring countries to manage COVID-19.

They value the job even though it puts their own health at risk and often conflicts with gender expectations.",

Nearly 186 000 community and religious influencers have been trained to deliver outreach messages, and almost 7000 coordination meetings have been held.",

These medical students have specifically helped doctors by following up with people placed in quarantine.",

WHO provided technical support to health investigation training and equipped young recruits with gloves, masks, non-contact infrared forehead thermometers and contact tracking sheets.",
          "Although the fear and stigma attached to COVID-19 means patients sometimes do not cooperate with follow-up teams, the follow-up strategy has been successful. After a peak in the number of confirmed cases in early May, Chad succeeded in significantly reducing the number of documented cases, while maintaining restrictive measures at the borders and opening up public places.",

          "Years of conflict and natural disasters has made South Sudan’s COVID-19 battle particularly challenging as it’s rushed to protect thousands of displaced persons from COVID-19 within the sites set up over the past decade as refuge. Of the 1.7 million displaced persons in the country, nearly 168 000 currently live in one of the 116 camps or settlements, where conditions meant physical distancing is virtually impossible. Basic services in camps can sometimes be limited, with water, sanitation and hygiene services as well as food and shelter supply outstripped by the needs of camp residents. COVID-19 posed an enormous threat to vulnerable populations in overcrowded camps and settlements where people have inadequate access to social services.",
          "WHO, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and other partners, coordinated activities to build trust, introduce transmission-prevention measures, maintain continuity of health services and supplies and establish separate dedicated COVID-19 treatment and isolation centres. It also supported the training of nearly 400 health care workers in the camps and settlements on caring for COVID-19 patients and how to prevent and control the spread of the virus.",
          "Any resident of a camp or a settlement for the displaced confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 and in need of isolation or treatment in a dedicated facility is referred to government-run facilities. Given their limited capacity, additional isolation facilities were established for every camp and settlement hosting more than 5000 individuals. The United Nations is supporting 14 isolation centres for displacement camps and settlements. WHO-trained medical experts provided health education and psychological support to displaced persons to diminish the stigma and fear of COVID-19. The prevention and control measures taken appear to have helped. As of 30 September, only 59 cases among displaced persons had been confirmed from the camps and settlements.",

To strengthen prevention, free screening and therapeutic management of patients with diabetes or diseases related to high blood pressure in the context of COVID-19, WHO has provided more than 13 000 vials of insulin, 339 oxygen concentrators and other equipment including electronic blood pressure monitors and electrocardiographs to the Ministry of Health.",

In Uganda, like most African countries, mental healthcare was already weak before the epidemic, and mental health services suffered. Experts from the WHO Regional office for Africa observe that little if any budget is allocated in many African countries to implement plans for mental health and psychosocial support as part of their COVID-19 response plans.",

Many children have not been able to keep up with their schoolwork. Adequate access to the internet, electricity and electronic devices remain a challenge and alternative off-line options, including paper based, continue to be relevant.",

It is accompanied by a music video that illustrates the guidelines of the safe reopening of schools. It also highlights the blended approach to learning that combines children engaging face to face learning in school with remote learning at home.",

          "The head of the Cuban Centre of Molecular Immunology pointed out that as long as there is no efficient vaccine, strategies must continue to be directed at avoiding infection and slowing the progression towards serious or critical forms of the disease. The EU’s representative to Cuba shared recent information about ongoing studies globally on the prevalence of COVID-19. Senior Cuban researchers commend the project as it would not only help to understand the epidemic, but could also be very useful for strategies of immunization.",
          "An 18-month UN-funded initiative focuses on improving the capabilities of medical devices in intensive care units, guaranteeing the availability of personal protective equipment for health workers and enhancing diagnostic capacity. Partners agreed to strengthen ties between Cuban and EU member states academic institutions.",
          "One EU member state – Sweden, through its embassy in Cuba, works with PAHO/WHO to support the Immunoassay Center (CIE) for developing COVID-19 diagnostic technologies. The first contribution will allow the acquisition of supplies needed for the production of COVID-19 diagnostics based on SUMA technology. In order to better understand how this collaboration could help the island’s response to the pandemic, the Ambassador of Sweden, Mr Tomas Wiklund, and the Representative of PAHO/WHO, Dr José Moya, established close contacts with CIE specialists. They discuss the strategies, products, and impact of this important national institution, as well assess the possibility of future collaboration initiatives. SUMA, which began in Cuba in the 1980s, is especially useful in prenatal and neonatal screening; epidemiological surveillance; prevention of vertical transmission of HIV and Hepatitis C; prostate cancer screening and blood certification, among other functions. The technology package, which will now enable detecting COVID-19, includes equipment, diagnostic kits and specialized technical assistance services.",
          "WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response .",

          "Ghana has not been spared in the COVID-19 crisis, but the country started its preparedness activities early. As part of its surveillance response activities with support from WHO and Norway, Ghana has now put in place an expanded contact tracing system to identify contacts of confirmed cases of COVID-19. WHO has supported contact tracing in Ghana, especially in Greater Accra, the region with the highest number of cases, with funding from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH). So far, WHO has provided technical and financial support to boost contact tracing activities as well as to strengthen contact tracing field teams and data management. As part of WHO’s assistance, contract tracers received training and logistical support. Staff were also trained on data collection related to outbreak response management and analysis. As a result, the number of new cases identified has increased by 64% through tracing and collecting samples from over 18 000 contacts in one month. Support from the WHO, along with the dedication of health staff, led to the identification of numerous cases which would not have been otherwise detected and the slowed the further spread of the disease. The improved data collection also allows authorities to make evidence-based decisions on containment measures. WHO’s support to the greater Accra Region was made possible through the Global Health Preparedness Programme (GHPP) of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) with funding from the Government of Norway. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response ."

The WHO India team worked closely with the New Delhi government to support its efforts to train the health workers to continue their valuable role in patient care. More than 230 health workers and paramilitary forces were trained in two batches of training of trainers (ToT) that covered topics such as epidemiology of COVID-19, infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols, donning and doffing of personal protective equipment, bio-medical waste management, triage, mock drills, medical management of cases, data collection, and more. The WHO Country office team also extended support to the Care Centre in the operational planning, facility assessment, and providing recommendations for further improvement in service provision and delivery of care. Information materials on handwashing, hand rub, and wearing masks were developed and shared to reinforce key safety messages. Fourteen contactless foot-operated handwashing stations were installed at the facility for doctors and nurses.

With the Emergency Situations Coordination and Urgent Assistance Centre, WHO facilitated the training of ambulance doctors, nurses and emergency vehicle drivers on standard operating procedures for preventing and controlling infection during the transportation of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. The initiative was carried out as part of the Solidarity for Health program implemented by WHO and funded by the European Union (EU). The newly-trained health workers will also share knowledge with their colleagues – over 7 000 medical specialists, village doctors, ambulance teams and resuscitators. Earlier on in the crisis when information was lacking, the virus spread quickly in Georgia among medical staff. With better-trained personnel, WHO and partners are ensuring that the health system is well prepared for a resurgence of cases. The first phase of the joint WHO–EU Solidarity for Health initiative focused on the COVID-19 response. It included the delivery of more than 1.5 million items of personal protective equipment for frontline health and laboratory workers, a study to gain insights into COVID-19-related behaviours among the general population, and support to strengthen national capacities for enhanced surveillance and infection prevention and control. This assistance is part of a wider package of EU support for Georgia of over 400 million euros (almost 1.5 billion Georgian lari).

A few hours after the incident, a team from the WHO Country Office in Greece arrived on the island and started working at the forefront of the response, joining efforts with government and other health actors. On 11 September, the WHO team on the ground was joined by an expert from WHO/EURO. Together they began supporting the establishment of a central medical area. WHO then created a coordination cell to help with critical public health response activities. A total of 22 team members, including medical doctors, nurses and paramedics with different specializations worked with local authorities and health professionals to carry out triage, testing, isolation and treating COVID-19 patients as well as providing medical support to other people in need.",
          "WHO’s work to make this happen ranged from customs clearance for shipments of medical supplies and equipment, organization of their transportation and storage, coordination of initial briefings on security and public health, and provision of Farsi and Arabic interpreters.",
          "WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response ."

Armed with medical knowledge, he immediately self-isolated from his wife\r\n    and other family members. As his symptoms worsened, he called an ambulance, and eventually tested positive for COVID-19 while in hospital.",
          "“While I was in hospital, testing and examinations were free of charge, but I had to find and buy my own medicines. I am very grateful to the anesthesiologists of Khmelnytskyi region and other colleagues who helped me find and buy medicines while\r\n    my family members were in fourteen-day isolation. Since then, the availability of medicines in hospitals has improved and medicines are now provided to patients free of charge,” said Andrii.",

It demonstrates the Government’s commitment to universal\r\n    health coverage (UHC), ensuring that no one is left behind and everyone can access the health care they need without experiencing financial hardship.",
          "This commitment to UHC has been evident since 2015 when the Government initiated the reform of its health system to improve the population’s health and ensure financial protection from out-of-pocket payments. The reform aims to increase efficiency,\r\n    modernize an obsolete service delivery system and improve access to better quality of care.",
          "WHO, through the UHC Partnership, has been walking hand-in-hand with the Government since the very first steps on this road. It provided continued and consistent technical support on health financing and service delivery with a strong focus on strengthening\r\n    primary care, working closely with national and international stakeholders throughout elections cycles and changes in the Government. The Partnership, which assists 115 countries in accelerating progress to achieve UHC, is funded by the European Union,\r\n    the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Irish Aid, the Government of Japan, the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, the UK Department for International Development and Belgium.",

          "During the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria, WHO has been supporting the government in an initiative to improve contact tracing, active case searching and testing using the existing Tuberculosis (TB) infrastructure in the country. The outbreak of COVID-19 in February 2020 and the public health response measures put in place to curtail the spread of the pandemic led to fear the virus might impact active TB case finding activities. Instead, WHO and health officials have been using the structure to effectively combine case detection for TB and COVID-19. In States like Niger, 18 WHO TB supervisors and disease surveillance and notification officers (DSNO) have been designated as super-trainers. During contact tracing, WHO has also been sensitizing surveillance teams on symptoms and detecting TB and COVID-19. From April to June 2020, 30 rural communities were visited, 3 072 households were screened with 2 235 suspected TB patients identified out of which 277 TB patients were notified through the Niger state TB & Leprosy control program, all being tested for COVID-19. WHO continues to support Nigeria at all levels to ensure that the Covid-19 response takes advantage of extensive structures and human resources available in the TB control programme to increase detection, diagnosis and management of cases at the community level. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19. A special appreciation goes to Member States and other contributors who provided flexible funds, making it possible for WHO to deliver a coherent, strategic and broad response .",

          "At the time of writing, Samoa is free of COVID-19. Preventative and precautionary measures were implemented early and continue. WHO has played a strong role in keeping COVID-19 at bay in Samoa by supporting a mass media campaign, training clinical teams on prevention, screening, testing as well as carrying out isolation, case management and intensifying mental health services. WHO's COVID-19 support to Samoa also includes an initiative with the Samoa Red Cross Society (SRCS) and the Adventists Disaster Relief Agency (ADRA) to intensify public education on COVID-19. It builds on the early COVID-19 sensitization sessions held for approximately 200 village chiefs, mayors, religious leaders and women's community group representatives from the four inhabited Samoan Islands Upolu, Savai'i, Manono and Apolima. As part of the initiative, WHO collaborated with the Ministry of Health and the SRCS to develop a COVID-19 training toolkit to deliver standardized information sessions on COVID-19. The toolkit includes a component on home-based care. In July, WHO joined the SRCS in Manono and Apolima, two of Samoa's smaller islands, where more assessments were conducted and hygiene kit care packages and water were distributed to vulnerable families. The unavailability of clean water for hand-washing, cooking and general hygiene is a barrier to preventing and managing COVID-19 infection. This and other barriers are the backbone of WHO's collaboration with SRCS and ADRA to better understand families' vulnerability to COVID-19 and to provide them with the hygiene supplies.",

          "WHO recently received a generous donation of USD 1 million from the Qatar Fund for Development to support its ongoing work in Sudan. The agreement is part of a larger, joint project that brings together the Qatari Red Crescent and Qatar Charity to support vulnerable populations in Sudan, in coordination with the Federal Ministry of Health and WHO. Sudan’s health system suffers from years of underfunding, lack of staff, human resources, medicines, materials, equipment and medical supplies. Recent flooding in Sudan has also led to an increased risk of vector- and water-borne diseases, requiring strengthened disease surveillance and coordination. COVID-19 has also created additional challenges for the health system. As part of the project, WHO will build the capacity of the health workforce to respond to emergencies. WHO will also establish and equip a reference laboratory in White Nile State for more effective diagnosis and response to disease outbreaks such as COVID-19. The project will strengthen federal coordination of emergency operation centres and emergency standard operating procedures as well strengthen the capacity of the health workforce at all levels. The project will also address the main pillars of emergency preparedness by strengthening: surveillance and lab capacity, infection prevention and control, isolation, case management capacity, and rapid response teams. WHO thanks all donors and partners who have contributed to fund the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to combat COVID-19.

          "Reports of infections, illness, attacks and deaths among frontline health workers are mounting worldwide. As the war against COVID-19 rages on, WHO is calling on governments and health care leaders to protect the health workers who protect us all – particularly in emerging COVID-19 hotspots .",
          "A new WHO Health Worker Safety Charter released on World Patient Safety Day 2020 is “dedicated to the millions of health workers fighting COVID-19 across the globe who put themselves and their families at risk to treat patients and contain the spread of this disease”.",
          "Limited resources and health worker lives on the edge",
          "Laila Collier is a hospital worker in Cape Town, South Africa who has treated many COVID-19 patients experiencing respiratory failure. At the beginning of the outbreak, she was told: “There’s no emergency in a pandemic.”",
          "This advice, often given to medical teams, was that Laila should never compromise her own safety to address a momentary crisis; the best way for her to help the most patients was to look after her own health in the long-term. “This was the mantra we all hoped to implement in our practice,” she said.",
          "But with grueling hours and limited supplies of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), health workers like Laila have been forced to make tough choices. While working a 24-hour hospital shift, Laila found herself in a “chaotic” situation where the hospital was short-staffed, and she simultaneously cared for two patients – one with COVID-19 and one without. When her COVID-19 patient’s lungs began rapidly deteriorating, Laila grabbed any PPE she could find and ran to intubate the patient. When her goggles fogged up, Leila had to remove them to properly see the patient’s airway.",
          "The procedure of intubation generates aerosols that can infect health workers. Laila successfully stabilized the patient, but not without placing herself at risk of acquiring COVID-19.",
          "“When panic sets in and you are watching someone die in front you, and you know that you can potentially reverse the problem, you will take all chances and risks, often to your own detriment,” says Laila.",
          "Health workers are bearing the brunt of the COVID-19 burden",
          "Laila’s situation is far from unique. The vulnerability of health workers has been one of the harshest lessons of the pandemic so far. Although not representative, data from many countries across all WHO regions indicate that COVID-19 infections among health workers are far greater than those in the general population. While health workers represent less than 3% of the population in the large majority of countries and less than 2% in almost all low- and middle-income countries, around 14% of COVID-19 cases reported to WHO are among health workers. In some countries health workers account for as many as 35% of all COVID-19 infections.",
          "The stress of the pandemic – exacerbated by a demanding work environment and fears for personal and family safety – has also taken a significant psychological toll. A recent review of health care professionals found one in four frontline health workers reported symptoms of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. What’s more, health workers face rising levels of discrimination, verbal harassment and physical violence in their daily lives.",
          "Patient safety depends on health worker safety",
          "Health worker safety and patient safety are inseparable, and the world's ability to successfully fight the coronavirus pandemic depends on our ability to safeguard health workers. That is why the global health community is dedicating World Patient Safety Day on 17 September this year to an often-overlooked aspect of patient care – the safety of health workers.",
          "WHO is calling on Member States and relevant stakeholders to support the new ‘ Health Worker Safety: A Priority for Patient Safety Charter ’ and commit to concrete actions that ensure safer conditions for health workers and patients – such as developing relevant policies, labor laws and supplying sufficient PPE. Ultimately, patients can only be safe if health workers are safe.",
          "WHO has also outlined specific World Patient Safety Day 2020-2021 Goals for health facilities to invest in, measure, and improve health worker safety over the course of the next year. The goals address personal protective practices, workplace injuries stress and burnout – among other key safety issues.",
          "COVID-19 has exposed serious gaps in the systems intended to protect both health workers and patients from harm. Now that governments and health care leaders know more, they must do more. As worldwide coronavirus cases reach new highs, we must invest and protect our health workers, like Laila, who risk their own lives in the line of duty.",

An investment case prepared with support from the GFF and input from a wide variety of stakeholders was presented, which led to commitments from the Government to increase the health budget by 15% every year, improve the efficiency and equity\r\n    of public health expenditure and better coordinate and align both domestic and external resources for health through a national platform for coordinating health financing. The platform was launched in July 2019 under the leadership of the Prime Minister’s\r\n    office.

Gavi and other GAP signatory agencies, including WHO, UNICEF, the Global Fund and the World Bank, together with other partners, are actively engaged in the transition strategy. In addition, Gavi has supported the establishment\r\n    of a multi-donor programme management unit, so that other agencies, including the Global Fund and the World Bank, can align their financing after the results of the first Gavi implementation report are available. In light of the Government’s\r\n    commitment and engagement to improve the efficiency and coordination of health financing and effective collaboration among the many partners in the country, including the Government of France and the United States Agency for International Development,\r\n    a list of clear priorities for support by GAP and other agencies has been drawn up. These are strengthening domestic resource mobilization by training civil society in budget advocacy; coordinated joint messaging from in- country partners; support\r\n    to achieve better technical and allocative efficiency in health expenditure; and support for the health financing coordination platform. All development partners, including the GAP agencies, are working to coordinate better among themselves and participate\r\n    in the platform with a consistent voice; ensure greater transparency and commitment from the Government, the private sector and other partners, including civil society organizations; improve the efficiency and sustainability of health financing and\r\n    national capacity to manage health funding; and ultimately contribute to better health outcomes through improved coverage of and access to PHC, especially for populations and regions that are not currently reached.",
          "Enabling factors for better coordinated support and more efficient health expenditure in Côte d’Ivoire include: A shared, evidence- based narrative among the agencies and the Government on health financing priorities; Collaboration among partners in developing shared high-level messaging, with institutional buy-in from GAP signatory agencies and other partners; Leveraging opportunistic strategies to strengthen joint advocacy for improved health financing, such as the World Bank spring meetings and the replenishment meetings of Gavi, GFF and the Global Fund; and Alignment of support to national budget and planning cycles and encouraging joint missions . Remaining challenges include maintaining momentum while electoral campaigns are starting in the country; implementing a functioning system for tracking and monitoring health expenditure; continuing support for implementation of the platform; and designing\r\n        joint modalities for implementation support. Côte d’Ivoire has been focused on COVID-19 since the first case appeared in the country in March 2020. As in other countries, individual and joint support by the agencies aims to ensure not only that the Government has adequate resources to\r\n        respond to the pandemic but also that service delivery and supply chains continue to function effectively. 1.

The Government\r\n    identified four priority areas where GAP agencies and other partners could offer joint support to strengthen Ghana’s health financing strategy: resource mobilization and donor transition planning; public financial management reforms, including\r\n    Ghana’s Integrated Financial Management Information System for more efficient use of resources; sustainable financing for PHC; and reform of the national health insurance scheme to support UHC. As a follow-up to the forum, the Chief Director\r\n    of the Ministry of Health convened a task force to continue work on the prioritized operational plan and costing with national stakeholders, GAP signatories, other development partners, civil society and the private sector.

          "According to the Minister of Health and Social Affairs of Mali, “the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All has been a transformative framework for Mali to start a dialogue with all partners on how to quicken the pace of action,\r\n    reach communities and achieve greater health impact”. The Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All has been a transformative framework for Mali to start a dialogue with all partners on how to quicken the pace of action, reach communities and achieve greater health impact. - Michel Sidibé, Minister of Health and Social Services, Mali Mali faces significant health challenges, including persistently high maternal and child mortality rates, the highest adolescent fertility rate in the world, low basic child immunization coverage, malnutrition, a relatively high burden of infectious diseases\r\n    – particularly tuberculosis, malaria and diarrhoeal disease – and an increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases. The country also has one of the lowest densities of health workers in the world, low national expenditure on health and\r\n    suboptimal laboratory capacity and supply chain systems. Key obstacles to achieving UHC in Mali include a fragmented national health insurance scheme with very limited coverage, high out- of-pocket health expenditure and geographical barriers to accessing\r\n    services. The country’s UHC index is 38 out of 100. To accelerate progress towards UHC, Mali is embarking on major health reforms, a pillar of which is strengthening the PHC system. Although the current system is fragile, it is decentralized to village level through a network of community health workers\r\n        in community health centres. Mali also plans to strengthen its universal health insurance scheme to provide an expanded package of services for all citizens, creating “last mile” delivery systems for health commodities and upgrading\r\n        secondary and tertiary health facilities. The health reform framework of the Government, known as the Mali Action Plan (MAP), expresses Mali’s vision “to become the first country to nationalize and implement the Global Action Plan\r\n        for Healthy Lives and Wellbeing for All”. To coordinate financing for the MAP and to strengthen national capacity to implement it, the Government has established a management unit in the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and is exploring\r\n        opportunities to establish a MAP “basket fund”. The Minister of Health and Social Affairs recognized early that enhanced collaboration among the GAP agencies came at an opportune time for Mali, and he requested in July 2019 that the signatory agencies and other development partners align their\r\n        support and collaborative actions with the MAP; most GAP agencies have signed a commitment to do so. In August 2019, Gavi and the Global Fund agreed to align a total of € 22 million in financing for health systems strengthening over the next\r\n        year to support Mali’s PHC system, using the MAP management unit to channel and manage the funds. Subsequent discussions culminated in a formal presentation of the MAP to technical and financial partners in January 2020, when the Government\r\n        requested that the agencies specifically support the MAP’s PHC priorities and activities. The GAP agencies were also requested to increase commitments to fill financing and capacity gaps, including by seconding technical expertise to the\r\n        management unit, to participate actively in the MAP’s national coordination platforms and to support domestic and international launches of the MAP. With support from the GAP PHC accelerator working group, country-facing staff of the GAP agencies have defined the support they can provide together in response to Mali’s requests. The Government is mapping resources for the National Health Strategic\r\n    Plan and the related investment case with support from GFF and the World Bank to identify the available resources and funding required for the MAP. GFF and the World Bank, with support from the Government of The Netherlands, launched the Projet d’Accélération\r\n    des progrès vers la Couverture Sanitaire Universelle (PACSU) to accelerate progress towards UHC with an investment of US$ 80 million to strengthen Mali’s health care system and contribute to the MAP objectives. Other possible activities of\r\n    GAP agencies include joint support for the MAP’s community health roadmap, including accreditation and training of community health workers and digitalization of the community health system linked to DHIS-2; strengthening maternal, new- born\r\n    and child health service delivery and diagnostic and laboratory services; support for services in fragile areas of the country and in the context of COVID-19; strengthening governance, financial management and “last-mile” procurement of\r\n    medicines; and exploring opportunities to implement performance- based funding at the primary care level. GAP implementation in Mali has benefited from strong leadership from the Government, a clear national plan and vision to guide alignment of and action by the signatory agencies and other development partners, and intensive discussions among the agencies’\r\n    country- facing staff and with the Government to ensure that stronger collaboration helps to accelerate the country’s progress towards UHC."

          "The GAP agencies are learning from and building on existing collaborations in Pakistan, such as the National Immunization Support Project, through which Gavi and the World Bank have already aligned financing. Discussions among the agencies on providing\r\n    joint support for scaling up PHC in line with the National Health Vision began in July 2019, led by the WHO Country Office. These focused on the design and financing of expanded UHC benefit packages for different settings. Additional opportunities\r\n    for joint support were identified and discussed after presentations to the GAP PHC accelerator working group and the GAP Sherpa group in January 2020, including scaling up PHC interventions in demonstration districts; engaging private physicians in\r\n    a family practice approach; strategic realignment of human resources for health; mapping and aligning federal and provincial resources; strengthening public financial management; and reforming the Lady Health Worker Programme based on development\r\n    of a strategic framework and investment case. Other opportunities include strengthening existing health coordination mechanisms, such as the Population, Nutrition and Development Partners Forum and the federal and provincial inter-ministerial health\r\n    committees.",
          "As Gavi, the Global Fund, GFF and the World Bank open new funding windows over the next year, these signatory agencies and other partners, such as the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, are exploring opportunities for alignment to support health systems\r\n    strengthening and delivery of essential health services at the primary care level. As a direct result of discussions on the GAP, the Global Fund, Gavi, GFF, UNICEF, the World Bank and WHO have planned a joint appraisal mission to strengthen PHC and\r\n    health financing by aligning financing, technical assistance and support for priorities identified by Pakistan’s federal and provincial ministries of health. The mission, which has been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, will be led by the Government\r\n    of Pakistan with support from WHO and UNICEF as co-leads of the GAP PHC accelerator working group and Gavi, the Global Fund and the World Bank as co-leads of the GAP finance accelerator working group.",
          "Joint and coordinated support under the auspices of the GAP will help to reduce the burden on Pakistan of managing multiple donors and funding streams, ensure that technical support for PHC is aligned with the country’s Health Vision and help to\r\n    lay the foundation for better access to health care for the Pakistani people.",

          "COVID-19 has caused widescale disruption to essential health services globally. To help maintain these in Indonesia, WHO is supporting surveillance of immunization services and vaccine preventable diseases, including diphtheria. Diphtheria is an infectious bacterial disease that primarily affects the throat and upper airways and produces a toxin that disturbs other organs. It is spread through direct physical contact or from breathing in contaminated droplets from infected individuals. The disease is fatal in 5-10% of cases with a higher mortality rate among children. Vaccination has reduced the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically. However, diphtheria is still a significant child health problem in countries with low immunization coverage. In 2019, Indonesia reported 948 cases of diphtheria nationwide. Eighty-one per cent of those who fell ill with the disease either had not completed the full dosage of immunization (7 doses or more) or had no vaccinations against diphtheria. WHO and the Indonesian government are working together to achieve the national target of diphtheria control by 2024. Overcoming disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO is continuing to support Indonesia by providing technical assistance, facilitating capacity building for surveillance officers and sourcing lifesaving diphtheria antitoxin treatments. In late July, WHO procured and delivered 700 vials (10 000 international units per vial) of diphtheria antitoxin, a crucial treatment that can reduce child fatality."

A large proportion of this amount (59%) was from Member States, followed by intergovernmental organizations – mainly the European Union (EU) (17%), United Nations organizations (6.5%), partnerships (6%), and non-state actors (including philanthropic foundations, private sector entities, academic institutions and nongovernmental organizations) (4%).",
          "Over this period, the top 3 donors were Germany (US$ 37.2 million/€31.3 million), the EU (US$ 35.6 million/€30 million), and the United States of America (US$ 30.3 million/€25.5 million). As well as increasing the total value of their donations in recent years, these donors have been among the top 3 since 2016. European Member States’ contributions together with the EU’s represented 57% of total voluntary funding to WHO/Europe at the end of June 2020.",
          "Of the specified voluntary funding received from Member States of the WHO European region, and the EU, most of this funding (63%) is allocated directly to the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe)’s work in countries. Of this amount, Turkey receives 28% and Ukraine 11%, a concentration of funds largely explained by emergency operations in these countries.",
          "From January to the end of June 2020, just over half of WHO/Europe’s funding (51%) has been directed towards work for emergencies, including the COVID-19 outbreak. This contributes to the global strategic priority set down in WHO’s 13th General Programme of Work, to address health emergencies. A further 22% has been put towards the third global priority of promoting healthier populations, and 20% to the first priority, achieving universal health coverage.",
          "WHO’s European Member States, together with the EU, have also assumed a leadership role as contributors to the global COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan with their combined voluntary contributions (close to US$ 750 million/€631.5 million) representing more than half of total funds pledged and received to date."

The initial focus has been on strengthening primary health care and sustainable financing for health.  Somalia is one of the\r\n    countries where progress under the GAP is most advanced and where its added value has been most clearly demonstrated.",
          "Routine immunization in Shibis mother and child health facility, Benadir region, Somalia. © WHO",
          "The Somalia country Director and Representative of the World Food Programme, Dr Cesar Arroyo underlined the vital importance of the GAP – through cementing collaboration among the 12 agencies: “The GAP initiative marks a crucial step towards\r\n    solving health-related challenges in Somalia and offers us an opportunity to strengthen our partnerships across the humanitarian community thereby enhancing operational efficiency, particularly within the COVID-19 context and beyond”.",
          "Three decades of civil war and instability have weakened Somalia’s health system and contributed to it having some of the lowest health indicators in the world. The situation varies from region to region but between 26-70% of Somalia’s 15\r\n    million people live in poverty and an estimated 2.6 million people have been internally displaced.",
          "But the Government is committed to using current opportunities to strengthen health and social development. These include implementation of Somali National Development Plan for 2019–2024 and the Somali Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Roadmap,\r\n    launched in September 2019.",
          "Both plans identify primary health care  as the main approach to improving health outcomes in the country.  Primary health care provides whole-person care for most health needs throughout the lifespan, ensuring that everyone can receive\r\n    comprehensive care ─ ranging from health promotion and prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care ─ as close as possible to where they live.",
          "Working together, the Government of Somalia, GAP agencies and multilateral and bilateral partners have identified 5 priorities for enhanced collaboration to accelerate progress towards UHC.",
          "Says Monique Vledder, Head of Secretariat for the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents: “The launch of the Global Action Plan has helped accelerate momentum across global health agencies to align their support to country\r\n    partners. In Somalia, the GFF has brought the spirit of the GAP from the global to the country level, convening partners across the federal and local governments, Somaliland, UN agencies, donors and civil society to establish the Health Sector Coordination\r\n    Committee. Country stakeholders and GAP agencies  are now building consensus around a priority package of essential services and critical health system reforms.”",

          "Improving access to a package of high-quality essential health services",
          "The country’s health services package is being updated with support from GAP agencies and other partners, with a focus on prevention and community-based components, communicable and noncommunicable diseases, and mental health.",
          "Strengthening emergency preparedness and response through UHC",
          "Somalia is prone to emergencies from natural disasters and disease outbreaks and is now responding to COVID-19. GAP agencies are exploring opportunities to support the finalization and implementation of components of a National Action Plan for\r\n    Health Security, which includes strengthening of laboratory and early warning systems and ensuring that a package of essential health services and key commodities are effectively delivered in humanitarian settings.",
          "Strengthening the role and capacity of the Ministry of Health",
          "This is essential to address fragmented health service delivery and funding arrangements; improve institutional capacity for policy-making, regulation, coordination, planning, management and contracting; and use of data in decision-making.",
          "Harnessing the private sector for UHC",
          "Private health services and the pharmaceutical sector are largely unregulated in Somalia but could contribute to improving access and achieving UHC. GAP agencies are exploring opportunities to support the development and operationalization of\r\n    a strategy for the private health sector, to assess its current role in service delivery and implementation of regulatory frameworks and contracting mechanisms.",
          "De Martini COVID-19 isolation center in Benadir, Somalia supported by WHO. © WHO",
          "“GAP provides us an opportunity to accelerate progress in achieving universal health coverage in Somalia through coordinated action and alignment with development partners and UN agencies. More than ever, we now need to push this agenda as we support the health systems of Somalia recover stronger and better from the COVID-19 pandemic“, said WHO Country Representative in Somalia, Dr Mamunur Malik .",
          "“Our collective engagement in improving access to care for women, children, and other vulnerable groups will be decisive in improving health and well being in the country. Through an integrated, coordinated and collaborative approach such as the GAP,  we can also build the required capacity of national and local health authorities to  deliver not only cost-effective health interventions using a primary healthcare approach, but also monitor and track porgress of the health-related indicators of sustainable development goal in the country“, he added.",
          "A doctor is preparing for routine immunization in Shibis mother and child health facility during COVID-19 in Benadir. © WHO",

          "To move these efforts forward, GAP agencies are collaborating with the Government to develop an operational plan. They aim to align this with the new funding that a number of agencies are providing for the response to COVID-19, to support the scale-up of primary health care, including implementation of the package of essential health services."

          "Facing up to NCDs Honduras’ National Health Code (Decreto Numero 65-91, El Congreso Nacional) establishes the right of citizens to the assistance and care necessary for the promotion, conservation, recovery and rehabilitation of their health. Yet, access to this care remains an ongoing challenge, with more than 4 in 10 of the country’s 9.2 million people living in rural areas. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are an enormous challenge to Honduras’s health systems. In 2016, NCDs represented more than two thirds of all deaths in Honduras, and more than 7-in-10 premature deaths. Diabetes is a particular challenge, with more than half the population estimated to be living either without a diagnosis, or an appropriate treatment plan. Despite the considerable health risks of diabetes, data on national prevalence and management remain extremely poor. Honduras does not have an updated population prevalence of diabetes nationally, with WHO estimating 7.2% of the population were living\r\n        with diabetes in 2016. Credit: WHO As Dr Ricardo Rodríguez Buño, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) explains, this is a big issue for patient care: “We estimate more than 650 000 Hondurans are living with diabetes. But the majority of them either have not been diagnosed, or do not have an adequate treatment plan. Strong surveillance and NCD registries are vital to change this.” Concerningly, a partial population-based survey of diabetes, hypertension, and NCD risk factors conducted in the cities of Tegucigalpa and Comayagüela in 2009 found half of all people living with diabetes did not have an established diagnosis\r\n            and treatment plan. In addition, the inconsistent data collection that does occur mainly addresses consultations or patient registration, without being able to determine that patient’s pathway. Diabetes surveillance: lacking information and impairing decision-making Timely health information, efficient system management and appropriate resourcing are all needed to enable decision-makers to assess the burden of NCDs in Honduras, and assign Government resources accordingly. In this context, collecting,\r\n                analysing and interpreting data on NCDs and their risk factors is vital. However, to date Honduras has not had adequate systems to gather information on diabetes care. The information system used to collect diabetes data is inadequate to comply with the standards needed to inform decision-making by authorities\r\n                and clinicians. Information systems are highly-fragmented, with few data-sharing processes in place. As three examples: Honduras’s national Dialysis Control Program does not have a functional information system; several dialysis clinics are outsourced to private providers using monopoly contracts, where records often only collect data on what sessions were provided, rather than clinical data; while the National Institute of Diabetics (Instituto Nacional del Diabético, INADI) has a digital information system, it is incomplete and does not routinely use electronic medical records. Dr Laura Giacaman, director of epidemiology at the National Institute of Diabetics (INADI), explains these challenges: \"Until 2018, we did not have a statistical or epidemiological surveillance unit. Since then we have been working to obtain data and information, but our resources are still very weak. It is vital to have an integrated information system that gives us information anywhere, anytime. This can permit us to make decisions for such important issues as human resources, medications, and actions. It also allows us to monitor and follow up on clinical management for the benefit of patients.” There\r\n is a clear need to strengthen Honduras’s diabetes information system. By improving how information about diabetes is captured and communicated, not only will the population benefit, but the approach can also be a precedent for other\r\n            institutions seeking to improve their management systems. Fragmented paper records were commonplace for diabetes surveillance. Credit: National Institute of Diabetics (Instituto Nacional del Diabético, INADI) Fixing these challenges A recent project, funded by the Government of Denmark, was granted to a coalition project led by the PAHO/WHO Country Office in Honduras, working with the Ministry of Health (Secretaría de Salud, SESAL) and INADI, and supported by other\r\n                Government institutions. This coalition had a primary aim to create and agree a national plan for the improvement of the health information systems. To support this improvement, secondary aims of improving diagnostics and monitoring frameworks were also considered vital. As a first step, activities were carried out to evaluate the available information related to diabetes in the health care system, and to improve the capacity and quality of information systems to assist clinical management. This evaluation shone a light on several areas of need. In response, a framework for the effective surveillance and monitoring of diabetes and its complications was developed and validated by the working group. This framework contains 21 indicators and 5 annexes, capturing data on aspects such as health outcomes, service productivity and performance, and quality of health care delivery. Ing. José Ramón Pereira, director of the Information Management Unit (UGI), Ministry of Health, explains the value of this framework: “This framework is important because it allows us to advance a delay: we can now have standardized information from all health facilities as a first step to integrating these systems together.” To progress this framework, a national plan for the improvement of health information on diabetes care for 2020-2024 was prepared. The plan set out ways to integrate NCD monitoring and surveillance into the existing health system. It also finds key areas to improve. With technological strengthening as a particular area of concern, a procurement process was undertaken nationally to secure glucometers, biometric identification systems and computer equipment for health facilities. The national plan to improve health information for diabetes care will help reach people living with diabetes not previously diagnosed, improve patient care, and identify where equipment is needed. Credit: National Institute of Diabetics (Instituto Nacional del Diabético, INADI). The result: stronger information systems, revitalized surveillance and working together towards one goal Despite only beginning in April 2020, the project has allowed Honduras to lay the foundations for future action. Most importantly, a national plan has been created to develop information systems for diabetes and its complications. This roadmap includes milestones for development, such as strengthening dialysis registries, developing diabetic patient\r\n                registries at central and regional levels. While conducted in a very short time-scale, the national plan will serve as a primer for larger structural developments across the country and rapidly improving diagnosis and monitoring capacity. It is hoped this work will create tangible\r\n                improvements in both universal health coverage, and give diabetes patients the quality of care they deserve. Better surveillance enables clinicians to engage patients in appropriate treatment plans. Credit: National Institute of Diabetics (Instituto Nacional del Diabético, INADI). Importantly, grant funding has also enabled partners to achieve a technical agreement for the surveillance and follow-up of people living with diabetes, through a National Monitoring Framework. As Dr Karla Pavón, director of the Health Surveillance Unit (UVS), Ministry of Health summarizes, this technical agreement ultimately means better care for people living with NCDs: \"By generating unique information we can support decision-makers in a timely manner. Working with the health networks, we can move forward to detect the NCDs that are taking place all over the country.\" Part of this technical agreement has included boosting the capacity for dialysis surveillance.

Reopening borders, tourism, and public spaces is challenging in timing and logistics, sometimes causing increases in virus transmission and a possible reinstatement of lockdowns in cities and areas. This is all too evident in places like the US, Australia, Spain, and the UK.",
          "“ We are at a critical point,” says Dr Stéphane Hugonnet, Medical Doctor and Epidemiologist, Unit Head, WHO Health Emergency Programme. “Contact tracing is crucial in order to\r\n    rapidly identify cases and their contacts and prevent resurgence.” As lockdown measures begin to reduce COVID-19 cases to manageable levels, says Dr Hugonnet, the epidemiological practice of contact tracing must go into full force."

          "Seemingly simple, contact tracing is the process of identifying all people that a COVID-19 patient has come in contact with in the last two weeks. In reality, the lift can be monumental.",
          "“You need a system to identify cases, a functioning laboratory, a system to feedback data, people to identify and follow-up with contacts, provide support if they need quarantine, and treat them properly,” says Dr Hugonnet. This amounts --\r\n    at a minimum -- to three days of work per COVID-19 patient. And that’s not even considering test delays, new branches of virus transmission, and travel difficulties in rural or conflict settings.",
          "Contact tracing becomes complicated and time-consuming very quickly. Especially in the context of COVID-19, as the virus can be transmitted between people without even manifesting symptoms.",
          "“It all adds up,” says Dr Hugonnet.",
          "To cut down on the man-power needed to manage these processes, a wide array of digital tools are surfacing around the world. An option used currently in 55 projects worldwide is called Go.Data .\r\n Developed by WHO during the West African Ebola epidemic in 2014, Go.Data is a tool for public health practitioners and field responders that facilitates labour intensive processes of contact tracing such as initial case investigation, transmission\r\n    pathway visualization, and contact follow-up.",
          "Developers are also turning their eyes to the public, putting epidemiological tools in the hands of ordinary citizens and businesses. The details vary from tool to tool. Some, like SaferMe, simply provide employers with a database of regularly updated\r\n    contact tracing from employees and a place to input daily health surveys.",
          "Others have more complicated implications, for example the “Exposure Notification” from Apple and Google. These “proximity tracking tools” are downloadable phone apps that use Bluetooth to alert users when they’ve come into\r\n    contact with a COVID-19 positive person, advising them on next steps. However, there are some roadblocks to ubiquitous public adoption. First and foremost: data security and privacy."
        ]

      {
        "heading": "Data security and privacy",
        "content": [
          "The effectiveness of digital proximity tracking tools depends on a high coverage and utilization rate among the population. Trust is a central issue, with laws on privacy and data security varying drastically throughout the world. “We must ensure\r\n    that key elements of privacy are not abused or disregarded in the name of public health response for emergencies,” says Bernardo Mariano Junior, Director of the Department of Digital Health and Innovation and Chief Information Officer of WHO.\r\n    “The key is finding frameworks where data privacy and data sharing can coexist in ways that add to public health responses.”",
          "Mr Mariano also emphasises that digital tools cannot be used in a vacuum, a sentiment echoed by Dr Hugonnet. “Digital tools have the potential to optimize traditional contact tracing processes, but only if they are integrated into a comprehensive\r\n    public health response,” says Dr Hugonnet. “The application cannot function or be effective on its own.”",
          "When it comes down to it, contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic relies on the ubiquitous implementation of traditional epidemiological approaches, involving public health responders who investigate cases in person, set out to talk to those potentially\r\n    exposed, and advise them on what to do next. However, in the context of widespread community transmission this may not be enough, and new technologies might be required to scale up these processes. Even so, according to the International Telecommunications\r\n    Union, at the beginning of 2020, 46.4% of the world population had no access to internet. As digital solutions to contact tracing are explored, it’s key to remember they will only benefit a privileged subset of the world. Even with broadband\r\n    internet access — needed to download proximity tracking apps — users would also need smart phone technology, which creates another roadblock to the widespread use of these digital tools.",
          "While the world searches for breakthroughs in health technology, WHO is running multiple tracks at once: behind the scenes bringing together private sector, innovators and governments to scale up technology and digital inclusion, and on the ground in humanitarian settings like Syria, Yemen and Bangladesh to set up early warning systems for COVID-19 transmission and provide much needed support.",
          "There is still so much to learn about contact tracing in the age of COVID-19. WHO ensures what we know already is put to work.",

          "When COVID-19 began spreading, countries needed to immediately plan to respond to a global pandemic. Pakistan, for example, recognized the urgency for a strategic approach to identify needs, develop a country-level response plan, and coordinate at both the national and provincial level. Of particular importance would be a real time mechanism to help monitor the flow of contributions in support of the response. Pakistan health officials began to work closely with WHO for the COVID-19 response. By using the COVID-19 Partners Platform action checklist, resource tracking and the Supply Portal, Pakistan was able to create its preparedness and response plan and coordinate with local donors. “For the first time we have a tool that allows us to monitor fund flow, this is both operationally useful and a great service to all our partners,” says Mr Julien Harneis, UN Resident Coordinator of Pakistan.",
          "The online Partners Platform, launched with United Nations Development Coordination office (UNDCO) on March 16 th , was built upon a WHO-vetted checklist of 143 actions, drawn from the most up-to-date guidance created by international experts. Countries choose actions from the checklist to create their COVID-19 preparedness and response plans. They can then note if they have initiated or fully completed the actions. Since all actions are fully costed, countries can also note where they need financial assistance. The transparency of the Platform allows donors to track what actions are taking place, where the biggest resource needs and gaps lie, and how to prioritize which allocations go where.",
          "WHO / Blink Media – Fabeha Monir",
          "“When we started emailing COVID-19 checklists and plans to countries in January the list of countries was growing rapidly”, says Mr Scott Pendergast, Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships for the WHO Health Emergencies Programme;  “we realized we needed a live digital Platform to provide updated guidance on the new pandemic to help all public health officials in all countries around the world share what steps they were taking with each other,” says Dr. Lucy Boulanger, head of WHO’s new COVID-19 Partners Platform. Her team immediately began developing the first digital Platform where governments, UN agencies, and partners can plan and coordinate together in one place.",
          "Countries quickly recognized the value in the Platform and became highly engaged. At the time of this story, 123 countries, areas and territories are actively using the Platform, with 110 plans uploaded and 106 countries tracking their activities using the “action checklist” across eight pillars of the public health response and a ninth pillar on maintaining essential health services and systems. Boulanger describes the Platform as a rich repository of ideas.",
          "Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHOs Health Emergencies programme, stresses the Platform’s importance in keeping health systems from breaking down. “Health emergencies weaken health systems, and weak health systems exacerbate health emergencies. It’s a negative cycle unless you can turn it around. The Platform can be used to help countries maintain essential health services like vaccinations during a pandemic.” Dr Boulanger, a medical epidemiologist and part of WHO’s Health Emergencies programme’s preparedness division, offers Italy as an example of a country whose health system was put under extreme stress early on during the pandemic constraining their ability to offer most essential health services.",
          "WHO / Blink Media – Fabeha Monir",
          "The need for the Platform concept existed before COVID-19 came on the scene. “This Platform grew out of extraordinary frustration during the last five years of Ebola coordination,” says Dr Boulanger, who spent two years responding to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. “Countries’ desires to respond to health emergencies grew exponentially following the Ebola outbreak. It could no longer be a static system over email. It had to be user-friendly, country-focused, and data driven in real time,” says Boulanger.",
          "The Platform is constantly evolving based on the needs of the more than 3500 stakeholders actively utilizing the platform. Operational guidance can be adjusted immediately as new information on the virus develops. “For example, guidance for rolling out vaccines to different countries (the Access to COVID-19 tools (ACT) accelerator) is going to be changing rapidly, and the only way to update and track that efficiently is on a web-based platform,” says Boulanger.",
          "Using data gathered from all WHO regions, the Partners Platform data dashboard provides all users with visualizations highlighting global, regional and country datasets; analysis comparing actions, resource needs, contributions and gaps; and data to inform decision-making.",
          "Perhaps one of the most unique aspects of the Platform is its transparency, particularly the visibility of countries’ response plans, resource gaps and donor allocations. As of 1 September, 88 countries have shared resource needs across nine pillars of public health totaling US $9.1 billion. Donors have responded with more than 600 contributions totaling US $7.5 billion.",
          "The Platform facilitates requests for funds but does not match funds with needs. A country goes onto the Platform and makes a request for a resource (i.e. Personal Protective Equipment), and then, should they need funding, makes a request for financial support for that resource. If funding comes in for that request, the country can then move into the Supply Portal within the Platform to request the supplies and see committed funds. As of 1 Sep, 88 countries have used the Supply Portal.",
          "Donors can request information from the Platform on what needs exist and what actions are being implemented when and where. We can see that the most widely planned actions on countries’ checklists are for coordination, surveillance, risk communication, and community engagement. The actions with the highest price tag are case management (work force and supplies to take care of patients) and maintaining essential health services.",
          "The Partners Platform is the only place where the major donor partners (World Bank, Development Banks, the EU, UAE, Canada, Germany, Gavi, Japan and The Global Fund) can see what each other is doing in emergency response, make informed decisions, and coordinate. “In this way funding goes towards internationally standardized interventions. Donors can ensure their contributions are going towards implementing key activities,” says Boulanger. The Philippines, for example, has 36 NGO partners engaged on the Platform. By using the Platform, partners can visualize which regions in the country need more help and direct their donations accordingly.",
          "The Platform also promotes coordination between countries. AFRO aims to register at least one member of a Government Ministry in each country with the Platform. This dedicated engagement strategy has led to a tide change of interest from Ministries: 45% of AFRO countries (22 countries) have now appointed a Ministry member on the Platform, with 65% of users from the Ministry of Health. Kenya wants to use it as their national reporting system.",
          "WHO / Blink Media - Gilliane Soupe",
          "The Platform represents an additional way for countries to provide technical leadership and support to neighbouring countries as well as globally. United Arab Emirates was one of the first in the Eastern Mediterranean Region to upload its response plan to the Platform. In addition to using the Platform to monitor regional and global resource needs, the Platform helps countries with cross-border preparedness/response planning (like international travel).",
          "Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General appreciates that the Partners Platform was conceived from the beginning with countries’ needs in mind. “The Partners Platform is country centered. The countries decide what information they want to share with the world about their actions and resources. It gives the power to the countries and the visibility to the world,” says Boulanger.",
          "WHO’s Partners Platform is an exemplary mechanism for solidarity in response to COVID-19. It integrates and streamlines the planning, financing and monitoring of the global response, with transparency that has never been seen before. WHO hopes the Platform can be used for future global health emergencies with plug and play modules depending on the epidemic. Some authorities have inquired if it may be used as a model for socio-economic protection or economic risk mitigation. “I can’t grow it fast enough,” says Boulanger."

          "We recommend systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with severe and critical COVID-19. We suggest not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with non-severe COVID-19 as the treatment brought no benefits, and could even prove harmful. Treatment should be under supervision of a clinician.",
          "Corticosteroids are listed in the WHO model list of essential medicines, readily available globally at a low cost.  WHO encourages countries to maintain sufficient stocks of corticosteroids to treat COVID-19 and the other disease for which they are effective, while not maintaining excessive stocks which could deny other countries access.",
          "This guidance was developed in collaboration with the non-profit Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC), which provided methodologic support to develop and disseminate living guidance for COVID-19 drug treatments.",
          "Work on this guidance began on 22 June when the RECOVERY trial published a preliminary report on the impact of corticosteroids. To supplement the results, WHO partnered with investigators of seven trials on corticosteroids to conduct a meta-analysis of these trials, in order to rapidly provide additional evidence to build on RECOVERY data and inform guidance development.",
          "The guidance was thus informed by combining data from eight randomized trials of systemic corticosteroids for COVID-19.",
          "WHO provides guidance that works across all contexts for all countries and health care systems."

          "With age often comes wisdom. As COVID-19 swept across Europe, Greece started implementing nationwide measures to contain the virus, including cancellation of major public gatherings and lock-down measures. The city of Athens followed these measures while also moving quickly to bring experts together from all sectors to protect marginalised communities.",
          "They knew that these strict measures would heavily impact vulnerable groups who would face isolation, disruption to treatment and rehabilitation services, and reduced access to social programmes. These groups were also at higher risk of getting COVID-19 and having a more severe case, due to higher rates of noncommunicable diseases.",
          "“These very harsh times have taught us that the best outcome always comes with collaboration and consistent efforts. When city and civil society join efforts, the result is more than fruitful, as together we can open an ever-safer umbrella towards marginalized populations. In this battle against time, no one is to be left behind,” said the Mayor of Athens Kostas Bakoyannis.",
          "Athens is one of 70 cities belonging to a global network committed to saving lives through the prevention of NCDs and injuries – the Partnership for Healthy Cities . From March, the Partnership expanded to urgently address the pandemic, as cities are playing a vital role in the response to COVID-19.",
          "Athens city authorities, together with the Hellenic Liver Patients Association “Prometheus”, the Greek Association of People Living with HIV “Positive Voice” and funding from the Partnership for Healthy Cities were able to strengthen support to get essential supplies and health information to marginalised communities during the pandemic.",
          "Through the project trained staff and volunteers in Athens distribute food, water, gloves, masks, antiseptic liquid, and information about COVID-19 to those affected by homelessness, people who inject drugs, sex workers and migrants. The informational flyers provided life-saving public health advice on how to protect yourself from COVID-19. The city also created temporary housing for more than 400 people affected by homelessness and a specialised support centre for people who inject drugs.",
          "“WHO supports Greece with advocacy and evidence-based policy guidance for COVID-19 and beyond. The ‘whole-of-society’ approach leaves no one behind and amplifies the best of social norms while creating a new positive normal that minimizes stigma and discrimination,” emphasized Marianna Trias, WHO representative for Greece.",
          "The Versatile Center for Homeless People combines accommodation with health and social care services to promote the physical and mental health of participants. The Centre also offers a day service, where residents can access personal hygiene facilities, a healthy meal and internet, in addition to a space for resting. In April, Athens opened a second, more specialised, centre for people who inject drugs. The centre offers temporary accommodation alongside drug treatment and rehabilitation services.",
          "In recognising and addressing the needs of marginalised groups during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Athens is promoting health equity and building a more just city. These programmes reflect progress in tackling the long-standing challenges of homelessness and substance use and improving access to health for hard to reach groups.",
          "Cities must build on the successes and innovation born out of the pandemic to catalyse progress towards ensuring the right to health for all."

Many services for illnesses that are unrelated to COVID-19 have stopped, with multiple primary health care services on hold. Community health workers, vaccinators, midwives and family welfare assistants are unable to perform outreach services. The pandemic is limiting women’s access to life-saving maternal and newborn health services. Lockdowns and travel restrictions disrupt regular supply chains of essential medicines and health products, and creates a gap in the stock of essential vaccines, leading to the disruption of immunization services. This results in another major threat: future outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, a fear that is generating global concern.",

          "Over 110 million people – over 10% of the population – are living with a mental health condition in Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed substantially to mental health challenges in the region through fear and uncertainty, especially for frontline health-care workers and for those suffering from existing conditions.",
          "The flagship is part of a more concerted effort to secure better mental health for all, both through intensified country support and inter-country initiatives at the regional and global levels.",
          "A core components of the initiative is challenging stigma and discrimination by improving mental health awareness and literacy among the public, service providers and decision-makers.",
          "Another key pillar is enhancing access to person-centred, rights-based mental health care in communities to expedite progress towards universal health coverage for people with mental health conditions.",
          "The flagship will encourage efforts and investments to relocate care away from institutions and towards community services, including through the integration of mental health into primary health care and other priority programmes such as adolescent health and noncommunicable diseases.",
          "Through collaboration with a strong coalition of partner Organizations and citizens, WHO/Europe looks forward to building a more positive approach to, and future for, mental health across the Region."

          "Soon after the world started getting used to the terms coronavirus and COVID-19, WHO coined another word: \"infodemic\" — an overabundance of information and the rapid spread of misleading or fabricated news, images, and videos. Like the virus, it is highly contagious and grows exponentially. It also complicates COVID-19 pandemic response efforts.",
          "“We’re not just battling the virus,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We’re also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response.”",
          "Proliferating misinformation — even when the content is, in a best-case scenario, harmless — can have serious and even social and lethal health ramifications in the context of a global pandemic. In some countries, rumours about impending food scarcity prompted people to stockpile supplies early on in the epidemic and caused actual shortages. In the United States of America, a person passed\r\n    away from ingesting a fish tank cleaning product containing chloroquine after reports mentioned hydroxychloroquine as a possible - yet unproven - remedy  for treatment of COVID-19. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, hundreds died after drinking methanol alcohol that social\r\n    media messages said had cured others of the coronavirus. This is the kind of dangerous misinformation that WHO is most worried about.",
          "Even as the world is laser-focused on the search for a safe, effective vaccine, misinformation continues to spread about immunization as well. Health experts in Germany are concerned that the country’s anti-vaccination movement may deter many people\r\n    from getting immunized when a safe vaccine becomes available. A recent study that examined the vaccination views of 100 million Facebook users globally found that while the pro-vaccination camp (6.9 million people) outnumbered those against vaccination\r\n    (4.2 million), the anti-vaccine group was less isolated and had more interaction with the individuals (by far the largest group, at 74.1 million) who are undecided about vaccination. These “swing vaxxers” are important to target and get\r\n    on board with lifesaving vaccination.",
          "To learn more about how WHO is taking on the infodemic fight, the United Nations Foundation caught up with Tim Nguyen on the sidelines of the world’s first infodemiology conference , which brought together world experts\r\n    to discuss the developing science of managing infodemics. Nguyen’s team manages the Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN), which is leading WHO work on managing infodemics."

          "“Infodemics have already happened in one way or another in past epidemics, but what’s happening right now is something of a global scale, where people are connected through different means and share information more quickly,” Nguyen\r\n    said. “This has created a new situation where we are rethinking and reshaping our approach to managing infodemics in emergencies.”",
          "According to a recent study evaluating English-language misinformation, the largest category of posts labeled as false or misleading by fact-checkers was content that deliberately challenged or questioned policies and actions of public officials, governments,\r\n    and international institutions such as the United Nations and WHO.",
          "One flagrant example of this is “Plandemic,” a 26-minute conspiracy theory video that falsely accuses Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading infectious disease expert in the United States, of manufacturing the virus and sending it to China. The same\r\n    video falsely claims that wearing masks will lead to self-infection. More than 8 million people watched the video across social media before it was taken down.",
          "Such content can erode public trust in the very organizations leading the fight against COVID-19. To remind the public of the primacy of science, WHO first pinpoints what kind of misinformation is floating out there and then responds with its own evidence-based\r\n    guidance. The wider United Nations community has been helping amplify this information through its own anti-misinformation initiative Verified .\r\n For example, the initiative’s “Pause. Take care before you share” campaign encourages people to take time\r\n    to verify sources before deciding whether to share any content online.",
          "WHO has also been working closely with social media and technology companies to help curb some of the misinformation spreading on their platforms. In February, officials from\r\n    the health agency met at Facebook’s headquarters about how to promote accurate health information about COVID-19. Now, WHO is working with more than 50 digital companies and social media platforms including TikTok, Google, Viber, WhatsApp, and\r\n    YouTube to ensure that science-based health messages from the organization or other official sources appear first when people search for information related to COVID-19. Even the dating app Tinder now features WHO health reminders, because social\r\n    distancing is still appropriate during a date."

          "“Countering fake news or rumours is actually only responding or mitigating when it’s too late,” said Nguyen. “What we’ve put in place in the beginning of the pandemic is what we call a social listening approach.”",
          "WHO is working with an analytics company to incorporate social listening into its public health messaging development — a first for the Organization.",
          "Each week, the company reviews 1.6 million pieces of information on various social media platforms, then uses machine learning to conduct searches based on a newly developed public health taxonomy to categorize information into four topics: the cause,\r\n    the illness, the interventions, and the treatment. This helps WHO track public health topics that are gaining popularity and develop and tailor health messages in a timely way. Examples include “How does a pandemic end?” and “How\r\n    do we know when we have a second wave of the virus?”",
          "Top public health topics for 9-15 July",
          "Machine learning also provides insights into what kinds of emotions users are experiencing. Instead of simply dividing the data by type of sentiment (positive, neutral, negative), language analytics can shed light on anxiety, sadness, denial, acceptance,\r\n    and other emotions expressed in social media posts. This level of detail allows WHO to develop an effective offensive strategy and assuage the public’s concerns before misinformation can gain steam.",
          "“What we’ve learned now, after two and a half months of doing this kind of analysis, is that there are recurring themes and topics that are coming back over and over again,” Nguyen said. “What that means to us is that we need to\r\n    re-push information at different times. People may not understand it the first time when we push it, but when the questions and issues come up later, it means it’s time to push it out again.”",
          "Not everyone has access to social media or the internet, but they remain just as prone as anyone else to being exposed to misinformation. To overcome this digital gap, WHO is working with colleagues from the UN Global Pulse initiative, which uses artificial intelligence and big data to tackle development and humanitarian issues and to apply social listening to countries where radio is a popular medium of information.",
          "In Uganda, for example, more than half of households rely on radio for their news, and thousands of Ugandans call into local programs every day to talk about issues from the most mundane to serious topics such as health care. The Kampala branch of UN\r\n    Global Pulse uses an automated speech recognition tool powered by artificial intelligence to translate the radio recordings from the local dialect into digital English text. The initiative was featured in the UN Foundation’s Innovation in Action series last year, showcasing how the UN is leveraging innovation\r\n    and fresh thinking to address the world’s most pressing challenges.",
          "Analyst listening to radio recordings to gather insights to better inform policy and messaging. © Pulse Lab Kampala",
          "The UN Global Pulse team is now using the tool to identify COVID-related language in Uganda and any misinformation that local communities are spreading. The team found that local communities were promoting witchcraft and herbs as COVID-19 cures; there were even rumors circulating about a vaccine being manufactured in Uganda. This kind\r\n        of data is invaluable for organizations such as WHO to inform their messaging and guidance development. WHO is working with the UN to scale up and pilot this project for two additional countries in sub-Saharan Africa and two in Southeast Asia.",
          "“You need to have a certain degree of good information out there to reach populations so that they are inoculated and not susceptible to fake news or disinformation,” Nguyen said. “We believe we need to vaccinate 30% of the population\r\n        with “good information,” in order to have a certain degree of ‘herd” immunity against misinformation.”",
          "That’s where the local community becomes especially important in helping to amplify WHO’s messaging."

They’ve created a dedicated page of “mythbusters” ,\r\n featuring fact-based answers to the most common misconceptions about COVID-19, including: whether shoes can spread the virus (very low likelihood), if hot baths can keep the new coronavirus at bay (no, and you may get burned), and if hand dryers\r\n        can kill the virus (no, they don’t).",
          "While WHO is accustomed to working with health ministries and other government bodies and officials to develop and amplify public health messaging, Nguyen said that in a crisis of the magnitude of COVID-19, a whole-of-society approach is necessary\r\n        to make sure all communities are reached. For example, instead of a top-down strategy, WHO works with specific groups such as youths, journalists, and faith-based organizations to co-develop guidance that is tailored to each context and community.\r\n        These groups serve as amplifiers, disseminating accurate health information to people organically.",
          "Nguyen noted that at the global level, information needs can be very different. “Let’s take the hand-washing guidance, for example. It’s important and there’s a global recommendation for how long and the way you need to do\r\n        it,” he said, “but let’s also be honest. There are certain parts of the world where it’s not possible to do it as recommended.”",
          "Community leaders can help tailor hygiene guidance in contexts where there may not be enough water sources or soap to properly wash hands, or in cramped conditions where social distancing may seem nearly impossible. Revised guidelines co-developed by WHO and faith leaders include replacing greetings of physical contact with a simple eye contact and bow; encouraging worshippers to complete ritual ablutions at home instead of at the place of worship; and even offering tips during\r\n        painful situations such as how to bury loved ones while abiding by COVID-19 restrictions.",
          "“It’s important to work with these amplification groups that understand the people they care for much better than we do,” Nguyen said. “We’re co-developing guidance with individuals who are directly affected and can help\r\n        us implement a certain practice that leads to behaviour change.”",
          "A new UN alliance to fight the the infodemic — comprising WHO, UNESCO, the International Telecommunication Union, and UN Global Pulse — recently received just over US $4.5 million from the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund to scale its community amplifier work, social listening initiative, and other projects including the creation of a centralized fact-checking and misinformation center\r\n        to provide countries with tools to address the infodemic. On 29 June, WHO also organized the world’s first infodemiology conference , which brought together scientists from diverse backgrounds to focus on the issue systematically and brainstorm science-based\r\n        ways to better manage it.",
          "“We have physicists, mathematicians, sitting with epidemiologists, with social scientists to discuss evidence-based approaches to manage the infodemic,” Nguyen said. “All of these scientific fields have their own schools of thoughts,\r\n        their frames, how they do research, so it’s interesting how one perspective can help fertilize the other.”",
          "While a vaccine and treatment for COVID-19 are not ready yet, WHO’s proactive steps are helping to neutralize the infodemic of misinformation.",
          "“To tackle this infodemic, we need to do things differently than we have in the past,” Nguyen said. “Thanks to the leadership of Dr Tedros, we are increasingly open to innovation and to rethink the way that we are doing things.”"

          "Immunization is an essential service which risks being disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The halt of immunization services, even for brief periods, can raise the likelihood of outbreak-prone Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) which would be catastrophic for health systems already battling COVID-19. In 2019, measles caused more than 6 000 deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a country which was fighting its largest Ebola outbreak. In Zimbabwe, a number of district hospitals and clinics in Masvingo Province had suspended essential health services as a result of COVID-19. Reasons for initial stoppage of services included healthcare worker fear of contracting COVID-19; a lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and facilities preparing for upsurge of COVID-19 cases. Communities were also reluctant to use health facilities for fear of contracting COVID-19. Drawing from lessons learnt in DRC, the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC), backed by the WHO, undertook a mission to Masvingo Province to provide support for COVID-19 response activities and assess the continuity of essential services provision in the province. The visit found that areas with closer facility proximity performed better at continuing vaccination programs. In areas without close facility proximity, the experts determined that monthly community outreach was necessary to meet the vaccination needs of children in marginalized areas. Other best practices determined were consistent and timely monitoring of performance of immunization services and prioritization of essential services provision.",
          "Training for nurses on COVID-19 protection and control helped continue vaccination programs for children. Taking advantage of food distribution points officials were able to remind mothers to get their children vaccinated.",
          "Other key recommendations for Masvingo provinces included increasing funding and logistical support for outreach services as well as involving stakeholders, community leaders and communities early during crises like COVID-19 to help build resilient health systems."

          "Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley said the masks would greatly assist the governments in protecting their frontline workers.",
          "She also thanked the WHO for being responsive and working on behalf of smaller states.",
          "“What is important is that we not only have access, which we didn’t as a small region as CARICOM on our own, but that we are also looking to be able to procure at prices that are usually only available for much larger countries and populations. Therefore, St. Kitts with 40,000 people will have the same access as Nigeria, with two hundred million people, and that is the fundamental policy space that we have negotiated to make a difference to the people of the region,” she said.",
          "This is in line with the goals of the UN COVID-19 Supply Chain Task Force, coordinated by WHO and the World Food Programme (WFP) and launched in early April,  to make supplies available to everyone, wherever they are needed. By consolidating the capabilities and expertise of each partner into a mega-consortium, identifying procurement needs and better negotiation with suppliers, WHO makes essential supplies accessible by using its leverage to secure large quantities.",
          "Prime Minister Mottley pointed out that the consistent support received from WHO and PAHO had made a significant difference to the ability of small states like those in the CARICOM region to handle the COVID-19 pandemic.  “I make this point because everything else in the conduct of commerce, in the strategic allocation of resources has been against small states and it has appeared as though the mighty and the strongest shall be only those who will survive. Were it not for these agencies, that would be our fate,” Prime Minister Mottley says."

          "The World Health Organization Liberia Country Office recently donated 21 Oxygen Concentrators to the Ministry of Health to support the government in the management of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Statistics generated by Liberia’s Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA+) and Quality of Care (QoC) in 2018 showed that only 58% of the country’s hospitals had oxygen. This situation was further exacerbated by the health challenges posed by COVID-19 on an already fragile healthcare system following a devastating Ebola Virus Disease outbreak (2014-2016). Oxygen concentrators are of extreme importance in respiratory infectious disease management. The concentrators deliver pure, high quality oxygen with the appropriate concentration vital for the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients with subnormal blood oxygen levels. By donating oxygen concentrators, WHO seeks to contribute to Liberia’s COVID-19 response and mitigate its impact on the health system. On the occasion of the donation, Liberian government officials lauded WHO’s assistance especially in this time of severe crisis. They pledged to distribute the equipment to all 15 counties to boost the national fight against COVID-19."

          "A donation by the Government of Japan made it possible for WHO/PAHO to secure a large stock of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) for Panama to contribute to its ongoing COVID-19 response. The Government of Japan’s grant amounted to over $US 230 000 of equipment. To provide Panama with the supplies, PAHO/WHO made use of the COVID-19 Supply Chain System (CSCS) coordinated by WHO to manage the acquisition of products, including gowns, medical masks, N95 masks, protective goggles, isolation gowns and face shields. The government of Japan said its donation was as a gesture of solidarity to support local efforts against COVID-19. The equipment will help protect professionals and health workers who care for patients in intensive care units, in hospitals and recovery or isolation centres throughout the country. To coordinate the donation, PAHO deployed a large team who works to ensure timely access to quality and affordable equipment for the countries in its region. PAHO’s work in Panama during the COVID-19 crisis has focused mainly on providing technical cooperation to prevent and control infections, strengthening epidemiological and health surveillance, ensuring the capacity of laboratories and hospitals, managing cases and ensuring access to a safe and effective vaccine."

          "Good hygiene practices such as hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment and cleaning and disinfection of medical equipment and environment – just some of the elements of infection prevention and control (IPC) – are at the forefront of COVID-19 responses worldwide. They protect both patients and health workers from infection.",
          "From the outset, the Government of South Africa prioritized scaling up of IPC; a vital component of quality care and a key element in achieving universal health coverage (UHC). The National Department of Health, among other measures, urgently approved the ‘National IPC Strategic Framework’ and a practical manual for its implementation, which was developed with support from WHO. The timing was crucial in order to support the national control and response to COVID-19.",
          "In low- and middle-income countries, healthcare-associated infections are double those in high-income countries. Strong IPC measures will help save lives among the 58 million people living in South Africa, especially in vulnerable populations. They have a direct impact on preventing healthcare-associated infections and the spread of COVID-19, as well as in combatting current threats posed by epidemics such as Ebola and cholera, other pandemics like influenza, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which are increasingly major challenges to public health.",
          "“I believe and trust that this strategic framework for IPC and the practical manual for its implementation will strengthen evidence-based infection practices at national, provincial, district and health facility levels towards combating threats posed by epidemics, pandemics and antimicrobial resistance,” said Dr Anban Pillay, Acting Director General, National Department of Health, South Africa.",
          "This support was provided through the UHC Partnership as part of WHO’s overall COVID-19 response. The Partnership is funded by the European Union (EU), the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Irish Aid, the Government of Japan, the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, the UK Department for International Development and Belgium.",

The Department of Medical Services, Ministry of Public Health, with support from WHO and the government of Japan has developed a 'new normal' model for health service delivery to strengthen the healthcare system and support health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.",

As part of the model, patients with different diseases are classified into three 'traffic light' groups based on the need for direct medical care and risk of COVID-19 infection. Patients who do not need to visit healthcare facilities are supported by remote consultation and drugs are delivered to them, often by village volunteers. Arrangements for patients who need to visit healthcare facilities are modified, considering the patient’s route and the need to maintain physical distancing. When more intensive care is required, services have been made safer for patients and health care providers–such as upgraded ventilation inside facilities.",

Altogether more than 40 public health experts are expected to provide surge support, working with national and provincial counterparts on key areas of the response. At the request of the South African government, WHO deployed the experts who will be embedded with the national response teams, working closely with local public health officials to address the country’s urgent COVID-19 challenges.",

          "Suriname is preparing to come out stronger from COVID-19. As the pandemic highlights the gaps in the country’s health system, the Government is acting quickly to drive its response, engaging partners, reaching remote communities through primary\n    health care and building a strong foundation for universal health coverage. About 90% of Suriname’s landmass is characterized as tropical rainforest. In the most remote villages reside indigenous communities who need access to effective primary health care. This is just one of the many challenges that Suriname’s health\n    system faces. COVID-19 has further highlighted its small health workforce: just eight physicians and 23 nurses per 10,000 people, health infrastructure that is still being developed and limited emergency response capacity, among others. UHC Partnership support for COVID-19 Since the start of 2020, WHO, through the UHC Partnership , has expanded its support in strengthening Suriname’s health system with the goal of helping the country achieve\n    universal health coverage. With funding from the European Union, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Irish Aid, the Government of Japan, the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, the UK Department for International Development and Belgium, the\n    Partnership has been supporting work in four main areas: saving lives, protecting health care workers, slowing the spread of the virus and strengthening epidemic intelligence. PAHO/WHO supported Suriname in advancing preparedness and response capacities. The Central Laboratory of the Bureau of Public Health/Bureau voor Openbare Gezondheidszorg (BOG) was provided reagents for molecular testing. Laboratory technologists were trained in conducting screening and confirmatory tests for COVID-19. This photo was taken in February 2020, before COVID-19 hit the country. (Credit: WHO/PAHO) Suriname’s experience in preparing for COVID-19 and its urgent actions to keep its population safe has also brought a unique opportunity to chart a new path for public health in the country. Looking forward, WHO will continue to support Suriname in building a resilient health system and to develop and maintain capacities to prevent, detect and respond to future outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics.

          "Ensuring access to health services is the cornerstone of a successful health response. Any verbal or physical act of violence, obstruction or threat that interferes with the availability, access and delivery of such services is defined as attack on health\r\n    care by the World Health Organization (WHO).",
          "As shown in the infographic below, the nature of attacks on health care related to COVID-19 varies greatly across contexts and can range from the use of heavy weapons targeting health facilities to the stigmatization of health care workers. Ultimately – whether they take the form of a cyber attack or a physical assault – they deprive people of urgently needed care, endanger health care providers, and undermine health systems.",
          "Impact on the response",
          "The COVID-19 pandemic has put some health systems under immense pressure and stretched others beyond their capacity. As such, responding to this public health emergency and successfully minimizing its impact requires every health resource to be leveraged.\r\n    Failure to protect health care in this rapidly changing context exposes health systems to critical gaps in services when they are most needed, and can have a long-lasting impact on the health and wellbeing of populations.",
          "In fragile and conflict-affected countries, acts of violence during the COVID-19 pandemic have already deprived hundreds of medical services and severely hindered the response. Among others, the bombardment and destruction of a 400-bed facility in Libya 1 (United Nations, 2020) further reduced the ability of health authorities and aid agencies to prepare for a full-blown epidemic.",
          "In other countries where attacks on health care have been noticed, the COVID-19 pandemic has sometimes created hostile environments for health care providers who have reported incidents of violence, discrimination and harassment. Stigmatized as vectors\r\n    of contagion in many countries, some have been assaulted, others were denied transport while commuting to work, and entire families were evicted from their homes. Furthermore, reports of attacks on medical vehicles carrying COVID-19 samples, on-duty\r\n    COVID-19 drivers as well as patients are accumulating and raising concerns worldwide.",
          "However, attacks on health care not only have a direct impact on the ability of health systems to deliver services to those most in need, but also take a heavy toll on the psychosocial health of patients, critical health care providers on the frontline\r\n    and their families. As those continue to be targeted by acts of violence during this public health emergency, health systems must – among other things – prepare for shortages of health care workers unwilling or unable to report to work\r\n    due to unsafe environments or obstruction in their personal lives.",
          "The role of stigma Acts of violence related to the COVID-19 pandemic take place against the backdrop of growing social stigma and discriminatory behaviours against anyone perceived to have been in contact with the virus. Health resources, patients, health care providers\r\n        and their family members are at particularly high risk of experiencing attacks due to the wrongful belief that they have become vectors of contagion in a community. COVID-19 misinformation plays an important role in shaping such beliefs and behaviours across the world. The ‘ infodemic ’ of false\r\n        information about the disease exacerbates fear of contagion, misconceptions and myths about the virus. Amid growing mistrust, health care providers increasingly come to be seen as a risk to communities rather than the solution to this public health\r\n        emergency. To illustrate, health care workers have reported being spat on, called ‘contagious rat’, assaulted after boarding public transports, having their belongings vandalized and their children discriminated against by their classmates. These attacks on health care speak to the importance of adequate risk communication at all levels of society to reduce fear, stigma and – ultimately – violence. How we communicate about COVID-19 is critical in supporting people to take effective action to combat the disease and protect health care. Responding to attacks During the pandemic, the international community, governments and civil society have taken the first steps to protect health systems by addressing attacks on health care as well as their roots. To stop attacks on vital infrastructure such as health facilities and water and sanitation systems, the international community has called for ceasefires in conflict-affected areas. Some national and local governments introduced new policies to protect\r\n        health care, including in India where perpetrators are punishable with prison terms up to 7 years. In Mexico, some cities have implemented dedicated transport services for health care workers after many were refused entry on public buses. Doctors’ associations across the world have also initiated talks with authorities to make their work environment safe from infections and to better protect health care providers outside the hospital. Through its Health Care in Danger initiative,\r\n        the International Committee of the Red Cross published a checklist for a safer COVID-19 response addressed\r\n        to managers of health-care services, individual practitioners and health policymakers. WHO and partners are also conducting communication and outreach campaigns at country-level to support governments in addressing attacks on health care. WHO, governments and the international community have also taken measures to address stigma around COVID-19. In addition to regular social media campaigns , the Government of the United\r\n        Kingdom and WHO launched the collaborative campaign ‘ Stop the Spread ’ to raise awareness about the dangers of misinformation\r\n        across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. WHO has also made available a COVID-19 risk communication package for healthcare facilities , as well as dedicated risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) guidance for countries, and a guide for governments, the media and local organization to prevent and address social stigma . WHO continues to collect information and data to improve our understanding of COVID-19 related attacks, inform its network of partners and document good practices. 1 United Nations (2020) Statement attributable to the Spokesman for the Secretary-General\r\n            on Libya [Press statement].

The ‘ infodemic ’ of false\r\n        information about the disease exacerbates fear of contagion, misconceptions and myths about the virus. Amid growing mistrust, health care providers increasingly come to be seen as a risk to communities rather than the solution to this public health\r\n        emergency. To illustrate, health care workers have reported being spat on, called ‘contagious rat’, assaulted after boarding public transports, having their belongings vandalized and their children discriminated against by their classmates.",
          "These attacks on health care speak to the importance of adequate risk communication at all levels of society to reduce fear, stigma and – ultimately – violence. How we communicate about COVID-19 is critical in supporting people to take effective action to combat the disease and protect health care."

          "Currently, the number of new cases is accelerating in the country and topped 100,000 in mid-July, which is wintertime in the Southern Hemisphere. Yet, public pressure is growing to continue opening up the country, already in recession before the pandemic\r\n    even started, and now facing a projected 7.3% contraction in GDP that could see 45% of the population living in poverty."

The country announced its first case on March 3, when a man in his 40s tested positive after returning to Buenos Aires from a trip to Milan.\r\n    Less than two weeks later, President Alberto Fernández decided to close the country’s borders for 15 days to non-residents, and shortly after, mandated a nationwide quarantine.",
          "“They pounced on it,” recalls PAHO/WHO Representative to Argentina, Dr Maureen Birmingham. “They were ready for the initial importation of cases and they’re really proud of that.”",
          "Prioritizing health may seem like a logical choice for some countries, but shutting down the country — and essentially, the economy — was seen as a risky move for a newly elected president presiding over a fragile economy. President Fernández\r\n    inherited an inflation rate of more than 50% and high sovereign debt, with a third of his country already living in poverty.",
          "Despite the challenging context, he showed that he did not believe in the false dilemma of choosing between health or the economy. He was convinced that saving lives was the more immediate imperative, so he led a decisive strategy to contain the pandemic\r\n    while preparing the health system, scaling up testing and tracing, and extending social protection measures to reduce socioeconomic hardship.",
          "At the same time, there was considerable community engagement to implement the measures, particularly given the COVID-19 situation at that time in Italy and Spain where many Argentines have strong family and cultural ties. In addition, the President valued\r\n    having a broad-reaching consultative process in place. Before each major decision, he first consulted with public health experts and established dialogue at the national level and with provincial governors, across political parties, with trade unions\r\n    and with actors in the private and public sectors. This helped ensure consistent, coherent communication from both national and local leaders, which contributed to the public´s understanding and acceptance of the lockdown measures.",
          "“They were a new government, having taken office in mid-December 2019 with a completely new structure and new people at all levels, and were just starting to familiarize themselves with their new job and each other when the pandemic hit,”\r\n    explained Dr Birmingham, who has worked in her role in Argentina for almost 5 years and through several leadership changes. “So one role PAHO/WHO played was to help rapidly bridge the gap in institutional memory from the previous administration\r\n    and serve as a neutral voice during the transition.”"

Of the remaining jurisdictions, roughly half were experiencing only sporadic cases (or no cases) and the other half were experiencing more\r\n    localized community transmission with some recent acceleration associated with the relaxing of quarantine measures.",

PAHO/WHO accompanied the government in the development and issuance of real-time guidance tailored to the Argentine context; helped\r\n    host webinars for relevant personnel from all provinces on key topics, including laboratory methods, surveillance, contact tracing, infection prevention and control; and provided training on tools to support the ramping up of health services.",

PAHO/WHO also helped develop specific protocols for high-risk populations, including older people, those with chronic conditions, as well as populations in vulnerable\r\n    situations.",

          "“This has clearly been a case of “learning-while-doing” in an exceedingly complex global supply and logistical situation for both the global consortium and the country,” said Dr. Birmingham. “Argentina had to make ultra-fast\r\n    decisions and payment when life-saving supplies and equipment became available or risk losing their chance to purchase it.”"

At this point, without\r\n    a vaccine, it is the only alternative to avoiding uncontrolled transmission, because continuous lockdown is not sustainable.”"

          "The National Center for Laboratory and Epidemiology (NCLE), Ministry of Health, with support from WHO, is enlisting the help of staff at local health centres and district health departments to monitor for outbreaks of respiratory illnesses. Leveraging the strength of local health workers to shore up its defences against COVID-19 is essential in a small country with relatively limited resources.",
          "NCLE, with support from WHO, has conducted tens of thousands of laboratory tests for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.",
          "At training sessions organized by NCLE and provincial health departments, with WHO support, community health workers learn how to identify and report signals of possible outbreaks immediately on a daily basis, are taught how to use a tool for monitoring and reporting incidents, and are trained on when and how to report potential warning signs to their local health centre or district hospitals.",
          "The training sessions will continue around the country for the next year and a half. In parallel, NCLE and its partners will follow up with provinces and districts where health workers have already been trained to monitor and support progress.",
          "The government also recognizes that crucial to community surveillance are religious leaders; monks engage with their communities every day, are respected role models and are influential in their communities, making them as well-placed as the health workers to spot signs of outbreaks.",
          "In April and May, several people who had recovered from COVID-19 were not accepted back into their local communities, requiring help from the authorities to resettle elsewhere. Monks are a powerful voice in combating this sort of stigma and discrimination, having previously worked for many years on fighting stigma against people living with HIV.",
          "The challenge for the Ministry of Health is empowering monks at community level with the right information and advice at the right time.",
          "On 23 and 24 July 2020, Chief Monks who lead temples in Vientiane Capital met with health officials to discuss community level action to prevent COVID-19 and combat the fear, stigma and discrimination outbreaks can bring, and coordination and collaboration between the government and the Buddhist community. Each day’s session was attended by 100 Chief Monks.",
          "It was organized by the Ministry of Health’s Centre for Communication and Education for Health, Lao Front for National Development and the Central Buddhist Fellowship with technical support from WHO and financial support from the United States via USAID."

          "The PAHO/WHO Representative in Colombia highlighted the historical advances taking place in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, with currently more than 200 experimental vaccines being developed, 24 of which are being tested on human beings and five in Phase III of their clinical testing. These results are part of our global initiative called \"Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator\", ACT-A , that seeks to accelerate global access to diagnostic tests, generate adoption of therapies for prevention and treatment, and develop, manufacture and distribute the COVID-19 vaccine.  As part of ACT-A, and in collaboration with GAVI, PAHO/WHO and other world partners created the COVAX Facility to guarantee fast and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for every country.",
          "The PAHO/WHO Representative explained that the PAHO Vaccines Revolving Fund can be used as a strategic tool for the purchase and distribution in the Americas of vaccines against COVID-19 when these become available. Member States will be able to benefit from the Organization's technical experience, as well as from its decades of experience in the safe distribution of vaccines.",
          "The Organization will also ensure that the process will be as inclusive as possible with an equitable distribution of vaccines among participant countries. The safety of vaccines is a serious matter and WHO has established a committee that will use established criteria, including safety, to help the prioritization of global investments in the development and procurement of vaccines."

          "In South Africa’s Wesfleur Hospital — a 50-bed public facility in the Western Cape, 25 miles north of Cape Town — staff are refashioning security booths into makeshift COVID-19 testing centers.",
          "Front windows are replaced with plexiglass, and two holes are made in the plastic to fit the arms of health workers performing nasal swabs.",
          "Think of a kiosk — with arms.",
          "COVID testing booth in Atlantis, South Africa",
          "“With COVID-19 being relatively unknown, staff were scared to do the swabbing of patients. Even with PPE [personal protective equipment], the fear remained,” said Dr. Earl Meyer, manager of medical services at the hospital. “Now, staff who were initially fearful are the ones conducting the most swabs.”",
          "Previously the country’s COVID-19 epicenter, the Western Cape is now approaching its peak . The area has more than 82,000 positive cases , or around 28% of the caseload in the country, which is home to the highest number of infections on the continent. A large number of these cases are concentrated in largely poor, Black townships , where residents live in crowded conditions with limited access to water and where unreliable internet or television access makes it difficult to receive information about the virus.",
          "At the same time, South Africa has a twin disease — the world’s largest HIV epidemic, with roughly 20% of adults (15-49 years) in the country living with the virus. An estimated 520,000 of those cases are in the Western Cape and also disproportionately affect Black Africans. The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS have warned that past gains made in the HIV response may be threatened during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "A six-month disruption to supplies of antiretroviral medicines, for example, could lead to an additional 500,000 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020-2021 and could also increase new transmissions from mother to child. Resurgence of HIV in patients when they are off their antiretroviral therapy could cause overall increased transmission of the virus. One early study from the Western Cape indicates that individuals living with HIV have a modest increased risk of dying from COVID-19 compared with HIV-negative patients, with less than 10% of COVID-19 deaths attributable to HIV. Noncommunicable diseases such as hypertension and poorly controlled diabetes posed the greatest risk of acquiring COVID-19.",
          "“Countries and their development partners must do all they can to ensure that people who need HIV treatment continue to access it,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We cannot let the COVID-19 pandemic undo the hard-won gains in the global response to this disease.”",
          "WHO has issued specific guidelines to help governments assist vulnerable populations, including those living with HIV, during the COVID-19 pandemic. One example is encouraging multimonth dispensing, which South Africa announced in May 2020 it would do by automatically extending antiretroviral medicine prescriptions for six- and 12-month periods. In addition to this guidance, WHO continues to supply South Africa with PPE — including gowns, masks and face shields — to help shore up supplies and protect frontline health workers who are treating both COVID-19 and HIV patients.",
          "Amid these challenges, Meyer and the Wesfleur Hospital team are bracing themselves for the peak of the novel coronavirus, which is expected any day now. Through their innovative testing booths, they have been able to screen thousands of people and increased COVID-19 testing in their area by more than 400%.",
          "The idea caught on. After Wesfleur started repurposing their security booths, other facilities in the Cape Town metropolitan area took note and started to procure similarly designed booths from the Department of Health.",
          "“At the time we introduced the modified outdoor booth, we had no in-patients related to COVID-19,” Meyer said. “Things have since changed dramatically. With our testing booth, we’ve established a very effective community testing site.”"

          "The Government of Rwanda is using drones to urge compliance with preventive measures against COVID-19 in densely populated, difficult-to-reach neighbourhoods and high-risk zones where many have not been respecting these measures. This lack of compliance was because community awareness teams could not access the areas.",
          "Drones equipped with cameras were therefore deployed to complement radio/TV messages, community health workers and other community leaders. The recorded footage allowed local authorities to closely monitor areas for the need for any intervention or evacuation that would normally take longer to identify and organize.",
          "Drones are just one part of Rwanda’s integrated national response to COVID-19.",
          "Even before it registered its first case, Rwanda formed a national crisis committee of key Ministries representatives, chaired by the Prime Minister, which put in place a COVID-19 Joint Task Force (JTF) to coordinate the implementation of a preparedness and response plan.",
          "Close to 2000 people from across sectors are working in different areas of interventions including epidemiology, dealing with surveillance, contact tracing, lab testing and case management, including psychological support. Other important supporting areas of intervention are risk communication and community engagement and planning logistics.",
          "Similar structures were established in all 30 Districts under the leadership of mayors. Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) were activated at district levels reporting on daily activities to the central level.",
          "The Rwanda Biomedical Center conducts tests by thousands. The laboratory started off with the capacity to test close to a thousand samples on daily basis but in four months ramped that up 15-fold by shifting to pool testing. The Government of Rwanda has set up several isolation sites and 10 treatment centers to offer treatment to confirmed cases.",
          "With the support of UNDP Rwanda and other donors, high-tech robots have been introduced at treatment centers to administer temperature checks, monitor patient status, and keep medical records of COVID patients. The use of robots is meant to minimize risk of infections among health care workers."

          "The virtual conference reviewed the ongoing response, identified multisectoral solutions and broad partnerships to effectively respond and control the spread of COVID-19 as well as developed an Action Plan for the next six months.",
          "The number of COVID-19 treatment facilities in the country has grown from one to 21. This has imposed a huge financial burden on the entire response, coupled with increasing expectations from front liners.",
          "Additionally, as resources are redirected to the COVID-19 response, routine health service delivery has been affected, with a noticeable decline in health facility utilization of nearly 40%. The proportion of fully immunized children has dropped by about 39%; maternal and neonatal health indicators have fallen significantly.",
          "Despite the concerted efforts by the Government and key donors to contain COVID-19, the number of confirmed cases continues to surge amidst meagre resources thus making it very challenging to effectively manage the response and sustain quality routine health care services.",
          "UN Resident Coordinator in Liberia, Mr. Kingsley Amaning, stressed the need for accountability and transparency in the management of funding, to ensure trust among  external investors and donors to the country. On behalf of all the UN Agencies, Dr. Peter Clement, WHO Country Representative in Liberia, thanked the Government of Liberia for convening the forum, and  emphasized the linkages between COVID-19 response and routine health services in a resilient health system.",
          "All speakers at the conference pledged their commitment to supporting the Government  and develop an action plan to enhance efficiency of COVID-19 response and recovery, as well as to ensure the continuity of quality essential health services for the population."

          "A nation well known for its safari destinations and natural beauty, Botswana is a small country of just over 2.3 million people. It boasts Africa’s oldest continuous democracy and is noted as an upper middle-income country. Botswana is located at the centre of Southern Africa, positioned between Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. One of the world’s poorest countries at independence in 1966, it rapidly became one of the world’s development success stories. With its economy built on a foundation of diamond mining, prudent fiscal policies and international financial and technical assistance, Botswana has now the fourth largest gross national income on the African continent and the highest Human Development Index of the continental Sub-Saharan region. Botswana spends at least US$466 per capita on health with only about 4% of the total health expenditures generated through out-of-pocket payments. This enables access to needed health services without significant financial hardships for a large proportion of the population. These achievements have undoubtedly assisted in Botswana’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite various challenges that persist.",

          "The central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan is a nation of just over 6.2 million, with a relatively young population: 67% of the total population is under age of 35, and 64% of the population is within the working age, ages 15 to 64. Kyrgyzstan has adopted successive reforms to transform its health system. This included the establishment of a single purchaser, the Mandatory Health Insurance Fund (MHIF), which pools funds at the national level to purchase a standardized package of services. The country was among the first former Soviet Union countries to shift from input‐ to output‐based budgeting. A reform of the service delivery model to promote family medicine practices and rationalize excess hospital capacity improved the efficiency of the system. Although the Government has prioritized health in their budget, Government spending on health amounts to only US$33 per capita and out‐of‐pocket payments remain high, representing 56% of current health spending. The spread of COVID‐19 can jeopardize the progress the country has made. Therefore, WHO and development partners continuously advocate to keep investing in preparedness and strengthening the health system against COVID‐19 to mitigate the broader socio‐economic costs of the pandemic.",

          "As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, people in all countries are being encouraged to take precautions to prevent transmission, including in many countries by staying at home and physical distancing. But a pandemic does not erase other diseases and their impact. While many services, including some health services, are being scaled back, the risk of further outbreaks of infectious diseases grows. The healthcare disruptions caused by COVID-19 could have a devastating impact on child mortality.",
          "In 2020 80 million children under one year of age, live in a country that has reported some kind of disturbance to the immunization programme largely due to limited access to health centres, low availability of PPE for healthcare workers and fear of contracting COVID-19. WHO is helping countries as they balance the threat of COVID-19 with the threat of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks and deaths that could result. With global and regional guidance, as well as by facilitating the delivery of essential health supplies, WHO is providing knowledge and assistance to immunization programmes worldwide, throughout a rapidly evolving situation.",
          "Here are some examples of how countries are working to achieve or maintain high vaccination coverage in the midst of the global pandemic.",
          "Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by COVID-19 was forced to repurpose much of its health-care personnel as COVID-19 cases mounted starting in late February 2020, However, wherever possible, the country’s regions and provinces maintained childhood immunization as part of the essential health services, prioritizing primary vaccine doses, while ensuring strict infection prevention and control measures, such as time slots and physical distancing in waiting rooms. The authorities also emphasized the importance of registering the children who had missed their routine doses and prioritizing them as soon as services were available again.",
          "In Syria , WHO and UNICEF supported a 5-day national immunization campaign in June to close vaccination gaps among children. During the campaign, with infection, prevention and control measures in place, health workers vaccinated more than 210 100 children and reviewed the vaccination status of 900 000 children to determine the vaccines they still needed",
          "Burkina Faso also conducted mass vaccinations in July, with a 4-day polio immunization campaign. Across two districts in the country’s Centre-East region, 174 304 were vaccinated against polio, in line with WHO guidelines and maintaining infection prevention and control measures.",
          "Credit: WHO Burkina Faso",
          "Across 39 countries and territories in the Americas, with lockdown restrictions easing, vaccination services that had been suspended in some countries are resuming. Vaccination services increased from 57% normal functionality to 79% in the same period. This was facilitated by using innovative approaches like mobile vaccination centres, drive through vaccinations, and vaccinating at schools and directly in homes.",
          "The risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases continues as the pandemic grows in many areas around the world. In January 2020, as Cambodia confirmed its first COVID-19 case, it also confirmed 84 cases of measles . 341 measles cases were recorded in Cambodia in the first four months of 2020.",
          "As COVID-19 has taken hold, it has been vital that immunization efforts against measles continue. As a result, mobile outreach teams have visited communities, giving catch-up vaccinations to children least likely to visit health centres and hospitals. In high-risk communities, health workers have gone door to door and boat to boat in order to administer lifesaving vaccines to the most vulnerable.",
          "Due to the ongoing work of the outreach immunization programme, communities are familiar with health workers and have developed trust in them. This has led to the same health workers providing COVID-19 guidance directly to communities that may not understand the complexities of the virus and what is needed to stay safe.",
          "Credit: WHO/Yoshi Shimizu",
          "After months of resilient work from outreach teams who safely continued immunization programmes during the pandemic, Cambodia saw fewer cases of measles recorded in May 2020 than in each of the previous months.",
          "Amidst challenges to resuming immunization services, there is encouraging news from the Maldives and Sri Lanka. The two countries were verified as having eliminated rubella, a vaccine-preventable disease, in early July. They are now the first two countries in the WHO South-East Asia region to eliminate both rubella and measles before the 2023 target.",
          "Countries across the South-East Asia region are making concerted efforts to resume disrupted immunization programmes with precautionary measures in place. National action plans on maintaining immunization services in the context of the COVID-19 transmission dynamics have been developed in all countries of the region. In Sri Lanka, health clinics have extended hours as one means to comply with physical distancing and have limited the number of children being served per hour. Health workers have been advised to vaccinate all children in a family needing vaccines in one visit if possible and to administer multiple catch-up vaccinations to each child according to vaccine-specific recommendations.",
          "Credit: WHO Bangladesh",
          "In the Rohingya camps in Bangladesh one of the world’s largest refugee camp with over 850 000 people living in extremely crowded conditions, maintaining critical health services among vulnerable populations is a priority. The immunization strategy for the camps is revised periodically to ensure vaccinations can continue despite fresh challenges to prevent outbreaks of other communicable diseases.",
          "A mass vaccination campaign with measles-rubella vaccine in Nepal that was halted mid-way in April was resumed in June with infection prevention measures in place.",
          "The world is in the midst of a pandemic. In continuing to administer vaccines whenever safely possible, countries are taking innovative steps to prevent a further burden on families and health systems that could be caused by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases."

          "The World Health Organization (WHO), working in partnership with both public and private sectors, has a proud history of vaccinology.",
          "By assessing vaccines for global supply, WHO’s groundbreaking Prequalification programme has made possible the deployment of quality-assured, safe and effective vaccines to dozens of countries across the world. This programme gives countries the security and confidence to know that vaccines being purchased meet WHO standards for safety, effectiveness and quality.",
          "The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), created by WHO in the 1970s, has, with the help of UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and others, brought lifesaving vaccines to hundreds of millions of children around the world. The immunisation programme is found in every country on the globe.  It has the farthest reach and deepest impact of any public health programme. WHO staff have supported governments and health professionals to deliver vaccines where they are needed on the ground. Its success is measured in millions of lives saved each year.  Through vaccination, smallpox has been eradicated and polio is on the verge of being defeated",
          "On constant alert, every year, WHO studies influenza trends, to work out which strains are emerging and should be included in the next season’s flu vaccine. And it continually monitors potential signals of pandemic threat.",
          "WHO estimates that in 2018 (the latest year for which estimates are available), 25,000 newborns died from neonatal tetanus, an 88% reduction the figure of 200,000 in 2000.",
          "Global HPV vaccine coverage is increasing. HPV vaccines had been introduced in 106 countries by the end of 2019, representing a third of the global population of girls.",
          "Today, 86% of the world’s children receive essential, lifesaving vaccines, increasing from around 20% back in 1980. This protects them and their communities against a range of infectious diseases, including measles, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B and polio. The number of children paralysed by polio has been reduced by 99.9 percent worldwide over the last three decades.",
          "This level of protection comes through a strong global effort to increase vaccine access and affordability, with support in recent decades from new partnerships like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance - focussing on expanding vaccine availability in the poorest countries - and the Measles & Rubella Initiative.",
          "Credit: WHO / Mark Nieuwenhof",
          "Innovative partnerships have also seen WHO help lead major cholera and yellow fever vaccination campaigns, and have also produced effective vaccines against meningitis and pneumonia, diarrhoea, and the world’s first-ever malaria vaccine currently being piloted in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi.",
          "Ebola",
          "We have known about Ebola since the 1970s, but the disease hit the headlines in 2014–2016 when an epidemic in West Africa killed more than 11 000 people. This epidemic triggered the first human trials of a vaccine against the disease and prompted changes in the way the world responds to outbreaks",
          "To tackle the threat of Ebola, one of the biggest priorities was to fund vaccine discovery, fast-track clinical trials, hasten regulatory approvals and enable manufacturers to produce and roll out an Ebola vaccine. From early testing to trials of the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine in Guinea in 2016 took the sum of ten months, a speed unprecedented at the time.",
          "The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) declared a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Bikoro in Equateur Province on 8 May 2018. Vaccination began on 21 May.",
          "“I just spent the day out with the vaccination teams in the community, and for the first time in my experience, I saw hope in the face of Ebola and not terror,” said WHO’s Dr Mike Ryan.",
          "When Ebola hit eastern DRCin August 2018 , the vaccine was used just days after the declaration of the outbreak. More than 300 000 people were vaccinated from August 2018 to March 2020, which helped to save lives and slowed the spread of Ebola.",
          "Credit : WHO / Lindsay Mackenzie",
          "As the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was not licensed, it was used under “compassionate use” as part of ongoing research studies. Those who volunteered to take part in the DRC study provided consent, and safety was monitored when they were followed up after vaccination. The results from the DRC vaccine studies confirmed that the vaccine is effective in preventing Ebola. The vaccine was licensed in the United States and Europe in late 2019. Earlier this year after WHO prequalified the vaccine, it was licensed in DRC and five other African countries.",
          "Meningitis vaccine for Africa",
          "Africa has also benefited from another innovative vaccine development. For more than 100 years, countries in sub-Saharan Africa were ravaged by widespread meningitis epidemics. During a severe epidemic 1996-1997 more than 250 000 cases and 2 ,000 deaths were reported across what is known as the “meningitis belt”, stretching from Senegal in the west, to Ethiopia in the east.",
          "With more than 450 million people at risk from meningococcal A disease, African ministers of health challenged public health experts and scientists to seek a new approach.",
          "WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and PATH recommended the development of a conjugate meningococcal vaccine for Africa that could meaningfully reduce the disease burden and eventually overcome the epidemics that came in waves. Clinical trials began in 2005 and were carried out in the Gambia, Ghana, India, Mali and Senegal. In June 2010, the vaccine received WHO prequalification. The first countries to introduce the vaccine – Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger – scaled-up activities relating to licensure, vaccine management, campaign planning and monitoring and management of adverse events following immunisation.",
          "The innovative and affordable vaccine was introduced in late 2010 and more than 300 million people living in the meningitis belt countries have since been vaccinated resulting in a dramatic decline, all but ridding these countries of this major cause of deadly epidemics.",
          "Looking forward",
          "The Ebola and meningitis vaccines are two of the most exciting developments in global public health in recent history. So too is the evolution of the routine immunization programmes that have so successfully halted the measles and polio outbreaks that once ravaged communities, killing and maiming young children. Pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines have been successful against some of the most common causes of pneumonia and diarrhoeal deaths. Innovative financing expedited the introduction of the pneumococcal vaccine, enabling it to be launched in 2011, in a world-first, in rich and poor countries simultaneously.",
          "Immunisation saves millions of lives every year. We now have vaccines to prevent and control 25 infections, helping people of all ages live longer, healthier lives. The wealth of experience accrued by WHO and its partners over decades is now being deployed to accelerate the development and distribution of vaccines against COVID-19, so that when we have a safe and effective vaccine, no one will be left behind. Vaccines remain the safest, most cost-effective protection against disease and will provide a powerful tool to address the COVID-19 pandemic."

          "A new WHO study on Ireland’s Sláintecare, a ten-year programme for health and social care reform, shows how important implementation of those reforms is to strengthening equitable access to health care and financial protection, building on steps already taken in response to COVID-19.",
          "The WHO report’s lead author, Dr Bridget Johnston from the Centre for Health Policy and Management at Trinity College Dublin, said, “This research is the first of its kind in Ireland. It shows how even low user charges are a barrier to access and lead to financial hardship for some households. Although the health system successfully protects many, there are clear gaps in coverage for the poorest people.”",
          "WHO’s analysis of survey data from 2009–2010 and 2015–2016 finds that although catastrophic spending on health in Ireland is low on average, reflecting one of the lowest levels of out-of-pocket payments in Europe, it has increased over time.",
          "These, and other gaps in coverage, were linked to cuts to public spending on health and to the health workforce, and several other measures taken after the 2008 financial crisis.",
          "Private health insurance covers around half of the population; although it reduces exposure to some out-of-pocket payments, it represents a significant financial burden for many people.",
          "In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the government has taken steps to address longstanding inequalities in access to health care, for example, providing universal access to testing, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 without charge and free teleconsultations for all COVID-related symptoms.",
          "Ireland’s new government can now build on these achievements by introducing universal entitlement to health care. The report outlines other progressive steps towards universal health care that can be made, many of them in keeping with the principles of Sláintecare, including that care should be provided free at the point of delivery, based entirely on clinical need."

The review used the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) tool, which consists of 19 technical areas including IHR communication and coordination, points of entry, surveillance, laboratory capacity and risk communication, to name a few. Experts made field visits to various sites. The government is commited to building up national capacities as a continuous process, tailored to the needs and priorities of the country, ensuring that all will be protected, particularly those potentially marginalized or vulnerable. WHO closely collaborates with health authorities, providing technical guidance and operational support to the country to maintain and enhance emergency preparedness and response capacities, including for COVID-19. The Ministry of Health and response agencies have acted quickly to COVID-19 and have implemented effective containment measures to find, test, isolate and treat cases and trace contacts. WHO stands ready to support their efforts. The JEE review results will help highlight the strengths and good practices of Brunei Darussalam’s health security systems."

          "Burkina Faso recently conducted its first mass polio immunization campaign since mass immunization was suspended in March to comply with COVID-19 physical distancing guidelines, vaccinating 174 304 children under five years of age in two districts while observing COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures.",
          "As immunization campaigns resume, WHO teams have developed guidance for frontline workers to ensure their safety and that of the children and their families. All vaccinators and health care workers involved have been trained on maintaining physical distancing while conducting vaccinations.",
          "The national COVID-19 Committee provided a total of 41 250 masks and 200 litres of hand sanitizers to the 2000 frontline workers who took part in the immunization campaign.",
          "Parents and caregivers expressed some hesitation to vaccinate their children for fear of contracting COVID-19, leading to a 10% drop in vaccination rates, according to WHO teams in the country. But waiting for the COVID-19 pandemic to be contained to resume immunization activities would have a detrimental effect on children’s health.",
          "The WHO African Region set up an inter-agency Rapid Response Team in September 2019 to mobilise responses to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks in the region within 72 hours. The programme’s teams have been working non-stop across the region to ensure that, in addition to supporting the COVID-19 response, they continue essential disease surveillance and planned for the eventual resumption of polio outbreak response.",
          "Plans include conducting three immunization campaigns in affected areas within three months, with the first round conducted within the first 14 days. The Rapid Response Team has succeeded in ending three outbreaks in Kenya, Mozambique and Niger."

The shipment, worth US$ 1.6 million, includes 9.5 tons of personal protective equipment (gloves, gowns, surgical masks, face shields, goggles), 10 PCR machines, 100 oxygen concentrator machines, 100 stretchers, 319 RNA extraction kits, micropippets, pippet tip filters, biosafety cabinet and other critical items. This latest WHO shipment will bolster efforts to keep frontline medical staff safe and improve testing capacity in the country. When the pandemic started there were no COVID-19 testing facilities in Afghanistan, but under the leadership of the Ministry, WHO has since established 11 testing laboratories with a total capacity to perform 2500 tests per day, with plans to put in place another 10 sites, according to WHO Representative in Afghanistan, Dr Rik Peeperkorn. Since February 2020, WHO has provided approximately US$ 4.2 million worth of COVID-19 supplies and equipment to Afghanistan for distribution based on need. An additional US$ 15.4 million worth of supplies and equipment are planned. WHO partners with the World Food Programme to source and deliver essential supplies for COVID-19 response to 135 countries."

          "The Governments of the United Kingdom and Canada have collaborated with WHO/PAHO to provide the Ministry of Health of Belize with various items worth US$271,135 to help the country prepare for a resurgence of COVID-19. The donated items consist mainly of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) that will primarily support infection prevention and control for healthcare personnel throughout the country. The government of the United Kingdom contributed US$169,035 towards the purchase of these PPEs, while Canada provided USD$80,000. PAHO was able to access USD$22,100 of WHO funding to complement the donation of the following PPEs: 41,400 Face Shields, 63,200 Respirators, 296,000 Medical Masks, 3,800 Goggles, and 11,100 Gowns. At the same time, the European Union (EU) has reallocated 500,000 Euros from the existing “Health Sector Support Programme Belize Project” that is being implemented jointly by PAHO and the Ministry of Health to Belize’s response to COVID-19. The funds will now go to: Improve the diagnostic capacity of the national laboratory network, by purchasing testing kits, equipment and supplies, and providing training on their use. Enhancing infection prevention and control with a focus on medical waste management for COVID-19 including purchasing of two autoclaves for Southern Regional Hospital and Corozal Polyclinic. Improving integrated healthcare at the community level through outreach services and strengthening human resource capacity in self-care and management, health promotion, and community engagement. The programme, co-financed by the EU with 6.8 million Euro, was originally conceived to strengthen the national health sector by improving health systems towards achieving universal health care for all while developing climate-friendly, energy-efficient, and disaster-resilient health facilities. Other activities of the programme will continue, such as strengthening the health system to provide essential health services as the prevention, control and treatment of non-communicable diseases and upgrading of six health facilities. PAHO/WHO Belize continues to work closely with the Ministry of Health and other agencies to support the fight against COVID-19 and to protect the most vulnerable, including frontline workers, healthcare workers, and the people of Belize."

          "The risk COVID-19 poses to public health in Yemen is unparalleled, pummelling a society and health system already weakened by over 5 years of ongoing conflict and vulnerabilities that existed before the war. Only half of the health facilities in Yemen are fully functional, and those operating are under severe shortages of essential equipment, supplies and medical staff. There is a huge lack of skilled health workers, and most health personnel have not received salaries for at least 2 years. Medical and paramedical staff lack training on case management, infection prevention and control and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to face COVID-19. None of this has deterred Dr Sami Al Hajj, a young doctor working at Science and Technology Hospital in Sana’ where he lives with his pregnant wife. After receiving calls and many messages on social media from people worried about the virus, Dr Sami printed a poster offering people in the community to stop him for a free consultation if they needed to and placed it at the back of his car. 30 people stop him each day, he says. He consults them  and refers them to the medical facilities where they can access medical support. WHO and aid agencies continue to ramp up COVID-19 response More than 16 million people are reached with awareness-raising activities, and support is given to  health workers across Yemen with over 227 500 PPE units. In addition, the United Nations has been providing living wages to 9000 frontline health care workers who would otherwise be unable to support their families due to the ongoing conflict. But an unprecedented financial gap faced by the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan threatens its ability to provide a living wage for over 10 000 health care workers who staff Yemen's functioning hospitals and health facilities. War, poverty, illness, family separation and now COVID-19 — coupled with a lack of access to basic services and employment opportunities — have also taken their toll on mental health. Generous and continuous support from the Government of Japan A new US$ 3 million contribution from the Government of Japan will give psychosocial support a fresh boost of support in health facilities in Yemen. It plays a critical role in supporting WHO’s humanitarian response in Yemen, with donations amounting to more than US$ 11.5 million between 2015 and 2020. This new funding  will help strengthen mental health governance and  will allow WHO to coordinate capacity-building, support and supervision work with health authorities. In 2019, WHO supported more than 14 000 mental health consultations, providing with its partners more than 90 000 psychosocial support sessions. 176 health facilities provided mental health and psychosocial support to those in need, including 47 hospitals, 63 health centres and 60 health units. In 2020, WHO requires US$ 234.4 million to continue delivering its life-saving programmes. To date, the funding gap at WHO remains above 90%."

All commercial flights were cancelled, and other options meant several days of travel, uncertainties and quarantines while crossing borders, and an increased chance of contracting COVID-19. “I was not content to start working on my new assignment from Oman. I am a person of duty,” she says of her desire to be physically present at her new post.",

Nine years of war and deep political division have taken a toll on Syria’s health care system. As of December 2019, according to WHO Health Resources Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS), only 50% of public hospitals run by Ministry of Health and Ministry of Higher Education reported fully functioning, 25% were partially functioning, and 25% were non-functioning."

          "Before leaving Oman and handing over her functions as WHO Representative there, Dr Magtymova followed the tradition for a farewell meeting with the people she had worked with for nearly 3 years. During her farewell the Minister of Foreign Affairs asked her how she planned to get to Damascus. “By camel route,” she replied, cheerfully, determined one way or another to get to her new post. The Minister of Foreign Affairs exchanged a glance with his  staff, she says, and shortly seats were secured on the only repatriation flight that was taking off the next day from Muscat to Beirut, to later reach her duty station of Damascus, by road.",
          "She packed all her belongings in storage but insisted on bringing one thing: the Turkmen carpet her mother had made for her some 50 years ago. “It’s my identity and refuge. It reminds me of my roots and values. It grounds my mind in an otherwise very volatile environment,” she says.",
          "When COVID-19 cases began spreading globally in February, Dr Magtymova made the difficult decision to cancel her long-planned flight from Oman to see her mother in her home country of Turkmenistan. Now she hopes this will be possible sometime later in 2020.",
          "“To see my mom, I first have to be sure the pandemic is under control,” she says of her duty to stop the international spread of COVID-19. “Every day I call my mom she asks, ‘When are you coming?’ I answer ‘I will, as soon as the fight with COVID is over,’” she says knowing she cannot risk infecting her mom and being stuck with the uncertain flight restrictions.",
          "For over 22 years, Dr. Magtymova has lived as a civil servant dedicating her time and energy to promoting global health and diplomacy for peace and sustainable development. Her work has placed her in her home country Turkmenistan, Lao PDR, India, Bangladesh, Maldives, DPR Korea, Yemen, Nepal, Oman, and now her 10th duty station of Syria. “My life is divided into many places and cultures, but my values are based on making choices for the collective good.”",
          "Dr Akjemal Magtymova during the virtual interview",
          "Dr Magtymova is a medical doctor and researcher in maternal medicine and human reproduction. She is also the mother of two children. Her mothering instincts combined with her medical and diplomacy studies make her uniquely qualified to care for the people of Syria. “Safety and wellbeing of my staff is my top priority and a prerequisite for our top performance at times of need,” she says. Magtymova is seeking out a separate room in their hotel to function as a kitchen in case they are forced into quarantine. “I’m trying to establish a home for my staff in the hotel – home to all UN international staff residing in Damascus.” Two texts messages from close friends – WHO colleagues - had woken her that morning announcing the death of loved ones due to COVID-19. “I share personal experiences and testimonies with my colleagues to encourage them to remain healthy and determined.”"

          "When Dr. Magtymova arrived in Syria, she was struck by how little people of all social and educational backgrounds recognized the seriousness of COVID-19. There was little compliance to social distancing or other measures. She started to invest efforts, immediately upon her arrival, to work with country representatives of UN agencies to follow the WHO recommended measures for prevention of COVID-19. She believes all UN staff in Syria would be example for compliance with these recommendations.",
          "\"Overall, there is little recognition of the seriousness of COVID-19 in this country it seems. The risk communication messages sent via media have not reached people in such a way that they would adopt the recommended behaviours. After nine years of war, the sentiment here is that Syrians are strong and may be immune to disease.”",
          "This sentiment persists despite the effort made to educate Syrians on COVID-19. WHO and UNICEF have collaborated extensively to enhance risk communications and community engagement by conducting awareness training, providing more than 50 interim guidelines and disseminating more than 620,000 information education and communication materials. Some 12 million people have been reached by television and radio awareness campaigns and printed information materials. Over six million people were reached through social media – platforms that partners continue to actively utilize for awareness raising.",
          "However, compared to war and starvation (9.3 million people in Syria are now considered food insecure, an increase of 1.4 million in the past six months), the pandemic seems benign to many Syrians. This wrong impression, Dr Magtymova surmises, may be due to the few number of COVID-19 cases detected and announced so far by the Ministry of Health. As of the 19th of June, there were 178 confirmed cases (rural Damascus being the highest affected) and seven deaths.",
          "These small numbers are partly due to Syria being a country less open to international travelers, but mainly a result of its laboratory testing and local surveillance capacities. The low incidence rate of COVID-19 in Syria (0.9/100 000) may be due to the low testing rate of 33 per 100 000. For WHO to provide epidemiological evidence for the WHO generated predictions to support MOH risk management messages, Dr Magtymova says, “We need more data, and our first step is to strengthen testing capacity.”",
          "11 June 2020, A 22-ton, second batch of the shipment of emergency survival and trauma medical supplies has landed in #Damascus , in collaboration with WFP. These supplies have reached secondary level health facilities in North-East Syria.",
          "While she argues that command and control work better in emergency response situations (like a global pandemic), she acknowledges the delicate balance between protecting the economy and introducing public health measures. “It becomes an ethical dilemma.” she shares. The lesson to be learned during the pandemic, she asserts, is the importance of government and global community policies to ensure universal health coverage, adequate funding, and equal allocations for preparation and response to public health emergencies.",
          "Upon arrival in Damascus she realized that both leaders in the UN and blue-collar Syrians were experiencing difficult times in the wake of the pandemic. They grieved the loss of routine and purpose. They also wanted to help."

          "Dr Magtymova, as the WHO Representative, has to identify and prioritize needs, set standards, assign tasks, and coordinate support. Many UN agencies are enthusiastic to be a part of the COVID-19 response in Syria. For example, WHO provides technical leadership to UNICEF working on risk communication and community engagement in Syria to help slow the rate of transmission. Since over half of positive COVID-19 cases are among Syrians returning home from other countries, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) plays an important role by supporting the authorities neighboring countries to set up quarantine facilities following WHO standards and WFP helps by providing food distribution.",
          "Dr Magtymova meets with humanitarian aid donors to understand their interests and what restrictions they face. Many suppliers associate Syria with sanctions, she says, so they are less likely to invest unless they understand the situation. She listens to their different perspectives in a highly politically complex environment while remaining neutral and independent.",

          "“Especially in the context of Syria, where the state is fragile, systems are disrupted, the economy is worsening, and people’s vulnerabilities continue growing with the impact of COVID-19, coordinated support from all is paramount to defeat the public health emergency and save lives and livelihoods,” says Magtymova. WHO has provided the Ministry of Health and health sector partners (UN, Syrian Red Crescent and national institutions as well as local NGOs) with essential supplies that are in high demand. To date, almost 1 million pieces of personal protective equipment for health care workers has been delivered, along with intensive care beds, and 27 ventilators. Professional and personal life – it is not either or but both In addition to her demanding work as a civil servant, Dr Magtymova works to balance her roles as wife, daughter, and mother. “For women in senior positions in the UN it is a challenge to strike a balance between family, marriage, and work”, she says. Her children, who live in Toronto, are 25 and 29 years old. And for over 14 years, she and her husband, a former military officer and former UN civil servant, have had to live apart. She thinks of her son and daughter and of her husband who are far away caught in different continents and who have always been her anchor, support and inspiration. “It’s time I feel to be together with the family because I don’t know how long…,” she says. Her voice trails off as emotion overcomes her. “Despite being apart, my husband and my family have been always by my side, providing support and care to help me to stand by my choice of serving others and remaining in active duty. Humanity needs the public health workforce more than ever,” she continues, “Look at my short grey hair,” she smiles, “I don’t mind. Keeping it like that is one way to optimize my time and stay in action. I am only one among many staff on the ground and I know what it is to accomplish a global mission. Now, my Organization is on the frontline fighting COVID-19. I am part of that and proud to be able to help the country and the region”. Read more about WHO’s response to COVID-19"

          "WHO Kenya will use KES 270 million (2,573,105 million euros) grant from the EU Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations department (ECHO) to boost the Government of Kenya’s efforts to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "WHO Kenya will train frontline health workers at national and county levels and strengthen the COVID-19 rapid response and clinical teams across all Kenyan counties.",
          "It will also be used to support risk communications and community engagement activities in identified as hot spots.",
          "Strategies include airing of messages in local languages on radio stations, TV, digital and other information platforms, engaging community leaders and the public in order to change individual behaviour, and building the capacity of health workers as they support the community response to the pandemic.",
          "Through the Ministry of Health, WHO is capitalizing on 21 community radio channels throughout the country to relay COVID-19 messages and conduct debates and discussions on the disease and its spread.",
          "A recent survey by the Kenya Bureau of Standards found that 100% of the country’s population had heard of COVID-19 and the safety messages from the government and partners, with 82% of them hearing it on the radio.",
          "Armed with these messages, Maasai elder Julius Oloiboni mobilized his semi-nomadic community to set up handwashing stations in their makeshift village, stop family members from interacting with each other, and stopped all movement out of the villages except for the cattle herdsmen.",
          "In Kawangware informal settlement in the capital Nairobi, Judy Emeza and her three children stood in a long line for a COVID-19 test, having heard through the radio about a free mass testing campaign in her neighbourhood, while  health promotion officer Beatrice Lugalia counters myths, allays fears and encourages testing through community visits and radio programmes.",
          "Along Kenya’s long, porous boundary with other countries, remote communities are not hesitating to support the work of the public health authorities. For instance, people are calling to report family members who have crossed from Somalia on trade missions and have tested positive for COVID-19. Along the border with Tanzania, several communities prohibited cross-border movement among themselves before the government formally closed all borders.",
          "The funding from the EU will allow additional technical personnel to be deployed to the counties to support training, rapid response, clinical and communications activities.",
          "The grant comes at a critical time as the country is dealing with community transmission and needs urgent response measures to stop further spread",
          "The current grant is part of 30 million euros that the EU has provided to the WHO in response to its Global Appeal to combat COVID-19 across the world, while EU Member States have already provided more than KES 3.3 billion (EUR 30 million)."

          "Cross-border trade here is worth about 100 billion baht (US$ 3.2 billion) a year.",
          "Given sustained low numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Thailand in recent weeks, Thai authorities have been examining the possibility of reopening the border.",
          "A joint team of specialists from World Health Organization (WHO), Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health and International Organization for Migration for Asia and Pacific recently visited this and another Thai-Cambodian border checkpoint, Ban Laem, in Chantaburi province, to assess the preparedness and response to the virus threats there and identify any gaps that their agencies and development partners could fill.",
          "The team confirmed that the border screening, health advising and quarantine were well-organized, as were coordination and cooperation among the agencies involved in border affairs, including health, customs, immigration, border police, tourism police, disaster prevention and mitigation office, and military.",
          "But it noted that the health information card  that border-crossers needed to fill out collected information on other major communicable diseases, but was not designed specifically for COVID-19. Also, the limited number of border health staff on this checkpoint meant that records were not computerized, making it difficult to do effective tracing.",
          "Several basic challenges had to be overcome if the border crossings were to be reopened safely, the joint team said.",
          "When and how the border reopens would depend on the situation in the two countries. Improved cross-border information exchange on the COVID-19 situation would help authorities manage a challenging situation. WHO’s International Health Regulations mechanism for rapid information sharing and local-level border health collaboration could be employed to ensure that the risk of COVID-19 crossing the border is as low as possible."

          "Beyond the COVID-19 response, ensuring that the most vulnerable population have access to and use critical healthcare services is a priority for WHO. The immunization strategy in the camp is being revised to ensure vaccinations continue in order to prevent another potential communicable disease outbreak. WHO also continues to monitor the risks of water borne and vector borne diseases and support partners in prevention and management activities.",

          "Five months since the first positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Kerala, the Indian state of 35 million people reported 4189 cases of COVID-19 as of 30 June 2020 and 23 deaths, with an impressive recovery rate of 51.7%. The state government’s prompt response to COVID-19 can be attributed to experience and investment made in emergency preparedness and outbreak response in the past, notably after severe flooding in Kerala in 2018 and a Nipah virus outbreak in 2019. The state used innovative approaches and its experience in disaster management planning. Active surveillance, setting up of district control rooms for monitoring, capacity-building of frontline health workers, risk communication and strong community engagement, and addressing the psychosocial needs of the vulnerable population are some of the key strategic interventions implemented by the state government that kept the disease in control. Early release of technical guidelines on contact tracing, quarantine, isolation, hospitalization, infection prevention and control, and extensive capacity-building for all cadres of health and other interlinked departments played a critical role in managing the situation. WHO had been a long-standing partner in the field of public health and  WHO officials were part of the response at state and district level. WHO field officials previously supported the Government in strengthening disease surveillance in the private sector during the 2018 Kerala floods. Experience and lessons learned from those experiences have proved very useful as the same team continued to support the COVID-19 response and were committed to working with the Government of Kerala in its fight against the disease. The WHO India office also coordinated with the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research, and Indian Society of Clinical Research to organize a webinar on Ethics Review of Biomedical Projects during a pandemic, focused on the need for quality research outcomes and adopting new research methodologies to respond to humanitarian emergencies. The webinar brought together 400 key stakeholders, including ethics committee members, clinical research and healthcare professionals, patients, patient representative groups and students. Experts from the  WHO Country Office in India reiterate that conducting research on new medications or vaccines during a pandemic was essential, and research ethics committees needed to be prepared to review research projects in a time-bound manner."

          "What is AMR?",
          "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites) are exposed to antimicrobial drugs (such as antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, antimalarials and anthelmintics). The microorganisms fight for survival by mutating or acquiring defence genes from other microorganisms. As antimicrobial drugs get stronger, and their use more widespread, bacteria’s resistance to antibiotics gets stronger and more widespread too, which can lead to untreatable bacteria, known as “superbugs”.",
          "How does AMR spread?",
          "Many people think that AMR is primarily caused by overuse of antimicrobial drugs, but environmental factors may cause the spread of AMR even more than the use of antimicrobials, especially in developing nations with limited access to clean water, poor sanitation and rudimentary waste management. This exposes people to frequent and preventable contact with faecal matter, which can host millions of resistant genes and bacteria, including potentially untreatable superbugs. Waterbodies polluted with resistant genes, bacteria and antimicrobial compounds from human and animal faeces and antimicrobial manufacturing are also an ideal environment for superbugs to emerge and spread,",
          "So while using fewer antimicrobial drugs – in humans, animals and plant life – is critical to reducing resistance, it’s also vital to improve hygiene, provide safer water and sanitation, and better wastewater treatment on a global scale, or resistance could continue to increase, potentially creating the next pandemic.",
          "How is WHO responding to AMR?",
          "The response to AMR has been spearheaded through the One Health Global Action Plan, developed by WHO in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).",
          "The 5 objectives of the Global Action Plan on AMR are to:",
          "1. improve awareness and understanding of AMR communication, education and training",
          "2. strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research",
          "3: reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures",
          "4: optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health",
          "5: develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.",
          "Because the many contributing factors of AMR vary greatly, WHO urged member countries to come up with their own national action plans. But WHO has found that WASH and wastewater management and improvement actions continue to be underrepresented in these plans. So, to encourage the implementation of WASH and wastewater management to reduce the spread of AMR, WHO has released a new technical brief summarizing the evidence and rationale for WASH and wastewater actions within AMR national action plans and sector-specific policy to combat AMR.",
          "What are the new recommendations?",
          "WHO’s new technical brief details 6 areas with evidence and actions to improve WASH and wastewater for AMR national action plans:",
          "1. Coordination and leadership",
          "Ensure WASH and wastewater management is included in national AMR policies and plans and support implementation of multilateral actions across the health, water, sanitation, animal, plant and industrial sectors.",
          "2. Households and communities",
          "Ensure universal access to safely managed water and sanitation services and increase wastewater and sludge treatment and safe reuse.",
          "3. Health care facilities",
          "Ensure universal access to safe water supply and sanitation, proper hygiene practices and health care waste management in health care facilities to support infection prevention and control.",
          "4. Animal and plant production",
          "Improve hygiene and wastewater and sludge management in food production, and where possible, minimize the use of antimicrobials and other chemical supplements in livestock, aquaculture and plant production operations.",
          "5. Manufacturing of antimicrobials",
          "Reduce releases of antimicrobials into waterways from antimicrobial manufacturing by encouraging cooperation across public and private sectors to enhance efforts to reduce pollution throughout the supply chain.",
          "6. Surveillance and research",
          "Advance knowledge on WASH and wastewater causes of AMR by raising awareness among politicians and health officials of the importance of all WASH and wastewater management actions to fight AMR; strengthening surveillance and identifying primary sources and transport of antimicrobials and antibiotic resistant genes in different locations and sectors through a One Health lens; and reviewing existing policies and plans to determine their feasibility and cost effectiveness to address priority risks.",

While the global standard for health care workers is 25 per 100 000 people, Somalia only has 2 health care workers per\r\n 100 000 people. With only 15 ICU beds for a population of more than 15 million,\r\n    it is listed among the least prepared countries in the world to detect and report epidemics, or to execute a\r\n    rapid response that might mitigate further spread of disease.",
          "In January, WHO began pre-positioning enough PPE to treat 500 patients and\r\n organizing trainings for health care workers. The local team quickly took nasopharyngeal swabs from four Somali students returning\r\n from China, and sent them off to the Kenya Medical Research Institute to be tested. One of the results — from a 26-year-old male — came back positive, indicating the country’s first official case of the virus on 16 March 2020.",

With the health ministry under scrutiny, the WHO Somalia team assumed an even larger role, leading the charge against COVID-19.",

Contact tracing, an essential tool in tracking the possible spread of disease, is difficult in remote areas. Health care workers must  travel through unforgiving terrain, braving\r\n    heavy rainfall and the threat of violence. In late May, following a spate of clashes between state security and Al-Shabaab insurgents, seven health workers from a local aid organization were kidnapped and\r\n killed in a Somali village.",

Others do not self-isolate — either because they are living in crowded conditions and are not able to, or they simply do not follow directives — and continue\r\n    to affect family and community members. Patients often do not go to the hospital until it is too late.",

The country has had 2 416 cases of COVID-19 and 85 deaths ,\r\n with the majority of these deaths falling between the ages of 60 to 70. Many of these patients are not recovering because of a lack of oxygen in the country’s health facilities. WHO Somalia purchased three oxygen machines to fill the gap.",

They’re advising on when to ease lockdown restrictions, and sharing modelling techniques and data-driven thinking\r\n    needed to take informed decisions. This also includes making sure that other life-saving services such as polio surveillance continue.",

          "Without this help, Somalia will remain captive to the virus — and that is a risk the international community should not be willing to take. As UN Secretary-General António Guterres continues to remind us ,\r\n an increasingly interconnected world means that, “we are only as strong as the weakest health system.”",
          "So far, WHO has helped train more than 4 000 community health care workers in proper handwashing techniques and hygiene, identifying suspected cases, and effective contact tracing. Last month alone, community health workers visited more than 300 000 households;\r\n    more than 6 500 samples were tested in the three laboratories; and more than 10 000 sample collection kits were distributed to federal member states in Somalia.",

This allows the continuation of regular activities such as immunization, consultations for individuals with noncommunicable disease, medication dispensation and other activities.",
          "Centers from Lebanon’s PHC  network have initiated screening for COVID-19 following training conducted by the Order of Nurses, in collaboration with the PHC department at the Ministry of Public Health. Staff working in PHC centres started screening for COVID-19 using a triage questionnaire prepared by the Order of Nurses in line with WHO recommendations. Since early March 2020 the PHC centers have been equipped by UNICEF with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).",
          "Another critical aspect of Lebanon’s COVID-19 surveillance system is contact tracing. It is a main pillar of the national COVID-19 surveillance system, through field investigation to identify people exposed to contacts of confirmed cases, combined with rapid deployment of health response teams for COVID-19 testing and daily follow-up over phone. Contact tracing and follow up can be done in Lebanon through a mobile application developed by the Ministry of Public Health.",

The third shipment that arrived on 20 June 2020 is a joint initiative of the United Nations and Switzerland, to deliver materials originally provided by WHO/PAHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, IOM and other humanitarian organizations. All three shipments included medicines, medical supplies, personal protective equipment for health workers, water purifying tablets, water tanks, hygiene kits and nutritional support packages, as well as sanitation and hygiene, nutrition and education materials. The supplies are  distributed in prioritized hospitals, health centers and among the most vulnerable communities.",

UN representatives are grateful to the Government of Venezuela for having facilitated the arrival of this important shipment, and to the Government of Switzerland for transporting these supplies that help save lives.

Through the program frontline health workers conduct house-to-house surveys for the identification of all SARI and ILI cases along with Japanese Encephalitis (JE), dengue, malaria and fever cases. Of the 4552 samples collected and tested since the 7 May programme launch, two COVID-19 positive cases were identified.

          "Since the start of the pandemic WHO has consistently supported the hard-hit Islamic Republic of Iran in its response to COVID-19 with multiple shipments of essential supplies. Most recently, on 20 June, WHO delivered a shipment of COVID-19 laboratory test kits to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The kits, which are based on PCR technology, are considered the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. Two days before, WHO had also delivered laboratory supplies to the National Polio Laboratory. WHO also provides trainings for the National Polio Laboratory staff, and evaluates the performance and proficiency of the laboratory on an annual basis. Earlier on 16 June 2020, WHO delivered 2200 vials of remdesivir (a broad-spectrum antiviral medication) to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. The medication is to be used for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 within the framework of the Global Solidarity Trial, a multinational project launched by WHO to find an effective treatment for the disease. Islamic Republic of Iran has been an active participant in the trial since its initiation on 23 March 2020. Also, WHO delivered earlier in June 2020 two shipments of supplies, chiefly personal protective equipment (PPE), to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. PPE, including surgical masks, gowns, and gloves, were distributed to frontline healthcare facilities."

          "Fighting at borders is making Libya’s response to COVID-19 particularly challenging. WHO has urged all armed groups in Libya to allow humanitarian agencies to obtain access to health care facilities on the ground, especially in the south, to help combat the recent surge in cases of COVID-19. The majority of cases are in Sebha municipality in the south, a major hub on the migration route from Africa to Europe.",
          "Most of the 24 000 people displaced in recent weeks due to fighting are living in overcrowded conditions that allow for the easy spread of the virus. In addition, the country’s health system is near collapse, with three quarters of Primary Health Care Clinics not functioning due to shortages in medical staff, supplies, medicine, and equipment. These shortages have made it difficult to assess the true impact of COVID-19 on the population. With so few early detection sites functioning right now, infections can go undetected for weeks, allowing COVID-19 to spread easily within communities. WHO is working with health authorities and partners to enhance disease surveillance and monitoring and deliver critical supplies to support the response to COVID-19. WHO has delivered laboratory equipment, test kits and personal protection equipment (PPE) to the health authorities for distribution throughout the country. Ms Elizabeth Hoff, WHO Representative in Libya, says, “It is essential that medical aid reach the most vulnerable communities displaced by fighting and people who face the twin horrors of conflict and pandemic. Unfettered access to health care is a human right, now more than ever.”",
          "Another pressing concern presently is the of access to  vaccination services  due to the pandemic . Of the US$ 3.3 million requested to support Libya during the pandemic, WHO has received US$ 2.95 million in contributions and firm pledges from China, the UK, France, Canada, Norway and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.",

          "World Refugee Day was celebrated in countries across the globe on 20 June 2020. Established in 2001 by the UN, nations have since celebrated this day to raise awareness about the challenges refugees face and are taking steps to ensure their protection and needs are addressed. During a pandemic, refugees may experience a health, socioeconomic and protection crisis. Because many live in crowded conditions and lack access to hygiene and sanitation facilities, their health is at risk. Many suffer from a loss of income and lack access to social protection. Due to border restrictions and suspended asylum requests imposed by many countries, refugees lack legal protection. An increase in xenophobia and racism during the pandemic also threatens refugees.",
          "While refugees and migrants often live in conditions that may increase vulnerability to COVID-19, they also play key roles in efforts to fight the pandemic. They contribute to their host societies during the pandemic by working in the health sector, assisting as cultural mediators and translators, producing personal protection gear, forming volunteer groups to help the most vulnerable in their communities and creating art and music to promote messages of hope and solidarity.",
          "Ahmed Ahmed is one example of a refugee who put his medical skills to work. Trained as a nurse in Aleppo, Syria, Ahmed now works at a migrant health centre in Izmir, Turkey as part of the contact tracing team helping patients recall everyone whom they had been in close contact with during the time they were infectious. He also works as a translator when interviewing Arabic-speaking patients. “Being able to communicate without language barriers and in a non-judgmental way is of the essence during contact tracing, especially as identifying possibly infected individuals is a time-sensitive matter – the sooner people are identified, the fewer people are at risk,” says Ahmed.",
          "WHO recently announced a closer collaboration with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The organizations work side by side to ensure that preparedness, prevention and public health response measures to COVID-19 reach refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced people and those who are stateless. By joining forces, both organizations will be able to better utilize resources and reinforce public health solutions on the ground.",

In a smoke-filled room inside, a woman cooks green fruits on a charcoal stove and crushes them into a black powder to treat hernia. In the three-bed clinic next door, patients can choose to be treated with plant remedies or with modern medicine by nurses who are trained in both.",
          "When Ebola erupted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s northeastern Ituri and North Kivu provinces, traditional practitioners in small clinics such as this were the first port of call for many who fell ill in rural communities. While it was the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s 10 th outbreak of the disease, it had never been seen in this part of the country before. Most traditional healers did not triage patients or have basic protection for themselves or their patients. Infection prevention and control was next to nothing. The virus was passed from patient to healer and on to the next patient, with disastrous effects on the mortality rate.",

Messages are better received when coming from someone in the same community who speaks the same language and understands cultural expectations.",

A call centre, messages disseminated through 17 radio stations in several towns and thousands of posters complement the house-to-house health education drive launched in May 2020. The community approach is also an effective way of combatting rumours and disinformation, says Djazouli Ibn Adam, who heads the health promotion division at the Ministry of Health. The involvement of members of the communities  “inspires confidence among families and makes it easy to relay messages and gather information from households,” says Mr Adam.",

The initial phase of the COVID-19 mortality surveillance is starting in Juba (where the highest number of cases have been reported) and then will be applied in other locations outside Juba.",

Therefore, the Ministry of health with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, has intensified community engagement interventions to stop the outbreak in the communities. District Task Forces (DTF) have been set up in all districts to spearhead the response at the community level. DTFs have developed or updated risk communication plans to help guide districts on how to respond to pandemic and how to mobilize resources and partner support. DTF members also mobilize citizens at the sub-county level. There they participate in radio talk shows, supervise the translation of information materials into the local language and participate in community dialogue sessions. Sub-county teams work to develop community engagement by conducting home visits, distributing IEC materials, advising people on physical distancing and conducting regular community meetings. The Community Based Disease Surveillance (CBDS) system has also played a major role at Ugandan borders to detect and track COVID-19 cases. Community-based work is the strategic focus of Uganda and its partners in their fight against COVID-19.",

The system is available in English, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi and Bengali. Tarassud Plus offers patients access to medical hotlines and support staff who direct them to facilities where they can be treated for their reported symptoms. Once patients are diagnosed, a medical tracking bracelet connected to the application ensures that they stay at home for the duration of their quarantine or isolation. In the future, coronavirus positive patients may be prevented from entering crowded areas like markets. The epidemiological data collected via Tarassud Plus (monitored through a round-the-clock Center of Operation Management in the capital of Muscat) helps medical officials track the spread of the virus and risk-stratify suspected cases.",

The training was designed to help participants provide relevant answers to their listeners in order to fight against rumors and erroneous information that sometimes circulate\r\nin communities. Participants were reminded of their important role to persuade the public to adhere to the observance of the measures recommended by the experts and government to control COVID-19 in Burkina Faso. Depending on their objectives, participants\r\nchose from a series of presentations that addressed issues to help them serve as able communicators in the fight against COVID-19 through their media outlets. Experts from the Ministry of Health and WHO Risk Communications and Community Engagement\r\nteams facilitated the training and were available to answer questions. As a recognition of the training’s value, participants have since requested experts from WHO to help them lead interactive programs on issues related to COVID-19 that are\r\nof highest interest among Cameroonian radio audiences.",

          "14 th June was celebrated across the globe as World Blood Donor Day.  The theme for this year’s World Blood Donor Day is “Safe blood saves lives” with the slogan “Give blood and make the world a healthier place.” This year Papua New Guinea joined the international community in celebrating blood donors and promoting the importance of safe blood donation. Dr Luo Dapeng, WHO Country Representative in Papua New Guinea, says, “Blood donation is even more essential during the Coronavirus pandemic, where people may be less inclined to donate blood.” Currently, there is no evidence anywhere in the world that coronavirus or other respiratory viruses can be transmitted through blood transfusion. Donating blood during a time of social isolation is now more than ever a symbol of unity and generosity. Papua New Guinea’s Sir Brian Bell Centre for Transfusion Medicine blood bank at the Port Moresby General Hospital has instituted new safety precautions during the pandemic. Physical distancing and hygiene measures are in place, including screening of donors, wearing gloves, and wiping down surfaces after every donation. If you are a healthy individual between 18 and 60 years of age, weigh at least 50kg (if male) or 45kg (if female) and have good blood pressure, you can donate blood.",

          "Namibia received high praise from other governments and WHO for its success in quickly containing and stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. Since the first two cases were reported on 13 March 2020, Namibia has had no COVID-19 related deaths and only diagnosed 34 cases. The President of the Republic of Namibia, Dr Hage Geingob, took prompt action by declaring a State of Emergency; closing all international borders, schools, universities and business; and locking down all 14 regions. The Namibian military set up a medical facility at the airport as part of the country’s preparedness. This proved to be particularly important considering almost 87% of the cases were imported with no reported community transmission as most cases are from travellers held in quarantine facilities. WHO and the Centre for Disease Control provided extensive technical support for the two COVID-19 treatment units on 5 June 2020 at the Windhoek Central Hospital and other units built around the country.",
          "Namibia’s response also included educating outbreak preparedness and response teams and staff from public and private health facilities. Together with the Ministry of Health and Social Services, WHO provided a virtual training to help prepare regions to efficiently respond to the pandemic. The training educated participants on a variety of topics including coordination, surveillance, points of entry, rapid response teams, laboratory case management and infection prevention and control, risk communication and community engagement and mental health. The following Ministries and partners were involved in the design and implementation of the online training; Office of the Prime Minister, Ministry of Health and Social Services, Ministry of Defense, WHO, CDC, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNDP, University of Namibia,  Namibia Institute of Pathology, Namibia Statistics Agency, Ministry of Agriculture Water and Land Reform, City of Windhoek and Namibia Airports Company. The training attracted close to 1000 participants from government, academia and civil society organizations. A second phase of the training is envisaged which will include simulations and more practical sessions targeted at different front-line health workers in regions and districts.",

The donation promotes and acknowledges the role women’s activities play in the fight against COVID-19. WHO Representative in the Congo, Dr. Lucien Manga, said that it would serve  to revitalize and give courage to women’s cooperatives helping their nation battle the pandemic. Since 18 May, all people in open and closed places in the Congo have been obligated to wear a mask, so this donation of mask-supplies is particularly timely and helpful.",

The workshop, based on the use of molecular technology to detect and diagnose Covid-19, was held at the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference of the Mexican Ministry of Health, with financial and technical support from WHO/PAHO. Along with technical training, the Guatemalan representative also received 500 molecular tests.  Today, as one of the strengthened capacity benefits from the training, results from test samples can be obtained and analyzed much faster than previously.",

          "Indonesia implemented the innovative COVID-19 Ambassador Programme (Duta COVID-19) in the province of South Sulawesi to strengthen COVID-19 risk communication and engagement within the community. Duta COVID-19 participants are non-symptomatic contacts of COVID-19 patients. They partake in a 14-day quarantine during which time they are provided COVID-19 training and education to share with their friends and family once the quarantine period is completed. Information includes how to prevent and control COVID-19 infection through strategies like physical distancing, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and dissemination of risk communication materials in the community. The programme is designed to lessen the burden of COVID-19 care on health facilities by reducing exposure of health personnel and enabling supplies to be focused on patients with confirmed and severe symptoms. The success of this innovative initiative came out clearly and strongly during an outreach video conference hosted by WHO last month to discuss COVID-19 response plans and activities with all Indonesian provinces. WHO, national and provincial health authorities agreed to share response plans, and their success stories, across sectors and partners to achieve an effective whole-of-society approach to pandemic preparedness and response.",

The 4-day workshop educated 74 healthcare professionals from 10 regions. The training aimed to optimize the autonomous management of the pandemic in individual health districts for rapid and efficient care of the sick, reduction in the mortality rate linked to COVID-19 and the protection of healthcare workers. The trainings aimed as well to support the decentralization of the response which is a key approach for optimizing the outbreak management. To build on the training, participants will further train themselves other health personnel in their regions in various areas, including the early detection of COVID-19 cases, precautions to take when working with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 and techniques to identify and isolate positive cases. Cameroon is one of 54 African countries affected by COVID-19, and as of 7 June 2020 it reported 7860 confirmed cases of the 150, 610 confirmed cases in Africa.",

He also thanked international partners and different internal government sectors for their timely and effective support. Dr Howard Sobel, WHO Representative to Lao PDR, commended the Lao government’s success in containing the country’s first COVID-19 outbreak, calling it “exemplary.” As the country still remains vulnerable to the threat of COVID-19, WHO is working with the Lao Ministry of Health and with other ministries and development partners to further strengthen the country’s defenses against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. This includes training health workers, enhancing the capacity of national laboratories, and further developing alert systems.

          "On this forum, participants get the chance to consider the scientific principles guiding current advice in an environment where they will not be judged or criticized.",
          "“It’s what makes us stand out from other webinar providers,” Dr Pfeifer explains. “We don’t teach by hammering home a formula. We are a generation that needs to be convinced, so it’s more like a chat with a person you know.”",
          "There is no limit to the number of people who can sign up and any health worker can participate.",

The goal of the task force is to encourage a coherent response and anticipate any unfavourable consequences that may stem from the pandemic, while shifting towards easing of restrictions and recovery. All while focusing on health, the task force will look at economic and socioeconomic recovery, the recovery of health systems, the safe easing of restrictions, and border management as tourism reopens.

The initiative is led by the Juvenile Association for the Support of Young People in Need (Jucarente) with support from World Health Organization (WHO), the Provincial Government of Luanda and the Angolan Network of Non-Governmental Organizations for the Fight against HIV/AIDS (ANASO). With a budget of around US $ 10 000, it aims to reach 10 000 families in six of the nine municipalities that comprise the capital where most positive cases have been identified. Volunteers are equipped with PPE and transportation to safely carry out their mission. Mobilization campaigns communicated via these volunteers are particularly important in communities where internet access and literacy rates are low. Volunteers can more easily reach these populations to extinguish rumors and mitigate potentially harmful information.",

          "Eugene, a 32-year old nurse, left the elderly care home early on 1 April eager to spend time with his wife and five-month old son at their newly built house just outside of Vienna. But on the way home, he felt something was not right. He began to\n        feel fatigue, his throat scratchy, and that nagging feeling that he could have contracted COVID-19 at his workplace.",
          "“I could only think of two things: if I have it, how to keep from infecting my wife and little boy; and infecting all these other people in the train,” his anxiety sank in more deeply as he began putting the pieces together. “At\n        that time, our care facility did not have enough personal protective equipment and there was a lack of disinfectant. My colleagues and I had to create our own masks out of gauze bandages, while more and more patients were testing positive each\n        day.” He knew the risk was high.",
          "“I could not stomach the thought of infecting my wife and son,” he says. Reaching home, he set up a tent out in their garden, and slept there to isolate himself. It was not an easy few days as spring had only started, and temperature dropped\n        at night. So did the symptoms setting in: dry and rough coughing, a 39˚ fever, his whole body aching, and chills despite wrapping himself in layers of sheets.",
          "After a visit from the Austrian health services for testing, his diagnosis was confirmed. “I felt chills down my spine – will I die? What will happen to my family? Will I survive this?” he recalls, describing how the symptoms got\n        worse, like his lungs were being attacked. He could not breathe, his fever was fluctuating, and he lost his sense of smell and taste.",
          "As the spring temperature kept dropping he mustered the energy to set up camp inside: he sealed off half of the house to keep his family away. At night he slept in the toilet because it has heated flooring. “I didn’t care. Besides, I already\n        lost my sense of smell. If I slept in the hallway my coughing would wake my son, and I did not want to take the slightest chance of infecting my wife – who took it very hard.”",
          "His head nurse and the Austrian health services advised him to stay at home. As a mild case and owing to his young age, he could not be accommodated at any hospital. For over a week he treated his cough with expectorant and his fever with paracetamol, and doubled up on liquids; as a nurse he was applying to himself the same care he would dedicate to his patients. He made regular trips to the garden to get some fresh air and sunlight, a luxury he said\n        he never thought he had.",
          "“I thought of how many others who are cramped in small spaces, and how difficult it must be for poorer families who live in slums in other parts of the world to even maintain any sort of physical distance,” he says. Most importantly, he\n        stayed in contact with friends and talked about sports, having beer, and travelling; and did regular video-chats with his wife and son – who were just in the next room. “So near yet so far,” he now muses.",
          "He used his isolation to read up on managing the disease, guidance on how not to infect other people, updates on vaccines and drugs trials for COVID-19, and inspirational stories of recovery. It was at this time that he started looking at life differently.\n        “When you’re left alone to battle a disease that has yet no cure and no one really knows how to handle, not knowing if you live or die, while thinking of who will take care of your family or if you will ever get back to work again,\n        you’re on survival mode. If I survive this, I will make it up – to my patients, my colleagues, and my family,” he recalls telling himself.",
          "On 23 April he felt the symptoms wane, and two days later his official isolation period ended. Because testing at that time was prioritised only for the severe cases and older patients, he was advised to monitor the gradual disappearance of his symptoms.\n        He also decided to extend his isolation to another week just to be sure – despite his utter eagerness to hold his wife and hug his son again.",
          "Now he is back at work, ready to pick up where he left off. His care facility has also acquired more than enough PPEs and disinfectants for the staff and the patients. He comes back ready with a story to tell them, and reassure his patients that COVID-19\n        is not necessarily a death sentence, that only very few die from it. “It did not kill me, and instead it has made me more resolute and compassionate,” he says.",
          "His road to recovery was rough, but he says it’s not as bad as many others he has witnessed at work or read about on the internet. As a health care worker he still had fears of being infectious while travelling to work, caring for his patients,\n        or as he reunites with his wife and son. He also admits guilt for missing work for a month: “How could we be called heroes if I was not even able to care for my patients, and my team severely understaffed? How can I be proud of my work as\n        a frontliner, if I’m sulked here at home?”",
          "But now he uses his experience to lift the spirits of his patients, colleagues, and some friends who also contracted COVID-19. “I want to show that I’m there for them – even if it’s just a few minutes of relief for them. I\n        want to remind people we can all fight this if we stay at home, stick to the facts, and still be connected while we’re physically distanced. It’s a small sacrifice compared to what the disease does to those who experienced it, and\n        this way we can still be united in solidarity,” he says.",
          "COVID-19 may have given him the scare of his life, but it has also built him stronger. Like over a million survivors across the world, Eugene is one with the story to tell, and the heart for it. “ When the antibody tests can be proven\n        really effective by the World Heath Organization, or governments, or private companies…I will be one of the first to volunteer to share my antibodies and try to save even just one life,” he smiles.",
          "Now that’s a frontliner."

          "A new WHO survey looks at the extent to which different countries in the European region have altered services for the prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The survey showed that palliative care, rehabilitation care, and services to address cardiovascular disease emergencies have been significantly disrupted in most countries. To treat NCD’s during the challenge of the pandemic, health care systems have employed new strategies like refilling prescriptions remotely, repurposing staff, and limiting facility-based care that was nonessential. The survey’s results showed a decrease in outpatient care due to patients not coming in for their appointments. This decline is attributed to travel restrictions during lockdown and fear of exposure to the disease. Countries are responding by adapting service methods such as offering telemedicine consultations and novel delivery methods of medicine. Considering the new global reality, WHO has arranged and facilitated several webinars for countries to share their experiences and exchange ideas to help one another address new challenges during COVID-19.",

The end of the Soviet state left the people in the newly independent states in Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation with uneven access to health care.

          "- political commitment to sustained TB control - a regular supply of anti-TB drugs - sputum smear diagnostic microscopy services - individual patient monitoring systems - standardized treatment regimes with direct observation of therapy (DOT).",
          "Patients with infectious TB are identified using microscopy services. Then health workers, community workers and trained volunteers observe and record patients taking the full course of the correct dosage of anti-TB medicines. The treatment has to be followed for six to eight months.",
          "If administered accurately, DOTS can treat TB with a success rate of nearly 99% and can help to avoid the development of MDR-TB.",
          "More on DOTS",
          "In Ukraine, DOTS was implemented as a pilot project in Donetsk at the end of 2001. “Before DOTS, only TB specialists were able to detect cases, by using expensive x-rays. Only a few cases could be detected and treated, and the patients had to stay at the hospital for at least one year,” explains Dr Maja Goroschko, Deputy Director of the Donetsk hospital. “With DOTS, general practitioners are trained to detect TB using a simple sputum test. If a patient is infected, he is transferred to a TB dispensary. This is a huge difference: now everyone who develops infectious TB can be detected and treated.”",
          "Although the changes needed to apply DOTS across Ukraine will be a long process, DOTS is already having a positive impact in the country. “Since we started DOTS our success rate in treating TB has risen from 57% to 81%. This is a major step up that will also help to get the development of MDR-TB under control,” says Dr Goroschko.",
          "Dr Kestutis Miskinis, Medical Officer at the WHO TB Control Office in Ukraine, agrees. “In order to control TB and MDR-TB in the long term we need to move forward with DOTS systematically. In regions where DOTS is not implemented, doctors do not have to follow any protocol with regard to the use of first and second line drugs. Drugs that are prescribed to MDR-TB patients often have not even been tested before and there are no regulations for a recommended dosage. If we do not expand DOTS, these factors will contribute to mounting levels of drug resistance in the country.”"

This rapidly expanding combined epidemic presents an enormous public health challenge. People living with HIV/AIDS are many times more susceptible to developing all forms of TB. “With people’s immune systems compromised, MDR-TB has a perfect opportunity to spread rapidly and kill,” explains WHO Assistant Director-General of HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, Dr Jack Chow, “We cannot control one without controlling the other, and we must begin to scale up TB/HIV collaborative activities to provide a synergy of prevention, treatment and care for co-infected patients.”",
          "At the beginning of April, WHO and the Ukrainian Ministry of Health held a workshop in Donetsk to explore ways of ensuring an effective joint HIV/TB response. The gathering is the latest in a line of WHO initiatives aimed at assisting countries scale-up TB control programmes. Already, preparations for the formation of a high level working group, made up of international and national TB specialists, are gaining pace. Ukraine could be the test bed that sees innovative and modern TB control practices put in place.",
          "\"Ukraine has the capacity to rapidly scale up and modernize TB control,\" says Dr Mario Raviglione, Director of WHO's Stop TB Department. \"If Ukraine can do this, we will see the threat from the TB/HIV co-infection and MDR-TB reduce. But for this to happen, the political will must be in place.\"",

          "I am Ingrid and I had pre-extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (pre-XDR-TB), a form of TB caused by bacteria that are resistant to some of the most effective anti-TB drugs. After two years on TB treatment (including an injectable drug) I was cured.",
          "I live in South Africa and I was working as a dietitian in the public sector when I got sick. I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis – a chronic, inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation in the digestive tract – and I was treated with drugs to suppress my immune system and decrease the inflammation in my gut. Shortly thereafter I was diagnosed with pre-XDR-TB. I was hospitalised for 75 days. During this time, I developed liver failure and nearly died. I woke up from the coma and the doctor said it was a miracle. The doctor and the nursing staff who treated me in hospital were very kind and I was fortunate to have loving family and friends who encouraged me.",
          "I remained weak when I left hospital and was struggling to cope with the injection and the pills that caused diarrhoea and vomiting. I found it hard to not have my freedom or the abilities I used to have, and felt very vulnerable and overwhelmed, like a massive wave had crashed over me. It made me think, “how do the poor and marginalised get through this?” I could not imagine doing this alone, without support from loved ones.",
          "After leaving hospital I started working as an assistant to an inspiring academic who ignited in me a passion for research. I was blessed with lots of love and care from my family and friends and started exercising again. It felt like I was getting a new start; it felt good to enjoy things again and be excited about life!",
          "I was declared cured in 2014. After having TB I now appreciate being healthy much more! TB changed my life; it has humbled as well as enriched me as a person, teaching me how much we have to be thankful for.",
          "I feel I can now relate to the suffering of so many in South Africa who have TB and hope more will be done to not just treat the disease, but treat the person – providing nutritional, economical, practical and emotional support. I believe that could give people with TB the hope they need!",
          "I am now part of TB Proof, an organisation that advocates for improved detection and treatment of TB, as well as breaking down the stigma attached to having TB. Our team is passionate about improving the outcomes for all patients with TB."

Actions taken included a WHO-led PCI training for local health workers and the evaluation of five health facilities in Sédhiou. Dr. Mady Bâ was appointed incident manager as part of the new system. He works closely with the WHO Resident Representative and other partners in developing strategies to support Senegal as the health crisis evolves. With the help of an Incident Manager, a region or country can better coordinate a response to a public health event with clear procedures.",

          "Many parasitic NTDs are present in Cambodia, including taeniasis/cysticercosis, schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminths.  Diagnosis of these parasites and diseases can be achieved using faecal samples and simple techniques such as the Kato-Katz test. For some infections the test is highly effective; for others such as Taenia solium, the Kato-Katz is neither sensitive nor specific, but can be very useful as a screening test or as a first step to map endemic areas in a country or region.",
          "In Cambodia until recently the Kato Katz test was only conducted at national level at the National Centre for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control (CNM - www.cnm.gov.kh ). There was no capacity at provincial level to conduct such tests. That made the surveillance and monitoring of several parasitic NTDs difficult and more expensive.",
          "Now, with the support of PROBITAS FOUNDATION ( www.fundacionprobitas.org/en/home ) and WHO, CNM conducted a Kato-Katz training in December 2019 for provincial and district laboratory technicians under the leadership of Dr Virak Khieu, Manager of National Helminth Control Programme.",
          "Forty-two technicians from the Provincial Health Department, the Operational Health District, the Referral Provincial and the District Hospital of 5 provinces (Kratie, Stung Treng, Rattanakiri, Mondulkiri and Preah Vihear) were trained, so local health workers can now assist in the surveillance and monitoring of many neglected parasitic diseases.",

Training was provided in April and May during the lockdown in anticipation of businesses reopening under a “new normal.” Through combined efforts of the Ministry of Health, WHO, USAID, and Save the Children, training was offered in seventeen provinces. There provincial and district health officers, as well as staff from the water authority (NAMSAAT), were trained on use of personal protection equipment, cleaning, and disinfection of premises. A printed copy of standard operating procedures (SOP) was shared and disseminated to businesses and public authorities to guide and inform improved cleaning practices. The local hotel association, NGOs and other business association were also involved in supporting implementing these enhanced cleaning procedures. The DHHP, WHO, and USAID will support follow-up visits to monitor cleaning procedures.",

          "When it comes to life post-pandemic, what Dr Konstantinos Petsanis worries about most is mental health.",
          "“Mental health repercussions regarding what is happening during this pandemic for people, today and beyond, will really be a problem in general,” Dr Petsanis says. “In general, stress behaviour for many, many people brings a lot of problems.”",
          "A neurologist by training, Dr Petsanis, Greek born, specializes in general cognitive disorders and dementia and where he is currently working in La Chaux-de-Fonds in Switzerland. Since the onset of COVID-19 however, he has been redeployed, assisting in emergencies and screening potential patients.  He sees mental health warning signs throughout the population.",
          "“Just the fact of someone wondering if he is positive for COVID is like having a stigma and something that is threatening his life… and that affects, of course, his behavior. We know very well that panic leads to bad behavior and to psychosomatic problems as well, and that brings on somatic problems very, very easily, and we have to be careful and delicate with how we handle this,” he says.",
          "Switzerland’s first case was identified in late February. A month later, the total had jumped to nearly 9000 cases. Switzerland is now on the downside of the COVID-19 curve. The most recent WHO tally showed only 50 new cases per day, and a total of approximately 30-thousand confirmed cases.",
          "Despite the declining case load, Dr Petsanis warns that health-care workers on the frontlines face their own set of unique stressors.",
          "“If we have to deal with people that are in panic, we have to be well-supported. In this, the stress is, of course, doubled. We deal with people who, at the end, have the coronavirus, but we have to stay calm, go straight through the criteria and rules, and don’t pass our stress to the patient,” he said.",
          "Countries are now facing an additional threat —a long period of economic instability. Dr Petsanis said that the unemployment during and after the Great Depression led to an increased incidence of heart disease.",
          "“We had so much stress before World War II that too many people got rheumatoid cardiopathies correlated with unemployment. Actually, it wasn’t just correlation, causation was established. We know that stress kills, first of all because it provokes two things, vaso-spasm in the vascular system and immunodepression, the suppression of the immune system,” he says.",
          "In a recently published Opinion piece in Time Magazine , UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, stressed the cumulative impact of stress, grief, and anxiety.",
          "“Unless we act now to address the mental health needs associated with the pandemic, there will be enormous long-term consequences for families, communities and societies.”",
          "The UN has urged governments around the world to take the mental health consequences seriously, and ensure widespread availability of mental health support. WHO has published guidelines for communities … even a children’s book .",
          "Dr Petsanis hopes for change. He’d like to see more investments in health-care facilities and in healthcare itself.",
          "“That way, we will have fewer medical errors, fewer issues in hospitals, less stress and panic.” He added, “I’m wondering myself if this corona period is a big alarm, a wake-up call to invest in human capacity.”",

Around 26 million are refugees, 80% of whom are sheltered in low and middle-income countries with weak health systems. \"The principle of solidarity and the goal of serving vulnerable people underpin the work of both our organizations,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"We stand side by side in our commitment to protect the health of all people who have been forced to leave their homes and to ensure that they can obtain health services when and where they need them. The ongoing pandemic only highlights the vital importance of working together so we can achieve more.\" The statement comes alongside the news that no migrants or refugees have tested positive for COVID-19 in Serbia. Extensive collaborative efforts from WHO and the Government of Serbia have seen refugees and migrants provided COVID-19 protection equal to that of the host population in the spirit of universal health coverage. “WHO is working with governments around the world to ensure supply chains remain open and lifesaving health services are reaching all communities,” said Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Health education materials in 7 languages were distributed to all migrant centres and NGOs that work with migrants in Serbia. Personal protective equipment (PPE), personal hygiene products and disinfectant were delivered to asylum and migrant reception centres throughout the country. Personal protective equipment shipment arrives in Kyrgyzstan. The WHO Country Office in Kyrgyzstan, together with the Ministry of Health of Kyrgyzstan received a shipment of personal protective equipment and laboratory consumables as part of the fight against COVID-19. WHO has primary responsibility for promoting the health of refugees and migrants, with a current focus on prevention and responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Refugees and migrants face the same health risks as host populations, but due to various barriers – geography, facilities, discrimination, language and costs – they may lack access to the health services required to control and treat illness. A recently published Lancet article warned of the increasing risks facing refugees and migrants, particularly those in camp settings where simple preventative measures like social distancing and self-isolation are harder to implement. In countries that host a large number of refugees and migrants, WHO country offices have been working with ministries of health and other partners in their efforts to prevent and control COVID-19. Who is also collaborating with other UN agencies to provide interim technical guidance on scaling up outbreak readiness in humanitarian situations, including refugee camp and non-camp settings. Similar guidance has been released specifically for countries in the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions where refugee populations are large. The TB center in Idleb, northwest Syria, is one of many health facilities where prevention measures have been put in place as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. HIHFAD (Hand in Hand for Aid and Development) staff, a partner of the WHO, check the temperature of all those that visit the facility and makes sure they use a hand sanitizer before entering. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) has developed a reporting system to monitor the occurrence and trend of COVID-19 among displaced populations in camps and non-camps settings. The\nWHO Country Offices in Djibouti, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen report rumours\nimmediately and aggregate data every week. Also, to enhance interagency\ncoordination for country support, WHO EMRO in collaboration with IOM , ESCWA and ILO , has\nestablished a Regional Taskforce on COVID-19 and Migration/Mobility. In Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar, WHO is working with governments to secure the health of nearly one million Rohingya refugees and their host community against multiple threats of COVID-19, cyclone and diseases associated with the upcoming monsoon season. As COVID-19 cases are confirmed in Rohingya refugee camps, WHO and partners work round the clock to scale up measures in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh to protect Rohingyas and their host community. “It is essential that organizations working with refugees and migrants have access to the technical guidance and resources required to prevent and control COVID-19 among displaced populations,” said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, Deputy Director-General of WHO. WHO has been working closely with ministries of health across the world, including in Cambodia, Greece, Lebanon, Mexico, Singapore, Thailand, and Turkey, among others. In Thailand, universal health coverage is available to all migrants and refugees, regardless of legal status. WHO’s Thailand Country Office has mobilized resources locally from the Government of Japan to help strengthen surveillance and outbreak response in refugee camps, along with distributing supplies of PPE and commodities. A migrant hotline for COVID-19 in the Khmer, Lao and Burmese languages was also launched. In Mexico, education materials on the prevention, early detection and management of COVID-19 in shelters for migrants and asylum seekers have been developed. Migrant reception centres have been identified as areas of potentially greater health risk and WHO is promoting the implementation of health protocols for the prevention and early detection of COVID-19 at these points.",
          "The Government of Singapore, with support from WHO, health partners and NGOs, has enhanced risk communication and community engagement with foreign workers in dormitories. A major challenge in reaching this vulnerable group is language barriers, but authorities have found innovative ways to communicate and engage with them in their native languages.",
          "Communication and engagement with vulnerable populations in Singapore is also being expanded by partnering with NGOs, including the Migrant Workers Centre. The group is tapping into its network of more than 5000 dormitory ambassadors to help communicate and disseminate important messages. These ambassadors are foreign workers themselves and have volunteered to help fellow workers.",
          "The Government of Singapore has also boosted Wi-Fi receptivity in the dormitories and provided SIM cards to workers to enable them to stay connected and informed. They have also opened up many news and entertainment cable channels to enable viewing on mobile devices.",

          "COVID-19 is the greatest global shock in decades.  Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost, and the world’s economy likely faces the worst recession since the 1930s. The resulting loss of employment and income will cause further damage to livelihoods, health, and sustainable development.",
          "Societies need to protect themselves, and to recover, as quickly as possible.  But we cannot go back to the way we did things before.   Increasing numbers of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, SARS and Ebola, have made the jump from wildlife to humans - and all available evidence suggests that COVID-19 has followed the same route . Once human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 began, national and international surveillance and response systems were not strong or fast enough to completely halt transmission. And as infections spread, a lack of universal health coverage has left billions of people, including many in rich countries, without reliable and affordable access to medical treatment.  Massive inequalities have meant that deaths and loss of livelihoods have been strongly driven by socioeconomic status , often compounded by gender and minority status.",
          "Attempting to save money by neglecting environmental protection, emergency preparedness, health systems, and social safety nets, has proven to be a false economy – and the bill is now being paid many times over.  The world cannot afford repeated disasters on the scale of COVID-19, whether they are triggered by the next pandemic, or from mounting environmental damage and climate change. Going back to “normal” is not good enough.",
          "In adversity, the crisis has also brought out some of the best in our societies, from solidarity among neighbours, to the bravery of health and other key workers in facing down risks to their own health to serve their communities, to countries working together to provide emergency relief or to research treatments and vaccines. The “lockdown” measures that have been necessary to control the spread of COVID-19 have slowed economic activity, and disrupted lives - but have also given some glimpses of a possible brighter future. In some places, pollution levels have dropped to such an extent that people have breathed clean air, or have seen blue skies and clear waters, or have been able to walk and cycle safely with their children - for the first times in their lives.  The use of digital technology has accelerated new ways of working and connecting with each other, from reducing time spent commuting, to more flexible ways of studying, to carrying out medical consultations remotely, to spending more time with our families. Opinion polls from around the world show that people want to protect the environment , and preserve the positives that have emerged from the crisis, as we recover.",
          "National governments are now committing trillions of dollars, in a matter of weeks, to maintain and eventually resuscitate economy activity. These investments are essential to safeguard people’s livelihoods, and therefore their health.  But the allocation of these investments, and the policy decisions that will guide both short- and long-term recovery, have the potential to shape the way we live our lives, work and consume for years to come. Nowhere is this more important than in their effects on environmental degradation and pollution, and particularly on the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming and the climate crisis.",
          "Decisions made in the coming months can either “lock in” economic development patterns that will do permanent and escalating damage to the ecological systems that sustain all human health and livelihoods, or, if wisely taken, can promote a healthier, fairer, and greener world."

They also increase the risk of emerging infectious diseases in humans  – over 60% of which originate from animals, mainly from wildlife. Overall plans for post-COVID-19 recovery, and specifically plans to reduce the risk of future epidemics, need to go further upstream than early detection and control of disease outbreaks.

Handwashing facilities are essential for the prevention of infectious disease transmission, but are lacking in 40 % of households . Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens are widespread in water and waste and their sound management is needed to prevent the spread back to humans. In particular it is essential that health care facilities be equipped with water and sanitation services, including the soap and water that constitutes the most basic intervention to cut transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other infections, access to reliable energy that is necessary to safely carry out most medical procedures, and occupational protection for health workers.",

Investment in healthier environments for health protection, environmental regulation, and ensuring that health systems are climate resilient, is both an essential guardrail against future disaster, and offers some of the best returns for society.  For example, every dollar that was invested in strengthening the US Clean Air Act has paid back 30 dollars in benefit to US citizens, through improved air quality and better health."

Energy infrastructure decisions taken now will be locked in for decades to come.

There is widespread public support for policies that do not seek only to maximize GDP, but to protect and enhance wellbeing, and for governments to combat climate change and environmental destruction with the same seriousness with which they are now fighting COVID-19. It is also shown by the millions of young people who have mobilized to demand action not only on climate and biodiversity - but also for the right to breathe clean air, and for their future on a liveable planet.",

Their skill, dedication, bravery and compassion has saved countless lives during the COVID-19 crisis – raising them to even higher levels of respect in their communities. Health professionals from around the world have shown that they are also strong supporters of action to protect the environment – and thereby the health of the populations that they serve. They are ready to be champions for the green, healthy and prosperous societies of the future, as evidenced in a recent open letter to G20 leaders , in which health professionals from around the world called for a healthy recovery from COVID-19."

          "Fifty low- and middle-income countries are soon to receive insulin for people with diabetes, thanks to a donation by global health-care company, Novo Nordisk . The donation, of insulin and glucagon [1] , to the value of US$ 1.3 million, comes at a time when many people with noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes are facing challenges with access to life-saving treatment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "“For many people living with diabetes these are difficult times,” said Professor Andrew Boulton, President of the International Diabetes Federation. “They are both vulnerable to the severe effects of COVID-19 and struggling with day-to-day problems managing their diabetes, such as disrupted access to medication, equipment and health care. Initiatives to secure the supply of essential diabetes medicines, and of insulin in particular, are very welcome.”",
          "“We are very grateful for this timely donation of insulin,” said Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Director of the Department of Noncommunicable Diseases at WHO. “It is the first donation of a medicine for a noncommunicable disease to WHO and it comes at a critical point.“",
          "The selection of countries to receive this donation was based on their income group and information provided to WHO by ministries of health on the capacity of their health systems to manage storage and supply at a time when transport systems have been disrupted and health-care systems are stretched.",
          "In order to meet the long-term needs of people with diabetes, however, a sustainable supply of insulin, provided at prices that countries can afford, is needed.",
          "“We must not forget that as we approach the centenary of the discovery of insulin many people globally still face multiple hurdles in accessing insulin on a daily basis in normal circumstances,” said Dr Kaushik Ramaiya, Chair of the International Insulin Foundation.",
          "The donation comes several months after the inclusion of insulin in WHO’s prequalification programme, which accelerates and increases access to critical medical products that are quality-assured, affordable and adapted for markets in low- and middle-income countries.",
          "The effort to ensure a regular, affordable supply of insulin is just one of a number of strategies implemented by WHO to improve treatment of diabetes. In April, the Organization launched updated guidance on diagnosis, classification and management of type 2 diabetes intended for all those involved in planning and delivery of diabetes care. WHO also works with countries to promote healthy diets and physical activity to lower people’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes.",
          "Countries are addressing diabetes as part of the Sustainable Development Goals, committing to cut premature death from diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases by one third by 2030.",

          "Despite the relatively lower number of COVID-19 cases in Africa compared to Europe, the pandemic remains a major threat to the continent’s health systems. A new study by WHO predicts that if containment measures fail, even with a lower number of cases requiring hospitalization than elsewhere, the medical capacity in much of Africa would be overwhelmed. Now with more than 100,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Africa, the virus has spread to every country in the continent. However, the pandemic has not spread as quickly as in other parts of the world and Africa’s COVID-19 mortality rates are lower as well. An early analysis by WHO speculates that Africa’s lower mortality rate might be due to its young population: 60% of Africans are under the age of 25. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, says, “It is possible our youth dividend is paying off and leading to fewer deaths. But we must not be lulled into complacency as our health systems are fragile and are less able to cope with a sudden increase in cases.” While Africa has made great progress in testing for COVID-19, it needs to expand the testing capacity in urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Authorities need to prioritize the protection of healthcare workers at facility and community levels by providing them with enough personal protective equipment.",

          "“If the purpose of urban planning is not for human health, then what is it for?” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health.  “Ideally, cities are planned for adequate standards of living and working, sustained economic growth, social development, environmental sustainability, better connectivity… but the ‘why’ at the core of all these things comes down to physical and mental health and wellbeing.”",
          "“Investments in health-based urban and territorial planning secure long-term health and wellbeing legacies for a growing proportion of humans,” said Dr Nathalie Roebbel, WHO Unit Head, Air Quality and Health.",
          "Over half the world’s population now lives in cities, and by 2050 that is expected to rise to a full 70 per cent of the human population. However, 75 per cent of the infrastructure that will be in place by then has not yet been built.",
          "This presents an opportunity to build transformative urban areas, especially as the world begins to build back with a greater consciousness of the links between space and health.",
          "One essential consideration is equity as there are substantial differences in health opportunities and outcomes within and across urban areas. The sourcebook is based on the premise that public health and urban planning both aim for fair and equitable outcomes and access to essential services.",
          "“Urban and territorial planning provides a framework to align and transform our built and natural environments. Putting human and environmental health back into the core of the urban and territorial planning process and principles will enable the full potential of our cities and territories to deliver healthier and resilient environments,” said Laura Petrella, UN-Habitat Chief of Planning, Finance and Economy.",
          "The sourcebook offers a comprehensive variety of resources, including frameworks, entry points, guidance and tools, as well as specific case studies illustrating recommended approaches to bring together planning and public health.",
          "The tools include a variety of health appraisal, analysis and data tools, such as   city-wide public space assessment, health impact assessment, cumulative risk and comparative risk assessments, spatial epidemiology, online analytical tools, citizen science, city dashboards and city profiling.",
          "The sourcebook explains why health needs to be a part of urban and territorial planning and how to make it happen.",
          "It also includes how to choose the best entry points for health — whether by setting, outcome, principle or sector — whatever the urban or territorial planning process, at any level.",
          "“Urban and territorial planning is a vehicle for health improvement and ultimately for achieving the New Urban Agenda and the many targets associated with urban health and the Sustainable Development Goals-  applying a health ‘lens’ to this process ensures all the determinants of health are considered ,” said Shipra Narang Suri, UN-Habitat  Chief of Urban Practices."

          "With support from World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners, in the last three weeks South Sudan’s Ministry of Health has trained over 100 health workers on COVID-19 case management and infection prevention and control. Participants are equipped with knowledge and skills on patient screening, isolation, contact tracing, use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and waste management. In addition to the hands-on training sessions provided for frontline workers at the Dr John Garang infectious diseases unit, eight online training sessions have been conducted to prepare health care workers. The goal then is for these trained individuals to spread their knowledge throughout South Sudan to other medical providers. Dr Olushayo Olu, WHO Representative for South Sudan, stated, “Continuous learning should be part of health care workers approach as much is yet to be known about the virus.” Case management trainings are supported by WHO, Centers for Disease Control (CDC), UNICEF, ICAP, International Medical Corps and South Sudan Red Cross.",

          "The current outbreak of COVID-19 in Somalia has exposed some of the weaknesses in its health system to rapidly trace, track, test and treat those infected with the virus who remain undiagnosed and undetected. Due to Somalia’s societal norms and high population density in major urban cities self-isolation and quarantine have been a real challenge. This resulted in active transmission in households, which has infected a large number of older people. Because Somalia lacked an early proactive testing strategy for COVID-19, the virus quickly spread. Somalia now leads all East African countries in mortality. The majority of deaths have occurred in De-Martino hospital, the major hospital in the capital Mogadishu city for treating COVID-19 patients. A few ways WHO has supported this hospital include training the health care workers on case management and infection control measures, donating a number of critical hospital and medical supplies, and assisting the hospital to automate its patient registration system. International support for Somalia has also come from United Nations International Office of Migration (IOM), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and USAID. As of recently, only 26% of WHO’s urgent appeal for US$ 21.95 million in emergency response to COVID-19 in Somalia has been funded.",

Funds collected by the CWPF will go towards actions outlined in the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to enable all countries – particularly those most vulnerable and at-risk, and with the weakest health systems – to invest in preparedness efforts, and respond to the COVID-19 crisis including rapidly detecting cases, stopping transmission of the virus, and caring for those affected.",

This becomes especially crucial during a worldwide pandemic like COVID-19 when migrants and refugees risk being marginalized. They may encounter social, political, economic, linguistic and cultural barriers when trying to access health-care services. Culture mediates both care-giving and care-receiving. Recently WHO/Europe has documented the efficiency in using intercultural-mediators in helping migrants and refugees access quality healthcare. A few of the many contributions intercultural-mediators offer include translating, advocating against institutional discrimination, and offering psychosocial support. WHO/Europe strongly recommends the integration of intercultural mediators into health-care systems across the European Region to provide equitable care to refugees and migrants. While responding to COVID-19 and developing strategies to transition to a “new normal”, Member States should implement measures that are culturally sensitive to effectively reach refugee and migrant communities.",

A new laboratory capable of processing 62 COVID-19 samples per hour is being installed at Mutukula border entry point shared by Uganda and Tanzania. The tests will particularly target truck drivers who heavily traffic the Mutukula Point of Entry. Upon inspection of the entry point, Ministry of Health officials and WHO representatives to Uganda found its porosity could lead to cross-border COVID-19 importation.",
          "The Government of Denmark has signed a grant worth two million dollars to support the COVID-19 response in Uganda by providing lifesaving commodities such as masks and Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) for health workers. The funds will also support the improvement of Sexual and Reproductive Health services in selected districts. Denmark’s grant is to be channeled through WHO and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). With the support of WHO and other partners the Ministry of Health is also working to prepare and provide COVID-19 patient care facilities at national and sub-national levels.",

WHO immediately activated its three-level (global, regional and country-level) Incident Management Support Team (IMST) and began assessment of the new coronavirus.",

WHO issued technical guidelines for countries to prepare for, communicate about, and control the large-scale community transmission of the virus. It formed committees of experts, visited Wuhan to investigate, and helped organize eight virtual IHR meetings (as of 7 May). WHO carefully tracked the first cases reported in different countries and responded by acquiring and shipping protective gear and testing supplies where needed.",

          "In early May, thousands of frontline primary health care workers across Indonesia tuned in to an online seminar on strengthening the roles of primary health care in prevention and control of COVID-19. The seminar was funded by USAID and hosted by the Directorate of Primary Health Services and Ministry of Health, with collaborative support from the Indonesian Medical Collegium (KDI) and WHO. While most online trainings on COVID-19 have focused on hospitals, this seminar concentrated on primary health care settings in Indonesia where many mild-moderate COVID-19 patients seek care. Participants from all Indonesian provinces attended the webinar or live-streamed it from YouTube. The seminar allowed participants to submit questions during the self-directed study portion of the training and have those questions answered during the interactive webinar. A pre-and post-test were a part of the training designed to help participants conduct effective prevention and control activities for COVID-19. WHO also provided technical assistance to develop the training modules based off relevant guidance and policy. A video tutorial is available as a post-seminar reference point for participants and health care workers who were unable to attend the seminar.",

This community of youth influencers, born out of the World Economic Forum, are working with WHO/Europe to ensure that tailored COVID-19 health advice reaches communities, families, and individuals in countries across the WHO European Region. Regular WHO-hosted webinars provide the Global Shapers network with accurate information and enable WHO to listen to the real concerns of youth in the Region. WHO’s access to the Global Shaper’s Facebook page, allows it to monitor and analyze information posted by members (i.e. pictures, questions, and rumors) to better tailor its risk communication.

At the start of the pandemic, these numbers were at risk of rising due to a lack of awareness of continued routine immunization, fear of COVID-19 infection, and transport issues arising from lockdown measures. Thanks to efforts made by the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) there has been an improved turnout since the start of the pandemic. WHO Nigeria provided technical support in the development of these guidelines to improve delivery and continuity of immunization services (particularly for children and at-risk populations) in Nigeria’s 36 states.

          "As the number of COVID-19 cases rise in Africa, more countries are calling for and inviting trained emergency medical teams (EMTs) to support their response to the pandemic in their regions. EMT’s are health professionals deployed around the world during emergencies to provide interventions, information, service, and equipment to countries in need. Burkina Faso recently welcomed the first Chinese medical mission. The team of doctors and various medical specialists brought a large quantity of protective equipment to make it easier for frontline health care workers to care for patients without risking their own health. They also visited healthcare sites with confirmed cases of COVID-19. In speaking with authorities, they insisted on the importance of differentiating treatment zones for those who are confirmed infected with COVID-19, those with symptoms, and those at risk. WHO continues to encourage international cooperation to overcome the pandemic.",
          "NOTE:  As part of WHO’s response, in mid-May, there were over 100 Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) and focal points worldwide continuously engaging in monitoring, guiding, and facilitating national and international COVID-19 response operations. A total of 19 EMTs have deployed to 15 countries across three WHO regions .",

The funds will be used to procure and distribute personal protective equipment (PPE), gear and test kits to support frontline credit union staff in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. This donation is particularly important for the Caribbean because its countries depend on importation of equipment and supplies. The majority of the Caribbean Credit Union members are first responders.

          "Getting humanitarian supplies where they need to go is a game of precision and meticulous planning under normal circumstances. Try adding a global, rapidly evolving pandemic to the mix, and you’ve described the current reality of World Health Organization\r\n    (WHO) Operations Support & Logistics Chief Paul Molinaro. He is WHO’s point man for procuring life-saving COVID-19 equipment and supplies destined for countries hit hardest by the virus.",
          "“There are a lot of pieces of a puzzle that have to be put into place at the same time,” Molinaro said."

        "heading": "Scaling Up the Orders",
        "content": [
          "In normal times, WHO fulfills country requests by placing orders through long-term contracts with vendors who ship cargo via freight forwarders. The COVID-19 pandemic turned the process upside down. Disruptions in Chinese manufacturing fractured global\r\n    supply chains, creating shortages in the face of soaring demand. Market competition increased, trade restrictions were implemented, and commercial flights were grounded. These challenges created a whole new level of complexity.",
          "“We’re sort of sailing the ship while building it at the same time,” Molinaro said. “Right now we have a ship, and there’s a lot of holes in it. But we have a ship.”",
          "In early April, the United Nations launched the UN COVID-19 Supply Chain Task Force – coordinated by WHO and the World Food Programme (WFP) – to massively scale up the procurement and delivery of personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and diagnostics supplies, and biomedical equipment like ventilators and oxygen\r\n    concentrators. The Task Force leveraged the capabilities and expertise of each partner into a mega-consortium to identify procurement needs and better negotiate with suppliers. Members include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Office for Humanitarian Affairs), the World Bank, The Global Fund, the United Nations\r\n    Office for Project Serves (UNOPS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA),  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), NGOs, Red Cross and Federation and other WHO health\r\n    cluster partners. The goal: to make supplies available to everyone, wherever they are needed.",
          "“We need to approach the market in a way that can give us success because unfortunately it’s unbalanced,” explained Molinaro. “Those who have the means and the means to pay, and the means to pay it very quickly and upfront benefit\r\n    the most.” Those without means, could easily be left out. Medical supplies are a “global good,” Molinaro said, which WHO can make accessible by using its leverage to secure large quantities.",
          "“We’re trying to bring some kind of order to a very fragmented, duplicative, and competitive procurement process,” Molinaro told us."

          "After allocations are negotiated, the Task Force puts down a funding guarantee – partly with money raised by the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO – and can then figure out how to get the goods sent out to countries.",
          "In the Task Force, WHO wears the technical hat. They know medical equipment well, and in the quickly changing context, can offer expertise on purchasing decisions such as which rapid diagnostic tests perform best. WFP takes care of logistics, including\r\n    establishing air routes and global distribution hubs, and chartering aircraft. The overall supply chain will be spread out across hubs in eight countries: Belgium, China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malaysia, Panama, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates\r\n    (UAE). WFP plans to use eight 747 aircraft and eight medium-sized cargo aircraft to move supplies. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said the WHO may need to “cover more than 30% of the world’s needs in the acute phase of the pandemic.”",
          "Dr Tedros described that each month, WHO would need to ship a minimum of 100 million medical masks and gloves; up to 25 million N95 respirators, gowns and face-shields; and up to 2.5 million diagnostic tests.",
          "“What we’re trying to do now is hugely ambitious,” Molinaro said. “Sometimes I think we’re going to attempt the impossible, but the alternative is what? If we don’t do this, what happens? We don’t get anything.”",
          "Determining who gets what depends on several factors, including what the countries request themselves through an online platform . It also depends on the health systems and infrastructure\r\n    countries have in place. Daily risk analysis is also important to determining types and amounts of supplies as rapidly shifting contexts can suddenly change needs.",
          "Sometimes, shipments don’t go according to plan – and sometimes, that’s a good thing.",
          "The Emiratis recently called WHO to let them know they had a plane going to Tehran. They had extra room to carry supplies – would WHO be interested? Getting supplies to Iran isn’t easy; WHO’s answer was a resounding ‘yes.’\r\n    Within days, 7.5 tons of medical equipment and supplies were delivered to health workers at a pivotal\r\n    point in Iran’s pandemic timeline.",
          "“There are these opportunities that are going to come up, so you need to take advantage,” said Molinaro. “You’ll take advantage of the one-off and hope to turn it into something else.”"

Dr Estrada is particularly worried about ensuring that patients in poorer countries can access affordable treatments.",

Not a vaccine or treatments for one country or one region or one-half of the world — but a vaccine and treatments that are affordable, safe, effective, easily-administered and universally available — for everyone, everywhere.”",
          "To that end, WHO brought leaders and partners together to launch the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator , a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to new COVID-19 therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines. At the event, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General stressed: “Inequity is unacceptable – all tools to address COVID-19 must be available to all. In the fight against COVID-19, no one should be left behind.\"",

          "Sania gave her the confidence she needed. She sat beside Razia and explained to her how the COVID-19 virus spreads. She told her that if proper precautions are taken, such as thoroughly cleaning hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub, COVID-19 can be prevented. She even took a further step and showed Razia how to properly wash her hands.",

Now with the COVID-19 crisis, IPC is ever more important.",
          "In the midst of the pandemic, Pakistan developed and launched National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control and inaugurated a new Center for Occupational and Patient Safety (COPS) at the National Institute of Health (NIH). The centre provides strategic direction for health professionals to embrace, create and implement transformational changes in the neglected domain of occupational safety.",
          "“There could not have been a better time to discuss infection prevention and control in Pakistan,” said Dr. Zafar Mirza, the prime minister’s special assistant on health on the eve of inauguration. “The role of health workers, particularly nurses and midwives, in dealing with COVID-19 is greatly appreciated.”",
          "It turns out teaching patients about health education, like Sania teaching Razia to practice hand hygiene, is not unusual. Many hospitals across the country are now conducting regular education both for patients, as well as health workers about hand hygiene.",
          "Nurses are critical to ensuring quality care. They engage and empower patients to speak up on their own behalf, and also enforce hand hygiene measures with colleagues from all levels of the hospital hierarchy.",
          "“Nurses are the key watchdogs of patients, so it’s absolutely critical that all of them prioritize patient safety and take responsibility for hand hygiene compliance,” said Dr Palitha Gunarathna Mahipala, WHO Representative Pakistan. “All hospitals worldwide must empower their health professionals to ensure safe care.”"

The faster these contacts are identified, the faster they can be vaccinated and protected from the disease. Quick testing is also critical for monitoring the effectiveness\r\n    of outbreak control activities, for the work of burial teams, for the clinical management of patients, and for the Ebola survivors’ programme.",

          "In November 2018, a trial was set up in outbreak-affected areas to evaluate four available Ebola treatments. In August 2019 data from the trial showed two of the four Ebola treatments substantially decreased mortality, especially if people sought treatment early. The survival\r\n    rate for those receiving either mAb114 or REGN-EB3 was as high as 90% for patients who had a low viral load.",

It also demonstrated that it is possible to conduct\r\n    ethically and scientifically sound research in the context of an infectious diseases outbreak, while simultaneously supporting the joint goals of saving lives and ending the outbreak.",
          "The design of Ebola treatment centres is also changing. In the DRC, innovative Biosecure Emergency Care Units for Outbreaks - transparent safe individual ‘rooms’- were used\r\n    by WHO partner ALIMA. This makes it easier for staff to safely care for patients, providing intensive care level monitoring and treatment, and enables families to see their loved ones safely and easily.

Each community is unique, and engagement has to be hyper-contextualized to affected communities. Communities asked for responders\r\n    who are local, familiar and speak local languages.

          "Her name is Mayerlín. She is seven years old and she should not be one of the 39,000 people in the world who will contract Chagas disease this year, and every year. She was most likely bitten at night by the vinchuca or kissing bug - the insect vector that transmits the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite. And that bug should not have been in her house.",
          "Vector control programmes have achieved huge reductions in the number of acute cases of Chagas disease by reducing the presence of kissing bugs in homes throughout the areas in Latin America where the disease is endemic. The estimated number of deaths per year worldwide went from 45,000 in the 1980s to 23,000 in 1990 and to 7,000 today. The estimated number of people infected with the T. cruzi parasite has declined from 30 million in 1990 to between 6 and 7 million in 2015.",
          "Although these statistics may not be very accurate due to the lack of epidemiological data for some regions, they do reflect the efforts made to control the insect vector.  And today, there are even areas completely free of the kissing bug responsible for the transmission of this disease. However, the problem in Mayerlín's community is not that the houses were never sprayed, but rather that there was no follow up on the initial treatment. After two years without seeing a vector control technician in the area, Mayerlín's mother found kissing bugs in their home.",
          "The good news for Mayerlín - as you can see in the photographic account of her story created by the Uruguayan photographer Ana Ferreira - is that she was diagnosed and treated in time. And, because of the early diagnosis and her age, the treatment was highly effective. The bad news is that, even today, less than 1% of patients with Chagas disease are receiving treatment. Mayerlín is one of the lucky ones.",
          "Still, there is not much point in having access to one of only two drugs that can treat Chagas disease if there is no follow-up in the control of the insect vector. The fight against Chagas can only make headway on two legs—vector control and access to diagnosis and treatment—and both must be strong. One is not enough. If both legs are not moving forward at a steady pace, the struggle will falter, and the advances made will be lost.",
          "Of the 39,000 new cases that occur every year, in the vast majority (30,000) infection occurs via the insect that transmits the disease. Mayerlín's story puts a face and a name on the problem, describing a real experience that will stand out among all those thousands of people and remain with us. Her story leaves us with a mixed aftertaste that reflects both the good and the bad news. And we are left wondering whether we are actually making progress. What we do know is that the only way to advance along the road is by walking.",
          "For this reason, as we mark the 111th anniversary of the discovery of Chagas disease this week, Mayerlín’s story illustrates the light and the dark sides of the response to this global public health challenge. She is just one of the 39,000 people who have been threatened by this neglected disease this year; and she is our one. Chagas disease is the most deadly parasitic disease in Latin America and there are now tens of thousands of cases in other countries around the world, including the United States, Spain and Japan. We must not forget her.",

          "Valentina is helping to organize beds in the mornings, and in the afternoons, she’s teaching nurses online. “We need nurses to continue their education and graduate, because right now, we need nurses to work on COVID19.” Within days\n        of graduation, her students are donning protective masks and gowns.",
          "“We must continue with our work,” says Valentina. “We are strong in this situation.”",
          "That’s the message received from dozens of nurses and midwives all over the world this past week. While each has their own experience, they were united in their resolve to do everything in their power to help learn more about and mitigate COVID19.",
          "Nurses are reorganizing wards to open more beds for COVID19 patients, while keeping others, including women in labour, safe. They’re taking stock of equipment and lending it across units. They’re learning on the job with information that\n        changes daily – even hourly. In Delhi, where COVID19 cases on the rise, nurse Ajo Jose has been preparing educational videos, teaching nurses to safely wear one protective mask all day, without scarring their own faces.",
          "“We are motivated,” says Ajo. “If we don’t do this right now, there may not be another chance.”",
          "In Uganda, midwife Harriet Nayiga is staying in touch with her young clients – vulnerable young women she normally counsels on their sexual and reproductive health and rights. Now, they must all stay home. She is texting and calling those who\n        have a phone, “to keep them informed and safe.” She worries for those who she can’t reach.",
          "And nurses are doing the unthinkable. In Spain, nurse Silvia Esteban Sepulveda tells us that because critical COVID patients are isolated, the last human touch they may feel is that of a nurse’s hand. “We have had to video-call family\n        members late in the night, so they can say goodbye to their dying relative.”"

The virus also claimed the lives of her parents and brother.",
          "That is a human tragedy. There’s also a practical reality. When health workers are exposed or become sick, they have to go home and stay there for at least two weeks. Hospitals scramble to find replacements.",
          "The truth is, there aren’t enough nurses and midwives in the world right now. A new report issued by WHO, Nursing Now and the International Council of Nurses for World Health Day 2020, reveals a global shortfall of 5.9 million nurses - with the greatest gaps found in countries in Africa, South East Asia and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean\n        region as well as some parts of Latin America.",
          "One nurse told us he is managing a COVID19 quarantine ward where there are two nurses, and about 130 people. Despite his fatigue, he told us that he is proud to contribute to overcoming COVID19.",
          "One New York-based nurse, Grace Oghiehor-Enoma, sums up the thoughts of many:",
          "“It’s like you’re going into the battlefield. You see the fire, and you’re running into the fire, not thinking about yourself. That is the selflessness that you can see in nursing today.”",

          "The best way to achieve the health SDGs is through UHC, where everybody receives the quality health services they need, without suffering financial hardship. By 2030, there should be no one dying needlessly from preventable diseases; no one should be left behind. That is the philosophical motto of the SDGs. ”",

          "The annual Prince Mahidol Award Conference (PMAC) held from 28 January to 2 February 2020 under the theme, Accelerating Progress to Universal Health Coverage (UHC), brought together more than 1,000 participants from multilateral agencies,\r\n        academia, civil society, public sector and the private sector. Leveraging this event, several of the signatory agencies to the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All organized sessions to discuss ways for achieving UHC and the health-related Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs)."

          "Investing in primary health care systems as a path to achieving UHC was a key message throughout the conference. As Dr Naoko Yamamoto, WHO Assistant Director-General, Universal Health Coverage and Healthier Populations said in her opening remarks, “Strengthening primary health care is the path towards UHC. We need to transform the way health and social services are organized, funded and delivered. For health care and coverage to be truly universal, it calls for a shift from health\r\n        systems designed around diseases and health institutions towards prevention and health promotion.”",
          "Reinforcing these remarks, Her Royal Highness Dina Mired, Princess of Jordan and President of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) said, “Our health systems have long been geared to treat communicable diseases only and certainly\r\n        not to prevent diseases, making some to call Ministries of Health as far as Ministries of Disease.”"

          "Mechanisms to finance UHC was another central theme of the conference. Five of the Global Action Plan signatory agencies working on the Sustainable Financing for Health accelerator, (Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Global Financing Facility; the Global\r\n        Fund; the World Bank and WHO) organized a side event entitled: Making health financing work for UHC. The event, attended by more than 120 participants, focused on sharing practical steps, policies and experiences countries have taken\r\n        to more effectively mobilize, utilize and leverage financing for health. Throughout the two days, panelists and country participants from Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Georgia, Ghana, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Kenya, Mexico, Papua\r\n        New Guinea, Peru, Thailand, South Africa and others shared experiences on areas such as the implementation of “pro-health tax” reforms to public financial management systems, and policies to reduce financial hardship and unmet need.",
          "Marijke Wijnroks, Chief of Staff from the Global Fund and co-lead of the sustainable finance for health accelerator group said, “one of the broader aims of the sustainable financing accelerator is to support countries mobilize more domestic\r\n        resources for health and ensuring its effective use.”",
          "Globally, the WHO estimates that 20 to 40 per cent of health budgets is wasted. “It’s not enough to mobilize more resources for health; we need to get better and more equitable coverage and financial protection from the money that is spent.\r\n        Improvement at the country level requires implementing better policies that include incentives for efficient use of resources to maximize impact,” added Joseph Kutzin, WHO Coordinator, Health Financing Policy and member of the sustainable\r\n        financing accelerator group."

          "Advocating for more resources for health is no easy task. “The dialogue between Ministers of Health and Ministers of Finance can be likened to men are from Mars and women are from Venus,” explained Toomas Palu, Senior Advisor on Health, Nutrition and Population for the World Bank and co-lead for the sustainable finance for health accelerator group . “We need to support Ministers of Health develop the investment case and demonstrate how health programmes contribute to broader national development objectives. This is where the Global Action Plan agencies can support countries achieve the health SDGs,” said Palu.",
          "As the conference concluded, it is clear that progress must be urgently accelerated to achieve UHC. “Fostering dialogue between countries around the key themes of health financing and primary health care and leveraging opportunities such as\r\n        PMAC is a critical way for the Global Action Plan signatory agencies to engage with stakeholders from different constituencies, identify priorities and support impact at the country level,” said David Hipgrave, Senior Health Advisor, UNICEF\r\n        and member of the primary health care accelerator group."

The shipment, which included personal protective items for health workers, laboratory screening tests, trauma medication and other medical supplies, was to be distributed to Sana’a and Aden to support readiness for COVID-19, as well as to the humanitarian response to the ongoing conflict. On 9 March, Saudi Arabia delivered a shipment of medical equipment to Wuhan city in China. In response to an urgent WHO appeal, Saudi Arabia donated US$ 10 million to support all countries of the Region in their national COVID-19 response. An additional US$ 10 million will go to provide WHO Yemen with essential equipment and supplies for the national readiness and response plan. “Infectious diseases such as COVID-19 know no borders. We have seen how a public health threat in one country can quickly affected entire regions and spread to become a global pandemic. This funding will help WHO intensify its efforts as it takes regional and global action to combat the spread of the disease,” says Dr Ahmed Al Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean."

          "Maria Emily C. Ballesteros, a nurse managing the tuberculosis (TB) program of the City Health Office in Tuguegarao City, the Philippines. Her dream for Tuguegarao is to one day see zero TB cases and that no one dies from this infectious disease. Nurses and healthcare workers play a critical role in providing health services. These are the people who devote their lives to caring for others; giving lifesaving immunizations and health advice; looking after people and generally meeting everyday essential health needs. They are often the first and only point of care in their communities. In the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses and healthcare workers are at the forefront of the response - providing high quality, respectful treatment and care, leading community dialogue to address fears and questions. Like Emily, countless TB nurses are working hard to ensure that people with TB get uninterrupted treatment and maintain the good quality of TB care. 2020, in the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife, we thank all the nurses, midwives and healthcare workers working to #EndTB! Watch the story of Emily:"

          "When Kenya announced the country’s first case of COVID-19 , the government shifted swiftly into response mode. With the help of WHO, the Kenyan government had already created four Rapid Response Teams in the Ministry of Health’s Emergency Operations Centre, set up a hotline, and established a coronavirus isolation and treatment unit  at Kenyatta National Referral Hospital. Dr. Jackson Njoroge is one of 1,500 clinicians trained as a rapid responder to the outbreak. As Dr. Njoroge checked the personal protective equipment of the youngest member of his five person team, he emphasized that “there is no room for mistakes.” Part of a meticulous containment strategy outlined by the WHO, these Rapid Response Teams snap into action after each confirmed case, tracking down potential transmissions in the patient’s contact history. “You are protecting the entire community when you put in place a good contact tracing,” said Dr. Okot, Epidemiologist and Surveillance Technical Officer for WHO Regional Office in Africa."

          "The World Health Organization called on Member states in South-East Asia Region to urgently scale-up aggressive measures to combat COVID-19, as confirmed cases cross 480, and the disease claims eight lives. “The situation is evolving rapidly. We need to immediately scale up all efforts to prevent the virus from infecting more people,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region.  Eight of the 11 countries of WHO South-East Asia Region have confirmed cases of COVID-19. While Thailand has 177 confirmed cases, Indonesia 134, India 125, Sri Lanka 19, Maldives 13, Bangladesh 5, Nepal and Bhutan one each. These numbers are increasing quickly. Looking at the numbers, some countries are clearly heading towards community transmission of COVID-19, the Regional Director said, adding this should best be prevented.  Of critical importance are continued efforts to detect, test, treat, isolate and trace contacts. Simple public health measures are critical. Practicing hand hygiene, covering your cough and sneeze, and practicing social distancing cannot be emphasized enough, Dr Khetrapal Singh said. “This alone has the potential to substantially reduce transmission.”"

Iraq has a vulnerable health system, weakened by years of war and internal crises. On the ground, experts from WHO provided guidance on control measures and enough test kits and personal protective equipment for a rapid response to severe cases at the national and regional level. Should a patient need more sophisticated medical treatment, they can soon be taken to one of the three negative-pressure rooms WHO is building in Baghdad, Erbil, and Basra."

          "The Islamic Republic of Iran, reported more than 27,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Like every country, its health system is being challenged by the pandemic. Since the first case was reported on 19 February, WHO has sent seven shipments of emergency medical supplies to the country, including two medicines part of a global research study on treatments for COVID-19, called the Solidarity Trial . “These important medicines will not only support the treatment of patients… but will also help the country contribute significantly to the Solidarity Trial in an effort to find an effective treatment for this virus,” said WHO Representative Dr. Hamlemann. Even overloaded hospitals are able to participate in the study, generating robust data on potential treatments for the virus. Recently, while WHO experts were conducting field trips and technical support work, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education launched a new public campaign to emphasize early detection, contact tracing, and community engagement. Officials from WHO and Iran worked together to identify several priority areas for scale up. “WHO is working closely with the Islamic Republic of Iran in coordinating and providing critical international support to the country during this outbreak,” says Dr. Hamelmann. Soon the number of labs able to test for COVID-19 will rise from 30 to around 50."

          "“The health problems for women in Nigeria include high maternal mortality, breast and cervical cancer as well as issues related to harmful traditional practices like female genital mutilation. Due to the practice of early marriage (and childbirth), we also have related health issues such as vesico vaginal fistula.” she explained.",

She also works with widows of conflict including child widows and those who have suffered harmful traditional practices.",
          "The Association uses a unique campaign called the Women’s right to health information (WORTHI).  This operates on the belief that if medical information is made simple and easy to understand and delivered to women in the local language, then communities can receive and act on lifesaving information. The Association carries out the WORTHI campaign in communities so that mothers who are the main care givers in their home can use this lifesaving information to save their own lives and those of their families.",
          "“Our greatest achievement has been the passage in 2015 of the Violence against persons prohibition (VAPP) Act for which our Association actively advocated through Parliament,” she said.",
          "The VAPP Bill was a 14-year long process of activism by civil society engaged in legislative advocacy. The Act entitles victims to comprehensive medical psychosocial, social and legal assistance by government agencies. This bill has stipulated punishment for female genital mutilation, harmful traditional practices, violence and harmful traditional widowhood practices.",
          "The Bill incorporates life imprisonment for perpetrators of rape. The Association speaks out to the general public to raise awareness of the Act, providing support for survivors, training first-line responders and embarking on prevention education."

WHO has made Italy a priority, and members of the RRT worked closely with national and regional authorities, visiting hospitals, briefing health workers, and developing detailed technical plans to manage the outbreak. The plans emphasize the importance of containment measures across the country - and Italy responded with some of the toughest restrictions on movement - and prioritizing the identification and testing of suspect cases. WHO will now deploy a senior advisor to Rome and establish a field emergency team in the WHO Venice Office. “We are ready to scale up our involvement as needed,” concluded Dr. Hans Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe."

Health workers, such as midwives, nurses, doctors and community health workers, can support parents to identify and respond to a baby’s needs, while counselling on the importance of early play and communication. They can make sure that families are aware of relevant services and additional support, including maternal mental health care.",
          "In the contexts of humanitarian emergencies or where there is poverty and deprivation, additional support systems will often be needed to help children develop to the best of their potential.",

          "Nurse Ann-Marie Lawlee mostly works with the many homeless people who come into Dublin’s St James’s Hospital.",
          "The hospital normally has around 20 homeless in-patients, who have all had different experiences – often traumatic. “They have all been affected in different psychological and physical ways. It’s important for us to build a rapport and make them feel comfortable within the hospital environment.”",
          "But it’s not just a case of looking after people while they are in hospital. Leaving hospital, when you don’t have a home to go to, can be very challenging: “It’s important to plan their discharges carefully. I try to be aware of where people are going so I go and visit a lot of the hostels.”",
          "It’s also important to keep in touch with former patients to ensure that they get follow-up treatment. Under a  new scheme called “inclusion health” Ann-Marie and her team keep information flowing between social workers, community health workers, nurses, GPs,  treatment centres, and the other major hospital in Dublin. This is vital because a lot of patients go from one hospital to the other. The scheme is also building up a set of drop-in clinics where people can access nurse specialists in various illnesses as well as social workers and other team members.",
          "28-year-old George says he appreciates the support he is getting from the system. He spent much of his childhood in care and has been in jail or homeless since he was 17. He’s been struggling to give up drugs and is cautiously optimistic. He has a social worker and he’s following a community employment scheme. The course is five days a week, all the other participants are trying to get clean too, and George says he loves it. “But then I leave at 4 o’clock and I’m back to the hectic state of homelessness.”",
          "George was in hospital to have a blood clot treated, but he also needs regular medical services to treat his hepatitis and epilepsy and to give him the methadone he requires. He tried to discharge himself but Ann-Marie and his social worker encouraged him to stay. “She said she could link in with my key worker and all of these people from homeless services to hopefully get something sorted so when I get back out I’m not going straight back out to the hectic-ness… When you’re on your own it drains you, you need someone to give it a bit of push, someone to fight for you and say: ‘This man needs help.’”",

          "The Ministry of Health of Zambia launched its first-ever National Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) strategic plan, as part of its five-year health plan (2017-2021), in response to the World Health Assembly resolution on prevention of deafness and hearing loss.",
          "While the plan aims to provide equal access to cost effective and high-quality health services for ENT care to communities across the country, the lack of qualified professionals is making this extremely challenging.",
          "With five ENT specialists and one audiologist serving a population of 17 million, it is crucial to develop task-sharing strategies to address the needs of the population.",
          "Nurses from 92 health facilities across Zambia stepped up and underwent two-weeks of training in hearing assessment and ear examinations. Twenty-eight nurses have been trained to-date and are the key drivers in improving access and raising awareness on hearing loss in the country. Over 15 000 people have already been reached with interventions to prevent, identify and address hearing loss through these efforts.",
          "One such nurse is Precious Nyanga from the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka. Having undergone the training, Precious confidently manages common ear and hearing problems and refers any cases which require specialist attention.",
          "\"My job is to assess hearing and carry out ear examinations. Those found with hearing loss are fitted with hearing aids so that they can communicate with their loved ones. When one is not able to hear, they become isolated or isolate themselves which may lead to depression. For children who have hearing loss, they are not able to speak because to be able to speak, one needs to hear. Unfortunately, these children are deemed dull and sometimes useless, so my job is to make sure that I help them.\"",
          "\"The three-year old child pictured here was brought to the clinic by her mother because she could not talk. She was assessed with play audiometry hearing screening test and found to have severe hearing loss. She was then fitted with hearing aids and immediately started speech therapy. Now, she is able to communicate with the people around her.\"",
          "Outreach health services ─ especially to the most vulnerable populations and raising awareness ─ is at the core of the national strategic plan.",
          "Nurses are often referred to as the ‘boots on the ground’ as they are responsible for the implementation of government policies and translating them into grassroot actions.",
          "Nurse Carol, is at the forefront, leading community outreach in Zambia.",
          "\"We provide outreach services to communities who may not know about the various health services we provide including hearing assessments and ear examinations, including those who do not have the means to go to the hospital.\"",

          "More than 150 countries currently use the WHO list to work out which medicines best meet their national health contexts and priorities, so they can compile their own national essential medicines lists.",
          "Essential medicines are those that satisfy the priority health care needs of a population. They are the medicines that need to be available in a functioning health system at all times, in appropriate dosage forms, of assured quality, and at prices individuals and the community can afford.",
          "Keeping up-to-date lists of the most important medicines a country needs is key to achieving health for all in a sustainable way.",
          "Since 1977, the WHO list has been revised every 2 years (most recently in 2019) by a group of experts and published in print or PDF formats. It includes information about available dose forms and strengths; specifications as to who should take a medicine; what conditions a medicine can treat and how it should be taken, as well as details about the clinical evidence supporting recommendations being made.",
          "The new electronic version brings the traditional EML to smartphones and computer screens in a comprehensive, freely accessible, online database. Instead of flicking through pages of information, users can search by simply clicking on the name of a medicine, for example, or a health issue. They can also make their own customized lists by exporting the list – in full or in part – into an Excel or Word version.",

The World Health Organization is supporting countries across Africa to step up measures necessary to quickly diagnose and control widespread infection should the virus transmission reach the continent.",
          "Ethiopia is strengthening surveillance, diagnostics and medical care and public health information and education in readiness for a potential coronavirus outbreak. As COVID-19 is a new pathogen, Ethiopia, like many other countries, lacked the capacity to diagnose it. Adamu Tayachew heads an eight-member technician team at the National Influenza and Arbovirus Laboratory. “We started collecting samples on 25 January 2020. We shipped 11 samples in three phases to South Africa for analysis. The remaining we tested here. The shipment involved a lot of people and complex coordination. It called for working with several bodies to ship the samples and then following up on the results.” WHO has sent reagents to more than 20 countries in Africa, including Ethiopia, to boost diagnostic capacity. Ethiopia’s National Influenza and Arbovirus started testing for the virus on 7 February. “The test is not complicated. We now have the reagents and the necessary documentation. Once the samples are submitted we provide results within the same day. Currently we receive up to four samples a day for testing, but we anticipate that this will increase,” says Mr Adamu."

Virus detection requires high complexity tests that identify the specific genetic fingerprint of the virus. To support the implementation of the virus detection in Barbados, WHO/PAHO conducted trainings at the Best-dos Santos Public Health Laboratory. The two-day training which commenced on 10 February 2020, was facilitated by Virologist, Dr Lionel Gresh. Included in the training was a review of the current knowledge about this novel pathogen, as well as the hands-on implementation of its detection. Dr Gresh said that: A highly-motivated team that included five medical laboratory technologists and the laboratory Director participated in the training, and as a result, Barbados now has the capacity of testing any case that might fit the current testing criteria for COVID-19."

          "Trecia Simone Stewart is an emergency nurse working in a hospital situated between two major highways and what she describes as some “volatile” communities in Spanish Town, Jamaica. The hospital treats a large number of trauma patients with injuries including gunshot wounds and road traffic accidents. It has also recently had to manage a large dengue outbreak.",
          "“I love the fact that I’m the first person that the person comes in contact with when they come into the emergency department and the fact that whatever care I provide for the patient will be a lasting one. So, I try to always provide quality patient care and I try to always do my best so that my patient is given the best healthcare. I want the patient to be treated how I would want to be treated if I was in a healthcare facility, so I am going to give my best so that quality care is given.”",
          "Getting good care to patients has been easier since the creation of a new, bigger emergency department, but it’s still not big enough to cope with the fast-growing local population.  “The hospital was built in 1952, but since then we have had a lot of development and the population has basically outgrown the size of the hospital.”",
          "Trecia also highlights the fact that many colleagues are migrating – moving away to work in other hospitals or leaving the country completely – leaving the centre short of staff.",
          "She is proud to be a nurse: “Nursing is a very noble profession. It’s good to see the World Health Organization recognizing the work we do. And just a quote from Calvin Coolidge, ‘No person has ever been honored for what he received. Honour has been the reward for what he gave.’ That’s a nurse. “",
          "Patient Sherycka Hall agrees: “Nurses are the first people you see when you enter the hospital, they do your tests, ask you, if they can give you any advice they do and then they send you over to the doctor. Even if chaos is happening around him or her, they need to know how to control themselves within whatever situation.” And it helps when they are caring: “Nurse Trecia is a well-rounded person. She knows how to be calm in the midst of chaos, but she also has a big heart.”",

          "As a child, Alice Shiundu remembers going to hospitals with her mother and admiring the white uniforms and caps they wore. Her mother would address them as “Mother Teresa”, the name the Luhya people gave to nurses. Alice told her mother that she too wanted to be “Om Teresa” when she grew up. She’s worked as a nurse for more than 25 years now and is currently a nurse manager at a busy centre in Nairobi.",
          "It’s a big management job (the centre sees more than 3,000 people a day) and the days are long:  she starts at 6.30 in the morning and finishes at 8pm at night. Alice supervises 150 staff, and is responsible for budgeting and procurement.",
          "Alice sorts out problems, responds to complaints (and compliments), and deals with correspondence. She spends a fair amount of time in meetings – as well as walking round to make sure that everything is going smoothly – for the staff and the patients.",
          "Sarah Wambui Chege works with Alice as a nurse-midwife. She is proud of the progress they are making on “primary care nursing”. “This means the patient is assigned one nurse or doctor who will follow them and care for them throughout. The patients are able to ask questions directly to their nurse or doctor or midwife, which has helped the flow of work.”",
          "Sarah is fully trained in Emergency Obstetric Care and now herself trains doctor interns and student nurses. She says: “I love the good outcome when I work with a mother, monitor her labour, deliver her a healthy baby and she goes home happy with no complications. Seeing a mother go home safely with her baby, that makes me the happiest person.”",
          "Alice and Sarah are both very conscious of the need for resources, including having enough staff and beds. “The willpower is there to do your best to do the right procedures but sometimes the challenge is that there are no resources. This may compromise the quality of work that you are doing.”  Sadly, “If a nurse can’t provide something a customer needs, the nurse gets the blame. This can be very demotivating.”",
          "Both women place a high value on qualifications. Sarah says that “To be where I want to be, I would need to upgrade in learning and get advanced degrees in midwifery.” Alice is working towards a PhD: She also wants to see more nurses getting better qualifications. “I want to see a dynamic nursing profession where we can have many nurses with PhDs or master’s degrees, where we can also have our own nurse in Parliament fighting for the rights of nurses and the rights of health services in our country.”",

          "Heather Heinrichs is a midwife working in remote Hay River in Canada’s Northwest Territories – a sub-arctic town of 3,500 nestled on the south bank of Great Slave Lake. Until five years ago, women from Hay River who wanted to give birth had\n    to fly or drive around the huge expanse of lake to deliver in Yellowknife, the Territorial capital, or travel hundreds of kilometres south to larger centres.",
          "Now, pregnant women can have all of their antenatal care in Hay River. They can choose to deliver there in the birthing room that Heather and another midwife colleague manage at the Hay River Regional Health Centre. The midwives check in on newborns for\n    six weeks after they are born and provide continued services to women for one year.",
          "Shorter visits with the doctor",
          "“Before we set up the midwifery services here, women might see different doctors and nurses during their antenatal visits,” says Heather. That’s because Hay River, like many northern Canadian communities, relies a lot on ‘locum’\n    doctors – who travel to stay in the community for a few weeks at a time while the territory searches to fill a position, or the regular doctor is on leave.",
          "“Before it was hard – I had to tell each doctor or nurse the same thing, every time I had a check-up,” remembers Brandy Buggins, who has had four pregnancies in Hay River – most recently with her new baby Chloe.  “When\n    the midwives came, we got to know each other. This made me feel so secure. Being cared for by Heather has been awesome.”",
          "A deeper connection",
          "Heather identifies as Métis, tracing the descent of her family to the Métis Nation, one of the three distinct groups of Indigenous peoples in Canada.  When she completed her four-year midwifery degree, she began work with a midwifery\n    service focused on care for Indigenous people in downtown Toronto.",
          "She was struck by the gaps in access to health care for Canada’s Indigenous people, and about the unfair judgements that could result in poorer health outcomes. She saw the potential to improve those outcomes by incorporating the strengths of culture\n    and the long history of Indigenous women giving birth in their own communities, attended by experienced local women.",
          "“I learned about how to help people connect with their families – to call up their aunty, or mother or grandmother - and to learn from them. I learned how to treat birth as a ceremony, to cherish it as sacred.”",
          "New babies born in Hay River",
          "About half of Hay River’s residents identify as Indigenous – whether First Nations, Métis or Inuit.",
          "Before the midwifery service opened, women had to get to Yellowknife or another community with birthing services by 37 weeks of pregnancy.  “They may have gone alone, having to figure out who would look after their kids or elderly parents in\n    Hay River,” says Heather.",
          "Now, Heather and her colleague deliver anything between five and 25 babies each year. If a pregnancy is  higher risk, Heather will counsel the woman to deliver in Yellowknife.",
          "A first-hand view",
          "Natasha Cleary sits with Heather Heinrichs in her clinic office. She has come in for an antenatal check  from Enterprise, a small community about 30 kilometres south of Hay River. Heather has booked Natasha for an hour –to give plenty of time\n    for an examination, and to discuss any questions Natasha might have.",
          "During the exam, Heather talks to Natasha about how she’s feeling; draws blood for the laboratory; measures fetal growth and listens to its heartbeat. At first the heartbeat sounds fast – so Heather counsels Natasha to sit and relax for a\n    moment and drink a glass of water. After fifteen minutes or so Heather listens again to the fetal heartbeat. This time it’s completely normal. And there’s still plenty of time to talk about breastfeeding, breast pumping, natural ways to\n    relieve discomfort, and any other questions on Natasha’s mind.",
          "Heather will continue to monitor Natasha’s pregnancy in the few weeks remaining. “I’m really hoping to stay here in Hay River to give birth,” says Natasha. “It’s so much better. I don’t have to worry about what\n    to do with my three kids or how my husband will find extra time off work.”",
          "Future challenges and opportunities",
          "Heather loves her job. She and her colleagues have built beloved, comprehensive professional midwifery services where there were none before. Heather sees a world of expanding possibilities for women and families in the region, and even deeper bonds in\n    the community.",
          "“I love midwifery because of the connections we make with clients.  I love getting to know them and making a plan that will work for them. Through midwifery I can support people through a really challenging time and help them come through\n    all the stronger for it.”",

To that end, a consultation was organized to gather input from key stakeholders in order to determine the types of in vitro diagnostics for which prequalification is most needed and for which it will have the greatest benefit. The input received during the consultation was compiled and assessed by independent consultants. SAGE-IVD also provided recommendations. The final list of new IVDs accepted for prequalification assessment was determined in collaboration with WHO programmes.",
