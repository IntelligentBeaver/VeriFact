          "During a 2-day visit to the southern province of Cunene in October 2023, staff from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Angola assessed efforts to eradicate Guinea worm disease (also called dracunculiasis).",
          "The mission was led by WHO's Dr. Humphrey Karamagi and Dr. Maria Cecília de Almeida, who leads NTD control programmes within the national public health directorate in Luanda.",
          "In addition to visiting local civil and health authorities, the team made a couple of field visits. Notably, a trip to Namacunde emphasized collaborative efforts with neighbouring Namibia to sustain community-based, cross-border surveillance, while a visit to Onanime showcased efforts to treat water surfaces with molluscicides with the aim of preventing people from getting the infection.",
          "Angola never reported cases of dracunculiasis until recently. In 2018, a suspect case was detected through a nationwide case search held in conjunction with the national immunization campaign against measles and rubella. The specimen was sent to the WHO Collaborating Center for Dracunculiasis Eradication at the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, where a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test confirmed the worm as Dracunculus medinensis . Angola’s first case was an 8 year old girl from Cunene province.",
          "Since then, one additional case has been reported in 2019 and another one in 2020, while no more cases have been reported thereafter. However, risk of transmission remains; this is further complicated by the fact that endemic areas are located along the border with Namibia, with a risk of introduction of transmission from Angola to the neighbouring country, which was certified by WHO as transmission-free in 1999.",
          "It is therefore crucial that disease control activities including surveillance, awareness and vector control are sustained until when robust evidence of absence of guinea-worm disease in Angola is gathered and WHO can proceed with certification, as a key step towards global interruption of transmission.",
          "Communities where\r\ndracunculiasis cases were detected in 2018-2020 are located along the border\r\nwith Namibia. As people move across the border, the risk of introduction of\r\ntransmission from Angola to Namibia is substantial, and cross-border\r\nsurveillance is key to minimize such risk.",
          "Community sensitization and health education are key activities aimed at raising awareness of the disease. People living in areas of persisting transmission should know what to do in case they see a person with suspected infection, and take immediate action to prevent any further spread.",
          "The team interviewed local health staff with the aim of ascertaining capacities to detect and notify suspect cases, checking the level of community engagement in surveillance activities, and identifying any outstanding needs in terms of resources and equipment .",
          "Copepods are small aquatic crustaceans that live in stagnant freshwater. Also called “water fleas”, they can swallow the larvae of the Guinea worm and serve as vectors of infection when in turn they are swallowed by humans. They may be seen at naked eye but a magnifying glass can certainly help.",
          "Temephos (Abate ® ) is an organophosphate molluscicide used to treat water. This is usually done by specialized staff requiring dedicated equipment. It kills the copepods, thus minimizing the risk of transmission of Dracunculus medinensis to humans. Fine-mesh cloth filters can also be used to filter out the tiny crustaceans from water before drinking.",

        "content": [
          "Pakistan has made significant strides in advancing universal health coverage (UHC) since signing the UHC 2030 Global Compact in 2018. It became the first country to develop a UHC benefit package, based on the Disease Control Priorities, 3rd edition (DCP3). The country has begun phased implementation in 12 prioritized districts after the development of a UHC benefit package  in 2020, with the support of the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All (SDG3 GAP) partners, including  Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Global Financing Facility (GFF), Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Bank (WB) and World Health Organization (WHO). The SDG3 GAP coordination and alignment committee at country level has played a catalytic role in streamlining and enhancing coordination among development partners for primary healthcare (PHC) and health financing accelerators to drive UHC implementation.",
          "The effectiveness of the SDG3 GAP coordination and alignment committee became evident during the summer of 2022 when Pakistan experienced catastrophic floods resulting from heavy rains, glacial melt and landslides. Approximately 33 million people were affected, with nearly eight million people displaced and 1700 fatalities. The floods damaged the health infrastructure and impacted the health workforce, leading to the disruption of 13% of health facilities. The delivery of healthcare services from the community to the district level was markedly affected. Due to the disruption of services, the immediate focus shifted to the formidable task of conducting a post-disaster needs assessment (PDNA) . WHO led the health cluster for the PDNA, involving 22 national and international experts from seven entities, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), UNAIDS, UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, WB, and WHO. Most of these organizations were already collaborating under the SDG3 GAP committee and these connections proved instrumental in bringing all relevant partners together for the assessment and in sharing updates on their ongoing and planned activities in response to the floods.",
          "Visit to flood-affected area, Larkana, Pakistan, 12 September 2022. © WHO Pakistan/ Hamid Inam",
          "The PDNA involved a meticulous analysis of the flood's impact on the population, physical assets and healthcare services. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses, it identified the necessary response measures to restore essential and non-essential services as well as provided estimates for short-, medium- and long-term needs for infrastructure reconstruction and service delivery restoration. The total cost of damages in the health sector was estimated at US$109 million, with losses amounting to US$34 million. The projected costs for recovery and reconstruction were estimated at US$188 million.",
          "The PDNA report served as the baseline to develop the Resilient Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework (4RF), which, in turn, became Pakistan's blueprint for planning, financing, implementation and monitoring at national and provincial levels. The 4RF outlines key priorities for policy and operational reforms, including short-term plans to ensure uninterrupted health service delivery and to address social determinants as well as medium-term strategies, involving UHC and coordinated mechanisms, disease surveillance, health information systems and stable public financing. It was developed through consultation with key stakeholders, including federal and provincial governments and international development partners. The dynamic nature of the 4RF allows for regular updates to align with changing priorities and availability of resources, playing a vital role in monitoring and evaluating the recovery programme's progress and effectiveness.",
          "Medical camp supported by WHO, Sukkur, Pakistan, 12 September 2022. © WHO Pakistan/ Hamid Inam",
          "The PDNA and 4RF played a pivotal role in offering evidence-based estimates and strategies at the International Conference on Climate Resilient Pakistan, co-hosted by the Government of Pakistan and the UN in January 2023, in Geneva. The global conference served as a platform to secure international support and establish enduring partnerships, aimed at enhancing Pakistan’s climate resilience and adaptation efforts. This success highlighted the remarkable collaboration among partners, which proved invaluable in working cohesively on the PDNA and 4RF. It stands as a noteworthy example of practical endeavors that can be replicated at the implementation level within the health sector, through joint work plans and comprehensive monitoring and evaluation processes.",
          "Under the flood rehabilitation plan, development partners are supporting the Government of Pakistan through a resilient recovery, by reconstructing damaged health facilities and building the capacity of the health workforce. WHO Pakistan is working with the government to reconstruct the health sector infrastructure to provide essential health services. This includes the refurbishment of 464 PHC facilities, the strengthening of 169 basic emergency obstetric care (EmOC) service centers and the establishment of 88 nutrition stabilization centers in flood- affected districts. UNICEF provided essential PHC services to 6 083 267 flood-affected people through outreach and static facilities, refurbished 112 damaged facilities and supported 5000 lady health workers with essential supplies and basic equipment for community outreach. The GFATM provided financial support of US $48.25 million to support uninterrupted availability of lifesaving health products, thereby ensuring the continued access to free malaria and tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic and treatment services for communities during the humanitarian response phase. The funds have also been used to renovate health facilities and replace destroyed equipment in laboratories for building resilient health systems. Building on previous milestones As featured in the 2022 Country Case Study , the SDG3 GAP partners supported the strengthening of PHC and health financing to facilitate the implementation of the UHC benefit package for  integrated service delivery. However, the floods in 2022 severely damaged the health infrastructure, disrupting health service delivery, and there is a risk of a reversal of previous gains on the path to achieving UHC.",
          "Resilient health systems are vital foundations for robust and productive communities, delivering health services in an equitable, sustainable and effective manner. WHO, with GFATM’s support, provided technical assistance to the government to develop a resilient health systems component in the GFATM funding request 2024-26. The consultative process engaged federal and provincial governments, SDG3 GAP partners (UNAIDS, UNICEF, GFATM, UNFPA, UNDP), development partners and private sector representatives. The interventions outlined in the resilient health systems plan are primarily centered around PHC and community engagement. They aim to facilitate integrated service delivery, eliminate duplications, optimize resource allocation and enhance efficiency within programs associated with HIV, TB and Malaria. Further, this offers a significant opportunity for coordinated endeavors between the government and partners, including SDG3 GAP allies, with the potential to enhance collaboration during implementation and establish a robust resilient health systems framework for integrated service delivery, aligned to the National Health Support Project (NHSP).",
          "To address the issue of suboptimal coordination among partners, as reported by the Government in the SDG3 GAP monitoring framework survey , the SDG3 GAP coordination committee is actively working to strengthen coordination and collaboration among partners, both in the planning and implementation phases, to avoid fragmented efforts in their support to the Government. Over the past few years, this collaborative effort has witnessed many landmark developments, such as the joint high-level mission for “primary healthcare for universal health coverage” (PHC4UHC). The mission involved eight SDG3 GAP agencies and regular engagement through the SDG3 GAP coordination committee and technical working groups. The active participation of all partners in key initiatives, including the NHSP, the Model of Care, the resilient health systems component on the request for funding from GFATM, cross-programmatic efficiency analysis of selected vertical programs, the PDNA and the 4RF, among others.",
          "What is the SDG3 GAP?",
          "The Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Wellbeing for All (SDG3 GAP) is a set of commitments by 13 agencies that play significant roles in health, development, and humanitarian responses to help countries accelerate progress on the health-related SDG targets. The added value of the SDG3 GAP lies in strengthening collaboration across the agencies to take joint action and provide more coordinated support aligned to country owned and led national plans and strategies."

          "Anna*, a hairdresser from Benin City in Nigeria, experienced abuse at the hands of her father. Unable to receive justice due to lack of strong evidence, she decided to flee. Tempted by promises of better economic opportunities, Anna embarked on an irregular migration journey, unaware of the dangers that awaited her.",
          "“It was at my workplace that I got information [about migration],” she said. “My boss claimed his brother’s wife was abroad and I could work for her, and if I migrated out of the country now that I had all these hairdressing skills, I was going to make a lot of money in just a week, enough to pay off my [new] boss (madam).”",
          "Loaded into overcrowded trucks with poor hygiene conditions, Anna was smuggled from Nigeria to Libya. The conditions were deplorable, and she faced physical and sexual abuse from traffickers.",
          "“... When I asked what in was doing here, one of the traffickers slapped me in the face. ... I was dumped in the desert for two days. On the third day, another pickup truck came with four men. Each of them took turns on me. They all raped me in the desert.”",
          "Even upon reaching Libya, her health deteriorated. Despite her illness, she was forced into prostitution.",
          "After enduring four years and eight months of despair with no hope of returning home, and determined to search for better life conditions, she made the decision to attempt an irregular journey to Italy. However, she was intercepted at sea, and ultimately sent back to Nigeria.",

          "Returning to her home country, Anna faced stigma and discrimination, exacerbating her already fragile health conditions. Mocked and isolated, she lost her appetite and suffered of poor physical and mental health.",
          "“Neighbours laughed at me because I returned in the same state I went away [in poverty]. I suffered a lot of mockery, I was stigmatized, I used to hide indoors. I had no appetite to eat, whenever I saw food, my stomach would tighten up, due to worry. Sickness was finishing me.”",
          "Despite her ordeal, she recovered and now shares her story to raise awareness of safe, orderly and regular migration, emphasizing the importance of protecting one's well-being, and of making informed choices.",
          "“If it affects one person, it affects all of us,” she says, imploring young people to consider the risks associated with irregular migration. “Let’s try to migrate the right way,” she concludes.",
          "Photo credits: Jibril Olamide Baruma",
          "Anna's story is not unique, highlighting the hardships and risks that countless individuals face on their perilous journeys. Unfortunately, most never reach their intended destination or find their way back home. Even those who survive, they often endure sickness due to inadequate living and working conditions, lack of access to health care, and exposure to violence.",
          "Anna told her story in a video report produced for the Fourth WHO Global School on Refugee and Migrant Health, which gathered over 1600 representatives of governments, United Nations agencies, researchers, nongovernmental organizations, civil society, and migrant and refugee communities in person in Dakar and online to discuss effective strategies in tackling the non-medical factors impacting the health of migrants and refugees worldwide.",
          "“To protect and promote the health of refugees and migrants, we must address the social determinants of health. In practice, that means improving health care access without financial impediment; training culturally sensitive health care providers; tackling socio-economic disparities; fighting stigma and discrimination; and offering social integration and support programs,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, at the opening of the 2023 edition of the WHO Global School on Refugee and Migrant Health.",
          "On this International Migrants Day , let us reflect on the struggles faced by individuals like Anna and take action to create a world where migration is safe, regular, and where quality health care is accessible to all, regardless of their migration status.",

The head of the department was an outstanding scientist named Anatoly A. Smorodintsev who had isolated influenza viruses from patients in Leningrad between 1933 and 1936 and substantiated the possibility of attenuation, or altering the virus to make it harmless, to obtain a live influenza vaccine.",

The obtained FITC-conjugates proved to be useful in recognition of influenza cases and outbreaks during the 1968-1969 pandemic. Later the methods for their preparation were introduced into the experimental production of reagents in the newly organized All-Union Research Institute of Influenza of the Ministry of Health.",

Since 2010 we have introduced sentinel surveillance.",

They determined the pathways of SARS-CoV-2 introduction into Russia, identified numerous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 during long-term persistence of the virus in a patient with immunodeficiency, detected that virus in infected cats, and identified a new northwestern genetic variant (AT1).",
          "An important contribution to the antigenic characterization of influenza viruses was made by D.M. Danilenko as a result of cooperation with the WHO Collaborating Center in London and the introduction of the antigenic cartography method to visualize the antigenic relationships of influenza viruses circulating in the country and vaccine strains.",

          "On Universal Health Coverage Day 2023, we showcase various stories of hope and progress. In Burkina Faso, for example, district health facilities are better equipped to address the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases after receiving assistance to strengthen their health workforce and to deliver essential care. In Tajikistan, maternal and child mortality rates have decreased as a result of investments in infrastructure and health workforce training at primary care level. In India, communities living in the forests, many of whom have never visited a hospital in their lives, are now able to access basic health services during their weekly visits to their community markets. Mobile medical teams are using these markets as a strategic way to reach remote populations. In Lesotho, more lives are saved through the improvement of critical care capacities.

Sarah is one of over 2500 farmers across four Kenyan counties transitioning from growing tobacco to high iron beans through the Tobacco-Free Farms initiative . Sarah's story of resilience unfolds highlighting the transformation it has meant in her family’s life and for her community.",
          "High-iron bean farmer Sarah Ikarot stands in a field where tobacco once grew. Credit: World Food Programme.",
          "Introduced to tobacco farming in 2000 by her husband, Sarah faced insurmountable struggles, vividly recalling days when providing for her family was a challenge. \"I remember there were days I could not afford to buy clothes or support my children,\" says Sarah.",
          "Sarah Ikarot and her son, Allan Papa,      enjoy a meal of high-iron beans and rice. Credit: World Food Programme.",
          "Her son, Allan Ojolong Papa, echoes the difficulties of tobacco farming and its impact on education. \"At times, my dad would stop us from going to school so that we work in the farms. It was so discouraging,\" he admits. Yet, in those moments of doubt, a resolve emerged within him. \"I would think to myself, well, if I don't do this, I won't be able to go to school, and I'll be chased away,\" Allan reflects. \"This is what I used to pay my fees.\"",
          "Tobacco farming requires a lot more manual labour than high iron bean and many more months of labour, often requiring the entire family support to tend to the fields and cure the tobacco leaves. The tobacco crop also harms the soil and poison nearby water bodies, with nicotine seeping deep into the ground.",
          "Sarah recognized these challenges and strengthened her resolve to secure her family's future, which led her to embrace high iron bean farming.",
          "Through the Tobacco-Free Farms initiative, a joint UN effort by WHO, WFP, and FAO, Sarah found empowerment in an alternative livelihood. Transitioning to high iron beans brought a significant turnaround. \"I bought five packets of seeds, planted in a quarter-acre, and harvested 54kgs,\" says Sarah, who used the proceeds to support her daughter's education and clear her son's school fees. With her harvest, Sarah can feed her children and provide for her community– offering a healthy, locally produced crop.",
          "The initiative has created an enabling environment for farmers to shift away from tobacco through a supportive crop production and market driven ecosystem. In partnership with Farm to Market Alliance (FtMA) and the Ministry of Agriculture, the initiative is providing access to inputs, delivering trainings and aggregating crops all within walking distance of the farmers’ homes. This type of support is what allows farmers to access lucrative markets for their alternative crops, making the decision to shift away from tobacco an easy one. This is a stark contract to tobacco farming that often ends with farmers indebted to the tobacco industry or the entity selling them the crop because of little return from the crop.",
          "Sarah, now a vocal advocate for high iron beans, highlights their dual benefits as a source of food and income. She emphasizes the quicker return-on-investment and the nutritional value of high iron beans, a stark contrast to the demanding and less rewarding nature of tobacco farming.",
          "This ambitious endeavor not only seeks to break the chains of tobacco farming but also to empower farmers with sustainable alternatives that bring financial prosperity and food security, heralding a future where agriculture is both economically viable and environmentally sustainable.",
          "Stay tuned as we explore how the Tobacco-Free Farms initiative is rewriting the narrative for farmers and their families one success story at a time, and how its impact extends far beyond individual fields, fostering a ripple effect of positive change across communities.",

The course is developed for early- and mid-career NCD professionals, including researchers, policy-makers and postgraduate students. The course was initially conceptualized as a summer course, but became virtual due to COVID-19.",

The Region has the biggest number, and also some of the oldest WHO CCs. The first WHO CC was the Department of Biological Standardization at the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark, originally designated in 1948. The countries in the Region hosting the largest numbers of CCs are the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, the Russian Federation and Switzerland.",

Many WHO CCs have also supported  implementation activities in other countries, including countries from other WHO regions.",
          "To improve communication and boost networking, the WHO European Office conducts regular briefings and informal consultation for WHO CCs. Through regular briefings and leadership from the Regional Office, it shares their vision, announces milestones and gives updates. The briefings have “in focus” sessions, in which WHO CCs deep dive into the \"what\" and \"how\" in order to support the work of WHO and its implementation to the Member States.",

          "Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, cancers, respiratory disease and injuries are responsible for 80% of global deaths each year. To see progress in combating the spread of NCDs, it is critical to increase public awareness of the problem and how to prevent these diseases and injuries. Also, prioritizing road safety is essential to save lives and prevent injuries in a world where millions are affected by traffic accidents each year. However, these topics are often underreported and underestimated and in addition, there are also issues around how NCDs are covered in mainstream media: language, consistency in messaging, and an understanding of key underlying issues.",
          "This training aimed to improve the quality and quantity of media coverage on key issues around NCDs and injuries. More specifically, the goal is to help journalists have a clear understanding of the different NCD Diseases and risk factors, understand their role and embrace their responsibility as media to communicate these topics and to learn different angles when covering NCDs and injuries.",
          "As Ivo Rakovac, Special Representative and Officer in Charge at WHO Country Office Greece & Unit Head and Regional Adviser for NCD Surveillance Regional Director’s Special Initiative on NCDs and Innovation points out: “NCDs are causing 90% of deaths and 85% of disability in the WHO European Region. Tackling NCDs requires whole of society approach, and journalists and media  play key role in informing public and shaping opinion, including contributing to societal accountability. Therefore, it is important that journalists have comprehensive and unbiased knowledge about NCDs and work with WHO on its dissemination.”",
          "Each day included WHO experts and was supported by journalism networks including: BBC, BIRN, European Solutions Journalism Network, and the World Federation of Science Journalism.",
          "In January 2024 an online follow-up session will take place. WHO announced a global competition for the best article written on the topics of NCDs and Injuries to be awarded in early 2024."

Above, a pediatrician screens a young patient for a respiratory tract infection in Armenia. ©WHO/Nazik Armenakyan",
          "Out shopping one day, Vanessa Carter felt moisture on her cheek and looked in her rearview mirror. She saw pus seeping from an area of her face where she had undergone reconstructive surgery after a road accident.",
          "“I kind of freaked out. I hadn’t seen this before,” said Ms Carter, of South Africa. “They said to me, ‘Come in. This is an emergency. It must be an infection of the prosthetic.\"",
          "Over the following year Ms Carter’s infection would retreat and then rebound, eating away at her flesh as she consulted experts, received conflicting medical advice and ineffective treatments, and frantically searched online for answers.",
          "It took almost a year for her to get an accurate diagnosis: She had MRSA, a drug-resistant bacterial infection. She learned that many kinds of antibiotics would not work against MRSA. The realization helped lead her medical team to treatments that could work.",
          "“If I’d known earlier, maybe I wouldn’t have lost huge portions of my face,” said Ms Carter, the chair of WHO’s Taskforce of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Survivors . “I am not the only patient with a story like this. We know there are many, many more.”",
          "Ms Carter told her story at the October launch of WHO’s new publication , “People-centred approach to addressing antimicrobial resistance in human health: WHO core package of interventions to support national action plans.”",
          "The publication, prepared with financial support from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, presents a package of interventions countries should prioritize in their national action plans to counter AMR, a growing public health threat that kills at least 1.3 million people a year and contributes to the deaths of 4.9 million more people across the life course from neonates to the elderly. It puts all modern medicine at risk.",
          "Among the report’s recommendations is that countries promote the stories of people who, like Ms Carter, have fought drug-resistant infections, because their experiences often reveal gaps in health systems that prevent timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Patients’ stories can also point to factors that enable microbes to develop resistance to drugs in the first place: poor sanitation, inadequate hand washing, unaffordable treatments, unavailable tests, lack of awareness and training, lack of access to essential health services, and weak government regulation that enables substandard and falsified antibiotics to circulate.",
          "The people-centred approach aims to “shift the narrative of antimicrobial resistance away from the more traditional bugs-and-drugs discourse that we have used, towards a people-centred, humanized narrative,” said Dr Sarah Paulin-Deschenaux, technical officer in WHO’s Antimicrobial Resistance Division and one of the publication’s authors. “We hope this will enhance awareness and understanding of AMR among policymakers, because in all fairness, we still have a long way to go to really get full political and financial commitment to address this growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance.”",

          "China has almost 100 million people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and accounts for almost 25% of all COPD cases globally. Notably, COPD was the third leading cause of death in China and accounted for more than 0.9 million deaths in 2013. A nationwide intervention with integrated strategies and measures targeting COPD care in primary health care has been implemented with key initiatives, including screening for people at high risk of COPD and a national programme for improving use of lung function tests. Through efforts by the Chinese Government, the capacity of screening and management of COPD in primary health care has been greatly improved.",
          "This work is part of China’s Medium-to-long term plan of China for the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases (2017–2025), which aligns with the objectives of the WHO Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases ."

          "China has made strategic investments to improve the accessibility of COPD care service in primary health care institutes. This initiative encompasses an in-depth understanding of the COPD country profile, identification the gap in the accessibility and affordability of essential technique and medicines and the formulation of effective solutions to overcome challenges. The China Pulmonary Health Study, conducted from 2012 to 2015, revealed that 8.6% of the general Chinese adult population (or 99.9 million Chinese adults) aged 20 years or older in 2015 had spirometry-defined COPD, with only 10% ever having received a pulmonary function test. Recognizing this gap, the central Government of China launched a national project which allocated funds to equip primary health care institutes with portable spirometers and provided professional training to provide primary care workers.",
          "\"China recognizes the urgency of tackling COPD, a disease affecting millions of our citizens. Through strategic investments and targeted interventions, we have significantly improved the accessibility and quality of COPD care in our primary health care settings.” Said Professor Chen Wang, the Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre (WHO CC) in China, “by integrating WHO guidelines and collaborating closely, we aim to further enhance our COPD care capabilities and contribute to global efforts in combating noncommunicable diseases.\"",
          "The project’s goal was to improve their capabilities in the early detection and proficient management of COPD. As a result of the work, 30 000 portable spirometry equipment units have been distributed, covering nearly half of the primary care settings nationwide. Between 2020–2023, over 140 000 primary health care workers have received comprehensive training on pulmonary function tests, fortifying their skills in the early diagnosis of COPD. In October 2021 China initiated national COPD screening, and the WHO Collaborating Centre (WHO CC) China-Japan Friendship Hospital played a leadership role in steering this endeavour.",
          "Through a combination of questionnaires and portable spirometers, health care workers successfully screened nearly 1.5 million individuals within 2 years. This effort led to a substantial increase in the diagnosis of COPD patients. Those who have positive scores in COPD-SQ questionnaires but in normal FEV1/FVC ratio were identified as high-risk of COPD. They received early intervention education, including smoking cessation, and underwent repeat spirometry 1 year later.",
          "Improving access to the essential medicines for COPD patients is another crucial aspect of COPD care in primary health care services. In line with WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicine (WHO EML), the National Health Commission developed the National Essential Medicines List. Six essential inhaled bronchodilators were included in the catalogue of essential medicines covered by the national medical insurance system. This strategic inclusion ensures an ample range of treatment options within primary care settings."

China's commitment to improving accessibility, early diagnosis, and treatment aligns with the WHO's Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases.” Said Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Director of WHO’s Department for Noncommunicable Diseases, \"this partnership demonstrates the collective commitment to achieving the goals set forth in the WHO NCD Action Plan, paving the way for a healthier future\".",
          "To address the poor quality of COPD care service, the WHO CC initiated the Enjoying Breathing Programme in 2017. It aims to establish a new comprehensive COPD patients’ management model engaging all tiers of hospitals and disease prevention and control institutions. The programme spans the entire life course of COPD, including prevention, early detection, treatment, as well as regular follow up based on the triage of COPD patients. Most notably, the programme established a well-structured training framework including training the trainers, medical professionals in hospitals and primary care institutes, COPD patients training and self-management.",
          "To strengthen the quality of primary care services for COPD patients, health care providers undertook specialized training. The training focused on identifying the early conditions, chandelling with exacerbation situation and lifestyle prescription to enhance the medicine compliance. Simultaneously, the COPD patients’ education program was implemented to bridge the awareness gap, rectify poor self-management practices in preventing exacerbation and empower patients to make wise decisions during emergencies. During 2017–2023 the Enjoying Breathing Programme has proven impactful, benefiting over 60 000 COPD patients. Experts from the National Centre for Respiratory Medicine have offered online and on-site education to nearly 100 000 primary health care workers. This comprehensive COPD management network has been successfully implemented in 51 cities across China.",
          "The collaboration between China and WHO in advancing COPD care not only contributes to the well-being of 1.4 billion Chinese people but also serves as a model for global health initiatives. The achievements in reducing COPD-related morbidity and mortality in China have the potential to align with the goals of the WHO NCD Action Plan."

          "Against a backdrop of war, rabies in Ukraine is on the rise.",
          "Amid ongoing conflict, Ukraine faces another silent and deadly threat: rabies. When people abandoned their homes at the onset of the war, many were forced to leave their animals behind to fend for themselves.",
          "According to Olya Vasylyshyn, a veterinary student from Kyiv and member of the nongovernmental organization ZooPatrol Ukraine: “Over a million dogs are homeless, and the longer they are left to fend for themselves the more feral they are getting. We rescue, treat, rehabilitate and rehome cats and dogs.” .",
          "When food is scarce, dogs form packs and hunt together, increasing the competition for food and elevating the risk of conflict between animals and humans. In addition, agricultural land lies fallow, allowing rodent numbers to increase. This makes them an appealing food source for foxes, dogs and cats; in turn, these populations also are on the rise. Until relatively recently, Ukraine implemented a successful oral rabies campaign for fox populations and regular rabies vaccination campaigns for domestic animals. However, current circumstances have caused vaccine coverage to fall and immunization protection in animals has been waning fast. Cats also seem to currently play an unusually significant role in the epidemiology of rabies in Ukraine.",
          "Throughout 2023, according to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the country has seen a significant increase in the number of human bites from both domestic and wild animals, as well as laboratory-confirmed cases of rabies in animals. The number of emergency rabies prophylaxis treatments administered to victims has surged by more than 40% over the past 9 months.",
          "In response, the Ukrainian authorities requested the World Health Organization (WHO) to convene a multistakeholder rabies conference to map out a way forward for the control of rabies. The conference, held on 18-19 October in Lviv, Ukraine, was organized by WHO in cooperation with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Public Health Center, the State Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) with the financial support of the Government of Germany.",
          "Oleksandr Revnivtsev, National Survey Coordinator, FAO, commented: “WHO and FAO, two very active organizations assisting Ukraine today, have joined forces in the fight against rabies.”",
          "Representatives from the Ukrainian Oblast Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the regional-level State Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection, , regional departments of health, primary health care facilities, the State forestry agency, NGOs on veterinary practice, hunting, and evacuation of animals, medical and veterinary universities, civil society and international experts and partners participated.",
          "Participation was overwhelming with over 120 individuals in the room and 250 attending virtually.",
          "Olena Kuriata, One Health Officer, WHO Country Office in Ukraine, added: “This conference has demonstrated why the One Health approach is so important when dealing with threats such as rabies. The participants have mapped out that one of the first things to follow up on is to improve mechanisms and legislation for cross-sectoral collaboration among the human, animal health and wildlife sectors.”",
          "As a follow-up, the group agreed that improved animal population management, especially of wild and free-roaming domestic animals, was urgent.",
          "With a change in the evolving epidemiological situation, it is evident that there is a need for improved data and surveillance that can also inform community awareness.",
          "Katinka de Balogh, WHO Consultant on rabies, reflected: “Nowadays, so many parts of the world are in conflict. Ukraine sets the example by addressing rabies in a difficult and complex context. I wish Ukraine and all the participants a lot of success in eliminating rabies.”",
          "Ukraine is a large country where it will be important to stratify the rabies control efforts according to the ability to carry out prevention and control activities, and make sure that updated standard operating procedures for human bite case management and palliative care are in place everywhere.",
          "For Yurii Zhyhariev, National Professional Officer (Clinical Management), WHO Country Office in Ukraine: “The conference has had an overwhelming response that provided an opportunity for the exchange of knowledge and best practices while strengthening intersectoral and international collaboration and commitment towards a common approach to disease control and prevent the suffering of humans and animals from rabies in Ukraine.”"

In the east of the country, entire villages have been burned to the ground as intercommunal clashes and armed conflict rage, forcing people to leave their homes for their safety and survival. The area has also seen floods and landslides, further increasing the risk of outbreaks of deadly diseases.",

          "A concerning feature of this outbreak is that the country has reported consistently high cases throughout the year. After an initial peak in April, about a thousand cases have been reported each week. Larger and longer lasting outbreaks mean additional challenges for health workers, who are already overstretched, responding to a number of diseases in extremely challenging circumstances.",

          "Diana Adom* is one of the many Ghanian individuals who is finally receiving the mental health care she has needed—in her case, medication for schizophrenia. “It was difficult for me to even come out of the room as people hurled insults at me. My children were mocked and called ‘children of a mad woman’,” she says.",
          "Together with the United Kingdom’s Department of Health and Social Care, WHO has also supported Ghana to enhance the mental health and psychosocial support skills of 394 personnel, to strengthen available support systems in schools, at health facilities and in communities.",

Much of that success can be attributed to the many nurses who were trained to screen and treat straightforward cases at the primary health care level. Nurses like Marie Rose Kwitonda and Josephine Uwishooreye say the training has allowed them to help patients who would otherwise be waiting for a doctor.",

Recognizing communities as an integral part of health systems, the region’s 47 Member States adopted the \" Strengthening community protection and resilience: regional strategy for community engagement, 2023–2030 \", to build healthier and more resilient populations. The strategy centres on fostering trust and participation within communities, and points to behavioural sciences as means to inform effective policies and interventions.",
          "The African Region faces a disproportionately high disease burden, recurring health emergencies, and worryingly low access to essential health services. The strategy sets out a way forward to engage communities in developing responsive and equitable policies, participating in planning and service provision, and adopting behaviours that have a positive impact on health outcomes.",
          "Adopting a behavioural lens to inform actions",
          "The community engagement strategy prioritizes among others research, monitoring, evaluation and using lessons to inform interventions. This includes generating evidence about the community and with the community and ensuring capacity within Ministries of Health for collecting behavioural insights or data to inform policies and plans. In particular, it urges Member States to integrate behavioural insights functions, engage behavioural and social scientists and work with academic institutions to generate context specific data and evidence.",
          "This milestone achievement is the result of work by the Regional Office for Africa, together with the Behavioural Insights Unit at WHO headquarters, to increase and mainstream the use of behavioural sciences in the African Region’s health sector. Under the umbrella of the Behavioural Sciences for Better Health initiative, efforts undertaken until now have included working to facilitate collaboration, share knowledge, build capacity and demonstrate the potential of producing and using systematically context specific behavioural evidence.",
          "“From the very beginning of the behavioural insights for better health initiative, we have worked closely with the WHO Regional Office for Africa, achieving results such as strengthened skills and capacity and the collection of Covid-19 social and behavioural data through a dedicated data collection tool ,” said Elena Altieri, Behavioural Insights Head of Unit. “We’re thrilled to see this close collaboration result in mainstreaming behavioural sciences in the community engagement strategy for the region.”",
          "Global resolution for behavioural sciences",
          "The achievements in the African Region and inclusion of behavioural sciences in the recent community engagement strategy align with the global Behavioural Sciences for Better Health resolution (WHA 76.7) adopted earlier this year. The global resolution also recognizes behavioural sciences as essential to public health and urges Member States to boost evidence and capacity.",
          "Dr Doris Kirigia, WHO Regional Office for Africa Health Promotion and Determinants of Health Team Lead who was among regional behavioural insights focal points who gathered for the first time in July 2023 in Geneva, Switzerland to synchronize strategies, priorities, and plans on behavioural science for health observed:",
          "“I am resolutely inspired to champion the integration of behavioural science into public health practices within our own region,” said Dr Kirigia at the close of the meeting. “This not only promises effective solutions for the pressing health concerns affecting Africa but also offers a pathway to address health inequities rooted in intricate social, contextual, and political dynamics, while simultaneously fostering health promotion and community resilience in the face of recurring health emergencies.”",
          "Work to support implementation of the African Region community engagement strategy and mainstream behavioural sciences in health systems is ongoing. This includes a 2-year project to support embedding Behavioural Insights into academic institutions, WHO country offices and Ministries of Health in in Burkina Faso, Namibia, and Zambia.",
          "In addition to ongoing work in the African Region, the Behavioural Insights Unit is working closely across all other WHO Regional and Country offices to implement the global resolution."

In Nepal, two initiatives, the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Wellbeing for All (SDG3 GAP) and Health Data Collaborative (HDC), are working together to strengthen Nepal's civil registration and vital statistics system (CRVS) and national data systems. SDG3 GAP and HDC provide a collaborative platform that aligns technical and financial resources from various stakeholders to support the implementation of country-owned strategies and plans, focusing on SDG targets. Since 2019, Nepal has been a pilot country for SDG3 GAP implementation, focusing on data and digital strengthening, and in 2020 submitted a country position for HDC affiliation.",

          "In January 2023, a joint mission to Nepal was conducted by SDG3 GAP and HDC partners, co-lead by WHO, UNFPA, and UNICEF, in response to a request from the Nepalese government for assistance in enhancing Nepal's CRVS system, including through the integration of birth and death information into the civil registration process. The mission aimed to achieve three main objectives: to convene stakeholders from national, bilateral, and multinational partners in health and other sectors; to review ongoing activities and explore opportunities to expedite partners' collaborative support for Nepal CRVS Strategy 2019; and make recommendations for enhancing partners' alignment to Nepal's overall data and digital health objectives. Discussions also included support for Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for advancing national data systems. The meetings held as part of this joint mission showcased ongoing collaborative efforts that partners can leverage to accelerate progress.",
          "A key example of effective collaborative action was the impact of the country stakeholders of the CRVS Data and Digital Health Accelerator Working Group, initiated by SGD3 GAP and HDC partners and led by the Ministry of Health and Population. Under the stewardship of the Ministry of Health and Population, the Working Group facilitated dialogue between the different national CRVS coordinating institutions and in-country stakeholders, leading to coherence in implementing the CRVS strategy. A notable outcome of this improved coherence is that different national agencies are beginning to establish data-sharing agreements with the Department of National ID and Civil Registration (DoNIDCR), bringing the country closer to the goal of digital interoperability.",

Examples include the joint provision of technical assistance by World Bank, UNICEF and WHO to support development of the Vital Event Registration and Social Protection Management Information System (VERSP-MIS), which is the centralised repository for vital information that will also facilitate the data sharing and digital integration objectives of the CRVS strategy, leveraging on established data-sharing agreements between DoNIDCR and National Statistics Office. This data integration process aims to create a comprehensive network of interconnected systems, allowing efficient and streamlined data sharing among relevant sectors and institutions.",
          "CRVS data integration within the health information system is already ongoing through joint work between GIZ, UNICEF, UNFPA, and WHO to develop and implement two essential systems: the Birth Registration Management System (BRMS) and the Medical Certification of Cause of Death (MCCoD) to enhance the reporting of vital events, such as births and deaths, from health facilities. Following successful pilots in Sudur Paschim and Koshi provinces, UNICEF, GIZ, and WHO have  planned scaling up the two systems to other provinces and municipalities using joint financing and capacity-building. Once completed, these systems will enable automated digital notification and sharing of birth and death data from health facilities to the CRVS database. The partners are also actively supporting the Ministry of Health and Population to enhance the digital reporting capacity of health facilities across the country. This support aims to ensure that health services are well-prepared and equipped to meet the data needs of the CRVS system. To improve CRVS coverage, UNICEF and the World Bank have conducted awareness campaigns to promote demand for CRVS and connect eligible individuals to social support systems using civil registration as entry points.",
          "Through these efforts, and under the leadership of the Ministry of Home Affairs, online registration has been successfully implemented in 96% of local registrars' offices, with 6,519 out of 6,743 offices now equipped with the necessary digital infrastructure provided by the Government of Nepal and the World Bank. Furthermore, an impressive milestone has been achieved, with over 19 million historical paper-based civil registration records digitised as of January 2023. This milestone will preserve and facilitate the accessibility of vital records for informed decision-making."

This strategic shift has been made possible through the in-country Data and Digital Health Accelerator Working Group that introduced and championed this innovative approach. In 2022, SDG3 GAP partners piloted a GAP monitoring framework in Nepal to track improvements in their collective efforts. This framework uses national government feedback to drive collaborative progress towards SDG3 goals. In 2022, feedback from Nepal highlighted collaboration best practices, such as the Nepal health sector-wide approach, that features partner alignment through pooled funding with the government. They also noted the benefits of aligning Joint Annual Reviews with national assessments, which reduces duplication, increase ownership, and enables further stakeholder engagement. These practices have enhanced collaboration, coordination, alignment with national plans and budget priorities, as well as partners' use of national monitoring systems. Challenges such as funding fluctuations, limited partner participation in pooled funding, and weak partner-government joint monitoring were identified as areas of much needed improvement. Addressing these issues will strengthen and accelerate progress towards Nepal's data and digital and broader health objectives.",
          "Nepal is not only working to improve data availability, but also actively strengthening data use to improve health-related SDG outcomes through the WHO Delivery for Impact approach. As a pilot country for this initiative, the Government of Nepal implements a 100-day challenge with data-driven and impact-focused planning and prioritisation to boost progress. This effort focuses on advancing priority health indicators and effectively leveraging integrated platforms and multisectoral strategies to address critical gaps. Using data-informed acceleration scenarios, the Government of Nepal has identified five priority areas: maternal mortality, tuberculosis, suicide mortality, cervical cancer, and health emergency management to strategically drive measurable impact toward national targets by 2027."

The Tajikistan government has, as a result, progressively increased funding for primary care services, resulting in higher government health spending and an overall increase in public health spending as a percentage of GDP. 1 Health financing reforms are underway to provide a more comprehensive and unified approach to healthcare financing, fostering a move from input-based resource allocations to strategic purchasing of primary healthcare services. Progressively increasing public resources available for PHC is pivotal to improving communities’ access to essential healthcare services.",
          "Improving the demand for and access to primary care services is another crucial aspect of Tajikistan's transition. The country is shifting from a system heavily reliant on hospital-based secondary and tertiary care towards primary care and public health, increasing the portion of their public health budget allocated to PHC, rising from 34.6% in 2010 to 40.7% in 2022. 1 As a result, the number of PHC visits per person has been rising steadily from 4.8 in 2010 to 7.6 in 2022. 2 To further improve access to essential health services, especially to the poorest and most vulnerable households, Tajikistan is also revising the Basic Benefit Package (BBP), using a phased implementation starting with priority groups alongside additional co-payment arrangements. As of 2021, the BBP covers 33.1% of the Tajikistan population, 2 with ongoing efforts to expand coverage and harmonise different co-payment and fee-for-service arrangements to reduce financial barriers to healthcare.",
          "Tajikistan has also made strategic investments to improve the organisation and strengthen the quality of primary care services. These investments are aimed at reducing the fragmentation of services by incorporating established vertical health services under a unified PHC structure within the framework set by the National PHC Development Master Plan.  Medical and nursing education changes have been implemented to bridge human resource gaps in family medicine doctors (FMDs) and nurses (FMNs) to provide essential primary care services. The proportion of primary healthcare institutions practising family medicine principles has increased from 56% in 2010 to 88% in 2022. Between 2010 and 2022, the number of doctors who have had family medicine training increased from 271 (4.4%)  to 4597 (82.3%), with the number of nurses also increasing from 327 (3%)  to 9669 (73.4%). 1",

The statement was endorsed by all key development partners and signed personally by the Minister of Health of Tajikistan. In September 2023, the Head of the Department of Health Reforms and International Relations at the Ministry of Health presented the key priorities for improving PHC to SDG3 GAP focal points through the PHC Accelerator (PHC-A) working group. The dialogue identified areas to strengthen PHC, such as revising regulatory documents, enhancing management skills, implementing a Districts of Excellence PHC model, and modernizing emergency medical services.",

Notably, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, in conjunction with the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children, and Adolescents (GFF), have taken a lead role in developing a Prioritized Investment Plan (PIP). This plan, created in close cooperation with all partners, serves as a roadmap for implementing the 2030 National Health Strategy. Within the PIP, clear details regarding the costs of priority activities and investments have been outlined for the next three years, allowing development partners to align their programs and investments in the healthcare sector. Simultaneously, the World Bank and the GFF are actively supporting a government investment plan, spearheaded by Tajikistan's Ministries of Finance and Health.

For instance, the European Union (EU)-funded Health Development Program, implemented by WHO, UNICEF, and GIZ, is strengthening health-sector governance, financing, and access to quality integrated primary care services. WHO, the GFF and the World Bank work closely together to support the Government in implementing critical health financing and service delivery reforms to improve the efficiency of PHC. WHO is supporting the piloting of strategic purchasing of PHC services, while the World Bank’s new Project, the Tajikistan Millati Solim Project, will scale up these reforms.

          "With the expected rollout of a new vaccine coming soon, children in the so-called ‘meningitis belt’ across central Africa may be spared the kind of struggles and challenges facing Evariste and millions like him affected by what can be a killer infection. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, in 2019, there were an estimated 236 000 deaths and 2.51 million incident cases due to meningitis globally (1). It is the second-highest cause of neurological disorders in Africa.",
          "Meningitis comes in many forms, most often due to bacteria or viruses, but meningitis can also be due to other causes including fungi and parasites. Bacterial meningitis can be the most lethal and is an infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The meningitis belt is a geographical region in sub-Saharan Africa particularly prone to seasonal meningitis epidemics, and the area carries the highest burden of the disease globally. The belt covers 26 countries stretching from Senegal in west Africa to Ethiopia in the east.",
          "In July 2023 WHO pre-qualified a novel meningococcal conjugate vaccine developed by the Serum Institute of India and the global health nonprofit PATH that protects against meningitis together with research sites across Africa, India, and the USA. It’s expected to be more affordable and accessible to meningitis belt countries than current multivalent meningococcal vaccines, which are by and large too expensive for these countries to include in routine vaccination programs (2).",
          "WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) reviewed the evidence of clinical trials, epidemiology, and strategic modelling research in September 2023. SAGE then advised all countries in the meningitis belt to introduce the new vaccine, which it described as Men5CV, into their routine immunization programmes: a single dose scheduled at 9 to 18 months of age.",
          "The vaccine Men5CV has the potential to drastically change the landscape of the fight against meningitis in what is one of the poorer and under-resourced parts of the world, and it feeds the hope that this debilitating disease can one day—soon—be done away with. Effective delivery and distribution of the vaccine will be instrumental in eliminating epidemic bacterial meningitis by 2030. This is the first visionary goal of the WHO Global Road Map for Defeating\r\n        Meningitis by 2030 which was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in November 2020 during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic; the road map was then\r\n launched in September 2021.",
          "Its introduction will also affect the near-term strategies and efforts aimed at rolling back the disease. For countries in the African meningitis belt, SAGE advice on Men5CV calls to roll out Men5CV through their routine immunization schedules; it also advises high-risk countries and countries with high-risk districts——to launch a mass campaign with the new vaccine that would target everyone aged between 1 and 19.",
          "The burden of meningitis goes much further than its threat as a potential killer or getting through what can be a serious infection. Its secondary effects can be devastating and life-altering: hearing loss, brain damage, seizures, limb loss or other disabilities can follow in one in five. It mostly strikes younger people, but adults also can develop infection . And even though effective vaccines against a number of meningitis-causing bacteria are available in wealthier countries, some younger people remain unprotected .",
          "But advances in the meningitis field—and in the efforts to defeat it—are happening on a number of fronts (3). There is increasing public awareness of the clinical features of meningitis and the need to seek rapid treatment; progress is being made (4) in clinical and molecular-based diagnosis. Advances are also seen in developing a vaccine (5) against Group B Streptococcus, which is the main cause (6) of sepsis and meningitis in babies under 3 months of age in high-income countries. The new pentavalent meningitis vaccine builds on those that came before it: a monovalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine against serogroup A, MenACV, started rolling out in 2010. It led to the control of meningitis A in the meningitis belt and its virtual elimination. The last case of meningitis A in the belt was confirmed in 2017. But it could rebound if efforts tail off.",
          "Defeating vaccine-preventable bacterial meningitis would transform lives in a large part of the world, averting the deaths of children and saving the huge costs in time, resources, money and the burden that comes with the disabilities caused by infection.",
          "As Evariste Ringtoumda recounts, his family stood together as he recovered from his illness and struggled to adjust, but it wasn’t easy. Many people, in poorer and wealthier countries alike, but especially in lower-income countries, don’t have access to appropriate support. Care and support is and will remain an urgent need to meet for people who must live the rest of their lives with the aftereffects of infection.",

          "Launched in 2019, the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health aims to ensure universal health coverage involving access to quality and affordable care for mental health, neurological and substance use conditions for 100 million more people. The Special Initiative for Mental Health focuses on two strategic actions: advancing mental health policies, advocacy and human rights, and scaling up quality interventions and services for individuals with mental health, substance use and neurological conditions.",
          "Kathleen O'Donnell Burrows, Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Program Advisor, USAID shares insights on USAID’s partnership with the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health :",
          "Mental health promotion activities are essential to achieving USAID’s goals. Mental health conditions may preclude individuals from engaging in foreign assistance programs and opportunities that further their development and recovery, and the economic development and recovery of their communities and countries. USAID, through WHO, is investing in approaches to improve the performance of a nationwide mental health system in partnership with the local government, known as a systems-level initiative, that go beyond service provision interventions.",
          "USAID has supported WHO’s Special Initiative for Mental Health since its inception in 2019 and is among its top three donors. The Special Initiative employs a systems-strengthening approach that involves establishing community-based systems for mental health provision combined with the policies, structures, and processes required to sustain access to these services. This approach maximizes access to appropriate and affordable mental health service provision for the population. This scope is a complex undertaking that requires close partnerships with multiple stakeholders (Ministries of Health, donors, WHO technical staff, and people with lived experiences) to design comprehensive, multi-faceted solutions that will impact the mental health environment in partner countries for years to come, for example strengthening mental health infrastructure to integrate mental health services in primary care.",
          "While mental health service delivery activities–including standalone individual or community-level interventions–are critical to address unmet mental health needs in certain contexts, on their own, these interventions can be short-term and fragmented if core challenges related to availability, access, delivery and uptake of services are not addressed. By focusing on countries (or large regions within countries) and supporting them consistently for up to five years, WHO and partners can address these issues through an integrated, comprehensive approach in that country (for example, advocating for specific policy changes that impact mental health services access nationwide). They can also glean systematic learnings to inform scaling up initiatives in additional countries. Long-term investments are necessary to go beyond service delivery and advance mental health policies and the right to mental health.",
          "Key outcomes from the Special Initiative indicate long-term reforms in national mental health systems",
          "USAID’s investment in the Special Initiative has resulted in tangible results, including governmental prioritization and investment towards mental health in Special Initiative countries. For example in the Philippines, the central government budget for mental health medications is increasing to 1 billion pesos in 2023 (up from 57 million pesos). In Ghana, the Ministry of Health allocation to mental health services has been raised from 1.0 percent to 1.4 percent of the annual health budget. Four partner countries (Nepal, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, and Jordan) undertook economic investment cases for mental health to better understand why it makes sense to invest in mental health for their population, taking into consideration a range of perspectives including return on investment figures and public health outcomes, which will help inform key budgetary and policy needs. In addition, some countries have created or updated their mental health policies and laws, including Paraguay’s Mental Health Law No. 7018 , Nepal’s National Action Plan for Suicide Prevention, and Zimbabwe’s inclusion of mental health services in the primary care essential services package.",
          "Further, most Special Initiative countries have endorsed or developed national mental health plans to integrate mental health within the healthcare system, for example Bangladesh’s National Mental Health Strategic Plan 2020-2030. These new laws, policies, and investments are meaningful. They impact how someone will be able to access appropriate mental health services not only today during the Special Initiative program but long after the initiative is complete.",
          "Prioritizing localization and commitment to investing in systems-level work",
          "USAID endorses the systems-strengthening transformational approach that underpins the Special Initiative for Mental Health. Results and outcomes from implementing countries, provide strong evidence in support of this approach. Such a systems-strengthening approach maximizes access to appropriate and affordable mental health services provision. This sustainable impact gets to the core of USAID’s localization priority and why USAID is committed to investing in systems-level work. The Special Initiative for Mental Health utilizes a participatory process, ensuring inclusion of mental health care staff, primary health care staff, and persons with lived experiences during the planning and implementation phases.",
          "Based on progress so far, we expect the success seen in Special Initiative countries, now mid-way through their work plans, to continue to grow and expand to ultimately support the advancement of improved mental health systems across all the countries we partner with at USAID."

          "This year, International Safe Abortion Day profiles the\r\n    unstoppable movement that is shaped by the diverse sexual and reproductive\r\n    health community around the world, dedicated to protecting and promoting\r\n    access to abortion care that is safe, affordable, timely and dignified. In a series of captivating stories, the World Health Organization together with  IBP Network  highlights some important key players in this abortion care movement: local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations (CSOs). In many parts of the world, these organizations are successfully translating WHO’s research and evidence-based recommendations into concrete actions that support women and girls’ agency and right to health. Each of these real-life stories highlights how local NGOs and CSOs have adapted and applied WHO recommendations in their various regions, countries, and communities to improve access to safe and person-centred abortion care. Beyond the guideline: real-life stories and impacts A range of actions are needed to address barriers to quality abortion care. Many of these actions are directly reflected in the WHO Abortion care guideline , and the WHO/IBP implementation stories provide captivating examples of how these issues have concretely been addressed at country and local level: 1. Decriminalization of abortion and removal of laws and policies that are barriers to access Our implementation story from PROMSEX showcases how persistent advocacy and litigation strategies were used in Peru to tackle misconceptions that abortion is illegal under all circumstances. Advocates for instance challenged medically unjustified waiting periods, the requirement of approvals from authorities, and efforts to limit the circumstances (or grounds) for when abortion is legally permitted. Advocacy led to a national abortion guideline that acknowledges abortion as a health-care service, and recognizes that safe, timely and respectful abortion can prevent severe and permanent damage to women’s health. 2. Empowering, supporting and protecting abortion care providers Colombian NGO Profamilia describes how they worked with both medical and administrative staff to address stigma, negative attitudes towards abortion, and conscientious objection, to ensure that abortion seekers are served with respect, empathy and without delays. 3. Ensuring access to self-management of abortion as an option to access medical abortion care In their implementation story from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Vitala Global shares how they worked together with local women and grass-root organizations to co-create a mobile phone app . This “digital self-care companion” supports women throughout the process of self-managing their medical abortions, in the context of a humanitarian crisis and restrictive laws. 4. Ensuring access to post-abortion care The NGO Reproductive Health Uganda combined a broad range of interventions to prevent unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions . The organization also increased uptake and quality of post-abortion care, including treatment of unsafe abortions and family planning. Their holistic approach included peer learning, community outreach, and leveraging male champions and religious leaders in the community to raise awareness and reduce stigma about comprehensive abortion care services. 5. Involving and reaching youth to safeguard abortion access for all  This year’s International Safe Abortion Day also has a particular focus on the essential role that young people play in championing advocacy for access to quality abortion, and how their fresh and innovative perspectives can accelerate universal access to abortion care. One such concrete example of how creative and youth-relevant approaches can improve awareness of and access to abortion care, can be found in the implementation story by Hidden Pockets Collective . Their experiences make up an inspiring tale of how an understanding of local social media behaviours and music preferences resulted in the use of Bollywood-style music videos, which helped to raise awareness of the right to sexual and reproductive health services including respectful, affordable and safe abortion. Collective actions advance sexual and reproductive health and rights Our five abortion care implementation stories remind us that equitable access to comprehensive abortion care requires multiple actions at different levels – across both the legal and health systems and within specific communities. They provide vivid examples of how global institutions such as WHO and local organizations together contribute to a movement that keeps making progress – even in the face of concerted efforts to rollback women and girls’ agency and rights – to safeguard health and well-being. Importantly, they are touching testimonies of how access to quality abortion make a real difference in the lives of real women and girls."

Advocacy led to a national abortion guideline that acknowledges abortion as a health-care service, and recognizes that safe, timely and respectful abortion can prevent severe and permanent damage to women’s health."

          "To ensure continued \r\ncollaboration among various agencies and stakeholders, the Ministry of \r\nSocial Affairs, UNHCR, IOM and WHO hosted a high-level MHPSS \r\nconference and parallel workshops on MHPSS preparedness. With the \r\npresence of both international and Estonian MHPSS practitioners, the \r\nMHPSS conference provided a platform for practitioners to exchange best \r\npractices and experiences—fostering shared learning.",

          "Speaking to the impact of Estonia’s work to \r\nstrengthen MHPSS preparedness, Katrin shared that “service providers now\r\n understand that everyone has a role to play in supporting people \r\naffected during a crisis, and the importance of working together to \r\naddress mental health needs.” To further build national capacities, \r\nEstonia’s Ministry of Social Affairs and WHO are hosting a global MHPSS \r\nPreparedness Workshop and Simulation in Estonia in September 2023.",
          "WHO is working with \r\nother Member States and partners in the region and globally to make \r\nMHPSS an integral part of all emergency preparedness plans and to build \r\nthe capacity of systems and services to provide quality mental health \r\nservices ready for any challenge.",

Today, with annual screening and support, she is healthier and no longer needs hospitalisation.",
          "“We used to have a lot of patients with advanced liver diseases and cirrhosis. Liver transplantation was not available nationally at the time. Then in 2010, Kazakhstan added viral hepatitis to the list of social significant diseases, and by law, this meant offering testing and treatment free of charge to everyone. Right now, irrespective of the stage of disease, everyone can get free treatment. It was good political leadership by the Ministry of Health,” said Kulpash Kaliaskarova, Professor of National Research Oncology Center and Chief Hepatologist to the Ministry of Health, Republic of Kazakhstan.",

Globally, 90% of people living with viral hepatitis do not know they have it, and each day 3 000 people die of the disease. WHO’s global hepatitis strategy, endorsed by WHO Member States, aims to reduce new hepatitis infections by 90% and deaths by 65% between 2016 and 2030."

          "Fotini Leobilla has dedicated her life to preventing drug overdose in Athens, Greece. In the early 1980’s she started using opioids and continued to use them until her husband died from an overdose in 1998. Through her recovery, she continues to recognize the shame that prevents people from seeking treatment. She is “haunted by the countless overdose victims” whom she has met along the way.",
          "Athens is one of many cities around the world that is working to fight the opioid crisis. Worldwide, roughly one third of the almost 600 000 annual deaths from drug use are caused by overdose, in most cases by opioid overdose.",
          "In addition to expanding access to treatment for substance use disorder, in March 2023, Greece through Ministry of Health and OKANA with strong support from the Prime Minister Mitsotakis, took action to expand access to a medication that can reverse opioid overdose within seconds by prioritizing policies that allow the use of naloxone.",
          "The City of Athens, has been a catalyst for this, joining the Partnership for Healthy Cities that helps support this initiative and added its weight to an alliance of local agencies that is determined to improve emergency response and treatment for people who use drugs. The Mayor of Athens, Kostas Bakoyannis, and the Ministry of Health along with stakeholders in the field are leading the campaign to create a new national law that would make naloxone more accessible, including the friends and loved ones of people that use drugs.",
          "As a result, Naloxone is now available in Greece to most health-care workers, but Fotini wants to expand access further so that everyone who uses drugs or could witness an opioid overdose can have the medication ready.",
          "The strategy of the City of Athens builds on decades of investment in harm reduction services provided through OKANA and the Organization Against Addictions ( KETHEA ) that have developed an extensive system of support for people living with substance use disorder.",
          "Globally, only one in five people who live with substance use disorder receive treatment, highlighting the significant barriers to accessing care.",
          "But in Greece, President of OKANA, Athanasios Theocharis, has helped pave the way toward a long-term and comprehensive therapeutic approach that is accessible to anyone struggling with opioid dependence.",
          "This inclusive therapy encompasses the restoration of both physical and mental health, as well as the re-integration of individuals into society. Among their services OKANA provides 64 facilities with opioid substitution therapy treatment centers,75 prevention centers and a drug consumption room.",
          "Presently, naloxone is administered by OKANA's health professionals and street workers in the field, and this is saving lives. To date, 373 experts have been trained and 131 overdose cases have been successfully reversed with naloxone to save lives.",
          "Bakoyannis made naloxone a central part of the city’s strategy to prevent deaths from opioid overdose by adding medication to the toolkit and empowering more communities (family, friends, and street work teams) that are trained to approach people and build trusting relationships.",
          "This approach aligns with WHO Guidelines on Community Management of Opioid Overdose , which recommends that people likely to witness an opioid overdose should have access to naloxone and be instructed in its administration to help prevent opioid overdose.",
          "“Medicines like naloxone and methadone are deemed essential by WHO to prevent and respond to drug overdoses and to treat drug use disorders,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, at the launch of the recent Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats in Washington, D.C. United States.",
          "The City of Athens was recognized for this initiative in March by the World Health Organization, Bloomberg Philanthropies and Vital Strategies at the Inaugural Partnership for Healthy Cities Summit in London.",
          "Mayor Bakoyannis cited cooperation and coordination as key elements for this initiative: “Gone are the days when each of us did our own thing, guided by our own good intentions. We must unite our voice with every agency, scientist, and family in order to change the legislative framework governing naloxone. Too many Athenians do not have access due to bureaucratic procedures. The failure of this model is obvious, it has reinforced a stigma rather than raising awareness.”",
          "George Kalamitsis, President of the Hellenic Liver Patient Association-Prometheus which is part of the city’s coalition said, “There is no true stereotype for people living with opioid addiction, such as the impoverished users often represented in the media. In truth, the victims are our family members, our spouses, our fellow students, and colleagues.”",
          "Fotini Leobilla knows all too well the importance of making naloxone more accessible. She recalls using opioids with someone who overdosed, but the fear of her own legal consequences nearly led her to leave the friend behind. Instead, she called emergency services so they could assist. Emergency services were able to locate the victim, provide naloxone, and immediately reverse the overdose.",
          "Fotini draws upon her personal experience to explain why she continues to advocate for new resources and support structures. “It is with an urgency born from my own experiences that I advocate for this life-saving antidote to be embraced and made widely accessible. Naloxone is not just a medication; it is a beacon of hope, a second chance, and an opportunity to reclaim lives otherwise lost to the shadows of addiction.”",

          "Clean water and sanitation remain the enormous needs: though camps like Bulengo are near Lake Kivu, its waters cannot be used without chlorination. While there are many toilets, they are full and have been for some time, without the money or resources to empty them. It is a daily issue, and it also opens the way to further disease outbreaks.",

It was supported by Gavi, UNICEF and WHO financially and logistically: 614 vaccination teams fanned out through the sites. WHO also stepped in to supply cholera treatment units in Bulengo, taking pressure off other overcrowded sites like nearby Kanyaruchinya.",

          "Rabies, a deadly viral disease, continues to have a profound impact on communities throughout Africa, causing progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. However, the good news is that rabies is 100% vaccine-preventable. Timely vaccination of exposed individuals, as well as vaccination of dogs and other animals to prevent infection at the source, has proven to be effective. Unfortunately, in many rabies-endemic countries, this strategy has not received sustained attention and investment.",
          "Among those most affected by rabies are children and young adolescents, as many of the victims are younger than 15 years old. Therefore, it is crucial to engage and empower these youths in rabies prevention and control activities and to raise awareness and welcome their fresh perspectives and innovative solutions.",
          "Let’s meet Yona Eliud Yangaza , an inspiring member of the youth-led registered nongovernmental organization the One Health Society – dedicated to fighting against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and antimicrobial resistance in the United Republic of Tanzania, Africa.",
          "Yona comes from Titye-Kasulu, a small rural village located in the Kigoma region in the western part of the country. His personal connection to the devastating effects of rabies became tragically apparent when his beloved friend, Aidan, was bitten by an infected dog and succumbed to the disease at the age of 13. Witnessing this deeply impacted Yona and fuelled his strong motivation to fight against NTDs like rabies.",
          "“ In rural areas of Africa, where access to medical facilities is limited, rabies presents a formidable challenge. Awareness campaigns play a climacteric role in apprising local populations about the significance of timely post-exposure prophylaxis and responsible pet ownership. By fostering a culture of alertness and tenderness, we can aspire towards a rabies-free continent. ” Yona Yangaza",
          "Recognizing that knowledge is power in the battle against rabies, Yona actively sought out information through workshops and books and in conversations with veterinary professionals to gain the necessary skills to make a difference. Africa has the youngest population in the world, presenting an immense potential for engagement and empowerment of its youth. To harness this potential, the One Health Society created a platform that interconnects young people from different sectors, such as animal health, human health and the environment, enabling them to collaborate in the fight against NTDs.",
          "Realizing the importance and potential of reaching out to and educating his peers, Yona -as a member of the One Health Society - along with the presidents of the Tanzania Medical Laboratory Students’ Associations (TAMELASA) established the Youth Engagements in Eradication of Rabies Awareness programme.",
          "Representatives of the Tanzania Medical Laboratory Students’ Associations",
          "This initiative started organizing workshops at the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (Dar es Salaam) and in local communities, disseminating information about the dangers of rabies and how to prevent it. To enhance their outreach, they created different information materials like brochures and posters, distributing them widely among their peers.",
          "“ Together, let’s make rabies history ” (TAMELASA campaign slogan)",
          "Setting themselves apart, they adopted various innovative approaches to combatting rabies and other NTDs. They for example effectively utilized social media platforms to spread their message and organized engaging events, such as community fairs and pet shows, where they interactively educated people about rabies and other NTDs. In collaboration with local artists, they create impactful visual campaigns that capture people’s attention and foster a deeper understanding of the issue among local communities.",
          "“ Vaccinating dogs, including puppies, is the most cost - effective strategy for preventing rabies in people because it stops the transmission at its source. ” Meseline Mulokozi",
          "However, this is just the beginning of their journey. Through collaboration and experience, they recognized the crucial importance of working across disciplines to combat rabies. As a result, they are planning to establish further partnerships with veterinary professionals, animal welfare organizations and local government authorities. They are passionate about advocating for rabies control with policy-makers, emphasizing the need to prioritize funding for dog vaccination programmes and ensure access to healthcare services for rabies prevention.",
          "Youth participation is undeniably crucial in the fight against rabies in Africa. The collaborative efforts between the One Health Society and TAMELASA exemplify the significant impact young individuals can make when they are empowered and supported.",
          "Continuing their mission to educate and raise awareness about rabies, the team aspires to inspire other youth organizations from various parts of Africa to join the movement. Through their collective efforts, they aim to create a ripple effect of youth-led initiatives, ultimately working towards a rabies-free Africa.",
          "Together, as One Youth for One Health, they have the power to foster sustainable change within their communities ."

          "For centuries across countries, people have turned to traditional healers, home remedies and ancient medicinal knowledge to address their health and well-being needs. According to the WHO Global Report on Traditional and Complementary Medicine (2019), various systems of traditional medicine being used around the world include acupuncture, herbal medicines, indigenous traditional medicine, homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathy, chiropractic, osteopathy, ayurvedic and Unani medicine. And one hundred and seventy WHO Member States have reported on the use of traditional medicine by their populations.",
          "Traditional medicine is sometimes seen as pre-scientific, its practices and treatments to be replaced by modern, better, more efficient science-based medicine.  What is less known, however, is its contribution to modern science and medicine, and a long history of traditional products and practices being translated into effective treatments for health conditions.",
          "Around 40% of pharmaceutical products today draw from nature and traditional knowledge, including landmark drugs: aspirin, artemisinin, and childhood cancer treatments. A closer look at these drugs reveals that the scientists behind them built off traditional knowledge to achieve their breakthrough discoveries.",
          "Tapping nature and indigenous knowledge to advance modern medicine",
          "After testing – unsuccessfully -- over 240 000 compounds for use in antimalarials, Chinese scientist Tu Youyou, head of the Project 523 to discover a cure for chloroquine-resistant malaria, turned to traditional Chinese medical literature for clues.  There, she and her team found a reference to sweet wormwood to treat intermittent fevers. In 1971, Tu Youyou’s team isolated artemisinin, an active compound in sweet wormwood that was particularly effective in treating malaria. Artemisinin is now recommended by the World Health Organization as the first and second line of treatment for malaria. In 2015, Tu Youyou was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her work on malaria, which has saved millions of lives.",
          "Willow bark as the basis of aspirin is another example of how nature and traditional knowledge have contributed to modern medicine. Over 3 500 years ago, bark from the willow tree was used as a pain reliever and an anti-inflammatory, by Sumerians and Egyptians. In later years, it was used to ease the pain of childbirth in ancient Greece and cure fevers. In the 1897, Bayer chemist Felix Hoffmann synthesized aspirin and the drug has gone on to improve, and save, the lives of millions of people every day – with multiple benefits including preventing heart attack or stroke, improving blood pressure, and relieving pain and swelling. Aspirin is now one of the most used drugs in the world.",
          "Aside from sweet wormwood and willow bark, the Madagascar periwinkle, hawthorn, foxglove, star anise and wild Mexican yam have contributed to medical breakthroughs including childhood cancer medicines and contraceptive pills. The Madagascar periwinkle, which is now the source of childhood cancer drugs vinblastine and vincristine has an exceptionally long history of being used as a medicinal plant and finds mention in Mesopotamian folklore, the Ayurveda system of traditional Indian medicine as well as traditional Chinese medicine. Medicinal plants like hawthorn and foxglove have been used to treat cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Other examples include: shikimic acid that is drawn from star anise and used in the manufacture of Tamiflu, antiviral medication that blocks the actions of influenza virus types A and B in the body; and norethindrone, derived from the wild Mexican yam, that is one of the first active ingredients in contraceptive pills.",
          "Modern medicine has built on what nature has to offer and has drawn upon traditional systems of knowledge of how these medicinal plants, herbs, roots, and bark were wielded to cure diseases across civilizations.",
          "Leveraging ancient practices to eradicate global diseases",
          "In addition to learning from how ancient cultures tapped natural resources for health, we have also looked to traditional community-based health practices for answers to modern diseases. The development of the smallpox vaccine in this global health success story is one such example.",
          "One of the deadliest diseases known to humans, smallpox remains the only human disease to have been eradicated. Over thousands of years, smallpox killed hundreds of millions of people around the world. Today’s vaccine for smallpox draws from the principle used in the ancient practice of variolation, where material from smallpox sores were transferred to healthy people, resulting in milder forms of illness. Ancient practices of variolation date back to as early as 200 BCE, with records of it being widely used in Asia and some parts of Africa.",
          "In 1721, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu observed the Turkish folk practice of inoculation among Greek and Armenian women, and successfully inoculated her own child against smallpox. This practice was also used in Persia, China, India and other countries. Similar accounts of enslaved West Africans in American colonies inoculating themselves against smallpox brought much needed attention to this ancient practice. Over time, through extensive testing, the traditional practice of inoculation was shown to effectively protect against smallpox—resulting in a widely used smallpox vaccine and ultimate eradication of this disease.",
          "Yoga and acupuncture are also examples of traditional healing practices that have been successfully used to address chronic health issues. Dr Susan Wieland, co-chair of the WHO Traditional Medicine External Advisory Group and Director of Cochrane Complementary Medicine, notes how “evidence from over 20 clinical trials indicates that yoga is effective in improving pain and back-related function in chronic non-specific lower back pain. The same holds true for acupuncture when it comes to pain relief.” Thus, research data underscores the value of these ancient practices that have gained popularity around the world, in modern times.",
          "In another example, Dr Wieland talks about how exposing babies with jaundice to sunlight—a timeless ayurvedic practice—corresponds to the modern medical treatment of phototherapy: \"we now understand the mechanism of why this (exposure to sunlight) is effective, how it converts bilirubin into an unconjugated form that can be excreted — so, we now have a different understanding of why it works. But traditional medicine understood that it did work.\"",
          "Expanding knowledge through new technologies",
          "Where else can traditional and Indigenous knowledge of the world around us guide the discovery for the health and well-being of the people and the planet?",
          "With remarkable and rapid modernization of the ways traditional medicine is being studied, new technologies and technological innovation could show the way and provide a deeper understanding of the tangible benefits of traditional medicine.",
          "Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a game-changer, revolutionizing the study and practice of traditional healing systems.  AI’s advanced algorithms and machine learning capabilities allow researchers to explore extensive traditional medical knowledge, mapping evidence and identifying once elusive patterns and trends.",
          "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has enabled the study of brain activity and measuring of relaxation responses of individuals engaged in traditional practices of yoga and meditation, which people around the world increasingly use for their mental health, stress management and overall well-being.  Taking clues from traditional uses, new clinically effective drugs can be identified through research methods such as ethnopharmacology and reverse pharmacology.",
          "It is an exciting time in research about traditional medicine products and practices, which are increasingly used by people around the world.  With increased use comes more research and more evidence to establish what works and what doesn’t.  And the research looks really promising."

          "It takes two days’ journey at least from Honiara, capital of the Solomon Islands, to reach the mountain village of Kuvamiti to provide and deliver routine health care and immunization for the people who live and work there. Supply efforts and logistics were even more arduous during the COVID-19 pandemic. A COVID-19 vaccination team driver and his colleague were nearly lost to strong undersurface river currents late last year near Kuvamiti.",
          "There are no bridges on this journey over more than 20 rivers.",
          "Instead those taking the path to Kuvamiti from the capital on the island of Guadalcanal must either range through by auto or wade across the waters. As shown in this photo essay from a field vaccination and health care expedition in May 2023 by a Guadalcanal Province team— supported by UNICEF, WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—it’s worth it. The people who live in the hill country around Kuvamiti make it so. Some of them walk for hours to meet the team on its rounds.",
          "17 May 2023. Sam the driver faces the river, again. Photo: © WHO / Neil Nuia",
          "Drivers, nurses, and the islanders themselves in the Solomons travel rugged terrain and open water, overcoming risk and fatigue, to deliver vital health care.",
          "This essay follows health care workers and bearers heading from the Totongo clinic, on the coast, inland to Kuvamiti village in the mountains. They are bringing COVID-19 and childhood vaccines as well as routine health care to villagers and those who live in the surroundings—some of whom will walk six hours to ensure a child’s check-up. From a vaccination perspective, it is an integrated effort meeting a variety of basic health care needs: treatments, therapeutics and vaccines for children, adolescents and adults. Looking ahead this approach may become increasingly common.",
          "The group huddles to consult and take the measure of the river, led by the medical truck driver, Sam, who works with the province. He’s also the risk manager for river fording. His experience is hard-won: in late 2022 during a COVID-19 vaccine delivery he and a colleague had to swim for it and abandon a vehicle being carried into dangerous deep water by this very same river, the Ruamiti.",

The country is working to catch up and maintain its childhood immunization programs and raise its rate of primary series COVID-19 vaccinations. That vaccination rate in this Pacific island nation stood at 32 percent as of January 2023, up from 9 percent the previous year.",
          "Heavy rains and erosion in the hills and mountains can block roads with landslides on the large island of Guadalcanal, as shown in this aerial view. The vaccination teams will get out and walk.",
          "Photo: © WHO / Neil Nuia",
          "Not everyone in Kuvamiti lives in the village—many people live in the surrounding hillsides and logging camps. As with this mother and child, they’ll walk down and travel the stunning but rugged walkways for a check-up, routine immunization or health care. Over the last year the vaccination teams have been carrying COVID-19 doses.",
          "When the word gets out that the team is in the area, people stop what they’re doing, pick up their medical records, and get moving.",

          "Nurse Rosemary Raikekeni runs the health clinic in Totongo on the coast of Guadalcanal, six bumpy hours’ drive from the capital. It is the nearest permanent clinic to the many villages in the far interior of the island. It is two hours by Land Cruiser to Kuvamiti village—if there are no landslides, and the rivers are all open for crossing or otherwise many hours’ walk.",
          "She is the vital link to health care for this part of the country, and is dedicated to it. She’s made that walk several times.",
          "The vaccination team from Honiara picks up Rose at the clinic in Totongo along with a colleague, a nursing trainee and her gear, and they set out together.",

Mathew, a health care worker with Guadalcanal Province, will put out an appeal to come for medical support, immunization services and COVID-19 vaccinations.",
          "Rose is a government-approved vaccinator. The Solomons could use more like her—she’s taken a trainee along this trip. The Solomons archipelago as a whole is spread out over 28,000 square kilometres, most of it water, and has a thinly distributed population. This means finding and retaining qualified health care workers is a constant challenge.",
          "Photo: © WHO / Neil Nuia",
          "Pop-up and informal clinics are the standard in the harder-to-reach parts of the country. The Solomons have several small permanent health care clinics like Totongo, Nurse Rose’s home base, ringed around the coast and dotted through the archipelago.",
          "But sparse populations and resources and geography make the interior a more challenging environment.",

Working with governments and essential partners, CoVDP provided urgent operational support to\r\n    the 34 countries that were at or below 10% full vaccination coverage in January 2022 on their pathways toward achieving national and global coverage targets. The greatest benefits of this approach were increases in full vaccination and booster\r\n    coverage for in both general and high-priority populations – older adults, healthcare workers, and persons with co-morbidities, including immunocompromised persons.",

The government will continue its efforts to provide free testing and treatment for all affected by hepatitis infection. Viral hepatitis can no longer be ignored. I, therefore, urge all Ugandans to come forward, test and know their hepatitis status. Mothers and caregivers should also endeavour to have their babies receive the hepatitis B birth dose and complete their pentavalent vaccine schedule,” said Dr Rachel Beyagira, Technical Officer on Hepatitis at the Ministry of Health Uganda.",

More than 30% of people infected with hepatitis B are aware of their status and can access comprehensive treatment services, including free medication. Around 90% of all infants receive childhood vaccinations. This success made Uganda the first country in Africa to reach and surpass WHO’s 2020 programme targets of diagnosing 30% of people living with hepatitis B, ensuring awareness of and access to care.",
          "“You can live a full, dignified life with hepatitis B, but the most important thing is prevention, especially vaccination in new-borns. For adults, testing, linking to care, education and treatment as needed are crucial; and lifelong therapy is often needed. The hepatitis community eagerly await the new WHO hepatitis B guideline that will provide guidance to simplify service delivery and ensure that more people are on treatment,” says Kenneth Kabagambe , founder of Uganda’s National Organization for People Living with Hepatitis B, a key partner in Uganda’s effort to combat viral hepatitis.",

WHO also conducted a rapid evaluation of the entire hepatitis programme in Uganda and provided tailored guidance based on local contexts. It also undertakes periodic reviews and updates to national hepatitis management guidelines and develops training tools to strengthen the capacity of health workers.",

Once the announcement had been made a trained search and rescue team were functional. They helped the community to move things to higher ground. Health care centers, schools, the police, the army and other agencies from the district all had response plans in place.",
          "Climate change is altering the world in which we live in. Weather has become more extreme, and natural disasters happen more often than before.  Flash floods have emerged as a persistent threat, endangering lives, homes, and livelihoods. Amidst this perilous environment, a silent killer lurks—the risk of drowning. Often underestimated, even knee-high water levels can prove deadly as individuals struggle to gauge depth and speed. In response to this pressing challenge, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has taken the lead in pioneering programmes to combat drowning and promote resilience in vulnerable communities such as Ban Kao Many.",
          "Drowning is the primary cause of death during sudden floods, accompanied by factors including cardiac arrest, hypothermia, and acute trauma. Moreover, contact with contaminated floodwater leads to acute illnesses, while the psychological toll leaves a trail of stress, anxiety, and depression.",
          "WMO's Flash Flood Guidance System (FFGS) has emerged as a life-saving resource in 72 countries, safeguarding over 3 billion lives. The FFGS has strengthened early warning systems and prevented numerous tragedies by offering guidance to forecasters on issuing flash flood alerts. Alongside, the WMO/GWP associated programme on flood management ensures the judicious use of non-structural measures such as floodplain, knowledge and awareness, land use planning, risk maps and early warning systems which support in minimizing casualties and maximizing the socio-economic benefits.",
          "Empowering communities with knowledge and awareness has drastically reduced drowning incidents in high-risk areas. Early warning systems are now more robust, and communities are equipped to respond swiftly to flash floods. The tangible results are reflected in the decline of drowning-related mortality rates.",
          "On the ground, the transformation is evident in the form of improved health services and healthier populations. Armed with accurate and timely information, people make informed decisions during flood events, effectively reducing loss of life. The bolstered psychological support services alleviate the mental anguish experienced by flood-affected communities.",
          "WMO is committed to expand the concept of integrated flood management globally.",
          "“Improving flood risk management locally and nationally is a core WHO recommendation towards preventing drowning deaths,” said Dr David Meddings, Technical Lead for Drowning Prevention at WHO. “The unique expertise required to effectively implement these initiatives requires our close collaboration with the disaster risk reduction sector, which includes UN agencies such as the WMO.”",
          "All FFGS activities are part of supporting the United Nations Secretary-General's call for Early Warnings for All in the next five years. UN Secretary-General António Guterres announced that WMO would “spearhead new action to ensure every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years.” The Early Warnings for All initiative represents an unprecedented opportunity to develop and implement people-centred, end-to-end early warning systems for floods, be they coastal, riverine, flash or urban, alone or in combination."

          "Brazil is blessed with abundant water resources, yet has long grappled with the tragic consequences of drowning. Every day, an average of 16 Brazilians lose their lives to drowning, with children and young adults being particularly vulnerable. The municipality of Marataises, along the Atlantic Ocean, was one of the places where drowning happened frequently. Yet things have now changed.",
          "Luke Luciano is a lifeguard and a drowning prevention programme manager for the Brazilian Lifesaving Society (SOBRASA), an organization that has undertaken a mission to educate the public and prevent drowning incidents. For him, changes over the past 12 years have been remarkable. SOBRASA assists local authorities in identifying drowning risks and developing customized prevention plans. They offer free technical support to public and private entities responsible for areas like public swimming pools, national park lakes, and waterways used by boats.",
          "According to Luke, people have changed how they behave around water in the municipality, and there are also broader social changes. “After participating in our fundamental school water safety program called Kim at School , children changed their behaviours around water by better recognizing risks,” says Luke. “The program also impacted families as children bought home our drowning prevention comic book with lots of tips to stay safe around water. Our education programs have worked very well over the years.”",
          "Brazil has one of the largest number of lifeguards in the world and yet these lifeguards cover no more than 30% of leisure aquatic environments. Expanding the lifeguard coverage alone would not be a strategic approach to tackle the problem comprehensively. Instead, SOBRASA has devised a strategy focused on educating the public on water safety, raising awareness about the risks associated with various water environments, and promoting responsible behaviour near water bodies.",
          "Over the course of 27 years, SOBRASA developed drowning prevention programmes aimed at reaching individuals of all ages and backgrounds.",
          "Through interactive sessions involving theatre, cartoons, comic books, and presentations by teachers, athletes, and lifeguards, SOBRASA developed a programme that has targeted elementary school children between the ages of 6 and 9, providing them with knowledge and skills related to water safety.",
          "Recognizing that surfers are often involved in water rescues, SOBRASA focused on teaching surfers basic drowning prevention techniques, rescue methods using surfboards, and first aid. With the participation of approximately 60 surfers per year, this initiative reached a total of 8,345 individuals over the years.",
          "Designed for health professionals, physical education instructors, aquatic athletes, parents, and individuals interested in the subject, SOBRASA has provided courses on drowning prevention, safe rescue techniques, and resuscitation. Conducted online and free of charge, these courses have also taken place in open environments such as beaches, swimming pools, rivers, or lakes. Over the past 25 years, this programme has extended to cover an average of 80 events annually, reaching more than 100,000 individuals.",
          "“This impressive work done by a civil society demostrates the importance of working with partners. They have contributed to the remarkable progress Brazil has made over the past 25 years to reduce drowning mortality by 47%.” says Dr David Szpilman, General-Secretary of SOBRASA."

Its concept was first initiated in 2013 in Capbreton, France.",

These skills, however, are very important to raise awareness of drowning prevention globally and to make these children feel safer and empowered in water environments.",
          "On the day, children are separated into small groups and participate in different workshops. These workshops are fun and varied, and combine theory and practice: Workshops cover Inshore rope rescue, Rescue tubes, Nipper Boards, Drowning prevention and CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation). These workshops form the cornerstone of the Water Safety Day activities, but they can change slightly depending on the location and the partners.",
          "Over the past decade, more than 1300 children have participated in these life-changing activities. Children discover lifesaving sports for the first time, leading them to share their experiences with family and friends. The programme has also contributed significantly to increased awareness of drowning prevention and water safety.",

          "Drowning is the leading cause of death among Thai children under 15 years old. Every year, 1,500 people drown in Thailand.  Recognizing the urgency of this public health crisis, the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) in Thailand took decisive action and spearheaded a comprehensive drowning prevention program. The MERIT MAKER initiative was developed, encompassing ten crucial components, including Management, Environment, Resuscitation, Information, Training (Survival Swimming), Media, Advocacy, Kindergarten/Day care, Education, and Research.",
          "“This approach guided all of our drowning prevention work in Thailand,” said Dr Tares Krassanairawiwong, Director General of the Department of Disease Control at MOPH. “Before, our public health officials didn’t really know where to start when talking about drowning, now, everything is based on the 10 components, they know what to do, how to train others and what to focus on.”",
          "Since its inception in 2015, the MERIT MAKER initiative has undergone continuous evolution and refinement to adapt to changing contexts and situations. The program encompasses a multidisciplinary approach, emphasizing community engagement and leveraging local resources for effective implementation.",
          "The MOPH played a pivotal role in driving and coordinating national policies and laws to protect the population from drowning. They established Thai Drowning Prevention Day, launched awareness campaigns, and integrated drowning prevention measures into various sectors, such as education and child health promotion. The Ministry also ensured that public health facilities incorporated drowning prevention programs into their ‘well baby’ clinics.",
          "Concrete actions have been taken to enforce safety regulations, such as introducing warning labels on baby bathtubs and setting swimming and water safety standards for water tourism. Furthermore, the MOPH collaborated with multiple agencies, including the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Interior, and Ministry of Transport, among others, to establish a comprehensive national drowning prevention system and network.",
          "The impact of the MERIT MAKER initiative has been significant. Since its implementation, drowning incidents among children under 15 have decreased by an impressive 33.5% between 2014 and 2020. These results highlight the program's effectiveness in saving lives and protecting communities.",
          "“Thailand have demonstrated drowning can be prevented at the national level through implementation of evidence-based, cost-effective drowning prevention interventions,” said Dr David Meddings, Technical Lead for Drowning Prevention at WHO. \"Further, Thailand have highlighted the importance of multisectoral collaboration for sustained, wide-scale drowning prevention programmes.”"

          "“The project, while contributing to enhanced safety of domestic passenger vessels in the Philippines, will also contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 8, 9, 14, and 17 by reducing risk to the safety of life onboard passenger ships including drowning and, reducing the potential of marine environment pollution resulting from marine accidents.\" said Dr. Heike Deggim, Director of the Maritime Safety Division of IMO.”",
          "Through the project, IMO has provided comprehensive recommendations which cover essential aspects of domestic ferry safety, including vessel classification, training facilities, safety management, embarkation controls, and occupational health and safety matters. These recommendations are poised to transform the safety landscape of domestic passenger ships, promoting clarity in the responsibilities of authorities, while ensuring the welfare of passengers and crew.",
          "This is only the beginning. As a next step, experts will test the efficacy of the implemented measures. By continuously evaluating and improving safety inspection and monitoring procedures, it is expected that this type of holistic approach will contribute to the overall safety system, including regulatory, technical and operational, relating to domestic ferries in the Philippines in a sustainable manner.",
          "Through this work, the IMO has played a pivotal role in providing specific recommendations to the Philippine authorities to bolster the safety standards of domestic passenger ships. These recommendations encompass short, medium, and long-term strategies aimed at ensuring the well-being of passengers and crew members alike. There is strong potential to roll-out this work to other countries requiring similar assistance.",
          "“Ensuring that people remain safe while travelling over water for daily purposes, such as to access employment or education, is a necessary component of drowning prevention which is tied closely to equity.” said Dr David Meddings, Technical Lead for Drowning Prevention at WHO. \"Through the newly established WHO global alliance on drowning prevention, we will collaborate closely with IMO and other organizations to address risk factors for drowning during routine commutes, ensuring that all people have access to safe and reliable transport over water, no matter where they live.”",

          "Commercial fisheries are a hazardous occupation. Every day, hundreds of fishers are injured and more than 80 fishers die while involved in fishing operations. Drowning is the main cause of fatalities in the sector, especially among small-scale fishers. Thousands of fishers drown every year: falling overboard, being caught under capsized fishing vessels or being pulled overboard by fishing gear are among the most common causes of drowning.",
          "The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is one of the first organizations that answered to the call to mark World Drowning Prevention Day.",
          "Over the years, FAO has been taking a comprehensive approach to fishing safety, with a focus on capacity development, codes of practice, fishing safety regulations and management, the promotion of use of personal flotation devices and other safety equipment, design and construction of safer vessels (including stability, repair and maintenance) and by promoting fisheries insurance services.",
          "“We are excited to mark another World Drowning Prevention Day. It is a day that we can work together with WHO to raise awareness on drowning, especially in the fishing industry,” said Ms Florence Poulain, Fishing safety officer of FAO. “FAO works with countries and partners to promote a safety culture in the industry, and we look forward to join forces to make that message even louder.”",
          "Many injuries occur in small-scale fisheries. In some regions, small-scale fishers are not carrying safety equipment on board. Few fishers are wearing life jackets.  Many small-scale fishing vessels do not have essential communication and emergency messaging equipment to reach emergency support in case of need.",
          "FAO is working with government counterparts to jointly rollout a train-the-trainer course on safety at sea for small scale fisheries. The train the trainers’ courses were implemented with 6 countries in the Caribbean region, 4 countries in the Pacific islands’ region, 4 countries in East Africa and virtually in the Near East and Central Asian regions and will soon be delivered in Sri Lanka and the Philippines.",
          "“Drowning is a multi-sectoral problem and drowning deaths among fishers is a clear illustration of this. Making fishing safer for fisherfolk is an important contribution to addressing the global drowning problem.” said Dr David Meddings, Technical Lead for Drowning Prevention at WHO. \"WHO is establishing a global alliance on drowning prevention. We look forward to working with FAO and other organizations to improve coordination, collaboration and accelerate drowning prevention efforts at global, regional and national levels.”",

          "“In the realm of public health, the detrimental effects of air pollution have long been a\r\ncause for concern. A disconcerting reality persists: the issue of air pollution remains\r\ninadequately integrated into the educational curricula of health professionals. By\r\nequipping health professionals with comprehensive knowledge and practical skills to\r\nunderstand, assess, and mitigate the health risks associated with air pollution, we can\r\nempower them to take proactive measures that protect people’s health.” Maria Neira, Director Department Environment,\r\nClimate Change and Health, WHO Air pollution is a public health\r\nemergency Each day, as we take a breath,\r\nan invisible storm of particles\r\nand molecules infiltrates our\r\nbodies, posing a threat not only\r\nto our lungs. Yet, have you ever truly pondered the significance\r\nof clean air as an important determinant of your health and wellbeing? Yet, it is a question that\r\nwarrants your consideration, for\r\nyou likely find yourself among\r\nthe vast majority – 99% of people exposed to air pollution levels\r\nthat exceed those recommended\r\nby WHO in their latest guidelines\r\npublished in 2021 . Air pollution is a major environmental threat and one of the\r\nmain cases of death among all\r\nrisk factors, ranking just below hypertension, tobacco smoking\r\nand high glucose . WHO estimates that, globally, air pollution is responsible for about 7 million\r\npremature deaths per year from\r\nischemic heart disease, stroke,\r\nchronic obstructive pulmonary\r\ndisease and lung cancer, but also\r\nfrom acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia which\r\nmainly affects children in low-\r\nand middle-income countries . Being recognized as one of the\r\nmain risk factors for Non-Communicable Diseases, a growing\r\nand consistent body of evidence\r\nshows that air pollution health\r\neffects also include preterm and\r\nlow-birthweight, asthma as well\r\nas cognitive and neurological\r\nimpairment basically having\r\nthe potential to impact our whole\r\nbody, way beyond our lungs. Air pollution is a threat also\r\nfor public health economy as it\r\nimposes enormous global health costs representing 6.1% of the\r\nglobal gross domestic product (more than US$ 8 trillion in 2019). © Vadim/Adobe Stock Breathing for tomorrow:\r\ntraining the next generation of health workers Put yourself in the shoes of a\r\nfamily doctor, faced with a young\r\ngirl who frequently suffers from\r\nasthma attacks. As you embark\r\non the journey of gathering her\r\nmedical history, you realize\r\nthat there might be more to the\r\nstory than meets the eye. Could\r\nair pollution be an underlying\r\nrisk factor worth considering in\r\nyour patient’s assessment? What\r\nadditional questions would you\r\npose? How would you advise her\r\nto reduce her risk? At present, health workers are\r\noften not aware of the health impacts of air pollution. This\r\nrisk factor is not sufficiently\r\naddressed in the curricula of\r\nhealth professionals, with only\r\n12% of medical schools world-\r\nwide including it as part of for-\r\nmal education, a study from the\r\nInternational Association of\r\nMedical Students’ Associations\r\nreports. As research is showing\r\nthat a strong incorporation of\r\nair pollution and health as part of clinical disease guidelines\r\nis missing , the results from a\r\nWorld Heart Federation members survey indicates that while\r\nair pollution is recognized as\r\none of the major risk factors for\r\ncardiovascular diseases, less\r\nthan 50% of the responders felt\r\nthat they have access to any\r\ntools and resources they need\r\nto better educate themselves\r\nand others . Yet, the international community recently recognized that the\r\nhealth workforce should play a\r\nmore prominent role in the battle\r\nfor clean air. The World Health\r\nAssembly resolutions WHA68.8,9\r\n“Health and the environment:\r\naddressing the health impact\r\nof air pollution” , and A69/18,10\r\n“Road map for an enhanced\r\nglobal response to the adverse\r\nhealth effects of air pollution” request WHO to strengthen the\r\ncapacity of the health sector to\r\naddress the adverse health effects\r\nof air pollution. In a landmark collaboration\r\nwith more than 30 international experts, the World Health\r\nOrganization has developed\r\nthe first WHO Air Pollution and\r\nHealth Training toolkit targeting\r\nhealth workers (APHT) set to be unveiled at the end of 2023. The\r\ntoolkit will be made of download-\r\nable and interactive resources to\r\ntrain health care workers, and\r\nbeyond. In preparation for the\r\ntoolkit launch, a freely accessible OpenWHO online training\r\nwill be released on the occasion\r\nof the UN International Day for\r\nClean Air and Blue Sky on 7 September 2023. © WHO/Blink Media/Tali Kimelman Training the trainers: a pilot\r\nworkshop in Ghana “If health workers are aware, they\r\ncan train their peers and advise\r\npeople in their neighborhoods\r\nand communities on how to\r\nreduce their risk” , said Edward\r\nOwusu, District Control Officer\r\nat the Regional Health Directorate, Central Ghana. Edward\r\nis one of the almost fifty health\r\nprofessionals that gathered in Kumasi, Ghana, in June 2022\r\nduring a one-week pilot workshop of the APHT toolkit led by WHO\r\nin collaboration with Ghana\r\nHealth Service. WHO also\r\ninvited experts from the Global\r\nFamily Doctors (WONCA) and University of Ghana . Participants\r\nwere exposed to a set of training\r\nmodules and multiple interactive\r\nsessions, tackling introductory\r\nmodules about air pollution and\r\nhealth as well as specific modules\r\nfor clinicians and care-givers\r\naddressing cardiovascular and\r\nrespiratory diseases as well as\r\nthe health effects of air pollution on newborns, children and\r\npregnant women. Using a train-the-trainer approach, the pilot\r\nworkshop allowed health professionals to gain appropriate skills\r\nand knowledge to act as trainers\r\nwith peer colleagues in the health sector and in the communities\r\nthey serve. The development of a\r\nclinical approach to air pollution\r\nwas enhanced using clinical case\r\nscenarios specifically designed\r\nto improve the clinical reason-\r\ning of health professionals, taking environmental risk factors\r\ninto proper consideration when\r\nassessing the health status of\r\na patient, and providing guidance for exposure reduction. A\r\nfield visit to hot spot air pollution\r\nsites was also organized. Piloting\r\ndirectly with the target audience\r\nensure relevance and provide\r\ninvaluable feedback for future\r\nadaptation and implementation\r\non the ground. © WHO/Ben Benasco Sackey Clean air interventions as a win-win-opportunity A reduction in air pollution emissions is a “win–win” opportunity to simultaneously protect human\r\nhealth and the environment and\r\nto address climate change mitigation, as the combustion of fossil fuels contributes to increasing\r\nthe levels of some air pollutants. In addition to interventions\r\nthat can take place in sectors\r\nlike household energy, transportation, power generation\r\nand industry, agriculture, and\r\nhousing , building the capacity of the health sector on air\r\npollution and health is essential to reduce the burden of\r\ndisease. Health workers have\r\na central role to play in this\r\neffort while engaging in multi-sectoral action and advocate\r\nfor clean air interventions that\r\naim at lowering emissions of\r\npollutants – and promote the\r\ncollaboration between all civil society relevant actors, political\r\nparties, and institutions for policy implementation. Their action is an unprecedented\r\nopportunity to protect and pro-\r\nmote both people’s health and\r\nwellbeing as well as the planet. While health care workers cannot\r\nreduce the emissions of air pollution alone, the constant trust\r\nbeing given to them and being at\r\nthe front line of prevention and\r\ncare, is a strong basis for providing guidance to individuals,\r\npatients and communities . Primary prevention and addressing\r\nroot causes of ill-health remains\r\ncrucial and needs to be strengthened, as it is cost-effective but\r\noften under-funded and over-\r\nlooked. The health argument\r\nneeds to be central to policy making in various sectors for a healthy\r\nplanet with healthy people. WHO\r\nleadership is now needed more\r\nthan ever. © Pexels"

          "As WHO celebrates\r\n    Self-Care Month (24 June – 24 July), we shine a spotlight on how self-care\r\n interventions are making a difference to the lives of people in Timor-Leste.",
          "“Timor-Leste is on the verge of a self-care revolution,” said Dr Arvind Mathur, WHO Representative to the island nation. “A lot has changed in terms of the way people approach their health and well-being due to improved access to healthcare in the country.”",
          "An estimated 3.6 billion people – half of the world – lack access to essential health services. WHO recommends self-care interventions for every country as a critical path to reach universal health coverage, promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable. This is especially true in a county like Timor-Leste where health infrastructure and access to specialized care can be limited.",
          "Working with the World\r\n    Health Organization (WHO), Timor-Leste's Ministry of Health is advancing the highest standard of\r\n    health for its people with the help of self-care interventions that screen for\r\n    diseases, expand options for health service delivery, and prevent illness,\r\n    while improving access to health services."

          "At\r\n designated drop-in centres 4,000 HIV self-tests have been made available and WHO\r\n    has been training outreach workers from those key populations to raise\r\n    awareness of HIV and self-testing; demonstrate how to use a self-test kit; and\r\n    encourage people to visit the centres to find out their status. Since the pilot\r\n    launch, over 700 people have taken a test. For those who test negative,\r\n    information is available about how to protect themselves in the future, while\r\n    those that test positive are referred for treatment.  To support\r\n    these efforts, WHO has also produced targeted information\r\n    leaflets, as well as materials aimed specifically at health workers and\r\n    counsellors.",
          "“I\r\n was surprised to find out there was no needle prick involved in this test,”\r\n    said a student from the national university in Dili. “I was nervous about\r\n    taking the test but the counsellor and health worker at the drop-in centre were\r\n    very helpful. They explained the entire process and also there was no pressure\r\n    to share the results unless I wanted to.”",
          "Another important\r\n    step in expanding self-care health options within the country will be the\r\n    introduction of self-sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) as part of the\r\n    national cervical cancer screening programme. In\r\n    Timor-Leste, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women. Almost\r\n    all (99%) cervical cancers are linked to HPV infections, an extremely common\r\n    virus transmitted through sexual contact.",
          "Self-sampling\r\n - where women are given a simple kit to take their own sample - is one of the\r\n    ways to test for the virus. Women can take the sample alone at home, in a\r\n    health clinic or another location typically using a swab (like a cotton bud) or\r\n    a soft brush.  The sample is then sent to\r\n    be checked at a laboratory and if positive, the woman is invited back for\r\n    further care.",
          "“We are committed to promoting self-care interventions in\r\n    all areas, including sexual and reproductive health, and our advocacy and\r\n    information, education and communication initiatives are strategically and\r\n    thoughtfully concentrated in this direction,” Dr Mathur said."

Timor-Leste also has a very young population: nearly half of Timor-Leste’s population is under 18 and according to a 2018 UNDP report, the country has one of the youngest populations in the Asia and Pacific region with a median age of 17.4 years. An estimated 19% of women 20-24 are married before they are 18, and almost a quarter are pregnant by the time they turn 20.",
          "Through an outreach initiative involving WHO, the Ministry of Health and agencies like Marie Stopes International, condoms and contraceptive pills are now available in every health outpost in the country. Awareness of these self-care options has been raised through focus group discussions and youth and parent corners and this, combined with their wider accessibility, is empowering people to take control of their reproductive health.",
          "“One visible change that I have seen is that women are seeking contraception more openly, and they are now often taking their own decisions in this area,” said Ms Fransisca Rosalina, a midwife for 28 years who works at the national hospital in Dili. “Previously, we had to speak to the husbands or other family members about family planning services. But now, women seek the information on their own. Many of them ask about it [contraception] when they are about to be discharged after childbirth.”",
          "“Self-care interventions are a crucial aspect of healthcare,” said Dr Odete Maria Freitas Belo, Minister of Health of Timor-Leste. “When self-care interventions are promoted, one promotes prevention of diseases as well as early diagnosis of diseases. In addition, self-care interventions also have the potential to reduce the financial burden on health systems and on individuals and communities, thus paving the way for Universal Health Coverage.”"

          "Some other countries achieved more modest results, still emerging from the project with better coverage than the continent’s 30% average. Those were Chad, Guinea, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Sudan.",
          "Burundi, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Mali also participated in the project and made gains. Combined, those five countries fully vaccinated 23.7 million people.",
          "Project data also shows that almost 26 million older people, group at high-risk for severe COVID-19 illness and death, received primary vaccinations. Among them was Makalé Camara, 70, of Conakry, Guinea.",
          "“I ended up agreeing to be vaccinated to protect myself,” said Makalé Camara, 70, who lives in Conakry, the country’s capital. “The fact that I could do so right here in my local health centre was also a big factor in my decision, as it made it convenient and accessible.”",
          "The work described in this story is made possible by a €16 million contribution to WHO from the European Commission’s Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO)."

          "The following Q&A was developed by the Global Malaria Programme in collaboration with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Belize nearly eliminated malaria in the early 1960s. What interventions were used at that time to control malaria, and why was the elimination target not reached? Beginning in 1950, Belize launched a targeted programme aimed at eliminating malaria nationwide. Key actions included spraying households with insecticides and stepped-up efforts to detect malaria cases through the use of vector control staff, health facilities and community-based health workers. In 1957, a National Malaria Eradication Service (NMES) was established within Belize’s Ministry of Health in response to the global push for eradication. In 1959, the country began systematically collecting malaria case data to monitor programme performance. These actions yielded results: between 1957 and 1963, annual malaria cases fell from over 1000 to just 17. However, by 1965, the number of cases had increased 12-fold and, subsequently, there were significant fluctuations in cases. Belize has attributed the resurgence in cases to inconsistent implementation of insecticide spraying, a weak surveillance system and a lack of domestic and international funding. By 1982, over half of all localities in Belize’s 6 districts reported malaria transmission. Cases continued to rise in the 1980s – a trend attributed to a shrinking malaria control budget and an influx of refugees from neighboring malaria-endemic countries during a period of political upheaval. How did Belize eventually stamp out malaria? What tools or strategies were critical to the success of Belize’s malaria elimination effort? Over the last 3 decades, Belize has achieved a dramatic reduction in its malaria caseload – from a peak of about 10 000 cases in 1994 to zero indigenous cases in 2019. The significant decline in cases can be attributed to effective investments – both at domestic and international levels – and to the crucial role of dedicated staff for malaria surveillance. This allowed for early detection of cases, prompt diagnosis and treatment, and complementary preventive measures such as indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets targeted to groups at high risk of malaria, including migrant workers living in border areas with Guatemala and Mexico. Enhanced surveillance allowed for a more strategic targeting of interventions and available resources in priority areas. The government was able to allocate sufficient resources at central and district levels to ensure the constant availability of supplies for diagnosis and treatment, high coverage of vector control, and a strong healthcare network in communities supported by volunteer collaborators and community health workers. Belize maintained malaria surveillance efforts during the pandemic and made an effort to integrate malaria and COVID-19 surveillance systems. Which sectors of government – beyond the health sector – contributed to this achievement? Collaboration with key industries has been crucial to the success of malaria elimination efforts in Belize – notably with the agriculture and tourism sectors. For example, early detection of malaria cases among migrant workers is supported by a collaborative effort between Belize’s national malaria programme and the banana, sugar and citrus industries. Meanwhile, a long-standing and productive partnership between the national malaria programme and Belize Vector Ecology Center (BVEC) has ensured the implementation and maintenance of entomological surveillance; the findings of such surveillance provide critical information on the distribution and density of malaria-carrying mosquitoes and their resistance to insecticides used in malaria control. What role did community health workers play in driving down malaria cases? A dedicated network of trained community-based health workers and voluntary collaborators were the backbone of malaria elimination efforts in Belize. They helped ensure early detection of malaria cases within their respective communities and, for those with a confirmed malaria diagnosis, the provision of effective antimalarial treatment. What cross-border efforts between Belize and its neighbouring countries – Mexico and Guatemala – are in place to prevent the re-establishment of malaria? Cross-border collaboration with Mexico and Guatemala began many years ago, as described in Belize’s 2007‒2011 National Health Plan. These collaborative efforts focused on sharing information between teams stationed along borders and at the national level. Community health workers and voluntary collaborators in border areas ensured prompt case detection through rapid diagnostic testing. In addition, Belize has developed and distributed information, education and communications materials for travellers and migrants through border control and tourist agencies. Has Belize also participated in regional and global initiatives or programmes to keep malaria at bay? Belize has participated in a number of regional and subregional initiatives, such as Elimination of Malaria in Mesoamerica and the Island of Hispaniola (EMMIE), financially supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Regional Malaria Elimination Initiative (RMEI), established by the Inter-American Development Bank with technical leadership from the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and the participation of the Council of Health Ministers of Central America (COMISCA). RMEI supports Central American countries, the Dominican Republic and Colombia in a collaborative effort to eliminate malaria. With support from USAID, PAHO has provided technical cooperation throughout Belize’s anti-malaria campaign. This success in Belize contributes to PAHO's Disease Elimination Initiative , a collaborative effort between governments, civil society, academia, the private sector and communities to eliminate more than 30 communicable diseases, including malaria, in the Americas by 2030. At the global level, Belize is also a member of the “ E-2025 ” – a group of countries identified by WHO as having the potential to eliminate malaria by 2025. Through this initiative, Belize and other malaria-eliminating countries have received specialized technical support and have shared innovations and best practices. How will Belize maintain a robust surveillance and response system to prevent the re-establishment of malaria? To keep malaria at the forefront of the health agenda in Belize, the country has developed a plan to prevent the re-establishment of malaria transmission. The plan focuses on maintaining malaria surveillance in both the general population and in high-risk groups, as well as improving collaboration within and across sectors. Training refreshers will be organized for healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, assistant nurses etc.) and vector control personnel to maintain malaria vigilance and good access to diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, personnel in key sectors, such as agriculture and tourism, will continue to be sensitized on the risk of malaria reintroduction in Belize and the importance of ensuring the timely detection and response to any imported malaria cases. Are there lessons learned from Belize’s experience that could be applied to other countries in the region? Belize’s malaria programme has dedicated vector control staff to guide the technical aspects of malaria control interventions and monitor their implementation. The country has maximized access to diagnosis and treatment through health facilities and the use of community health workers and voluntary collaborators in nearly every locality. Furthermore, the collaboration of Belize’s malaria programme with agricultural farms is unique in the region. Vector control staff have established good relationships with the main farms that hire workers from neighbouring malaria-endemic countries, ensuring the distribution of information, education and communication materials, as well as malaria testing, prompt diagnosis and treatment. Will Belize draw on lessons from its malaria elimination strategy for other infectious and vector-borne diseases? The importance of ensuring decentralized access to prompt diagnosis and treatment along with vector control interventions and robust surveillance have been nationally recognized as the main strategies that led to the successful elimination of malaria. These strategies will likely be implemented for other vector-borne diseases such as leishmaniasis and Chagas disease."

Prior to the conflict, Syrians could only access MHPSS services at two psychiatric hospitals located in Aleppo and Damascus. Today, with WHO support, there are over 5000 community workers, volunteers, and health workers,trained over the last two years to provide integrated MHPSS services. Additionally, over 51% of PHCs (600 centers) and 8% of schools across the country offer MHPSS services.",

          "Beyond Syria, the core actions outlined in the MHPSS Coordination Handbook have been  implemented across humanitarian emergencies around the world, leading to effective and efficient MHPSS responses in Gaza, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka among others. Through MHPSS coordination efforts by WHO and partners in Yemen, over 3,500 healthcare staff, first responders, frontline workers, school teachers, and child protection and gender-based violence (GBV) case managers had been trained in mental health and psychosocial support. Additionally, the country is implementing an updated national mental health strategy that strengthens MHPSS service delivery.",
          "The humanitarian response to the arrival of refugees from Ukraine into Poland is another example of how better coordination has boosted mental health care provision. Sanem Ozen, an MHPSS officer with UNHCR, who co-chairs the Poland MHPSS TWG alongside WHO, highlighted how TWGs have improved coordination: “It was challenging to engage partners, particularly local partners, in mapping MHPSS services. This information is crucial to enabling us to deliver MHPSS services to those impacted by the war in Ukraine. With the working group, we have been able to coordinate across partners and stakeholder groups, and efficiently map MHPSS services at all levels.”",
          "Thus, coordinating efforts among humanitarian responders not only ensures more efficient MHPSS responses and better access to the support people need following emergencies, but  lays the foundation for stronger national mental health systems and ultimately, improves the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of affected communities.",

          "Country experiences show that success on polio transition is context specific. In Somalia, integrated public health teams, built on the polio network, deliver a broad range of health services, despite challenges posed by ongoing polio outbreaks and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Central African Republic, thanks to strong advocacy by civil society, sustaining polio eradication remains on the health agenda. Meanwhile, India’s significant progress builds on transforming the networks built initially to eradicate polio to strengthen the country’s essential immunization programme.",
          "From 25 – 26 April, national, regional and global stakeholders, including country representatives, global health partners and donors, and members of civil society, gathered in Geneva to share their experiences of polio transition. The objective of the two-day forum was to agree on the future direction of polio transition, including adjustments that are needed, building on lessons learned.",
          "In his opening remarks at the forum, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), underscored the rationale for the transition process, “As we move closer to a polio-free world, we must work to sustain the incredible infrastructure that has been set up to eradicate polio.”",
          "“A transformation of this scale and complexity has never been done in public health. We have a huge challenge, and a huge opportunity.”",
          "The challenges and opportunities of a successful transition were recurring themes during the forum. Although much progress has been made since 2018, the COVID-19 pandemic, political and economic instability and a more constrained fiscal environment have complicated transition efforts and strained health systems in many countries. To overcome this, countries have continually adapted transition planning for their contexts, guided by national health priorities, towards strengthening health outcomes, especially in the areas of essential immunization, health emergencies, and primary health care.",
          "Reflecting on these lessons, stakeholders agreed that the renewed global vision for transition should be inspiring, actionable, practical and relevant to all countries. They emphasized that providing coordinated technical and financial support, aligned with country priorities, is critical for success. At the national level, countries should adapt flexible strategies, with realistic milestones.",
          "Strong essential immunization programmes were recognized as crucial for achieving and sustaining polio eradication. Meanwhile, maintaining the poliovirus surveillance system and laboratory network was identified as a critical priority to protect a polio-free world and strengthen broader disease surveillance efforts. It was recognized that there is scope to systematically integrate gender, equity, human rights and the health of refugees and migrants into transition planning, aligned with the country context. Stakeholders also discussed the potential ‘enabling factors’ to make transition a success, and ‘risks’ that need to be mitigated during transition, as well as the specific responsibilities of different stakeholders.",
          "The outcomes of the forum will inform the new Global Vision for Polio Transition that will be shaped by the end of 2023. The vision is an essential component of the post-2023 strategic framework, alongside Regional Strategic Plans, tailored to regional and national context, and a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework to track progress and ensure transparency and accountability.",
          "Dr Tedros concluded his remarks by noting the potential to strengthen health systems through a successful transition.",
          "“Eradicating polio and safeguarding its legacy with stronger health systems will be a gift for our children, and our children's children.”",
          "Following the forum, Member States offered further guidance on transition during the 76 th World Health Assembly, building on interventions made during the 152nd Executive Board meeting . Member States highlighted that the polio transition strategic framework should aim to integrate polio functions into Primary Health Care towards Universal Health Coverage, align with WHO’s evolving work on pandemic preparedness, resilience and response, and focus on strengthening routine immunization, surveillance, outbreak management and response, national capacity building and partnerships. Considering the ongoing risk of the spread of polio, Member States emphasized a risk-based approach to transition, backed up by realistic timelines and clear milestones.",
          "The strategic framework will be developed through a consultative process to ensure that the next phase of transition is fit for purpose."

          "In front of the bountiful table – with rice, beans, meat, corn, cassava, sweet potatoes, cabbage, and cucumbers – Álvaro Luettjohann smiles: “Everything we are about to eat is organic and produced here.” Álvaro and his wife, Adriana, live in Candelária, a small town in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. Going to their farm feels like walking into an oasis in a neighborhood normally marked by tobacco growing and the use of pesticides.",
          "Brazil is the largest exporter and third largest producer of tobacco in the world, but tobacco farming is a problem globally with over 120 countries growing tobacco. In Brazil, tobacco crops are highly concentrated in the three southern states, one of which is Rio Grande do Sul, where Álvaro and Adriana live, which hosts more than 50,000 tobacco farms.",
          "Álvaro and Adriane know the tireless work of a tobacco farmer since their families have grown this crop for generations. Studies show that tobacco farming is a much more labor-intensive endeavor compared to other crops. Beyond that, tobacco farmers and their families face various health risks throughout the process, including chronic lung conditions and nicotine poisoning caused by the absorption of nicotine through the skin when workers handle uncured tobacco leaves.",
          "Á lvaro feeding the chickens.  Credit: Raquel Torres / Fiocruz-CETAB's Collection",
          "For many of these reasons, the couple abandoned this activity decades ago: Álvaro stopped growing tobacco in the late 1980s, and Adriane did it when she married him in the mid-1990s. Instead of tobacco, they are now growing more sustainable food crops and in 2004, they completely eliminated the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers.",
          "Today, they have an organic certification, preserve Creole seeds, and grow nearly all the food they need: rice, seven types of maize and 10 types of beans, peanuts, potatoes, several types of sweet potatoes, cassava, vegetables, chia, sesame, mate and various fruits. The couple also raise animals for milk, eggs, and meat, and have a mill for the production of cornmeal.",
          "Farming families like theirs are helping to turn the tide on food insecurity and improve our environment as well as save lives from the deadly impact of tobacco.",
          "Álvaro says he grew up under the discourse of the tobacco industry, hearing that tobacco growing was the region’s true vocation and that it was not worth growing other crops. “But my father never believed that and, although we grew tobacco, he managed to have a diversified farm – and there were some periods when we put tobacco aside. He always said that 'you cannot eat tobacco, so you need to grow food’” Álvaro recalls. However, according to him, his family was persuaded that pesticides and chemical fertilizers were necessary to increase productivity. “But the great productivity we were promised never came, and on top of that our soil became impoverished.”",
          "After Álvaro and Adriane started their organic production, it took a few years for them to make the soil healthy again, but now they have well-nourished land with organic bio-products.",
          "The couple emphasizes that government policies were essential for them to succeed as to stop growing tobacco and become organic farmers. They accessed credit programs to purchase machinery and even to build their house on the farm.",
          "The couple doesn't have any intention of growing tobacco ever again. “We always talk to friends and family members who still grow tobacco for a living, and we try to show that it is possible to have other sources of income”, says Adriane, who is the only one who has abandoned tobacco in a family of 10 siblings.",
          "If governments stopped subsidizing tobacco farming and supported farmers to switch to more sustainable crops it would help address the global food crisis and support healthier communities.",

          "“ The aim of the United Arab Emirates Health Foundation Prize is to motivate health  workers, including scientists, researchers, workers and  specialists ”, said  Dr Hussain Abdul Rahman Al Rand, Assistant Undersecretary for the Public Health Sector, when delivering the prize on behalf of the UAE Health Foundation, “ in order to make further achievements that benefit  health in its various sectors and to contribute with the United Nations system in general and the World Health Organization in particular to the implementation of projects and programmes that strengthen health for all around the world and address health challenges globally.”",
          "Dr Maria Asuncion Silvestre is a renowned clinician and researcher, a passionate advocate for exclusive breastfeeding and the founder of a nongovernmental organization “Health of Mother and Child”. She has used her experience as a practitioner in her community and her findings as a researcher to improve the health of mothers and newborns. She designed a pioneering protocol consisting of a simple set of choreographed actions for health workers attending a mother during delivery and her newborn immediately after birth and during the first week of the child’s life. This affordable Essential Intrapartum and Newborn Care Protocol helps to bridge the health equity gap. Her work has helped save lives at national level and beyond. In collaboration with her national government and 17 other countries of the WHO Western Pacific Region, Dr Silvestre scaled up the “ First Embrace” campaign for Early Essential Newborn Care, a set of simple WHO-recommended and cost-effective interventions.",
          "“ Nonseparated, the mother/newborn pair is our first food system. We should protect it as passionately and as furiously as we protect our agricultural lands, our coral reefs, our rainforests ”, said Dr Maria Asuncion Silvestre at the award ceremony. “ We sought to “rechoreograph” actions in the first minutes to hours after birth, eliminating unnecessary actions, so we formulated a timebound sequence of steps. Many health facilities in my country and elsewhere implemented the Protocol and reaped the benefits. Evidence shows that receiving at least one of the four core steps was protective, the more elements of essential care received, the more newborn survival improved. Breastfeeding saves lives. ”"

It has promoted healthcare cooperation globally, committing to reducing health inequality worldwide. As part of this effort, the Memorial Prize was established to uphold Dr Lee’s core value of promoting public health. By doing so, KOFIH endeavors to create a healthier world and to strengthen long-term public health around the world. Among the many contributions Dr Meneses has made is the ethical and patient-centered care model and the national strategy of integrated health service networks - making Guatemala stand out as the only country in Central America to be using such an innovative strategy. ”",
          "Nowadays serving as the national supervisor for hospitals in Guatemala, Dr Jorge Francisco Meneses promoted community participation in hospital care for over 20 years, by setting up community-based committees focusing on the safety and satisfaction of patients, their families and the community. The quality of patient care has significantly improved in his country, thanks to the model of ethical and patient-centred care that Dr Meneses has designed and helped to scale up at the national level. In recent years, Dr Meneses has coordinated a pilot project in the Guatemala South Health Area as the first-ever integrated network of health services in the country, aimed at providing services to underserved communities. This outstanding work resulted in the adoption of a national strategy of integrated health services networks, the first in Central America.",
          "When accepting the honourable memorial prize, Dr Jorge Francisco Meneses said: “ I am firmly convinced that integrated health service networks based in primary health care constitute the strategy to ensure that my country Guatemala can bring about meaningful change in its health system, promoting equity in health care.” He reaffirmed his objective of “ ensuring that health services are brought closer to the population and that everyone who currently lacks access to health services can benefit from continuity of care, who now do not have access to health care”."

The use of data as the foundation for evidence-based decision-making has been central to WHO’s mission. Today, there are more opportunities than ever to harness the power of data. Yet progress is uneven, with global disparities in capacity for health data collection, communication and access. The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the urgent need for the public and policymakers to have access to timely, robust and reliable data.",
          "Recognizing these challenges, WHO is proud to announce a transformative digital platform, data.who.int, a one-stop shop for health data. Data.who.int fulfills WHO's commitment to provide health data as a public good; it is powered by the ambitious technologies of WHO’s World Health Data Hub, delivering an end-to-end solution for WHO data processes. From collection to use, the World Health Data Hub provides a world class experience leveraging innovative technology to address data challenges.",

Starting with the data underlying WHO's annual World Health Statistics report, the new website reimagines the indicator page – the most representative level of data presentation – with consistent, expressive and accessible visualization, while also presenting metadata to promote ease of accessibility, reference and use. The data powering WHO’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) monitoring is now fully accessible to the public in a harmonized, seamless experience. Furthermore, the data.who.int country pages highlight life expectancy, leading causes of death, and civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) figures by country, making it easy to quickly access and compare country-level data.",
          "Data.who.int aims to be the most accessible public health data platform in the world. For the first time, all data will be digitally available in the six official languages of the United Nations, while also respecting local formatting, charting, and colour conventions. Charts and their contents are more widely accessible through an appropriately chosen design vocabulary and inclusive approaches to chart design, as well as increasing support for assistive devices and alternative modes of access. Controlled colour schemes ensure that chart colours are colourblind-safe and with sufficient contrast for multiple consumption contexts. As a key process in the iterative development, release and improvement of the website, data.who.int is undergoing regular testing with users representing the visually, motor and cognitive impaired communities to consistently improve accessibility.",

          "\"I remember talking to a mother, whose child had cancer, who told me that after many months she was finally able to sleep through the night because her child was now receiving morphine at the hospital and had stopped screaming in pain,” recalls Dr Salwa Massad, a Research Manager for the WHO Palestinian National Institute of Public Health – occupied Palestine territory.",
          "Salwa touches upon the dire shortage of cancer and palliative medicines, for children with cancer living in the Gaza Strip. Years of conflict and the ongoing siege of the Gaza Strip since 2012 has exacerbated gaps in childhood cancer service delivery, created shortages in cancer medicines, and delayed access to life-saving services such as radiotherapy for children living with cancer.",
          "In 2021–2022, Salwa, Khalid Abu Saman and the team conducted an assessment of structural barriers to paediatric cancer services in Gaza in partnership with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and WHO. A key early strategy was to involve the MoH closely in the design and roll-out of the survey so as to secure Government buy-in for suggested interventions thereafter. Another strategy was to involve multiple stakeholders in the qualitative study including parents of children with cancer, oncologists, nurses, social workers in oncology hospitals in Gaza and in referral hospitals in the West Bank, MoH focal points, and pharmacists – to gain a better understanding of the scope of the problem and design long-term solutions.",
          "Photo credit: WHO/PNIPH / Khalid Abu Saman",
          "Generating political will and advancing implementation through advocacy",
          "The occupied Palestine territory is one of 67 countries where governments have committed to increase access and quality of care for children with cancer through the implementation of the WHO-St Jude-led Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer (GICC) Cure All Framework. GICC aims to increase the survival rate of children with cancer globally to at least 60% by 2030. Salwa and the team used evidence-based data generated through the survey to make progress towards evidence-based interventions in the two oncology hospitals in Gaza (the Rantisi and the Turkish Palestinian Friendship hospitals) that directly contribute to strengthening paediatric oncology services in Gaza.",
          "Data from the study and the interviews with the mothers of child cancer patients were instrumental in enabling three key achievements:",
          "1) Policy changes in paediatric oncology. Leveraging the voices of children with cancer and their parents, Salwa and her team demonstrated the challenges associated with the age limit (12 years) for transferring children with cancer from Rantisi paediatric hospital to the adult oncology ward of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital. She states, “We took the testimonies of oncologists and mothers of children with cancer to Dr Yousef Abu Alreish, the Deputy Minister of Health in Gaza and explained how disruptive the age limit was to their treatment process. We used evidence from published studies to show how outcomes improved when children were kept in paediatric wards.” As a result of these efforts, the Ministry of Health issued policy changes that raised the age limit of paediatric cancer.",
          "Photo credit: WHO/PNIPH / Khalid Abu Saman",
          "Under the Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer, Salwa’s team also advocated for the establishment of an oncology youth ward in the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital that allowed children to be with others their age as well as their mothers. The wards were designed to enable parents to stay with their children during the course of treatment, an option that wasn’t previously available. Additionally, through the Initiative, a resource room was set up for children who otherwise would spend all day looking at the ceiling for want of any other form of entertainment. The resource room now offers toys, books, activities, and a smart TV to keep children engaged.",
          "2) Promoting early detection and timely referrals. Through the survey, WHO determined significant gaps in early detection and timely referrals among Gaza-based healthcare workers. A cancer oncologist in Gaza described how he hadn’t received any training for over 15 years. Some parents and oncologists shared horrific stories of late/inaccurate diagnosis for children with cancer, partly due to absent or insufficient diagnostic tools. As a result of these testimonies, the Deputy Minister of Health formed a task force to follow-up on reported diagnostic inaccuracies and made provisions for the training of emergency room physicians and paediatricians on childhood cancer early warning signs for timely investigation and diagnosis.",
          "3) Procurement of cancer medicines. Speaking about how difficult it is for children to cope with their illness because of shortages in basic medicines (Figure 1), the head of pharmacists in Gaza who participated in the qualitative study stated: “If we can’t heal children with advanced stages of cancer in Gaza, at least we can help them die with less pain.” Another parent shared how “her son kept screaming all night with pain and the only pain medicine that the hospital could give him was paracetamol.”",
          "Figure 1: Percent of oncology drugs with zero stock at Ministry of Health, by month, Jan 2021–April 2022, Gaza",
          "The Initiative is also preparing to better train health care workers in Gaza to enable early detection of childhood cancers and timely referrals. “All these changes were possible because the Ministry of Health was with us right from day one,” emphasizes Salwa. “We didn’t conduct the study and then go back to them saying 'this is what you need to implement.' Instead, we did the study together with them so they had complete ownership over the results.\"",
          "Thus, through GICC, the occupied Palestine territory has raised the age limit for transferring children to adult oncology, made provisions for a youth cancer ward, served as a catalyst for the establishment of pain clinics at oncology hospitals in Gaza, and enabled the procurement of palliative care and essential cancer medicines."

          "The Government of Rwanda has been deeply committed to the Sustainable Development\r\n    Goals (SDGs) and has taken a whole-of-government approach to owning, integrating, and\r\n    implementing the SDGs. Integrating the SDGs into national development plans ( Vision\r\n 2050, the National Strategy for Transformation - NST, NST1 (2017-2024) ) reflects the\r\n    government's continued commitment to using the goals as a blueprint to develop and\r\n    achieve health-related SDGs.",
          "Collaboration is key for strengthened SDG monitoring. © WHO Rwanda/ Ms. Mutizwa Nyasha Making information systems fit-for-purpose to monitor SDGs Strengthening and adapting health information systems is key to Rwanda's efforts to \r\nachieve SDGs. To achieve this, Rwanda has taken a phased approach to strengthen its \r\nNational Statistical Systems by implementing successive National Strategy for the \r\nDevelopment of Statistics ( NSDS-II 2014-18 and NSDS-III 2019-24) to integrate SDG \r\nindicators into the national framework for monitoring and evaluation. The first step to identifying and fulfilling relevant health-related SDG indicator requirements \r\nwas to develop an official national list of all SDG indicators assigned to all NST1 pillars. In \r\n2019, the national statistical system produced 60 per cent of the SDGs applicable to \r\nRwanda , across all sectors. Furthermore, 70 percent of health-related SDGs were available for reporting in 2020. To \r\naddress this data gap, the Ministry of Health worked with the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO) and other key stakeholders for Health-SDGs in Rwanda, namely the Rwanda \r\nBiomedical Center, National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda and other relevant ministries, \r\ninstitutions, and agencies to \r\ndevelop a comprehensive \r\nmetadata handbook to \r\nintegrate each selected \r\nhealth-SDG indicator into health information systems in Rwanda. This phased approach \r\nhas increased the percentage of SDG indicators for which data is available and monitored \r\nthrough administrative data systems; and increased capacity of Rwanda's health \r\ninformation system (HIS) to provide timely, reliable, and disaggregated data for evidence-based decision-making and measure progress on SDG targets, including Universal Health \r\nCoverage. Mr. Daniel Ntabanganyimana, Sector M&E and Reporting specialist at MoH, said that: \"In the past, gaps in the SDG indicators meant that accurate and timely statistics about some \r\ncritical aspects of health SDG remain missing, leaving certain groups less than fully visible to \r\ndecision-makers and poorly understood health challenges. As a result, it was impossible to \r\nknow how good or bad we were doing. The new indicator metadata guidance is a great step \r\ntoward more accurate population data; it makes us more aware of our local health challenges \r\nand helps us monitor progress everywhere. This makes all the difference to our work. It means \r\nwe can see and reach more people. It means we have a better chance of leaving no one \r\nbehind.\" Making Partnership and Coordination effective for a better health information system One key lesson in Rwanda's SDG implementation is that national ownership and leadership \r\nare essential for effective partnerships and coordination. Rwanda's commitment is evident \r\nin the country's high-level political buy-in, which has translated into intersectoral \r\ncooperation and establishing clear linkages between the health sector strategy and the \r\nNational Strategy for the Development of Statistics. Establishing clear mechanisms for coordination and communication between external \r\npartners and national stakeholders also ensured alignment with national priorities. A prime \r\nexample of this is the country commitment to establish a multisectoral Health-SDGs Task \r\nForce to serve as a platform for inter-agency collaboration and coordination between \r\nGovernment Ministries, Development Partners, Civil Society Organizations, and the Private \r\nSector. Reinforcing key health information systems is another key pillar for Health-SDGs \r\nmonitoring. In this regard, one of the key achievements of the Ministry of Health and \r\npartners has been the digitization of healthcare in Rwanda. One of the main priorities was \r\ncreating a National Health Information Exchange (HIE) platform to provide a secure, \r\nreliable, and interoperable way for health data to be exchanged between different HIS \r\ncomponents and other data systems. The development of the platform is finalized and the \r\nHIE platform is being tested in selected health facilities. Additionally, the Rwanda Health \r\nObservatory will serve as a one-stop shop for all health data related to the SDGs and will \r\nprovide users with easy access to data from multiple sources in a single location. It will \r\nalso allow for data visualization, making it easier to identify trends and patterns. SDG3 GAP partners play \r\nprominent roles in strengthening \r\nHealth-related SDG monitoring \r\nwithin the United Nations (UN)’s \r\nJoint Programme on Data. \r\nUNFPA supported the National \r\nInstitute of Statistics of Rwanda\r\n(NISR) to allow for collecting age, \r\ngender, and disability \r\ndisaggregated data through the \r\nIntegrated Household Living Condition (EICV) Surveys. UNFPA supported the mobilization \r\nof resources to prepare the 2022 Population and Housing Census. Through UNWOMEN’s \r\nsupport, the NISR was able to collect important gender data for the sixth 2019/2020 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS6) in particular the domestic violence data as well as \r\nthe production of gender thematic reports from the Establishment Census 2020. UNICEF \r\nsupported the NISR to develop a new Multidimensional Overlapping Deprivation Analysis \r\n(MODA) using the DHS6 data. At the same time, the WHO provided technical and financial \r\nassistance in monitoring health-related SDGs and, together with other UN agencies, in \r\nstrengthening the civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system and other \r\nadministrative systems. The WHO also provided financial resources through the Health \r\nSystems Connector of the Access to COVID-19 Tools accelerator (ACT-A) to strengthen \r\nelectronic health records (EHR). Collectively, SDG3-GAP partners have contributed to \r\ncapacity building for health workers on data use and analysis. The pursuit of an integrated health information system, a central tenet of the SDG's \r\nachievement in Rwanda, is accelerating collaborative progress for health-related SDGs. The \r\nefforts put Rwanda firmly on course to begin to identify helpful synergies and high-impact \r\ninterventions that can be leveraged to accelerate progress toward SDG3."

          "FORCCE FOCUS FORCCE Focus is a section in this newsletter where we feature RCCE personnel across the globe. Through brief Q&A sessions, we shine a spotlight on each person’s RCCE journey, the work that they do and their unique insights on working in the field of risk communication and community engagement. Q&A with Tara Rose Aynsley Tara Rose Aynsley has been working with the World Health Organization since 2017 when she first joined WHO as a Technical Officer for Risk Communication. In 2021, she moved to the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean where she currently works as a Risk Communication and Community Engagement consultant. When the series of earthquakes in Turkey and Syria struck on 6 February 2023, Rose was thrust front and center into the response efforts. In this interview, we talk to Rose about that experience and the importance of risk communication and community engagement following a disaster. FS: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself and your professional journey? How did you end up in the field of RCCE? TRA: My journey to working in the field of risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) was like for many professionals in this area, winding and untraditional. Originally, I studied Law and Public Administration, however made the shift early-on in my career to working in health and social policy and programming in Australia. In 2014, after working with a national NGO in Mongolia, I was hooked and made a deliberate shift to continue working internationally. In 2017, after completing a master’s specializing in emergency management, I was fortunate to join the WHO Pacific subregional office as a RCCE technical officer. More than four years on in the role, I considered myself very lucky to have worked with an amazing group of committed health and RCCE specialists to establish and strengthen the RCCE systems across 21 Pacific Island countries and areas. Travelling by boat for work, labouring through cyclones, floods and outbreaks are some of the many fond memories of responding to emergencies in the Pacific. These were insightful experiences that poured into the ‘why’ I do this work. Six years have passed since beginning with WHO, and until now, helping empower and engage communities as part of health emergency management is just as rewarding as when I started FS: When you heard about the multiple earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, what thoughts were going through your head? Can you describe your experience and feelings during the earthquakes? TRA: It was felt before it was heard. At the time I was in my room was on 12th floor of the Damascus hotel. The trembling woke me up, before it transcended into what felt like the whole building swaying. After evacuating the building, I believe many of us were still in shock and so the full enormity of the event and its impact didn’t sink in until we arrived in the office where full details of the devastation started rolling in. With it, came the flood of emotions – deep sorrow for the so many who lost their lives and families; the desperate grip of hope for others to be rescued; and the overwhelming feeling of helpless and frustration of wanting to do more. This, of course, fuels the adrenaline to do as much as you possibly can to assist. Overwhelming though was the great feeling of honour to have worked alongside my WHO colleagues at the country office, who put aside everything to work around the clock and provide life-saving health services and support. FS: What concerns did you feel were important to immediately address given the situation? When a disaster of this magnitude happens, what should be the priority for RCCE? TRA: In the initial hours of the response, the main focus for RCCE was ensuring critical life-saving information was shared with affected communities on what to do during aftershocks, how to avoid further risk and injury and operational information such as which health services remained operative and where to seek care. Daily social listening scans were immediately conducted, scouring digital platforms to better understand community issues and needs, which we then fed into our overall health sector response. FS: Take us through the first weeks of the response. What RCCE materials did you and your team put out there to support the affected communities? (Feel free to include links if you like)? TRA: Like any complex humanitarian event where every aspect of people’s lives were affected, we needed to implement responsive communication and community engagement interventions that addressed the multiple health risks and impacts, including risk of infectious diseases like cholera, what to do during aftershocks , and encouraging positive coping strategies to address the extreme trauma and mental health impacts. Through our daily digital listening we were able to detect emerging issues, and quickly disseminate information and resources to respond, such as the recent information on burns and fire management after a several fires broke out in tents and shelters. To ensure that there was harmonized community outreach by mobile response teams, we also developed an integrated community health responder package , which is being rolled out via our NGO and community partners to ensure there is coordinated, consistent health outreach and support is provided to affected communities. FS: What were some of the main challenges you face during the response? How did you address these challenges? TRA: Even before the earthquake, the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria has caused huge population displacement, major socioeconomic decline, and deterioration of the health system, and so the response needed to consider the complex needs, and challenges already faced by Syrians. For instance, how you encourage safe practices and behaviours for handwashing and sanitation to reduce risk of cholera infection, when people didn’t have access to safe water or toilets. As much as possible we tried to ensure that health outreach involved the distribution of supplies and resources, as well as information, so as to enable people to adopt preventative measures. FS: Finally, what learnings can you share with us from the work you did in the past month? TRA: One of the areas of work that I believe we used effectively in this response was the collection and use of social and behavioural data captured via daily digital listening and the establishment of a community feedback mechanism. During the initial weeks of the response, when community feedback were difficult to capture, we were able to collect insights via online mediums, and using this to guide the health sector response. Building on this we also developed a community feedback mechanism, which is enabling us to systematically listen to the needs and concerns of communities, and thus ensuring we remain accountable and responsive as the situation evolves."

          "Asthma is one of the most common noncommunicable diseases, affecting an estimated 262 million people in 2019, and causing nearly half a million deaths every year.",
          "Although asthma cannot be cured, people with asthma can enjoy a normal life if correctly diagnosed and treated. Inhalers (both bronchodilators and steroids) are considered essential medicines in the WHO package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions for primary health care and should be available to all people living with asthma around the world.",
          "On World Asthma Day, WHO experts offer 5 tips on how to manage your asthma better.",
          "1. Be aware of your symptoms",
          "Cough, wheeze and difficulty breathing are all signs that your asthma is not well controlled. If you feel that your symptoms are getting worse, follow the instructions from your doctor. Use a reliever inhaler (e.g. salbutamol) with a spacer to open your airways.",
          "2. Identify and avoid your triggers",
          "Common triggers include smoke, fumes, viral infections, pollen, changes in the weather, animal fur and feathers, and strong fragrances. Know what affects you and try to avoid if possible. If not possible, make sure you have your reliever inhaler readily available.",
          "3. Know your inhalers",
          "A reliever inhaler (also called a bronchodilator) opens up the small airways and improves airflow in and out of the lungs. Use this when you have symptoms",
          "A steroid or preventer inhaler reduces inflammation in the lungs and is an essential part of long term asthma treatment. By using a steroid inhaler, as directed by your doctor, you will improve your symptoms and reduce the risk of a severe attack.",
          "Inhalers are the safest, most effective treatment for asthma and allow people with asthma to lead a normal, active life.",
          "4. Use a spacer",
          "A spacer is a plastic chamber which connects the inhaler at one end, to your mouth via a mouthpiece or mask at the other end. It can help inhaled medicines to reach the small airways in the lungs and work better. The spacer allows more time for the medicine to be breathed in and means that less coordination is required. Without a spacer, you have to breath in deeply and press the inhaler at the same time – inhaled medicine often ends up in the mouth or throat and is ineffective. Some types of inhaler (e.g. dry powder inhalers) do not need a spacer – check with your doctor if you are unsure.",
          "Credit: Getty Images / Pollyana Ventura",
          "5. Take back control",
          "Knowledge is power. Ask your doctor to explain how your inhaled medicines work and how you should use them. Make sure your friends and family also know what to do if your asthma is bad. By taking your inhalers early, when you first notice that your symptoms are worsening, you can avoid a serious attack.",
          "WHO’s work on asthma",
          "WHO is working to support countries to provide essential asthma interventions as part of universal health coverage, through technical tools and guidance.",
          "“Uncontrolled asthma has major consequences for people living with asthma, their families and communities, health-care systems and national economies. It is shocking that every day children and adults suffer needlessly from symptoms that could be prevented with essential inhaled medicines,” says Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Director of the Department of Noncommunicable Diseases at the World Health Organization. “A huge effort is needed to accelerate universal health coverage and meet the Sustainable Development Goal commitments that have been made.”",

          },
          "If the number of avoidable premature asthma deaths that occur in low- and middle-income countries every year – roughly 185 000 people aged <70 years – is to be reduced, this global inequity must be addressed.",
          "WHO convenes a network of organizations committed to reducing the global burden of chronic respiratory diseases, including asthma, call the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD). The alliance also has a focus on addressing global inequity. Recently, a new GARD community on the WHO Knowledge Action Portal on NCDs was set up to help accelerate progress, by supporting networking and sharing of information and resources."

          "The WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health is on its way to achieving its target: ensuring one hundred million people across nine participating countries have access to affordable, quality mental health services.",
          "A mid-term review of the Initiative’s progress highlights important advancements in national mental health policies and increased provision of services for people living with mental health conditions. The map below (Fig 1) highlights some of the key country milestones reached since the Initiative launched five years ago:",
          "Fig 1: Country-level achievements through the Special Initiative for Mental Health",
          "Bolstering the building blocks of mental health care",
          "Across\r\nnine participating countries, the Special Initiative for Mental Health engages\r\nall health system building blocks: service delivery, health workforce, health\r\ninformation systems, access to essential medicines, financing, leadership and\r\ngovernance. To date, three of these areas have particularly benefited from the\r\nInitiative’s approach:",
          "1) Leadership and governance . Through a\r\ncollaborative and inclusive planning process, the Special Initiative for Mental\r\nHealth engaged a wide range of stakeholders including officials from Ministries\r\nof Health, people with lived experience of mental health conditions and local\r\nadvocates. In Jordan , planning for the\r\ninitiative received high-level engagement from national authorities, leading to\r\na review of the national Mental Health and Substance Use Action Plan, and the\r\nadjustment of national mental health priorities to match the global agenda.",
          "Similarly, as a result of support from Special Initiative\r\nfor Mental Health, Bangladesh endorsed a National Mental\r\nHealth Policy (2022) and began implementing their National Mental Health\r\nStrategic Plan (2020-2030). Paraguay has passed legislation on\r\nmental health access, while Ghana has appointed a governing\r\nboard to its mental health authority.",
          "2) Health workforce. The WHO Special Initiative\r\nfor Mental Health  also boosts mental\r\nhealth workforce capacity through various training programmes, including mhGAP , Self Help+ and QualityRights. Zimbabwe saw a national roll-out of\r\nQualityRights in mental health training across multiple stakeholder groups.\r\nSpeaking about the impact of the training, a mental health nurse in Zimbabwe said: “Before I trained in\r\nQualityRights, if a client complained about the medication, I would not listen\r\nto their concerns because I thought that I knew what was best for them. But\r\nnow, I ask clients if they are experiencing any side effects and if the\r\nmedication is working for them.” General health staff in primary health care\r\nfacilities across Zimbabwe were also trained to identify, manage and support\r\npeople living with mental disorders.",
          "In Jordan, mhGAP was integrated into the pre-service national\r\ntraining curriculum for family physicians. As a result, 31% of primary health\r\ncentres across the Kingdom now provide mhGAP services—compared to only 17% in\r\n2021. In Nepal, 47 health facilities with\r\npersonnel providing mental health services received supervision, enhancing the\r\nquality of service delivery.",
          "3) Service delivery . As part of the initiative,\r\ncountries have also developed new services focused on expanding access to\r\nmental health care. Paraguay introduced virtual consultations, resulting in a 500% increase in\r\nmental health care coverage. Argentina committed to increasing\r\nmental health service delivery in communities and general hospitals to promote\r\nthe transition  of mental health care\r\nfrom psychiatric hospitals to accessible community, primary and secondary\r\nhealth care services.",
          "Elsewhere, Ukraine endorsed Community\r\nMental Health Teams (CMHTs) as a national service model and included recovery-focused,\r\nperson-centred community care within services provided to patients under the\r\nState Programme of Medical Guarantees. Hospitals hosting CMHTs are now better\r\nprepared to support their clients during the war, given the mobile, innovative\r\nand multidisciplinary way in which the CMHTs work.  Since the beginning of Russia’s war with\r\nUkraine, CMHTs have provided over 23,000 consultations, reaching more than\r\n1,400 people with severe mental disorders.",
          "Increasing political\r\nprioritisation and funding for mental health",
          "By involving senior leadership across countries, training the health\r\nworkforce and rolling-out new mental health services—the WHO Special Initiative\r\nfor Mental Health has placed a spotlight on this often-neglected area of public\r\nhealth and supported countries to take action. One respondent to the\r\nInitiative’s recent mid-term review highlighted its impact, noting: “being part\r\nof the Initiative created momentum and put mental health on the list of\r\npriorities for national authorities and resulted in an updated national action\r\nplan for mental health.”",
          "Importantly, government leadership on mental health is translating to\r\nincreased investment in mental health services across the implementing\r\ncountries, which is vital to improving access to mental health care in these\r\npopulations. In the Philippines , the central government’s\r\nbudget for mental health is set to increase to 1 billion pesos this year, a\r\nsharp increase from 57 million pesos in 2022. The government has already\r\ninvested 10.4 million USD for free access to mental health medicines, 164 million\r\nUSD to pilot a new benefit package for mental health outpatient primary care\r\nand 293 million USD to support access to mental health services. Similarly, in\r\nGhana, the Ministry of Health’s allocation for mental health has been raised\r\nfrom 1.0% to 1.4% of its  annual  budget.",
          "Looking to the future, WHO will use the\r\nlearnings from the Initiative’s rollout in nine countries to encourage more\r\ncountries to scale-up mental health services, ultimately expanding access to\r\nquality and affordable mental health care – for all."

          "Hiao Khanh, 29, is a member of the Community Malaria Action Team in Chư Rcăm commune, Krông pa district, Gia Lai province, which is known for having the highest number of malaria cases in the country. In 2020, more than 200 cases were detected across the district.",
          "As part of his responsibilities, Hiao Khanh is in charge of overseeing 2 villages in the area. He has been working in malaria prevention and control in his community since 2019, after he recovered from malaria.",
          "“It was a near-death experience,” said Hiao Khanh. “I had high fever before getting access to health care support. After that, I was motivated to help reduce sickness and deaths from malaria in my commune.”",
          "People in this community rely heavily on the forest to earn a living. They go into the forest to work, and sleep there, putting them at high risk of contracting malaria.",
          "When it rains, the community’s scattered forest settlements are nearly cut off, as dirt access tracks are flooded, and hairpin bends on steep terrain become slippery. Hiao Khanh and his team need to use motorbikes to reach different parts of the community to help protect people from malaria.",
          "© WHO/Viet Nam. Community Malaria Action Team member Hiao Khanh after a meeting with members of the community.",
          "The team’s main activities are to raise awareness about malaria prevention, provide protective items such as mosquito nets, identify people who might have malaria and then transport them to health care facilities for testing, and support adherence to treatment for forest goers.",
          "The good news is that, with the right treatment, patients can now be cured in a shorter period of time. Previously, WHO recommended a 14-day course of antimalarial medicines to prevent a relapse of P. vivax malaria. Based on the latest evidence, WHO is now recommending a shorter (7-day) treatment option.",
          "However, ensuring individuals stay on track with their treatment remains a challenge. Forest workers, for example, often prefer to return to work as soon as their fever subsides.",
          "Part of Hiao Khanh’s work is to find and persuade patients to come back for treatment. Communication is a crucial aspect of his team's work. They actively listen to people's concerns, respond to their queries, and emphasize the importance of completing the full treatment course. By doing so, individuals can make a full recovery, allowing them to return to work without any further complications or malaria-related interruptions.",
          "“I hope to make people aware of malaria so that they are able to access health care services when they have symptoms,” said Hiao Khanh. “Just a ‘thank you’ from my people is enough to give me strength to continue this job to eliminate malaria from my homeland.”",
          "Viet Nam is highly motivated to reach the goal of eliminating malaria for a healthy future, an aim shared by many countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion."

          "The recent floods were a massive setback for Pakistan’s fight against malaria and a warning for the world of how climate change will impact disease response efforts.",
          "Last summer, Pakistan experienced the worst flooding in its history. At its height , more than a third of the country was underwater and 33 million people were affected. Within a few weeks, the estimated cost of damages exceeded US$ 15 billion , with over one million homes destroyed, 2 million acres of crops flooded, and 500 000 kilometres of roads damaged.",
          "And that was only the start of this flood’s terrible toll. Even before the waters receded, the mosquitoes came en masse , driving the worst malaria outbreak in the country since 1973.",
          "“The flood totally upended anti-malaria efforts in Pakistan,” says Dr Allan Schapira, a WHO consultant who recently conducted a review of Pakistan’s national malaria programme. “It largely hit the districts that had the most difficult malaria situation already, and it had the biggest impacts on the poorest people – those who normally live hand to mouth, in subsistence agriculture, or very small shops, and so on. Crops got destroyed, people lost their jobs and the little cash they had.”",
          "When the rains started to subside, there were huge collections of stagnant water everywhere, noted Dr Schapira. “It was just the perfect storm for malaria.”",
          "Progress in curbing malaria before the floods",
          "Pakistan had been making steady progress against the disease. In the more populous parts of the country, such as Punjab province, industrialization and socioeconomic development led to stronger health systems while better water management and rice cultivation practices helped mitigate the stagnant pools where malaria-carrying mosquitoes often breed. As these areas approached elimination, the focus turned to more rural and remote regions, such as the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, which border Iran and Afghanistan, as well as the province of Sindh.",
          "“Before the flood, there was gradual progress in malaria control,” notes Dr Samira Al-Eryani, a WHO technical officer who witnessed the devastating impact of the flooding in Pakistan first-hand. Key antimalarial activities included distributing insecticide-treated nets for vulnerable populations and increasing the availability of rapid diagnostic tests and treatment. “If the flood hadn’t happened, they could have continued to bring down the malaria numbers given these important ongoing interventions,” she added.",
          "“Pakistan is a very diverse country, and there are many areas that are difficult to reach,” says Izaskun Gaviria, senior fund portfolio manager with the Global Fund, which has supported anti-malaria efforts there since 2003. “Nevertheless, the malaria situation was becoming better and better, to the point where some of the provinces were close to elimination. Then the flood hit, and it turned the situation upside down.”",
          "Reaching the “unreachable”",
          "In fact, Pakistan saw at least a four-fold increase in the reported number of malaria cases after the floods, from 400 000 cases nationwide in 2021 to more than 1.6 million cases in 2022 in the 60 districts supported by the Global Fund (meaning there were very likely many more). Two provinces in particular – Balochistan and Sindh – saw an exponential increase in cases in a short period of time.",
          "Worryingly, an increasing number of these cases were caused by the P. falciparum malaria parasite, which can become fatal quickly without treatment. And after the flood, many communities were unreachable. “It was extremely challenging to reach people during the floods. Roads were destroyed, and people were scattered everywhere,” says Dr Al-Eryani.",
          "“Because the water was so high, there were many millions of people that were fairly inaccessible for several weeks,” notes Dr Gaviria of the Global Fund. The families and villages isolated by the insurmountable waters did not have any access to water, electricity, medicine or information, even as malaria tore through their communities. “Many of the young people we spoke to reported they had never been so sick in their lives. It was hard, very hard.”",
          "Even those who escaped the floods had to contend with the swarms of mosquitoes now breeding in stagnant pools of water. “I remember visiting areas where people had been displaced from their homes and villages and had nowhere to stay,” recalls Dr Mah Talat, Executive Director of the non-profit Indus Hospital & Health Network, a group of healthcare facilities across Pakistan that provide services for all patients free of charge. “It was getting dark, and you could see the mosquitoes everywhere, like large clouds of fleas. I remember thinking, how are these people going to stay here at night, in this dark, haunted place without any facilities?”",
          "Compounding matters even further, the flood didn’t just accelerate a malaria outbreak. Many other diseases and health problems also rode in the flood’s wake, from diarrhoea and cholera to hunger and even snakebites. “The flood brought many health problems,” notes Dr Talat. “There’s no clean drinking water, so we saw more diarrhoea. People are living on the roadside without protection or anything to eat. They’re extremely vulnerable and are being bitten by mosquitoes. So all kinds of vector-borne diseases and infectious diseases thrive.”",
          "“Unexpected and unprecedented”",
          "Nobody was prepared for such a massive deluge. “The 2022 floods were unexpected and unprecedented,” says Dr Qutbuddin Kakar, a WHO official in Pakistan. “There was no signal that we would have this level of floods and heavy rains. Some malaria-endemic districts in Balochistan had been experiencing a dry spell for four years.” But suddenly, rainfall was 6 to 7 times above average in these districts, even for the monsoon season.",
          "In short, “the main culprit behind these floods,” says Dr Talat, “is climate change.” In northern Pakistan, warmer temperatures melted glaciers and caused rivers to surge while, south of the country, sustained heating of the Indian Ocean led to extraordinary levels of rain.",
          "While Pakistan contributes less than 1% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, it is already bearing the brunt of climate change’s impacts. “Unfortunately, we are the victim of climatic changes for which we are not responsible,” says Dr Baseer Achakzai, Director General of Pakistan’s Health Ministry. “There’s no justice in it in terms of who created this problem and who’s now impacted.”",
          "The response, and the road ahead",
          "© WHO/Panos Pictures/Saiyna Bashir. Umaida Hatoon receives antimalarial medicine for her 6-month-old son after he tested positive for malaria at a mobile health clinic supported by WHO in Balochistan, Pakistan (March 2023).",
          "As soon as the flood hit, international health organizations such as WHO and the Global Fund came together with local governments and NGOs to combat the malaria outbreak in Pakistan and help address the extraordinary scale of need. The response drew on both the oldest and newest interventions in the anti-malaria tool kit. In the makeshift refugee camps, nets were distributed, tents (and what houses remained) were sprayed with insecticides, and mass drug administration campaigns were conducted to quickly treat as many people as possible.",
          "In addition, responders took advantage of innovations such as foldable bed nets (which are better suited to small tents), mobile health clinics that provide malaria diagnostic and treatment services, and portable solar panels to produce light, electricity, and mobile phone access for information updates.",
          "Thanks to these efforts, the immediate malaria crisis seems to be receding. “We can see that mortality, and especially infant mortality, is back under control,” says Dr Achakzai. “We have also been able to provide to our district health systems the basic equipment and test kits for malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis.” In addition, Pakistan will focus on building out the health and human resource infrastructure to reach more people living in remote areas of the country.",
          "Dr Achakzai cautions, however, that “there is a lot to do,” and funding remains an issue. “We cannot rely 100% on [international] funding; there should be domestic resources as well.” WHO’s Dr Kakar agrees. “Many provinces are under-resourced and focused on other competing priorities. [Malaria] was not considered a big threat, but with this flood calamity, the threat is now real.”",
          "Nor has the threat diminished just yet. Malaria cases usually decline in winter, and the disease could return with a vengeance in the monsoon season to come. “The situation is still tricky,” warns Dr Talat. “People have gone back to their homes, but many health facilities are not functional or still underwater and, due to the warm season, malaria is again coming back.” Unless national and provincial government officials, donors, and responders all stay vigilant, she adds, there will be a “huge surge in cases” in the year to come.",
          "Reaching those most vulnerable to malaria will require the engagement of all members of society. “We must involve each and every person in society in anti-malaria efforts,” says Dr Achakzai, “including community leaders, opinion makers, politicians, and of course parliamentarians and policymakers. [All must do more] to better reach those who do not have access to health facilities.”",
          "© WHO/Panos Pictures/Saiyna Bashir. A group of men trained by WHO embark on an indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaign in Sohbatpur, Balochistan. IRS is a WHO-recommended intervention to prevent malaria.",
          "If left unchecked, the potential surge could become a regional crisis. “Because of border trade with Iran and Afghanistan, the resurgence of malaria in Pakistan is a major threat for the malaria control and elimination initiatives [in those countries], as well as for elimination efforts in Saudi Arabia,” said Dr Kakar. A surge in malaria cases could also pose a threat for countries within and outside the region that are already malaria-free.",
          "Dr Al-Eryani concurs. “We need to be more prepared and invest more in preparedness. We were not ready for this level of major outbreak. We need to ensure that malaria interventions are timely, effective, and available when and wherever they’re needed.”",
          "For now, Dr Schapira is “cautiously optimistic” about the road ahead. “If we get the [necessary] support for all the districts, then I think the situation in 2024 will be almost back to normal. And, from 2025 onwards, we will be back to a bit less malaria every year. Pakistan could actually get back on track for achieving malaria elimination around 2035, which is their official goal,” he added.",
          "This may not have been a normal transmission season – but with climate change, it could quickly become the new normal, both in Pakistan and in many other places."

          "In April 2019, Gilimbeta took her daughter Lusitana to a rural health facility on the outskirts of Lilongwe, Malawi, for vaccination. At the time, she did not realize that her infant daughter was being written into history:  the 5-month-old was the first child to receive the world’s first malaria vaccine (RTS,S/AS01 or RTS,S) as part of the WHO-coordinated Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme.",
          "The launch of the malaria vaccine pilot implementation in Malawi, followed by introductions in Ghana and Kenya soon afterward, was a breakthrough – this was the first time that a malaria vaccine would be provided to protect children from one of the greatest risks to their health through the national immunization programme.",
          "Today, Lusitana, age 4 years, is an energetic and engaging child. She loves to play with her home-made dolls. She recently started nursery school and is excited to sing the “calendar” song she learned about the months of the year.",
          "“Since she got her vaccine, she’s never had malaria, and she’s a happy and healthy child,” Gilimbeta said. Gilimbeta is now expecting her 3 rd child, who she anticipates will follow her sister in receiving the full 4-dose malaria vaccine regimen.",
          "In a country where malaria remains a leading cause of child illness and death, Lusitana’s future could have been very different.",
          "“In Malawi, malaria is quite prevalent, said Dr Mike Chisema, Immunization Manager and Deputy Director, Preventive Health Services, Malawi Ministry of Health. Most children will experience multiple episodes of malaria per year, any of which could develop into life-threatening severe malaria.",
          "Community acceptance and impact",
          "On a recent morning, Grace walked in Gilimbeta’s footsteps. She left her home early to start the 40-minute walk to the health facility, traveling down a single-lane dirt road surrounded by maize fields. With her youngest daughter, Beauty, swaddled on her back, Grace greeted neighbors and friends along the way, avoiding the puddles left behind by the previous night’s heavy downpour.",
          "Despite the risk of showers, she was determined not to miss Beauty’s monthly health check to have her weighed, examined and vaccinated. On this day, Grace had brought Beauty to receive her 3 rd dose of the malaria vaccine.",
          "“I’ve been affected by malaria, and so have my older children,” explains Grace. “Every time a child or parent is sick, the whole house is affected - I can’t go to work, my husband can’t go to work. I can see a big difference [since Beauty was vaccinated]; the other children get [malaria] but [Beauty] doesn’t.”",
          "On her way to the clinic, Grace stopped to chat with Wezzie Phiri, a community health worker. In addition to her work at the health center, Wezzie is responsible for visiting families like Grace’s at home to provide health information and ensure that children keep up with the routine immunization schedule.",
          "In the years since the malaria vaccine was first introduced in the area, Wezzie has noticed a difference in the community.",
          "“It has been very helpful for the community and the facility,” Wezzie said. \"Since most of the parents are able to take their children to receive the malaria vaccine, the number of children who get sick with malaria and come here to the health center has really reduced.”",
          "For Wezzie, the story of the malaria vaccine is also personal.",
          "“I have 2 girls,” she said. “The 1st one, she never received the vaccine. But with my little one, she finished the 4 doses and I can see the difference. With the older one, it used to be a struggle, because every 2 months she used to get sick with malaria. But with the little one, she has finished all the vaccines and it has been good.”",
          "Becoming routine",
          "In late November 2022, the Government of Malawi announced plans to expand the use of the malaria vaccine across the 11 districts that have taken part in the pilot introduction.",
          "The decision followed the October 2021 WHO recommendation for use of the malaria vaccine to prevent malaria in children, as well as Malawi’s own positive experience.",
          "In his keynote remarks announcing the expansion, the Honorable Secretary for Health for Malawi, Dr Charles Mwansambo, said malaria vaccination “has an important role in the history of the fight against malaria, not only in Malawi but globally.”",
          "About 4 years on, more than 400 000 children in Malawi have received at least one dose of the malaria vaccine. When used alongside other malaria prevention tools, including insecticide treated bednets, the vaccine has been shown to substantially reduce deadly severe malaria, and to reduce all-cause child mortality.",
          "“Malaria kills, but there is now a vaccine that we know works and can be implemented. If all the doses are taken, we know it prevents the severe forms of malaria,” explained Dr Don Mathanga, who leads the evaluation of the public health use of the malaria vaccine in Malawi, at the University of Malawi’s College of Medicine.",
          "The Kawale health center in the Lilongwe district is in an area where the malaria vaccine recently became available as part of childhood vaccination. Access to the malaria vaccine has quickly come to be a normal part of the vaccination programme.",
          "“Mothers value the malaria vaccine and are coming forward with their babies to receive it,” said Dr Mike Chisema.",
          "Unprecedented demand in Africa",
          "More than 1.4 million children have been reached with the malaria vaccine across the 3 pilot countries since 2019. The malaria vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective and has substantial public health impact. If implemented broadly, the vaccine could save tens of thousands of lives each year.",
          "Demand for the malaria vaccine is unprecedented: at least 28 countries in Africa plan to apply for Gavi support to introduce the vaccine. WHO and partners are working to increase vaccine supply as rapidly as possible to protect more vulnerable children and save more lives.",
          "End note:",
          "The malaria vaccine pilot programme is a collaboration of the Ministries of Health of Ghana, Kenya and Malawi; PATH, GSK, UNICEF and Africa-based evaluation and other partners; and funded by Gavi, the Global Fund and Unitaid. U.S.-based Open Philanthropy provided a grant to PATH for the expansion of vaccine use by the Ministries of Health in pilot areas, in collaboration with WHO and using vaccine doses donated by GSK."

          "Wani Kumba Lahai, or Sister Wani as she is known, is a midwife, mother and grandmother. She is also a public health specialist who leads Sierra Leone’s nationwide malaria-in-pregnancy programme for the Ministry of Health and Sanitation. Her responsibilities include overseeing a community awareness programme that engages more than 7300 community health workers (CHWs) implementing different health interventions across the country.",
          "“ Some CHWs may be working in hard-to-reach areas, behind those mountains, those rivers,” says Sister Wani. “Women don’t like to disclose their pregnancy. They’ll keep it a secret from their neighbours, friends and distant relatives, but have trust and confidence to tell a female community health worker.”",
          "Through the programme, trained CHWs go door-to-door, encouraging pregnant women to attend their antenatal care appointments at the closest health centre, where staff not only monitor the health of the mother and fetus but can also deliver the first dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, a medicine given after the first trimester to prevent malaria in pregnancy. The CHWs in Sierra Leone then follow up with subsequent doses, at least one month apart, and continued promotion of antenatal care services.",
          "Sierra Leone is one of 8 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that have piloted in recent years a new community-based approach to malaria prevention during pregnancy.  The projects and programmes build on WHO guidance for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy.",
          "Preventing malaria in pregnancy: WHO guidance",
          "The 2012 WHO guidance called for the administration of at least 3 doses of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with quality-assured sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). It specified that doses of the preventive medicine should be delivered as part of antenatal care (ANC) visits, beginning as early as possible in the second trimester, and at least 1 month apart.",
          "WHO updated this guidance in June 2022 , recommending that other IPTp delivery methods, such as the use of community health workers, may be explored in areas where there are inequities in access to antenatal care (see box below). The recommendation notes that “IPTp is generally highly cost-effective, widely accepted, feasible for delivery and justified by a large body of evidence generated over several decades.”",
          "In addition, WHO has issued guidance on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience. Published in November 2016, the guidance calls for a minimum of 8 contacts between a pregnant woman and health care providers – versus the previously recommended 4 antenatal care visits – offering an increased number of opportunities to deliver IPTp.",
          "Updated WHO recommendation on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (June 2022) Antenatal care (ANC) contacts remain an important platform for delivering IPTp. Where inequities in ANC service and reach exist, other delivery methods (such as the use of community health workers) may be explored, ensuring that ANC attendance is maintained and underlying inequities in ANC delivery are addressed.",
          "Community health workers can make a difference",
          "The issue of access is key. If untreated, malaria in pregnancy can lead to maternal and neonatal death. It can also cause anaemia, stillbirth, and low birth weight, which is a major cause of infant mortality.",
          "According to the latest World malaria report , there were some 234 million malaria cases and 593 000 malaria deaths in the African Region in 2021 – representing an estimated 95% of the burden of the disease worldwide. Women and children are most vulnerable. In 2021, in 38 malaria-endemic African countries, more than 13 million pregnancies were exposed to malaria infection, placing the mother and fetus in danger.",
          "Visits to an antenatal care facility are optimal as they offer both IPTp-SP to prevent malaria and comprehensive health services for a safe pregnancy. However, not every woman has ready access.",
          "Barriers to seeking care include, for example, the long distances that many pregnant women must travel to reach a health facility, travel conditions and cost, and work and family responsibilities. Such inequities, among other factors, have contributed to a low IPTp-SP coverage rate in sub-Saharan Africa; in 2021, only about one third of pregnant women received the 3-dose IPTp regimen.",
          "Community-based delivery of IPTp, or c-IPTp, is an innovative approach aimed at increasing coverage of IPTp with SP, while not detracting from ANC. It complements ANC, giving all eligible pregnant women the opportunity to receive IPTp in the communities close to where they live, as well as at an antenatal care facility.  This can ensure optimal outcomes for the pregnant woman and her fetus.",
          "Along with Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Senegal and Malawi developed their own projects and programmes to pilot c-IPTp. In addition, from 2017 to 2022, the Transforming Intermittent Preventive Treatment for Optimal Pregnancy (TIPTOP) project tested the c-IPTp approach in 4 more countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique and Nigeria.",
          "Managed by Jhpiego, an affiliate of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, the Unitaid-funded TIPTOP project aimed to increase the uptake of IPTp3 among eligible pregnant women in designated geographies (3 districts per country), without detracting from ANC. TIPTOP also aimed to generate evidence to determine the feasibility, acceptability and cost effectiveness of c-IPTp.",
          "The project research findings and complementary data showed that coverage of 3 or more doses of the preventive therapy (IPTp3+) expanded significantly in TIPTOP geographies while the number of antenatal care visits were maintained or increased.",
          "Improved coverage of IPTp3+ and ANC 4+ visits in TIPTOP countries",
          "[From TIPTOP project video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKLWdxP5uBc ]",
          "Considerations for implementation and scale-up of c-IPTp in eligible areas",
          "Country pilots yielded a wealth of experience and insights. Here we highlight just a few:",
          "Pay attention to site selection",
          "Where coverage of antenatal care and IPTp3 are high, the added value of c-IPTp may be limited. A favourable national policy framework and an existing strong CHW programme can also make a big difference.",
          "Training and motivation of CHWs are essential",
          "Community health workers need to know exactly what to do based on each country’s guidelines,” said Dr Dorothy Achu, Regional Malaria Advisor for the WHO Regional Office for Africa. “In some countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria, for example, CHWs can administer the first dose of SP. In other countries, like Mozambique and Sierra Leone, the first dose of SP needs to be administered at an antenatal care clinic, with CHWs then providing subsequent doses.”",
          "Dr Achu further notes that CHWs can play a critical role in ensuring that pregnant women maintain the required intervals between SP doses, and that they are referred to health facilities to receive the full antenatal care package. High quality training, coaching and ongoing supervision are all essential.",
          "In addition, motivation is key. It can come from the prestige of working with a midwife, cash stipends or the joy of supporting healthy mothers and babies. “The quality of the CHWs, their commitment and dedication are what made TIPTOP so successful,” says Kristen Vibbert, TIPTOP Programme Manager with Jhpiego.",
          "Cultivate strong community engagement",
          "“It was great to see the participation of elders, youth, women’s associations, religious associations –they were all involved,” said Dr Seynabou Gaye, who has worked in infectious disease and malaria control in Senegal for 15 years. That engagement helped Senegal increase IPTp3 coverage from 49% in 2019 to 63% in 2021, while maintaining coverage of ANC.",
          "Prevent medicine stock-outs",
          "Stock-outs of SP early in the Democratic Republic of the Congo pilot project prompted TIPTOP to form a taskforce that improved data collection, analysis, and forecasting of SP needs, helping to solve the problem. Moreover, to expand the supplier base for quality-assured SP, in the context of the Unitaid-funded Supply Grant, Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) has supported manufacturers in achieving WHO prequalification for their SP products.",
          "Expect the unexpected",
          "Health worker strikes, extreme weather conditions (e.g. cyclones, floodings), local conflicts and insecurity, the COVID-19 pandemic and more have posed disruptions to the c-IPTp projects. However, when health and development are in the hands of – and led by – communities, in partnership with health facilities, solutions can be found.",
          "For example, COVID-19, if anything, showed the integral role of communities and the importance of CHWs during a pandemic, noted Ms Vibbert. “They helped dispel misinformation, encouraged women to seek medical care, and continued the distribution of SP when people were afraid to go to health facilities.”",
          "Strong data guides strong malaria programmes",
          "Quality data collection, sound data analysis, and a targeted use of the information collected laid the basis for the c-IPTp projects and their continual improvement. However, data collection and analysis can be a heavy lift without adequate support, and there is a need for investments and resources to assure data quality.",
          "While the pilot phase of the c-IPTp projects has ended, most countries have scaled up with government and/or partner support. In Senegal, for example, the initial 10 districts have been expanded to 30 with funding from the United States President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), said Dr Gaye, and c-IPTp is now part of the National Malaria Control Programme.",
          "In addition, further operational guidance from WHO is under development.  “We have to pay attention to how we accompany countries in thinking about this policy,” said Dr Achu, noting that many factors influence its effectiveness in different settings. The upcoming WHO c-IPTp field guide will address a range of considerations in the selection of c-IPTp sites.",
          "In addition, countries need financial support to bring programmes to scale – and initial funding is coming from PMI and from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.",
          "“We all bridge the gap to prevent malaria,” Sister Wani said. “We invest, we implement, we innovate.” Now, c-IPTp adds one more innovation in efforts to drive down malaria cases among the most vulnerable.",
          "One woman’s story of support through pregnancy in Madagascar When Brigitte (pictured right) was pregnant with her first child at age 20, she hesitated to seek antenatal care at the local health centre. Many doubts kept her away. She thought of it as a place only for sick people. She feared there may be expenses that she and her husband could not afford. There was also the widely held belief that if you talk about pregnancy before it is noticeably visible, you could lose your baby. But when Brigitte consulted with a community health worker (CHW) in her village of Andranomadio, Madagascar, she was reassured. The CHW listened to Brigitte’s concerns, promised her the consultation would be free of charge, and explained the advantages of regular antenatal care visits at the health centre for her and her baby, including free malaria prevention and screening for sexually transmitted infections. Brigitte decided to visit the health centre and soon realized the benefits. In addition to medicine to prevent malaria, she received services such as the tetanus vaccine and folic acid supplements. By the time she was 23 weeks into her pregnancy, Brigitte had completed her third ANC visit. She received her first dose of IPTp at the health centre and the next 2 doses at the community level from the CHW. “Prevention is better than cure,” Brigitte said. “And the more you go to the [health centre], the better you are reassured.” She became a champion for encouraging pregnant women in her village to go to their antenatal care appointments and receive IPTp-SP to prevent malaria. Brigitte’s experience echoes that of many women across the African countries that piloted c-IPTp, a community-based approach to prevent malaria during pregnancy.

          "The effort to eliminate malaria in Suriname has made tremendous strides over the past 2 decades, with the number of confirmed malaria cases dropping from 14 000 in 2003 to zero (non-imported) last year. But reaching highly mobile communities of undocumented gold miners with proper diagnosis, care and treatment has been a continuing challenge for public health officials in the country. As part of this year’s World Malaria Day campaign, WHO spoke with Dr Hélène Hiwat, Coordinator of Suriname’s National Malaria Programme, and Dr Hedley Cairo, Malaria Diagnosis Coordinator with the Ministry of Health.",
          "Before we talk about reaching the gold mining population in Suriname, can you give us a brief overview of how the fight against malaria has been going in the country?",
          "Dr Hiwat: We have been combating malaria for many years now. It used to be a very big problem here – Suriname had the highest API [ Annual Parasite Index ] in the South American region before 2004–2005. Then in 2004 we saw the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as a new medicine to treat malaria, as well as the first Global Fund grants to help fight the disease. As a result, the malaria rates in tribal village communities, which are mainly Amerindian and Maroon communities, rapidly decreased.",
          "But then we discovered that malaria remained in the gold mining areas. So around 2007–2008, we adapted our strategy to really focus on these high-case, high-risk population groups by implementing a malaria service delivery network – a network of community health workers in the gold mining areas. From 2009 onwards, this was managed by a dedicated malaria programme under Suriname’s Ministry of Health.",
          "With support from the Global Fund, the malaria programme has worked ever since to reach these mining communities in conjunction with Medical Mission, which is the primary health care provider in the tribal villages in the interior. We had hoped to eliminate malaria in Suriname by 2020 but didn’t quite manage it due to malaria’s reintroduction in Amerindian villages in 2019. We interrupted that spread in 2021, and since August of that year, we haven’t had any national cases in either the village or the mining communities.",
          "But we have still seen continued importation of malaria over the border. This is largely due to the mobility of the mining populations. Most of the gold miners are of Brazilian origin and travel between the countries of the Guiana Shield – so Suriname, French Guyana, and to a lesser extent Guyana. So, while 2022 was the first year for us to have zero indigenous cases, in the last year we have still seen around 60 imported malaria cases in these mobile mining populations.",
          "What tools and strategies do you use to reach this mobile population?",
          "Dr Cairo: A pilot programme was initiated where lay people living and working in the gold mining areas were trained to use rapid diagnostic tests, make a blood smear, and essentially diagnose and treat uncomplicated cases of malaria. At the same time, the national malaria programme undertook missions to these gold mining areas to distribute bed nets and do what we call active case detections.",
          "What are the particularly challenging aspects of reaching the miners?",
          "Dr Hiwat: For one, they are in a very remote part of the forest, so logistics can be very complicated and expensive because the road infrastructure in the interior of Suriname is essentially non-existent. Everything must be done by charter planes or boats, and these are very expensive. Even after you reach a boat landing or airstrip, you still have to go further by all-terrain vehicle to reach the actual camps where the mining sites are.",
          "Dr Cairo: Yes. It depends on the area, and it can take between 1 and 6 hours to get to the camps. We’ve even had trips that last up to 8 hours by boat.",
          "Dr Hiwat: Another issue is communication. We are dealing with migrant communities that have a different language and culture, and there is often a very low level of education among this population which complicates communication as well. And they are mostly living in the context of illegal mining, so a large part of the population is undocumented and has no insurance. These are all barriers that interfere with their access to health care and malaria treatment. That’s what we are dealing with and are trying to overcome.",
          "Given the illegal context, how did these groups react to the initial outreach and how did you develop and maintain trust over time?",
          "Dr Cairo: The main thing we do is work directly with people living in these communities. The people we train are living and working within these mining communities themselves. We also never go there together with police, so there’s a clear distinction between health workers like us and police. When we offer our services, we do not ask for documents. All these things help to build trust.",
          "How do you track who you’ve reached and who you haven’t?",
          "Dr Hiwat: Having these malaria service deliverers in place – and it’s a pretty broad network by now – means that we have good information coming out of the field. And since these deliverers are part of the communities, they are fairly well informed. So, we often hear very quickly when something is happening, when a new mining site is attracting a lot of people, or when there is a higher influx of miners coming from French Guyana. This information is obviously very important to our work.",
          "We also conduct missions to areas that are not covered by the malaria service deliverers on a regular basis, to check the people that are there and to see what has changed in terms of new arrivals and new mining sites.",
          "Were there any new tools or innovations that were especially useful for this outreach effort?",
          "Dr Hiwat: Yes. I’d say the malaria service delivery network itself was a very valuable innovation because we had not been working with these migrant populations before. It’s proven very efficient and cost-effective to have these people in the mining sites.",
          "We’ve also been working in a regional context with French Guyana and Brazil to help combat malaria in the French mining sites. That’s important for the region because the miners in French Guyana have less access to health care than those in Suriname, where we have the malaria service delivery network. The miners in French Guyana tend to sell the gold and buy equipment here in Suriname before going back to the mining sites across the border – this is also often how malaria cases are being imported into Suriname.",
          "To combat this, and to address the issue of self-treatment among miners (which risks accelerating the development of drug-resistant malaria parasites), a new kit was developed for proper self-diagnosis and self-treatment of malaria and distributed exclusively to miners working in French Guyana and along its borders with Suriname and Brazil. This Malakit was an innovation in a 3-country context, and it has been working well as a complementary intervention – after the pilot, we integrated it as a baseline intervention in our strategy. © PAHO/WHO. A facilitator of the Malakit Project in Suriname, pictured left, explains its use to a miner. Another thing we did was changing the models for how we communicate with case populations. We began to work with pictograms and to focus on what best delivers the messages to the target communities. Our staff is multilingual, and we are now also helping to train Medical Mission personnel – who manage and work in the village clinics – to speak Portuguese and give them some basic language lessons to help them communicate with miners, should they try to receive health care in the villages.",
          "Obviously, COVID has been a huge factor in every health campaign the past few years. Can you talk about the role or impact the pandemic has had on your outreach efforts?",
          "Dr Hiwat: We have been working for a while to make our anti-malaria efforts part of an integrated programme, so we were already providing services for HIV, leprosy, and leishmaniasis as well as malaria, because these are also high priority diseases for the target communities. When the Global Fund supported the country with a COVID-19 grant, it was also managed by the malaria programme. Part of this funding included missions to the gold mining sites just for COVID to manage cases and help educate people about the disease. We’ve done a lot of integration of malaria and COVID in our missions to the mining sites, and thankfully have been able to continue the malaria services during the pandemic as a result.",
          "When COVID-19 struck, our programme was already dealing with migrant communities and we already had a network of service deliverers among the miners, so we could assist the Ministry of Health in providing COVID services to them too. Without the malaria programme already in place, the Ministry would have had very few options to reach these communities. But since our system was already working, we were in a position to assist them in COVID efforts, including knowing where outbreaks were, diagnosing people, and assisting in managing cases.",
          "In general terms, why is it important to get health care and interventions to remote at-risk populations?",
          "Dr Hiwat: COVID-19 has shown why it’s so important to reach everyone. Malaria has been a problem in Suriname for a long time, and in the early years of this millennium had a very high impact on the tribal villages. Even if we eliminate the disease from these villages, there is a high risk that it will get reintroduced if we do not also address malaria in the highly mobile mining communities. There is a continuous interaction between the miners and the villages, and the malaria mosquitoes we have here are very efficient. So, a small outbreak could very quickly become a large outbreak in both populations.",
          "Dr Cairo: In addition, miners will use their own medication to treat diseases like malaria, because they have no access or very difficult access to health care. This increases the risk of emerging drug resistance in malaria parasites. That’s why it’s important to reach out to these people and give them proper treatment at the place where they are.",
          "What lessons can other malaria and health intervention programmes take away from your experience with gold miners in Suriname?",
          "Dr Hiwat: The most important lesson we have learned is that it’s necessary for public health reasons to go out to populations at risk and make it possible for them to access health care, which is a basic human right, rather than wait until after problems develop. If you want to combat malaria successfully, you need to have diagnosis and treatment close to the people in need – they should not have to wait hours and hours to receive care. And if malaria parasites develop resistance, it will be a huge problem for the entire region. So the health care system needs to be flexible enough to reach out and go to these populations."

Talks with the Ministry are exploring whether such costs could be included in future health budgets or if this new method could be introduced into the essential benefit package for universal health coverage in Morocco."

          "After five years of trying to become pregnant, Laxmi (name changed), who lives in a low-income neighborhood of a lower-middle income country, remains childless. She has been on an exhausting journey. Years of failed consultations with doctors, visits to clinics, temples, and religious leaders, has left her feeling distraught and ostracized.",

          "Her husband has not undergone any testing to assess if he was contributing to their inability to achieve pregnancy. The couple’s infertility, has led to Laxmi being labelled as ‘inauspicious’ by her own family. This has also taken a toll on her physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being.",
          "Laxmi’s story is not an isolated one; it is shared by millions in all world regions. Across countries and cultures, a lack of accurate evidence-based information, together with socio-cultural pressures to have a child, and the subsequent stigma associated with the inability to have one, causes serious mental health and well-being issues, that are often not discussed, let alone addressed.",
          "Furthermore, as in Laxmi’s case, the burden and the blame for infertility often falls on women alone, adding to the complexity, even though infertility can be caused by male, female, or unexplained factors.",
          "With advances in medicine, there are well-known and effective interventions for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility, but the reality is that fertility care is not universally available or accessible. In many countries, treatment for infertility is not included in health insurance schemes or benefit packages, making it very expensive.",
          "A recently published scientific article shows that cost of a single cycle of in vitro fertilization (IVF), in many low and middle-income countries, is more than the average annual per capita income.",
          "To generate evidence that substantiates these lived experiences and make a data-driven case to include infertility in the global reproductive health agenda, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the Infertility Estimates, from 1990 to 2021. The findings of the report show that 1 in 6 people globally are affected by infertility in their lifetime.",
          "“Given the global magnitude of infertility, and its negative impact on people’s lives and wellbeing, there is a clear need to make fertility care services widely available, accessible and affordable,” said Dr Gitau Mburu, a Scientist within the Contraception and Fertility Care Unit at WHO. “Efforts to address infertility should be part of universal health coverage. This should include financial risk protection to prevent households incurring catastrophic health expenditure on medically assisted reproduction.”",
          "“We need to destigmatize infertility and change it from something that makes people feel unwanted in society,” noted a social scientist who is part of a team of researchers collaborating with the WHO to conduct a study on the impact of delayed conception.",
          "To leave no one behind, we need to break the silence on infertility. There is a critical need for all stakeholders to acknowledge that infertility is a serious health issue, experts say.",
          "“Evidence is noticeably clear that infertility is a significant problem, yet it has been neglected in the global sexual and reproductive health and rights agenda,” said Professor Marie Thoma, a researcher based at the University of Maryland, who has been part of the team that gathered data for the infertility estimates.",
          "The infertility prevalence report is the first of its kind from WHO in more than a decade, and points toward an important public health problem, that is affecting people in all countries and all parts of the world.",
          "WHO is calling on all governments and stakeholders to recognize  infertility as an issue that requires attention and collaboration to provide evidence-based medical, clinical, and psychosocial interventions. Accordingly, countries need to focus on enhancing availability, accessibility, affordability, and quality of interventions, without stigmatizing the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of infertility."

When that happens, they lose their appetite, suffer from fever, diarrhea, and vomiting, and become very weak.”",
          "This life-long experience with malaria is the reason Vivienne and other mothers throughout this part of Kenya were enthusiastic about the arrival in 2019 of the world’s first malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01 (or RTS,S).",

In addition to checking on Vivienne and Isaac’s health, Rose reminded her about the various vaccines routinely given in Kenya. Because Vivienne lives in one of the 26 sub-counties that took part in the pilot introduction, that included the malaria vaccine.",

          "Dr Keith Carter led the mission of WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on Malaria Elimination and Certification to Azerbaijan from 3 to 14 October 2022. The team visited Baku, Azerbaijan’s capital city, and 3 other regions of the country: Lankaran, near the agricultural area on the south-east border with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Bilasuvar, also on the Iranian border, and Sabirabad in the centre of the country, which recorded its last malaria case in 2009.",
          "What makes you confident that Azerbaijan has eliminated malaria?",
          "For many decades there were 3 malaria parasites circulating in Azerbaijan, but Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium malariae transmission was interrupted in the 1960s. After that, Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) remained the only parasite at the local transmission level. When we reviewed Azerbaijan’s history of malaria and the Government’s elimination efforts, we found that the last case of local P. vivax malaria transmission was in 2012. Since then, only a few imported cases have been detected.",
          "We found no evidence of local malaria cases when we examined current data from its malaria detection and reporting surveillance systems. Azerbaijan is not a highly endemic malaria country, and the countries surrounding it – Türkiye, Georgia, Armenia, Russia, the Islamic Republic of Iran – do not have serious malaria problems. Except for the Islamic Republic of Iran in the south, which is also in the process of eliminating malaria, the threat of cases being imported to Azerbaijan by neighbouring countries is extremely low.",
          "Our team found that Azerbaijan’s specimen collection system, network of laboratory services, data management system, and clinical infrastructure is very sound and efficient. It felt like we had seen enough positive outcomes to convince us that they have eliminated malaria.",
          "What do you think Azerbaijan’s most effective strategies are for preventing malaria resurgence in the future?",
          "In terms of resurgence, the most important thing the Government of Azerbaijan can do is ensure that their electronic surveillance system and health care services remain funded and in place, and we pointed this out to health and government officials during our meetings. As long as they don’t dismantle what is currently in place, we saw no problem.",
          "The Ministry of Health registers all cases of infectious and parasitic diseases through Azerbaijan’s Electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance System (EIDSS). This system was introduced in 2010 alongside the national health infrastructure and its insurance system. It merges human and veterinary case data collection and is continuously synchronized among all EIDSS sites nationally. Data can be retrieved almost in real time, making malaria detection and treatment swift and accurate.",
          "We were fortunate to meet with Dr Ahliman Amiraslanov, Chairman of the Committee of Health care of the Azerbaijani Parliament, and other members of the Parliamentary Health Committee responsible for overall governance of the health sector in the country. The committee has ensured a budget to support efforts to eliminate malaria, and will continue providing funding to prevent re-establishment of the disease. The budget specifically allocated for activities to prevent malaria re-establishment is approximately US$ 700 000 annually.",
          "Of the many interventions employed throughout Azerbaijan to eliminate malaria, what impressed you the most and why?",
          "In the capital and beyond we were quite impressed with the people met and the sites visited. While in Baku, we met with staff from the Republican Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology, and parliamentarians responsible for maintaining national malaria control funding and operations as well as training institutions. Later we had the opportunity to travel outside the city to local hospitals, primary care health outposts, laboratories, and the malaria operation centres. During these visits we reviewed data, surveillance and reporting systems, and equipment and procedures for vector control.",
          "We found no problems with the hospitals and health outposts or with the treatment and laboratory facilities that we visited. We also inspected the university and training institutes where doctors, parasitologists and other public health workers learn how to implement prevention strategies and reactive protocols in case of a resurgence. In addition, we found that the epidemiological and entomological supervision systems are working well together to identify vectors and parasites active in the country.",
          "What role has a stable economy and peacetime played in malaria elimination in Azerbaijan?",
          "In terms of malaria, there are a few things to remember: you have the parasites, you have the vectors, and you have the humans that are susceptible to disease. As economies stabilize, governments can invest more in health, diagnostic and treatment centres. They can also adequately fund water management programmes that reduce potential mosquito breeding sites.",
          "For example, in the case of poor-quality housing, a stable economy allows you to, over time, make improvements to housing and prevent the breeding of mosquitoes around people’s homes because you can afford to build proper drainage and irrigation. Economic development means significant reductions in malaria transmission, and that is the situation in Azerbaijan.",
          "From 1993–1996 there was a malaria outbreak in Azerbaijan and approximately 13 000 P. vivax malaria cases were detected. The most explosive outbreak was due to armed conflict with Armenia that disrupted health services and exacerbated malaria transmission, especially among refugees.",
          "Close to a million refugees and internally displaced people were forced to live in tents in open areas where mosquitoes would breed and bite, and health care staff were unable to work. People in need of medical attention could not access appropriate care and the number of malaria infections swelled. When vectors are not detected and people who are infected cannot be diagnosed and treated, it results in an outbreak, which is exactly what happened in Azerbaijan in the 1990s.",
          "Azerbaijan law guarantees health care access as a right to all citizens. How well is Azerbaijan doing in terms of ensuring universal access to health care for all?",
          "We did not survey the entire national health care apparatus, per se, but during our time in the Sabirabad Region we visited a health service outpost and accompanied a nurse practitioner in Garalar village on her door-to-door home visits. She told us that all pregnant women receive prenatal care and appropriate vaccines, enquires for persons with fever, the main symptom of malaria and anyone who needs medical attention can receive it at the clinic or in their homes.",
          "The best-case scenario in any country is a health care service that can provide diagnosis for patients when they walk through the door, and that those cases can be detected and treated quickly. In countries where finances are strong this scenario is available – but in resource poor countries, access to these kinds of health services are much more of a problem.",
          "Azerbaijan is a wealthy enough nation that can afford to implement vector control through insecticide indoor residual spraying, for example, and proper water management practices. It can afford to maintain and sustain diagnostic and treatment facilities. It has access to laboratories with microscopes, and antimalarial drugs, including chloroquine, primaquine, and artemisinin-based combination therapies. Economic prosperity prevents malaria transmission.",
          "Is there a particular malaria elimination intervention that you found is unique to Azerbaijan compared to other malaria endemic countries?",
          "Azerbaijan is an upper middle class income nation, by comparison, to many others and its road systems are excellent and well maintained. This means anyone that is sick can easily reach local health centres close to where they live.",
          "In poorer countries with compromised road and transport systems it is more difficult for patients to reach health centres to receive proper care. Many people end up walking or pedalling a bike for miles to a clinic. Once they do arrive, the health facility may not be equipped with laboratories and microscopes for blood sampling, or the appropriate antimalarial drugs may not be readily available.",
          "Azerbaijan’s Government has been working toward malaria elimination since the 1930s, so today it is a question of maintaining services and funding systems that are already in place. For many years now the country has abided by the WHO’s malaria elimination guidelines, and in the past, it adhered to prevention protocols like the use of bed nets and insecticide spraying, as well as other measures.",
          "Did you observe if the COVID pandemic interrupted or bolstered malaria prevention efforts, and if so, in what way?",
          "When we arrived in October 2022 the railroads were closed due to COVID. We did meet with the airline and railroad industries, and with state customs officials, to discuss travel risks. Both the airlines and railroads were engaged in tracking for potential imported malaria or COVID cases coming into the country. They told us that at airports anyone coming in from overseas with a fever was tested for COVID.",
          "Everyone across multiple sectors was involved in these efforts. At the university and training institutes, we observed how doctors, parasitologists, epidemiologists, and entomologists were being trained to identify and treat malaria and viral diseases. Everyone was on board with malaria and COVID prevention protocols and understood what needed to be done during the pandemic. The systems were clearly in place.",
          "What kinds of prevention efforts did you observe the government is providing to protect agricultural workers from malaria transmission?",
          "Azerbaijan’s agricultural sector includes many cotton and rice plantations that employ large number of workers. These crops, in particular, rely on standing water reservoirs for irrigation purposes, which can become breeding sites for mosquitoes that transmit malaria if they are not managed well. As a result, agricultural workers, in particular, can be at higher risk of malaria.",
          "We had the opportunity to meet with representatives from the Azerbaijan Amelioration and Water Management group in the capital, Baku, that oversees and coordinates irrigation practices from their headquarters, and from satellite offices in the outlying districts. The group works in close collaboration with the Regional and District Centers of Hygiene and Epidemiology to reduce mosquito proliferation in the plantation regions. Their cooperative efforts include monitoring water collectors and drainage systems, and clearing vegetation from channels to prevent mosquito eggs and larvae from growing.",
          "During our visit to farming areas near the Iranian border, we found the health service system was fully equipped to reach agricultural workers if there was a need for care. Protocols call for them to immediately test, diagnose and treat workers with appropriate antimalarial drugs, and to monitor and assess environmental, entomological and epidemiological risk factors. Health workers also conduct malaria prevention education and determine whether insecticide use and water management interventions need to be bolstered.",
          "The citizens of Azerbaijan have endured malaria for decades. Can you briefly discuss any public health education strategies that you felt were effective in harnessing public support and adherence to testing and treatment?",
          "Health care in Azerbaijan is free for everyone in the country, and the fact is that people take advantage of a free health care system. They do go to the district health centres and they do access appropriate treatment when they need it. They get tested and they get vaccinated.",
          "The public’s utilization of services reflects the people’s trust in the public health sector and the officials who lead it. Some of Azerbaijan’s current health infrastructure is built upon the foundation of the Soviet health system that was put in place years ago. People began relying on the health care system then, and they continue to rely on it now. It is free for all citizens in Azerbaijan and the people believe in the information they receive and comply with public health guidelines."

          "Dr Kholmirzo Davlatov is the Director of the State Institution \"Republican Tropical Diseases Center” within the Ministry of Health and Social Protection in the Republic of Tajikistan",
          "The key to malaria elimination is universal access to health care. To what extent has Tajikistan managed to ensure access to health care for all?",
          "Primary health care in the Republic of Tajikistan is organized according to the principle of family medicine. The entire national population, regardless of geographical location, has access to quality medical care that is delivered to all residents through 2908 primary health-care facilities, 523 public sector health facilities and 578 private facilities. As of January 2022, there were 21 170 physicians (20.4 per 10 000 of population) and 61 383 other health workers, including nurses, (58.9 per 10 000 of population) providing medical care throughout the country.",
          "Are the National Malaria Control Programme authorities concerned about the resurgence of malaria in areas bordering Afghanistan? What measures and strategies are in place to mitigate these risks?",
          "Ensuring sustainable entomological surveillance and control of malaria vectors is our primary strategy for preventing the return of local malaria transmission in areas that have been cleared of the disease. This includes areas bordering on Afghanistan where imported cases are a concern. We also employ timely measures to identify and track malaria patients and parasite carriers, and follow their treatment and hospitalization trajectories.",
          "Pursuant to Order No. 606 of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population, the Ministry routinely conducts epidemiological surveillance of malaria and takes blood samples from all patients with a body temperature in excess of 37.5o to determine the causative agent of malaria.",
          "In areas that are highly susceptible and vulnerable to possible resurgence, we mandate entomological surveillance of malaria vectors, while monitoring mosquito breeding sites and their resistance to insecticides. Water management activities are focused on sustainably improving the rational planning of hydraulic engineering and reclamation projects, and colonizing reservoirs where Anopheles breed with mosquito-eating fish. We also spray residential premises with residual-effect insecticides.",
          "It should be noted that we have local Centres for Tropical Disease Control in all areas along the Afghanistan border. Our 2019–2023 national strategic plan to prevent the return of malaria transmission in Tajikistan calls for conducting annual vector control activities along the border to control for the importation of malaria-carrying mosquitoes. A new 5-year plan will soon be crafted to cover the time period of 2023–2028.",
          "All persons arriving from Afghanistan are subjected to a malaria parasitological examination. Every year for World Malaria Day on 25 April, we coordinate a public information campaign about malaria prevention. As part of this campaign, the populations living in the border settlements are examined for malaria.",
          "Over the years, the Government's policy of eliminating malaria and preventing its re-emergence has seen its share of ups and downs. Can you briefly describe some of the critical points where this course was tested and what difficulties were overcome?",
          "Since the late 1990s there was an increase in the incidence of malaria in Tajikistan. The timely adoption of 3 national malaria control strategies, spanning from 1997 to 2015, not only helped to contain the spread of the disease but facilitated the complete elimination of local malaria in 2014, which is when the last case was reported.",
          "In 2000, there was a sharp increase in the incidence of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria and 19 064 cases were detected. Experts from the Tropical Disease Control Centres, which had by then been organized in every region, took all necessary measures to actively identify patients, hospitalize them in a timely manner, treat foci, conduct proper epidemiological surveillance, and carry out informational and educational activities. These timely actions resulted in a sharp decrease in malaria incidence within 2 years, bringing the caseload down to 6160.",
          "Approximately 14 million doses of COVID vaccine have been administered in Tajikistan since the pandemic began. Has the Ministry of Health combined COVID testing/vaccination with malaria testing/tracing/antimalarial administration? Has the pandemic stepped up action against malaria or, on the contrary, hindered it?",
          "COVID testing and vaccination did not jeopardize our malaria control efforts because regardless of COVID testing, all patients with suspected fever were screened for malaria.",
          "During the pandemic, health care workers intensified their house-to-house visits to actively identify patients with fever, which simultaneously increased the number of people screened for malaria. Malaria chemoprophylaxis was not carried out in parallel with COVID vaccination, but all segments of the population over 18 were immunized according to indications.",
          "Tajikistan's main exports are rice and cotton, but irrigation systems in these industries often create breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Can you describe what water and irrigation management practices have been put in place to reduce the number of such breeding areas? How did these efforts fit in with the efforts of the National Malaria Control Programme?",
          "The most radical method for eliminating malaria outbreaks is preventing the formation of mosquito breeding sites. Through our National Malaria Control Programme, we focus on a variety of sanitary and water management activities in the rice and cotton-growing regions.",
          "Working in partnership with the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources, our hydraulic engineering measures include draining and backfilling water bodies unnecessary for agriculture, and cleaning drainage networks, water collectors and water bodies in districts with a high risk of malaria.",
          "At the same time, we have made widespread use of biological methods to eliminate mosquito larvae. In rice plantations and reservoirs favourable to the development of Anopheles, we have introduced the use of the mosquito larvae-eating fish, Gambusia. This biological prevention method has proven to be highly effective, and as a result, there has been a sharp decrease in the Anopheles mosquito population in the protected areas.",
          "What collaboration is taking place between the National Malaria Control Programme and military units to ensure that border guards deployed along the Afghan border are tested and treated as part of active malaria case-finding strategies?",
          "The National Committee for Coordinating AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria continues its work. The committee is comprised of representatives from such government departments as the health sector, tourism, migration, the Committee for the Protection of the National Borders, and others. Joint activities are managed with the in-house medical services of the Border Forces Directorate and focus on controlling malaria vectors, screening personnel for malaria, and holding seminars on malaria prevention.",
          "Every border post has a medical officer or paramedic assigned to be in close contact with the Regional Tropical Disease Control Centres, which are equipped with rapid testing kits, slides, and blood lancet devices. Patients suspected of having malaria must provide a blood specimen that is sent for laboratory testing at a Tropical Disease Control Centre.",
          "If the result is positive, an epidemiological investigation of the case is conducted at the border post, followed by a series of antimalarial and anti-mosquito measures carried out by the Centre’s personnel and experts. If a positive case is detected, the patient is then admitted to a military hospital for treatment.",
          "At certain times of the year, in order to assess the reliability of the absence of local transmission of malaria, studies are carried out along the border with a special focus on border guards. Similar studies conducted in 2015, 2019 and 2021 detected no positive results.",
          "What important lessons or experiences can you share with other countries working toward eliminating malaria?",
          "Tajikistan’s historical data indicates that as a result of large-scale antimalarial measures, malaria had been eliminated as a mass disease by 1960. Only isolated foci remained within a 3-kilometer zone from the floodplain of the Amu-Darya and Pyanj Rivers, usually opposite the Afghan border settlements where possibility of transmission of malaria could not be ruled out.",
          "After achieving such success, malaria stations were subsequently disbanded and the number of parasitologists, laboratory assistants, entomologists and disinfectors were reduced. Thus, during the malaria epidemic that hit in the early 1990s, there was a shortage of trained and experienced malaria control staff and it was difficult to carry out antimalarial activities at the local level.",
          "During this period, the Ministry of Health was compelled to educate and train specialists in the field of malaria surveillance and control via international and national training courses and seminars. The Ministry had to rebuild and relaunch activities at specialized antimalarial institutions and establish national and provincial level Tropical Disease Control Centres, with special attention paid to districts with a high risk of malaria transmission.",
          "Preventive and anti-epidemic malaria measures were launched within the framework of national programmes. Strategic plans were financed from the state budget and supported by grants from a number of international organizations. As a result, Tajikistan was able to eliminate malaria.",
          "What is one of the most concerning challenges Tajikistan needs to address to prevent resurgence?",
          "One of the most pressing tasks currently facing health services in Tajikistan is improving the existing system of epidemiological surveillance of malaria, intensifying our vigilance, and preventing the importation of the disease and its consequences.",
          "In order to maintain the current malaria situation and prevent the disease from re-emerging in Tajikistan, we need to fortify the capacity of the Tropical Disease Control Centres and the parasitological departments of the health and epidemiological surveillance centres.",
          "When carrying out anti-mosquito measures, and depending on the focality and occurrence of vectors, we have learned that we must pay special attention to the type of malaria landscape at hand. The application of a full-range of anti-mosquito measures are not always appropriate in certain environments so targeted actions caan often be more effective while also saving money."

          "Lessons learned Learning the lessons from its COVID-19 preparedness and response, Kazakhstan is committed to building robust and sustainable infection prevention and control (IPC) solutions , in the health care sector and in communities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kazakhstan boosted its IPC capacities at a national level by rapidly establishing or strengthening all core components of IPC programmes, including extensive training of front-line health workers and assessment and improvement of evidence-based IPC practices at the point of care in health care facilities. The Government of Kazakhstan is fully committed to building robust sustainable solutions and has included IPC element in the national “Healthy Nation” strategic programme for 2021-2025. A set of policy-level recommendations provided by WHO Europe to the Ministry of Health (MoH) has triggered important changes in the normative national IPC frameworks. As such, several decrees by the  MoH  have been either revised or developed, with a focus on: a national IPC programme developed and endorsed by MOH establishing facility-level IPC programmes; updating national guidance for surveillance of health care-associated infections; creating accreditation standards for healthcare facilities (HCF), including mechanisms for monitoring and audit; developing standards on workload, staffing, and bed occupancy for HCF; and developing water sanitation and hygiene as well as physical infrastructure standards. A functional IPC programme MoH has appointed IPC focal points and created a voluntary national expert group on IPC and antimicrobial resistance to provide technical IPC advice to the MoH. In 2019, the national expert group requested WHO Europe to support the self-assessment of the WHO IPC core components at the national and facility levels using WHO assessment tools. A pilot assessment was conducted at some medical facilities and, based on this assessment, national authorities have made a decision to strengthen IPC practices at four medical facilities to show the case of best IPC practices. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the National IPC programme supported the national COVID-19 task force by ensuring alignment of national IPC measures with international recommendations . IPC measures have been implemented using a multi-modal strategy implementation approach , IPC trainings of front-line health workers were extensively and routinely conducted, and IPC capacities at the health care facility level were further strengthened as an outcome of regular assessment, monitoring, and feedback. Learning the lessons from the COVID-19 preparedness and response , Kazakhstan has endorsed the national IPC programme and is institutionalizing the sharing of technical expertise and best practice through the forthcoming establishment of a formal IPC committee, composed of IPC practitioners from internationally accredited health care facilities with a robust IPC programme. In-country IPC experience exchange is in place to facilitate the sharing of best IPC practices within HCF IPC programmes, while evidence-based recommendations are being included in the forthcoming national IPC manual. Investing in human resources Specific attention is given to training and capacity building of the IPC workforce.  Kazakhstan has expanded the use of OpenWHO IPC courses for on-the-job training and is working on the revision of the current national IPC training curriculum in line with the WHO guidance on core competencies for IPC professionals .  A pool of national IPC experts received international training, and the MoH intends to develop a competency-based training curriculum for IPC professionals and the general health care workforce."

          "COVID-19 vaccination coverage is on the rise in some of Africa’s most fragile humanitarian settings as a two-year project funded by the European Union enters its last four months.",
          "At the start of 2022, the COVID-19 vaccination rate was less than 5% on average in the 16 participating countries. That rate is now closing in on 30% – the continent’s average – among the 14 countries whose data was available in January.",
          "The countries participating in the €16 million grant project are Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Tanzania.",
          "To achieve those rising numbers, national health workers trained by WHO experts have been administering vaccines in urban hubs, remote villages, refugee and displacement camps, workplaces, public spaces and elsewhere.",
          "“We don’t wait for the people to come to the vaccination sites. We go to the rural areas, to allow these populations to be vaccinated without having to travel and abandon their work in the fields, which is very precious to them,” said Daré Rabiou, regional director of public health, population and Social Affairs in Maradi, Niger.",
          "Rachida Ibrahim, a nurse at a health center in Kouroungoussao, elaborated on that way of working: “Every morning we vaccinate people against COVID-19. When there’s nobody left to vaccinate, we get on the motorbike and go to a village to vaccinate there also.”",

          "In Somalia, 42% of people were fully vaccinated by the end of 2022. Among these were some of the hardest-to-reach communities, such as nomads, refugees and people living in camps after fleeing drought and conflict. Project teams have so far fully vaccinated almost half of Somalia’s internally displaced people.",
          "From its start, the project has prioritized the most vulnerable, such as health workers, older people, and those living through humanitarian crises. In nine of the project countries, 56% of people of people living in refugee or displacement camps, along with their host communities, have been fully vaccinated, according to project data.",
          "Funded by the European Union and trained by WHO, vaccinators reached remote areas and camps for displaced people, including the Malika camp in Mozambique, above. ©WHO",
          "Most countries saw the biggest jump in their coverage rates after vaccination campaigns that were held from September to December of 2022. In Cameroon, for example, the number of vaccinated people doubled after a mass-vaccination campaign in November.",
          "Mozambique has been one of the project’s success stories; nearly two-thirds of the country’s population has been fully vaccinated. Among that group is Julieta Jose, a resident of the Malika camp for internally displaced people.",
          "“I’m very happy about the visit from the team because some people here in the community were never vaccinated,” she said. “It’s the best way to prevent COVID-19. I told everyone I know to come and get it.”",

          "The number of health workers trained to administer COVID-19 vaccines rose from about 130 000 less than a year ago to almost 1.6 million at the end of January; about 1000 of these were deployed in South Sudan in late 2022, helping raise the coverage rate from one of the world’s lowest to about 20%. The workers had to learn the cold-chain requirements of the vaccines, service-delivery procedures and more. Among those trained was Isaac Chol.",

          "A group of general doctors, nurse practitioners and other primary health care workers completed their training with the trainer, Dr Oh Chunghyeon. WHO estimates that over 60% of the need for ear and hearing care can be addressed at the primary level. This is possible through trained health care providers equipped with basic equipment and knowledge on ear examination, identification of hearing loss, and management of commonly encountered problems like ear wax and ear discharge.",
          "More about the PEHC training manual",
          "The Primary ear and hearing care training manual developed by WHO is an important resource to inform the community about healthy hearing practices and facilitate early identification of hearing loss. The training manual is comprehensive, starting from the anatomy of ear and teaches a public health approach for ear and hearing care. It is clear and easy to follow with hands-on practice sessions. It is a great tool for participatory training which includes group discussions. After completion of the training programme, the participants are competent not only in preventing, identifying and treating ear and hearing conditions but they can also more effectively refer patients with severe ear diseases to ENT specialists."

          "In many countries, parents of children with cerebral palsy often struggle to find information on how to support their children to improve functioning and independence. In this story, one parent describes her experience searching for information which led her to contribute to the community.",
          "Nguyen Phuong Ha knew something was different with her daughter, Pika, soon after she was born in Ho Chi Minh, Viet Nam in 2012. Her baby was born premature and found to have a brain haemorrhage three days after birth.",
          "“I just felt my daughter was not ok,” recalled Phuong. “But when I asked the doctor, he said, ‘Oh, premature babies are like this. There will be development delays. It’s normal.’”",
          "In the months that followed, Phuong brought her baby at her own cost to many other doctors, but none offered support, guidance or a diagnosis. She searched for information but didn’t come up with anything. So, as a biology researcher working with a research institute, she began her own research. After 11 months, she suggested to a doctor that her daughter had cerebral palsy. The doctor agreed. But he could offer no support or a plan for treatment for her daughter.",
          "“At that time in my country, there was not much information about cerebral palsy from public hospitals. And there was no support for parents,” Phuong said. “And because my daughter’s condition was so severe, they just said negative words.”",
          "Building a community to support parents",
          "With the dearth of information on cerebral palsy, and her many questions on her daughter’s health condition, she decided in 2014 to make a trip abroad to learn how children with cerebral palsy and their families were supported in other countries.",
          "“I was amazed, because there are many therapies with a new [approach]…,” she said, adding previously, she was only aware of physical therapy, which she has now studied in a course. “I found there were many systems to support parents – equipment, therapy, information. I learnt a lot.”",
          "Once home, realizing the scarcity of information and support from the health system for parents of children with cerebral palsy (CP), she resolved to share what she had learnt with other parents. She set up the “Superhero Family Club” group on Facebook. Within two weeks, it had 200 members. It quickly became a community for parents. She found that she shared a bond, a similar “voice inside”, with other parents.",
          "To help her research, she studied English on YouTube. She used this knowledge to translate information into Vietnamese, which she then shared with parents. “I learnt English by myself because of my daughter. I read a lot. Now I can read documents about CP very fast,” she said.",
          "Phuong is deputy chairwoman of the Cerebral Palsy Family Association in Viet Nam. Photo courtesy of Phuong.",
          "The seed planted has grown to a tree",
          "Today, a decade later, Phuong is deputy chairwoman of the Cerebral Palsy Family Association in Viet Nam, which provides support and information for parents of children with cerebral palsy. The Association has 3,000 members and 1,000 volunteers, who provide all kinds of support for the children, including a fund for parents who need help. “Everything is getting better,” she said.",
          "She is a spokesperson for parents on cerebral palsy, interacting regularly with the medical community. She has received an award from the Viet Nam Federation of People with Disabilities for her tremendous contribution for parents of children with cerebral palsy.",
          "Phuong has also contributed in other ways to the community. As she found no educational options available for her daughter, she decided to start a class for children with CP. “My daughter has severe CP. I found no school for her. So I decided to start a class for children with CP,” she explained.",
          "“At the hospital, I was told that children with CP cry a lot, but in our class, the children do not cry. My daughter is very happy there – she’s 10 now and very talkative! The parents are happy too. It is just amazing, I planted a small seed and now the tree has grown up.”",

While Sierra Leone was one of the first western African nations to receive COVID-19 vaccines—beginning its vaccine rollout in March 2021—by March 2022,\r\n        Sierra Leone had only 14 percent of its population vaccinated. That was up from five percent two months previous.",
          "On the strength (12 mass vaccination campaigns in 2022 and three in 2021) and strenuous efforts to reach remote parts and populations of the country, a year on—as of March 2023—Sierra Leone had administered 7.8 million doses of COVID-19\r\n        vaccines.",
          "37.9% of Sierra Leone’s total population has now been vaccinated against COVID-19 and in December 2022 Sierra Leone reached the target of vaccinating 70% of their adult population.",

Born and raised in Makontakay, Jeremiah knows the area and the communities well, and is trusted:\r\n            he loves working in the health sector, and dreams of becoming a doctor. “I feel really good to be able to help my people. I can see their health improving and I know I am contributing that that,” he says. In speaking with residents about COVID-19 Jeremiah is also able to engage people about drinking clean\r\n            water, hygiene, malaria prevention and general health. “As a mobiliser we are role models, so it’s important that people see us doing the right thing like taking the COVID-19 vaccine. When others saw that I took the vaccine, it gave them courage to take it themselves.” Photo credit: WHO / UNICEF / Michael Duff Here Jeremiah (right) walks with Kamoi resident Amara (left) to a mobile COVID-19 vaccination clinic on 8 December 2022.

If not for these teams most people here wouldn’t have been vaccinated.” “Before the mobilisers came, we were all very afraid to take the vaccine. No one wanted to take it because they thought it would kill them. But when they came and talked to us about the virus and the vaccine most of us changed our minds.\r\n                Many people here have even had three doses!” ---------------------------- In January 2022, WHO, UNICEF and Gavi established the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP) to intensify support to COVID-19 vaccine delivery. Working with governments and essential partners, CoVDP provided urgent operational support to\r\n            the 34 countries that were at or below 10% full vaccination coverage in January 2022 on their pathways toward achieving national and global coverage targets. The greatest benefits of this approach were increases in full vaccination and booster\r\n            coverage for in both general and high-priority populations – older adults, healthcare workers, and persons with co-morbidities, including immunocompromised persons.

          "When Dr Karina Quintero, a pediatrician associated with Panama’s Ministry of Health, first began working with the Paediatric Cancer Commission, she noted high mortality among children with cancer across the country. “In Panama, approximately,\r\n    90% of childhood cancer patients come with advanced-stage cancer—so the survival rate is very low,” she shares.",
          "Low childhood cancer survival rates in Panama are mirrored across other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where more than 90% of children with cancer live. For a child living in a LMIC, the likelihood of surviving cancer is less than 30%. However,\r\n    survival rates go up to over 80% for children living in high-income countries who can access optimal care.",
          "A complex interplay of factors contributes to lower survival rates in LMICs. These include incorrect diagnosis, insufficient diagnostic capacity and delays in treatment and treatment abandonment. The WHO Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer established in 2018, with the support of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital aims to address these factors and double childhood cancer survival rates to 60% globally, by\r\n    2030.",

          "Establishing cancer centres of excellence and care networks",
          "When cancer services are accessible, most children with cancer can be cured. What is required is a series of small, strategic investments to improve health systems. Establishing national cancer centres of excellence is one such measure that is implemented\r\n    through the Global Initiative. In the past two years over 12 countries participating in the Global Initiative have established cancer centres of excellence and made investments to increase the capacity of their health workforce to deliver quality\r\n    services for children with cancer. These cancer centres connect the dots across levels of healthcare through a robust referral pathway and harness competencies of a well-trained and multi-disciplinary health workforce—enhancing health outcomes.",
          "1. A robust referral pathway that connects the dots across levels of healthcare. Most children with cancer first seek attention at facilities close to their homes. Yet, across LMICs, the capacity of primary healthcare workers to diagnose\r\n    early and make appropriate referrals for childhood cancer cases remains limited. A global survey revealed that only 20% of countries reported having early detection programmes\r\n    or guidelines to strengthen early diagnosis of childhood cancer symptoms at the primary-care level. Moreover, only a third of countries globally have clearly defined referral systems from primary care to secondary and tertiary care, for suspected\r\n    childhood cancer cases.",
          "The Global Initiative ensures that services are coordinated at all levels—from community to specialized treatment centres—and that services are oriented towards providing care closer to home. Through the Initiative, Panama’s Ministry\r\n    of Health (MoH) developed a guide to enable healthcare providers, particularly primary healthcare workers, to understand the signs and symptoms of childhood cancer and follow a streamlined referral process. Over 400 primary healthcare providers across\r\n    the country received training on early detection and timely diagnosis of childhood cancers.  As a result of Panama’s participation in the Global Initiative, Dr Karina Quintero has noticed that “more children with stage-I or stage-II\r\n    cancer are coming in for treatment, and as a result of early diagnosis, survival rates have improved.”",
          "Early detection programmes and guidelines to strengthen early diagnosis of childhood cancer symptoms have been established as regional priorities in the Americas and Africa.",
          "2. A well-trained and multi-disciplinary health workforce that harnesses diverse competencies in cancer care. Caring for children with cancer requires several competencies, including nursing, nutritional support, psychosocial support,\r\n    infection prevention and control, and supportive and palliative care. The Global Initiative promotes a model of care that builds competencies of health workers across diagnostic, treatment and essential supportive services for childhood cancer—ensuring\r\n    comprehensive care.",
          "Dr Krishna Paudel, who works in Nepal’s Ministry of Health describes how the country is building a multi-disciplinary workforce to improve health outcomes in childhood cancer care: “When we manage a child with cancer, a lot of people are involved,\r\n    and they all need to be on the same page. Our existing nursing curriculum in Nepal does not cover all the core skills needed to provide care for a child with cancer. Under the Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer, our focus has been on training\r\n    nurses who spend more time with the patient and family members. It is very important that they know the challenges involved in cancer treatment and are trained to support families through this difficult time.”",
          "Since 2018, ten countries, including Nepal, have developed competency-based training curriculum to strengthen their childhood cancer heath workforce.",
          "Small, strategic investments in cancer care can save lives",
          "WHO’s technical assistance to governments to support them in building and sustaining high-quality childhood cancer programmes extends beyond establishing cancer centres of excellence and care networks. It also includes universal health coverage\r\n    by integrating childhood cancer as part of the full range of essential services and within benefit packages; roadmaps for diagnosis and treatment; and evaluation and monitoring through robust information systems and research. By making these strategic\r\n    investments in cancer care, we can save the lives of one million children over the next decade."

          "At WHO’s 152nd Executive Board meeting, Member States provided guidance to shape the next stage of polio transition and underlined their continued commitment to integrating the tools and expertise established for polio eradication to strengthen national health systems.",
          "Since the Strategic Action Plan for Polio Transition 2018 – 2023 was presented to the World Health Assembly in 2017, significant progress has been made. Several countries, such as India, have successfully transitioned their polio programmes to serve broader public health, whilst in other countries, such as Sudan, the introduction of multidisciplinary Integrated Public Health Teams have offered an innovative path to repurpose the skills of the polio network. In 2022, “proof of concept” for transition was further demonstrated through the successful transition of over 50 low-risk countries from Global Polio Eradication Initiative support.",
          "Building upon this progress, 2023 will see the development of a new global vision for polio transition, underpinned by tailored regional action plans and a revised monitoring and evaluation framework. The aim is to ensure that transition remains responsive to changes in global, regional and country health contexts, as well as lessons learned .",
          "During the 152nd Executive Board, Member States proposed that the global vision and regional action plans focus on transitioning polio assets to strengthen essential immunization, sustain high quality sensitive surveillance systems, and bolster health security. The United Kingdom noted the need to align efforts with broader primary healthcare approaches, whilst the United States of America noted that robust surveillance is critical to maintain a polio-free world.",
          "Countries including Paraguay and India emphasized that one of the focus areas of post-2023 transition vision should be to reach vulnerable populations, with a particular focus on more than 25 million ‘zero-dose children’, who have never received vaccine doses. Yemen noted that many of these children live in areas with protracted polio outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a backsliding in routine immunization rates worldwide, resulting in a global call to action to reach under-served communities.",
          "Member States additionally called for the work of integrating polio functions with the essential immunization system to be accelerated, to help achieve eradication in the most challenging geographies, and to lay the groundwork to prevent a resurgence of poliovirus.",
          "The Director of the Eastern Mediterranean Region, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, spoke on behalf of WHO’s six Regional Offices, noting, “There is a strong commitment to maintaining polio essential functions across all Regions, which will ensure that the significant investment is not lost as the Global Polio Eradication Initiative draws down. This is critical to maintain a polio-free world.”",
          "Success will rely on the collective commitment of national governments, WHO, partners and donors, including to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of transitioned functions.",
          "Thanking Member States, the WHO Deputy Director General, Dr Zsusanna Jakab, said, “We have an invaluable opportunity to position transition within an evolving global health landscape. An important lesson learned is that one size does not fit all – transition must be more nuanced, flexible and context specific.”",
          "“The global vision… will align transition efforts with the evolving global health agenda, including efforts for pandemic preparedness, integrated disease surveillance and health systems recovery and resilience.”",
          "This was the first opportunity for Member States to offer guidance related to the new vision and regional action plans. In the months ahead, WHO will convene multiple stakeholders at the global, regional and country level, to develop a common post-2023 vision, supported by regional action plans, to help realize strong and resilient health systems."

Through brief Q&A sessions, we shine a spotlight on each person’s RCCE journey, the work that they do and their unique insights on working in the field of risk communication and community engagement.",
          "Q&A with Melinda Frost",
          "Melinda Frost has been working in global public health for over 20 years in more than 40 countries in all WHO regions. Most recently, Mindy, as she is known to colleagues, was the RCCE lead for the World Health Organization global team.\r\n                    She is also the founder of the WHO regional network of RCCE focal points known as the Formidable Officers of RCCE (FORCCE) and is responsible for co-designing and co-leading the Emergency Communications Network and SocialNet deployment\r\n                    trainings, which collectively prepared 300+ media and emergency risk communicators and social and behaviour scientists for deployment.",
          "In this interview, we ask Mindy about working during the COVID-19 pandemic, her hopes for the future of RCCE and what’s next on her to-do list.",
          "FS: Mindy, you were leading the global RCCE team for WHO during the height of the pandemic. What was that experience like?",
          "MF: I’m trying to think of adjectives other than exhausting and exasperating – I’m joking of course – as tough as it was, there’s no other place I would have preferred to be during the pandemic response. I’m often amazed\r\n    at the sheer intensity of the work we did within the WHO Incident Management team. I’m so proud to have worked with many incredibly talented colleagues. The world is truly lucky to have WHO and especially fortunate to have dedicated people that\r\n    work in emergencies for WHO. I hope I was the right person at the right time for RCCE.",
          "I often think back to January 2020 having just come back from a family vacation (thankfully) and having visited my parents. We were a skeletal staff at the start of the response. We soon hired a team of RCCE experts and various scientists that could potentially\r\n    decipher what was going on and help us tailor information and guidance to affected populations. The year prior, I formalized the WHO RCCE regional network which proved invaluable throughout the response. We’ve met nearly every week for the past\r\n    three years sharing methods, data, materials and experience.",
          "We also quickly synchronized with partners. I remember a coordination group with WHO, UNICEF, IFRC (the International Federation of the Red Cross) and many others choosing to conclude regular meetings for Ebola response — only to start again the\r\n    next week and every week after (even to today) for COVID-19. This mechanism was formalized in June 2020 as the Collective Service which brings together the best of the best of the various partner organizations and ensures that we don’t duplicate\r\n    – or worse – leave gaps in preparedness, readiness and response in the very delicate work that needs to be done with communities. In 2022, both the WHO RCCE regional network and Collective Service joint responses expanded to cover a handful\r\n    of other concurrent emergencies.",
          "FS: What were some of the lessons you learned from the pandemic?",
          "MF: There was a lot we already knew would likely happen – misinformation, disinformation, misinterpretation of science, the need to communicate uncertainty and changes in scientific findings, the need to be generally consistent with messaging and\r\n    the need to tailor information and guidance to the local contexts. These are common issues that risk communication aims to tackle. I think the things that helped the most in the response to COVID-19 and that will shape the way we respond from now\r\n    on are the networks and partnerships I described earlier and the use of data. We had more data than ever before in the field of RCCE. Whether it was online social media data from our Infodemics team or behavioural insights – there was so much\r\n    information that really helped to shape our interventions. While it was difficult to absorb and nimbly respond at the global level, our regional offices were really able to operationalize this at region and country levels. Next, we really need to\r\n    ensure that RCCE practitioners and Member States know how to manage these data for future emergencies and can implement the most effective interventions given very dynamic and complex community level contexts.",
          "FS: What do you think is the one thing most people often get wrong about risk communication and community engagement?",
          "MF: RCCE, at least at WHO headquarters, is well placed as a technical response pillar equal to that of surveillance, infection prevention and control, clinical care, etc. The same can be said of WHO regional offices. However, the reality in national level Ministries of Health and sub-national entities can be a different story. Oftentimes, RCCE teams are a combination of media officers and community health workers focused on non-emergency topics (e.g., nutrition, immunization, non-communicable disease) who really know their communities. RCCE should be considered as the technical communication and engagement with affected populations which requires a spectrum of skills including emergency risk communication, operational socio-behavioural research, coordination with community leaders and civil society organizations, behaviour change communication, infodemics management and so on. It’s a broad and important field requiring a number of interoperable skills. RCCE incorporation into emergency preparedness, readiness and response has been an iterative process but I feel now it has a critical ‘seat at the table’ for all future emergencies. How can health emergency response continue effectively without a strong and dedicated focus on the people most affected by emergencies? This is why there’s a key focus on this area of work in the WHO Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Framework.",
          "I’m not sure that RCCE will continue as it has in the past; perhaps this area of work will be re-envisioned but there’s no doubt that the work done on COVID-19 and other concurrent emergencies has set a path for more effective support for\r\n    individuals and communities to be informed, engaged and empowered to make decisions for their health and well-being before, during and after emergencies.",
          "FS: What are your hopes for the future of RCCE?",
          "MF: While RCCE has always been a key part of emergency response and an important part of the International Health Regulations, it’s unfortunately been a sorely underfunded area of work which means trained workforce has been inconsistently supported\r\n    in Ministries of Health. When there is a dedicated RCCE pillar – it’s often one person versus a more comprehensive and required team. I think now everyone recognizes this need to effectively communicate and engage with affected populations\r\n    but we need more consistent approaches. I think the forthcoming RCCE Competency Framework should help set the path for consistent capacity building content, learner pathways and introduction into university curricula. In addition, I think this area\r\n    of work is plagued a bit with an identity crisis. Every organization has a different name for this discipline which I fear causes confusion at country level. We need to start being more consistent in terms of ‘terms,’ as well as monitoring\r\n    and evaluation indicators for this area of work.",
          "FS: Finally, congratulations on your new role as the Head of the Learning Solutions and Training Unit. Can you tell us a little bit about that and how RCCE will continue to factor into your work?",
          "MF: Admittedly, it’s bittersweet to be leaving RCCE. I’ve worked for a really long time in emergencies and RCCE but I also have significant background and experience in instructional design so I’m really excited to return to those roots.\r\n    I will still be able to support RCCE capacity building. I’ll be helping to develop a new training portfolio to address today’s emergency challenges ensuring that the next generation of RCCE emergency responders can access and absorb the\r\n    increasing amount of data inputs and make effective decisions while working as a key member of an incident management team."

          "More than three years have gone by since the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic. Since then, vaccines have been developed and we’ve learned a lot more about the\r\n                            virus and what we can do to mitigate its spread. In many parts of the world, life has returned to a semblance of normality. But with governments lifting mandates for preventive measures, the risk of COVID still looms large\r\n                            over the world. As pandemic fatigue continues to impact all aspects of the COVID-19 response, WHO sees the need to continue communicating to people and vulnerable groups the risks of COVID-19. To understand better the sentiments of communities in various parts of the world, the Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE) team recently completed a three-phased process to identify, develop and test creative ideas for the next phase    of the COVID-19 pandemic. Below is a brief overview of each of the three stages and the results:",

The main goal of the Ideation Workshop was to spark innovative ideas \r\n         for COVID-19 public health and safety measures interventions  by leveraging a diverse variety of perspectives. The workshop explored messaging related to COVID-19 public health and safety measures and vaccines, long COVID-19 and other\r\n        topics, resulting in a broad pool of concepts and ideas.",
          "Stage 2: Development of Creative Themes and Concepts",
          "Working with M Booth, a creative communication agency, the RCCE team narrowed down the list of broad COVID concepts to four creative concepts that were tested on a global scale. Each of the concepts leveraged different images, key messages and ideas\r\n        to positively engage vulnerable groups and the general public to continue practicing public health and safety measures.",
          "Below are the four ideas that were tested:",
          "Stage 3: Testing of Creative Concepts",
          "Testing of the four creative concepts was undertaken in December 2022 by research testing agency, Stickybeak, to understand at a country level which of the four concepts is most motivating for people to take action. The survey asked which concepts\r\n        participants found most motivating, both visually and linguistically, in terms of adherence to public health and safety measures.",
          "Survey audiences were recruited via Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok. The survey targeted a ‘lite’ nationally representative group of 200 per country, across 30 countries (five in each of WHO’s six regions). Respondents were split\r\n        more or less evenly across gender (male/female) and age groups (18-34/35-54/55+ years old) although in some countries in the African region, a higher percentage of the younger population was recruited because of the demographics.",

              "As a foundation, preventive measures are still seen as important across all countries surveyed (On a five-point scale, 87% of survey respondents gave preventive measures a rating of 4 or 5, with 5 being the most important).",
              "All four concepts performed well across the countries tested, with many countries having a close top 2-3 concepts to select from.",

              "Preference for specific concepts differed by country, which indicate a tailored communication approach by country may be more effective.",
              "Image is a strong driver of concept preference. The concept with the image of the child resonated most strongly.   It appears imagery with people, where there is good eye contact and connection would be a good creative space to attract attention and provide an emotional response.",
              "Similar to the findings on the concepts  , there were 2-3 messages that resonated more strongly per country. There is more variation within each region regarding messaging compared to the overall concept, specifically in the European and Southeast Asian regions."

The survey results highlight the importance of creating an emotionally\r\n    intelligent connection between technical guidance and RCCE interventions. These concepts can be rolled out regionally and globally and adapted as necessary to regional and country contexts."

          "Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a harmful practice that affects 200 million women and girls alive today. While there has been a steady decline in FGM prevalence, still, an estimated 3 million girls and women are at risk of undergoing FGM every year. FGM has no health benefits, but one in four girls and women have experienced FGM performed by health workers. This points toward an alarming trend in the medicalization of this human rights violation. We sat down with Catherine Meng’anyi, a nurse in Kenya, to hear about her work to end FGM. Through her efforts, she has reached more than 25,000 people from her community by advocating against FGM in a culturally sensitive way. She has rescued more than 200 girls from FGM and early marriage. Catherine has worked under Kenya’s Ministry of Health closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) in adapting materials used to end FGM and applies the WHO’s person-centred approaches to FGM prevention and care . She holds a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and is currently undertaking a Masters in Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program.",
          "Q: What brought you to ending FGM?",
          "I am a survivor of FGM. When I was 12, my parents, who are well-educated, decided to go along with our culture and community, but chose to have a healthcare provider perform the cut. I knew the provider very well and it took me many years to let go of the harm she caused and to forgive her. She had every reason not to cut me, but she did.",
          "When I underwent the cut, I was outside near my home, surrounded by relatives and people who knew me. I was covered with cloths and there were loud noises of celebration. I felt agitated and confused wondering what was going to happen next and if I would bleed to death. From the day I was cut, I carried pain, stigma and emotional, psychological trauma. The pain is always there.",
          "For a long time, all I could think about was how I should raise my voice and prevent others from going through the same trauma. I have younger sisters, and I felt I needed to do something to protect them. From the age of 15, I spoke up to my family, telling my parents that my sisters should not undergo the cut. It worked. From there I spoke to close relatives. Then, when I finished school, I took the opportunity to speak up in my local community against the providers who are still practicing the cut in secret. I was still not strong enough to share my own story, but I stood up for what I knew was right.",
          "Q: As a health worker, how have you managed to rescue hundreds of girls from FGM and early marriage?",
          "My strength has been in building a network of people I can call when I need help. When I am stuck or I identify a girl who needs assistance, I always have somebody just the click of a button away. As a nurse in Kenya I work closely with the Department of Children’s Services and the police in case there's a girl who has been subjected to early marriage or other forms of gender-based violence. FGM has been illegal in Kenya since 2011, and so collaborating with the police has been very key.",
          "In addition to the network of people with the government who are working to stop gender-based violence, I've always wanted to build up a network of survivors of women who underwent FGM and need support. Finding the strength to speak about your experience helps others say no; it helps end the practice.",
          "Q: There is a growing call for men to help stop FGM. What do we need men to do?",
          "It is important for men to stand up and say these cultural norms do not make sense. The practice of FGM is causing harm to their own children, their own sisters and mothers. We need men to embrace women who have not undergone the cut, to advocate and say they will marry women who have not had the cut. Many young men are coming out and saying no to FGM, so we need to strengthen these networks of men so that they are a team, a collective voice that other men hear.",
          "Q: What is your advice to health workers? What can they do in their clinics and at community level?",
          "People come to health workers for FGM, thinking that it’s much better than the traditional way, but FGM is a harmful tradition irrespective of how it’s done. It has been key to empower community health volunteers as role models in their communities who say no to FGM. We have them organize forums for girls to have a conversation about the dangers of FGM and early marriage.",
          "I believe person-centered communication is the very best approach when trying to change a person’s values. Often it starts with value clarification for providers themselves to help them understand that what they thought was correct, like FGM, is actually wrong and harmful. Usually once someone understands the dangers of something, it's easy to change their mind.",
          "I have always believed that having a conversation and understanding where a person is coming from is important. When a patient comes in for services, we, as health workers, need to start up a conversation about female genital mutilation and address the issue. Having this conversation also means getting solutions from the community themselves. That is the only way we are going to end FGM and early marriage.",
          "The World Health Organization (WHO) uses a public health approach to FGM and works to ensure that girls and women living with FGM receive quality medical care and counselling, as well to develop evidence and advocacy tools to support efforts to prevent FGM."

          "The government-led COVID-19 Response Coordination Platforms have ensured an effective whole-of-government, whole of society COVID-19 response, including the national COVID-19 vaccination roll-out. The SDG3 GAP partner agencies have demonstrated\r\n    their commitment to coordination and greater alignment by working in close collaboration with the MoHCC and contributing to Intra-Action Reviews that have guided the finalization of the Multisectoral COVID-19 National Response Plans. They\r\n    have played significant roles in the coordination structures and response pillars, for example, Points of Entry, Operational Support, Logistics Supply Chain System, and Lab Quality Assurance, Case Management, continuation of Essential\r\n    Health Services, Vaccination Pillar, and Research Pillar.",
          "It is important to note that SDG3 GAP agencies have actively participated in these structures based on their comparative advantages, resulting in greater relevance and appropriateness of inputs to the response specific to those pillars.",
          "Additionally, the Health Sector Coordination Framework (HSCF) was developed by the MoHCC with support from SDG3 GAP agencies in 2019-2020, following a recognition of the need for further alignment among development partners in the health sector\r\n    response efforts, and based on the lessons learned and experiences with the National Health Strategy (NHS) development processes. Despite the initial development of the framework, its operationalization stalled due to the emergence\r\n    of the pandemic, contextual dynamics, and financial constraints to support the key processes associated with the framework.",
          "The SDG3 GAP Recovery Challenge Funds have been instrumental in activating this coordination framework, which, though still in the early stages, presents a strong opportunity to improve partner collaboration and alignment in joint planning, implementation,\r\n    monitoring, and evaluation of health investments in PHC towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The HSCF would benefit from the full support of partners and capacity strengthening to ensure consistent conduct of the relevant business processes\r\n    associated with the framework.",
