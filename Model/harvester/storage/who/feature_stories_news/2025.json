I underwent a left hip replacement surgery, and the entire process was completely cashless. The doctors and nurses treated me with such kindness and respect, I never felt like I was away from home.

These services are offered across a network of public and private hospitals.",
          "The State of Rajasthan adapted this scheme under the Mukhya Mantri Ayushman Arogya (MMA) Yojana and took a major leap in advancing universal health coverage (UHC) by offering one of India’s highest financial protection thresholds under the broader umbrella of AB PM-JAY.",
          "However, there were limitations. Though wide-reaching and successful within the State, MAA Yojana’s benefits were confined to Rajasthan’s residents, as the State chose not to adopt the portability function which facilitates the use of hospitals anywhere in India for AB PM-JAY beneficiaries.",
          "People living in neighbouring states, often just a few kilometers from the border, could not access Rajasthan’s network of hospitals, even when they were the nearest or best-equipped facilities. This created an unintended equity divide, leaving many patients without timely or affordable care arising from access issues.",
          "Recognizing this gap, the Rajasthan State Health Assurance Agency (RSHAA), with support from WHO through the UHC Partnership , decided to introduce the portability provision under the MAA Yojana , and enhance benefits. This reform removed a long-standing barrier to care and reflects the broader principle that the right to quality healthcare must be nationwide and transcend state boundaries."

With Guyana’s introduction, 95% of the countries are conducting influenza vaccination for priority groups. This milestone is a result of sustained technical collaboration between the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and World Health Organization (WHO) with the support from the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework and the Task Force for Global Health.",
          "The rollout of seasonal influenza vaccines follows a series of coordinated activities, including the development of a national influenza vaccination policy, capacity-building workshops for healthcare workers and Expanded Programme on Immunization staff, and procurement of influenza vaccines through the PAHO’s Revolving Fund for Access to Vaccines. These efforts align with Strategic Objective 3 of the Global Influenza Strategy (2019–2030), which aims to build national influenza disease prevention and control programmes.",
          "Guyana’s progress in surveillance has also been notable. The National Public Health Laboratory was recently designated as a WHO National Influenza Centre (NIC), a recognition that reflects its enhanced diagnostic capacity and commitment to virus sharing under the PIP Framework. The laboratory now actively contributes data to the global FluNet platform , strengthening regional and global situational awareness of influenza virus circulation. Data generated from Guyana’s influenza surveillance system enabled the country to model the potential impact of influenza vaccination in reducing hospitalizations, and deaths as well as worker absenteeism due to influenza. In addition, the information from the surveillance system was used to evaluate the timing of influenza epidemics, enabling Guyana to determine which vaccines were most appropriate (northern hemisphere vaccines) and when to start their vaccination campaign (September) to achieve the maximum impact from the vaccination programme.",
          "The introduction of influenza vaccination and NIC designation are examples of Guyana’s commitment to strengthening the national health system and implementing WHO initiatives, including the Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) framework and the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR). By introducing seasonal influenza vaccination, Guyana is taking a decisive step to protect its most vulnerable populations and reduce the strain on health services during influenza season. This proactive approach underscores the country’s commitment to safeguarding health through prevention and their strategic investment in national epidemic and pandemic preparedness.",

The aim is to scale up mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) preparedness and response capacities. Nearly 300 humanitarian professionals, policy-makers and front-line responders from ministries, international and national NGOs and UN agencies from all six WHO regions participated.",
          "The latest edition of the event took place in Ethiopia in May 2025, following previous editions in Estonia, Tunisia, and Türkiye. With European Union support, WHO partnered with the Government of Ethiopia and Africa CDC to conduct the four-day exercise. Africa CDC sponsored mental health leads from Member States in the African Region, bringing regional representation alongside participants from all six WHO regions to strengthen emergency readiness and decision-making.",

Dr Sarah Wilson, from Egypt highlighted: ''The simulation helped us explore ways of engaging stakeholders more meaningfully using language that resonates, mobilizes, and leads to action;'' whereas Adib Asrori, from Indonesia, highlighted: ''As a humanitarian worker who started my career from scratch with a local NGO in Java, I have gained knowledge and experience related to humanitarian responses primarily through practical learning in the field over the years. The Build Better Before training was instrumental in providing a comprehensive framework for implementing the MHPSS programmes, especially in terms of concrete actions within the context of Disaster Risk Reduction.''",
          "The World Psychiatry Association also participated, with Dr. Simon Stafrace reflecting: ''A key lesson I learned was about the value and adaptability of MHPSS. It is not a standalone response but rather embedded into every element of humanitarian work. For psychiatrists, this means recognizing that our role extends beyond diagnosis and treatment. We can contribute through capacity-building, supervision, systems leadership, advocacy, and coordination, alongside clinical care. Importantly, our work should support and not displace the critical contributions of community-based and psychosocial practitioners who are at the heart of disaster response.''",

          "This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution. Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they’re made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO’s Vaccines Explained series .",
          "Infants are highly vulnerable to infection from the moment they are born. While antibodies passed from their mother during pregnancy and through breast milk give them a layer of protection against harmful germs, this immunity only lasts the first few months of life.",
          "Vaccines play a crucial role in safeguarding your child against harmful germs that could cause serious illness or even be life-threatening. For vaccines to work best, they need to be given before your child is exposed to these germs. That’s why most childhood immunizations are planned within the first 12 to 18 months of life.",
          "One of the best ways to keep your child safe is to make sure they get their vaccines on time.",
          "The science behind the schedule",
          "The immunization schedule is a plan that shows when children, adolescents and adults should get their vaccines. It is developed by medical experts who assess how diseases spread, who gets sick most often, and at what ages.",
          "The schedule helps to make sure that everyone gets protection at the safest and most important times.",
          "For more than 60 years, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global health experts, such as the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) and national authorities have intensively studied disease transmission, the safety of vaccines and the way they protect people from disease. This has shaped global guidance on what vaccines people need, when they need them, and how many doses are most effective and meet the highest safety standards.",
          "Based on extensive reviews of scientific information, WHO issues vaccine position papers that explain key facts about each disease, the vaccines available to prevent the disease, including their safety evidence, and WHO’s recommendations on the timing of each dose.",
          "Every vaccine is recommended at the time it offers the best protection against serious illness. This can mean one type of vaccine is needed at birth, while another is needed in adolescence. Timing of each dose is based on years of research across the world on how the immune system develops, when a person is most at risk of a disease, and how to keep protection strong.",
          "Vaccine schedules differ by country",
          "While WHO makes global recommendations based on best available evidence from decades of research worldwide, each country may slightly adapt the timing of some vaccines to meet their own needs. This is because every country has its own disease patterns, health needs, and systems.",
          "To create their national immunization schedule, each country will use WHO recommendations and summary tables , as well as advice from their National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups. These groups consider local disease patterns, population demographics, cost and availability, and the ease of delivering the vaccines.",
          "Some vaccines are universally recommended and adopted by all countries, such as the hepatitis B birth dose and a ‘combination vaccine’ that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis all in one vaccine, given in three doses. These vaccines, in addition to vaccines against Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), polio, measles, rubella, pneumococcal disease, rotavirus, and human papillomavirus (HPV) are recommended by WHO as part of the Essential Programme on Immunization. Even with universal vaccines, the type of vaccine, the manufacturer, the number of doses, and the timing can all differ from one country to another.",
          "In addition to these universal vaccines, some countries include vaccines in their schedule to protect against diseases that are common locally. For example, if you live in a country where dengue, malaria, or yellow fever are endemic, these vaccines may be recommended for your child.",
          "Since there is no fixed global schedule – only global recommendations provided by WHO – the best way to protect your child is to follow your country’s national schedule.",
          "Schedules change with scientific advances",
          "Immunization schedules evolve over time. While they are developed based on decades of comprehensive study, our understanding of diseases and vaccines continues to advance, leading to updated recommendations and improved schedules to offer the best protection.",
          "At the same time, a new vaccine can be added to the schedule after in-depth research on safety, vaccine performance, and optimizing where it would fit in the vaccine schedule. Each vaccine will be tested against placebos or current vaccines and added to the schedule at the most appropriate time to offer strongest protection.",
          "As science continues to advance and new vaccines are introduced, immunization schedules have grown more complicated, and our knowledge more established. Combination vaccines, such as the hexavalent vaccine – which protects against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Hib – make things easier by reducing the number of injections. This approach not only simplifies the process for families but also makes it easier to complete the recommended doses on time, requiring fewer visits to a health clinic and fewer injections.",
          "Like single-antigen vaccines, combination vaccines undergo rigorous testing to confirm safety, effectiveness, and the ability to generate immune responses equivalent to those produced by each individual vaccine.",
          "Why follow the schedule?",
          "The immunization schedule is timed to ensure that a child’s immune system is ready to respond effectively, providing protection exactly when they need it. Delaying, spacing out or altering vaccine schedules means that your child could be exposed to dangerous diseases for a longer period.",
          "Spacing out vaccines, beyond what is recommended, also requires more visits to the doctor and increases the likelihood that your child will miss a dose, or can result in vaccines being given out of sequence, which is some cases may reduce vaccine performance.",
          "When immunization schedules are delayed or disrupted, there is a sharp increase in the risk of infection not only for the child, but also for the wider community, depending on the disease. Every missed dose increases the chance of falling sick with a disease that could have been prevented and risks putting others in jeopardy.",
          "Vaccinate your child on time, every time."

Infertility is a deeply personal struggle that often unfolds in silence, due to stigma, the high cost of treatment and feelings of guilt, as demonstrated in a recent study conducted by the UN’s Special Programme in Human Reproduction (HRP). The study, titled Experiences of infertility among couples in Morocco , sheds light on the devastating impact infertility has on people’s lives.

One participant recounted her herbal treatment that left her and her husband unconscious for 12 hours.",

Patients arrive from nearby villages seeking help with ailments both common and complex. Among them are women whose stories are not written in their medical files. They come with headaches, stomach pain or dizziness, symptoms that sometimes hide something deeper.",
          "Dr Harshal Dhabe, the hospital’s Medical Officer, has learned to listen differently. “We see more than 400 patients a day in the outpatient department. Earlier, we used to just provide treatment,” he says. “Now, when a woman shows certain symptoms or comes to the hospital repeatedly, we consider the possibility that she might be experiencing violence.”",
          "Across the district, at the Primary Health Centre in Nandur, Dr Pratiksha Vijay Gawande sees the same reality. Her centre serves 26 villages and a population of more than 40 000. “Violence against women is not only a medical issue,” she explains. “It is also a human and social problem.”"

The study called “Project Uddan” is implementing WHO guidelines on strengthening the health systems approach to responding to violence against women. Project Uddan introduced them to the LIVES job aid – L isten with empathy, I nquire about women’s needs and concerns, V alidate their experience, E nhance their safety, and facilitate social S upport through a training. The LIVES tool was developed by WHO and the UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/World Bank/WHO Special Programme in Human Reproduction (HRP) to guide health workers to offer first-line support for survivors of violence.",
          "Soon after joining the centre, Dr Gawande took part in the WHO-supported training for health care providers. “At first, I wasn’t sure whether women would come forward or share their situation,” she said. “Before, I focused only on the medical treatment part. The training made me realize that there might be other reasons behind why a woman visits the health centre.”",
          "For Dr Dhabe, the training changed how he interacts with his patients. “We were taught how to identify, not only in cases of severe assault, but also through small signs that show that a woman may be a survivor of violence,” he says. “And we learned how to maintain confidentiality and communicate in a way that does not cause further harm or distress.”",
          "In Nandur, Dr Gawande remembers her first encounter with a survivor. “A woman came to me complaining of redness in her eye,” she says. “She said a twig hit her while picking fruit. But I realized something was wrong. I gained her trust and spoke gently. Eventually, she told me she had been beaten.”",
          "Dr Gawande provided LIVES support and referred the woman for counselling. “She was advised on how to improve her safety,” she added.",
          "For both doctors, these experiences mark a profound shift – from treating injuries to addressing the context of women’s health more holistically. They have learned to read between the lines, to create moments of safety even in busy outpatient departments.",
          "“If a woman comes with her in-laws, we find a way to speak to her separately,” Dr Dhabe explains. “We might refer her to the counsellor under the pretext of dietary advice or baby care. During outpatient department hours we are very busy, but if we identify a woman who may need help, we ask her to wait or refer her to our nurse who can provide the LIVES support.”"

In the past year alone, 316 million women were subjected to intimate partner violence. These figures have remained largely unchanged for two decades, underscoring the urgency of action.",
          "Yet amid the sobering data lies hope. The new edition of RESPECT Women outlines seven proven strategies to prevent violence; from strengthening relationship skills and empowering women and girls to ensuring multi-sectoral, survivor-centered services, reducing poverty and transforming harmful social norms. The health system has a critical role to play in ensuring survivor-centered services but can also contribute to prevention by countering harmful social norms as health workers are role models in their communities.",
          "Dr Gawande has seen this transformation start within her own practice. “Earlier, women came only for medical treatment. Now they also share their personal problems. This training builds skills in forming an emotional connection. Women realize we will listen without judgment and keep everything confidential. This is the common mentality in rural areas,” she said. “Women are not happy about the violence, but they often think it is something normal that happens in families.”",
          "Both doctors now mentor other staff, encouraging them to adopt the same approach. “Even if through our identification we can simply create a space for a woman to talk, it will have great benefits,” said Dr Dhabe. “Women often just need someone to listen to them.”",
          "“Every treatment lies on the foundation of tender love and care,” says Dr Dhabe. “A warmth of love is what every doctor should give to a patient. That is what builds the bond between doctor and patient, more than any medicine.”",
          "Looking ahead, he hopes more doctors will receive this kind of training and that health policies will reach the people who need them most. “The government has made strong reforms, but there is often a gap between policy and implementation,” he says. “That gap can only be closed through proper training, awareness, and education so that every woman knows her rights, and every health worker knows how to help.”",
          "Every woman deserves to live free from violence. If we, as health workers, can take even a few minutes to listen, we can make a difference. Dr Harshal Dhabe / Medical Officer",
          "For Dr Gawande, the most powerful lesson has been about empathy. “When I identified my first survivor, I realized that women do speak up, but only when you talk to them with sensitivity,” she said. “Health workers who have not yet identified a survivor should try once. If through our efforts even one life is saved, the satisfaction is immense.”",
          "Beyond the frameworks and statistics, it is about listening and believing, about creating environments where women can heal and reclaim control over their lives. As the 2023 estimates remind us, the world has made limited progress in reducing violence against women. But stories like those of Dr Dhabe and Dr Gawande show that change begins one conversation at a time, when a woman is heard, respected and supported.",
          "“Every woman deserves to live free from violence,” Dr Dhabe says. “If we, as health workers, can take even a few minutes to listen, we can make a difference.”"

          "Days are spent away at sea, far from the shore, exposed to harsh weather, physical hazards, and long hours with little rest. At sea, vision is everything! It guides them to read the waves, spot the catch, navigate changing weather, and avoid danger.",
          "Studies in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu show that 20–30% of fishermen over the age of 40 live with significant visual impairment, and 7% are blind in one or both eyes.",
          "In an occupation where poor vision can mean a missed catch, accidents, or even death, the stakes are high—not just for individuals, but for the food security of families and resilience of entire communities.",
          "Apparao is a fisherman from Chirala village in the Bapatla district of coastal Andhra Pradesh.  Beyond 30 kilometers in the waters, where networks die down and the horizons hold untold realities, vision was his only compass and safeguard.",
          "However, when his vision started to become cloudy and distorted, he had to stop fishing. ‘I didn’t know what else I could do,’ he said. The uncertainty wasn't just physical but also economic, emotional, and social, as it affected his livelihood and his purpose in life. Our eyes have a natural lens that sits behind the iris and helps focus light onto the retina. When this lens turns cloudy (due to cataract), less light reaches the retina and the brain receives poor visual signals, leading to blurry or dim vision.",
          "Relief came when the L V Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI) held a community eye screening at his local panchayat office, one of the thousands conducted regularly across the most underserved regions of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, and Karnataka.",

          "The LVPEI eye care pyramidal model comprises 278+ vision centres (permanent primary eye care centres that serve a population of 50 000+) 28 secondary eye care centres, 4  tertiary eye care centres and one quaternary eye care institute, an institute of excellence at the top.",

Vision loss due to cataract can be restored overnight with a simple and cost-effective surgery. In adults, the risk of developing cataract increases with age, but other factors can accelerate their development. In children, they can be congenital (present at birth) or develop later, often due to genetic factors, infections, or other underlying conditions. While cataracts may not be entirely preventable, there are lifestyle changes and habits that can be adopted to reduce the risk and delay their onset.",
          "After cataract surgery, eyeglasses often remain important for optimizing vision. They provide a safe, non-invasive way to fine-tune sight and correct any remaining refractive error. Many people still need eyeglasses for near tasks such as reading or other near work. A check for new eyeglasses is usually recommended once the eye has healed and vision has stabilized, typically a few weeks after surgery.",

          "Agyekum Joseph is a skilled and hardworking man. Fifty-two years old, he balances two demanding jobs: cocoa farmer and electrical rewinder. In addition to cultivating cocoa in Akyem Nkronso, a community in Ghana’s eastern region, he repairs fans, air conditioner motors, and other electrical equipment—work that requires precision, dexterity, and sharp near vision.",
          "As an electrical rewinder, Agyekum often works with small parts in intricate settings—items he refers to as “gadgets.” Tasks like inspecting machine components, rewiring appliances, and handling tools demand clear vision. Without it, even routine repairs can be difficult and prone to error. Lately, Agyekum began noticing changes in his eyesight. “I have been having some trouble with my eyes, especially when I’m working on something up close,” he explains. “After a while, things start to look blurry or cloudy, and I can’t really see what I’m doing properly. My vision becomes unreliable, so sometimes I have no choice but to stop whatever gadget or task I’m working on. Even when I’m reading my Bible, the letters start to blur together, and it gets really hard to read.” Fortunately, help was available. As a member of the Asetenapa Cooperative, Agyekum receives health services through Elucid, a social enterprise in Ghana that is working to improve the health and economic well-being of rural farmers by embedding essential health services into agricultural value chains. During a visit to a mobile clinic, Agyekum had his vision screened and was diagnosed with presbyopia, a common age-related condition that affects near vision. The solution was simple: a pair of near-vision eyeglasses.",
          "This year, Elucid began partnering with RestoringVision, a global nonprofit dedicated to tackling the challenges of presbyopia. Through this collaboration, Elucid is now able to provide high-quality near-vision eyeglasses to cooperative members who need them. At the clinic Agyekum attended, 315 people received vision screenings and 62 were given near-vision eyeglasses.",
          "After receiving his eyeglasses, Agyekum noticed an immediate improvement. “I received a pair of eyeglasses, and I can honestly say my vision is now perfect! I’m able to work on my gadgets with ease, and I can read my Bible clearly again. The glasses have really improved my daily life when it comes to my vision, and I couldn’t be more delighted.”",
          "Agyekum’s experience shows how restoring near vision can make a meaningful difference, not only in farming, but in skilled trades that require precision and care. With the support of Elucid and RestoringVision, he and many others in Akyem Nkronso are regaining the ability to work independently, read comfortably, and contribute fully to their communities.",
          "Presbyopia is a common eyesight issue tied to aging that starts after you hit 40. It makes focusing on things up close hard, which can turn activities like reading, threading needles, or spotting small details into a challenge. It’s not an illness; it happens as the lens in the eye becomes less flexible with age. Since presbyopia happens with age, you can't stop it from occurring. The most cost-effective treatment for presbyopia is near-vision eyeglasses. Regular eye checkups help to detect it and address its effects.",
          "This story was developed by RestoringVision, a member of the Global SPECS Network , in collaboration with the WHO Vision and Eye Care Programme, based on an interview conducted and photographed by Elucid.",

          "This November, at the seventh International Conference on Family Planning, WHO and the UN’s Special Programme in Human Reproduction (HRP) launched the 6th edition of the MEC and the 4th edition of the SPR . Updated with the latest evidence , they aim to make contraceptive care safer, more consistent and more responsive to people’s real needs.",
          "For the health service provider, the MEC answers the vital question: Is this contraceptive method safe for this particular individual given their past or present medical history (e.g. diabetes) and their physiological status (e.g. postpartum and currently breastfeeding)? The SPR provides guidance on how to use contraceptive methods safely and effectively. Together, they guide policymakers and program managers in ensuring that contraception is safe, effective, and rights-based.",
          "A couple learning about the different contraceptive methods available to them in Kigali, Rwanda. © Yagazie Emezi/Getty Images/Images of Empowerment",
          "“The release of the updated WHO MEC and SPR marks a transformative milestone in global reproductive health,” said Prof Frank Louwen, President of FIGO. “They reaffirm the central role of science in enabling choice, equity and quality in family planning.”",
          "The new editions reflect significant advances made in our understanding of contraceptive methods. For instance, Progestogen-only injectables can now be safely offered immediately after childbirth, emergency contraception can be repeated within the same cycle and hormonal methods can be safely used by women taking PrEP.",
          "Across countries, the impact of these tools is tangible. In Botswana, Bame Bame, a research nurse specializing in sexual and reproductive health, said, “I use the MEC almost every day. The Wheel and the App make it quick and convenient, especially when I am with a client. It reassures them, and it empowers clinicians like me with confidence that we are providing the best care possible.”",
          "Regarding the SPR, Sharon Uy, a family planning program manager in Samar Philippines, said “As a health service provider, the WHO Selected Practice Recommendations have transformed how I guide clients in choosing and using family planning methods. By complementing the MEC Wheel, they provide not just the ‘who can use’ but also the ‘how to use’, making counseling clearer, more confident, and client centered. They have simplified decision-making and allowed me to focus more on empowering clients through informed, evidence-based choices.”",
          "The true power of the MEC and SPR lies in how they are used. Policymakers can integrate the new guidance into training, supervision, and health system planning. Health workers can use the derivative products, like the MEC Wheel, the App and the Family Planning Handbook , to support informed, client-centred counselling. Academic and professional associations can help ensure that future generations of providers learn to deliver contraceptive care grounded in evidence and respect.",
          "A doctor explains contraceptive options using a WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria wheel during a family planning consultation in Bara Kahu, Islamabad. © WHO / HRP / Saiyna Bashir",
          "“In an era where science is increasingly questioned, the WHO MEC and SPR stand as vital safeguards,” added Prof Alison Edelman of Oregon Health & Science University. “They provide a trusted foundation for evidence-based clinical care and empower public health programmes to adapt to local contexts.”",
          "Every person everywhere should be able to have access to high-quality contraceptive care grounded in science and choice. The choice should always be yours, and that choice should be informed by the best research and evidence.",
          "“The updated WHO MEC and SPR reaffirm that every woman, man and young person has the right to make informed choices about their reproductive health, supported by the highest standards of scientific evidence. UNFPA welcomes these updated tools as essential instruments for advancing quality, rights-based contraceptive care – ensuring that guidance keeps pace with innovation, equity and the realities of diverse health-care settings”, concludes Julia Bunting, Director of the Programme Division at UNFPA.",
          "At a time when misinformation and misconceptions abound, the updated MEC and SPR are a step towards a future where every person can confidently make informed decisions to fulfil their fertility intentions. By adopting and implementing these recommendations, people can safely and effectively use contraceptive methods that best suit their needs."

          "When Zaitoon Ragman went into labour in Cape Town, everything seemed routine. But moments after her daughter was born, she began to bleed heavily. “I thought I was going home to God now,” she recalls. “I called my son to say goodbye.”",
          "Her life was saved by a rapid, coordinated response from a team of doctors and midwives. They quickly diagnosed postpartum haemorrhage and implemented all the recommended treatment interventions that stopped the bleeding. Unlike her previous childbirth, when she required a blood transfusion, this time she recovered safely and went home with her baby.",
          "Zaitoon Ragman wit h her baby Naa-iqah (6 days old) and older children Raeez, Naa-ilah, and Raheez at their home in Mitchell's Plain, South Africa. Zaitoon survived PPH after childbirth. © K Schermbrucker / WHO.",
          "“What makes PPH so dangerous is how unpredictable it can be,” explains one of her doctors, Alexandra St Clair. “Sometimes you only have minutes to act, and it requires the whole team working together to save a life.”",
          "Dr Alexandra St Clair, Medical Officer in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, prepares for theatre at the Mitchells Plain District Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Dr Alexdra St Clair regularly treats mothers for Postpartum haemorrage (PPH). © K Schermbrucker / WHO.",
          "Stories like Zaitoon’s underscore the urgent need for stronger systems to prevent, detect and treat PPH. Several millions of women are affected every year, and nearly 45 000 die as a result of excessive bleeding after childbirth, making it one of the world’s leading causes of maternal mortality.",
          "In response, the World Health Organization (WHO), together with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), has released consolidated guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage . For the first time, clinicians are advised to act not only at the traditional threshold of 500 mL of blood loss, but also when threshold of 300 mL of blood loss is reached and accompanied by any abnormal vital signs. This happens more often in women who are anaemic, especially in low-resource countries. To support earlier and more accurate diagnosis, the guidelines recommend objective measurement of blood loss using calibrated drapes.",
          "Noxolo Hoga, Advanced Midwife, uses the calibrated drape, a cone-shaped plastic sheet with a measurement pouch, which is used to accurately collect and quantify blood loss after delivery. Mitchells Plain District Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. © K Schermbrucker / WHO.",
          "The guidelines also include a standardized first-response treatment bundle known as the PPH bundle, or MOTIVE , to be used once the diagnosis of PPH is made. A bundle is composed of steps that are effective in stopping the bleeding and include the massage of the uterus, oxytocic drugs to stimulate contractions, tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding, intravenous fluids, vaginal and genital tract examination, and escalation of care if bleeding persists. Alongside these measures, the recommendations emphasize effective prevention, including daily iron and folate during pregnancy to reduce anaemia or intravenous iron when oral iron is not tolerated or speed is needed to correct iron deficiency anaemia, the use of quality-assured injectable uterotonics such as oxytocin or heat-stable carbetocin (where cold chain cannot be maintained) during the third stage of labour, and discouraging unsafe practices such as routine episiotomy.",
          "Noxolo Hoga, Advanced Midwife, uses the calibrated drape, a cone-shaped plastic sheet with a measurement pouch, which is used to accurately collect and quantify blood loss after delivery. The drape is placed under the woman’s buttocks, collecting blood and clots. If bleeding is determined to be excessive, the woman will be given oxytocin, tranexamic acid, and intravenous fluids to treat PPH, while the clinical team decides if further intervention is needed. Mitchells Plain District Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. © K Schermbrucker / WHO.",
          "By unifying previously fragmented recommendations into a single resource, it empowers governments, health systems and professional associations to accelerate action at national level. The guidelines contain evidence-based recommendations and are designed not just for policy, but for practice, ensuring health workers everywhere have access to clear, consistent direction.",

          "To help put the guidelines into action, WHO and partners have developed the Bleeding after Birth package , a suite of training resources for frontline health workers. This includes action plans that guide health workers step by step during emergencies, a provider guide to support clinical practice, and a facilitator flipchart for training sessions and simulations. These tools aim to ensure that the new recommendations become part of routine practice in health facilities worldwide.",

          "For Zaitoon and many other women around the world, the guidelines are not abstract. They are the reason she is alive to raise her four children. “If it wasn’t for the doctors and midwives, I would not be here,” she says. Her story is a reminder that behind every statistic is a mother, a family and a future saved."

          "On a typical day in the Irish city of Dublin, residents make around 220,000 return trips by walking and cycling. The national government is investing heavily in active travel, a and public investment of this scale has afforded an opportunity for local authorities to implement significant shifts in transport systems across cities and towns in Ireland. Aligned with the National Sustainable Mobility Policy, Dublin City Council aims to put 95% of Dubliners within a 5-minute walk of a safe route for active travel.",
          "However, measuring the impact of investments thus far has been a challenge due to patchy and scattered data. The use of technology for data collection has often been an afterthought, which means that cities find it difficult to assess and communicate the effect of these projects.",
          "To address this issue, in March 2024 Dublin City Council launched its 'Data Insights for Active Travel' project, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities. The project aims to pilot new technologies and community engagement for evaluating the impact of the city’s active travel investments. It connects a range of public sector partners, and its objective is to replace an ad-hoc approach to data collection with a systematic and integrated process. It also aligns local and national sustainable mobility strategies with WHO-recommended interventions to increase physical activity, strengthening policies and practice connected to safe walking and cycling.",
          "The project began by bringing partners together and identifying priority indicators, to inform data needs. A combination of baseline and outcome indicators were selected, and approaches that could capture the data were chosen. These included the city’s first ever use of AI roadside sensors, as well as smart bike lights and an AI safety assessment tool.",
          "Work has led to the creation of the Dublin Active Travel Dashboard , which combines data to correlate active travel patterns with infrastructure use, public health projections, climate impacts and estimated financial savings. The dashboard also applies the WHO Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT) for walking and cycling to model projected health and environmental impacts for different parts of the city. The city has also successfully set up a new structure of local, regional and national partners, created a new data infrastructure measuring the impact of active travel investments, and provided new opportunities for community engagement and feedback.",
          "Dublin’s experience shows how collaborative data ecosystems are key to turning infrastructure investments into better health and safer streets for all road users. The project has already won international recognition, taking home the prestigious Mobility Award at the 2024 Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona. Closer to home, the project model has also attracted interest from other Irish municipalities. As Dublin’s work progresses, the city will continue to show how collective action on data can underpin more effective evaluation and decision-making, contributing to healthier, more inclusive and more sustainable cities.",

          "In response to the growing demand from countries seeking to strengthen mental health services for children and young people, including school-based interventions, WHO and partnering governments have launched a multi-country knowledge exchange and mental health systems analysis initiative. The initiative aims to strengthen community-based mental health systems for children and young people. This area has often been neglected globally due to a shortage of child and adolescent mental health providers and training opportunities, limited budgets primarily directed toward adult and specialized services, and a lack of systems data to fully understand the scope of mental health challenges affecting children and adolescents.",
          "Strengthen systems for children and young people’s mental health",
          "This knowledge exchange and systems analysis initiative builds on the recently published WHO–UNICEF Mental Health of Children and Young People: Service Guidance . The guidance outlines how countries can develop context-specific approaches to improve access to quality mental health support by promoting quality care standards and creating networks that link health care, community mental health and cross-sectoral services.",
          "The knowledge exchange brings together stakeholders from Ministries of Health, other relevant government agencies, and WHO at country, regional, and global levels to collaboratively identify gaps, challenges, opportunities, and priority actions for strengthening mental health systems for children and young people. These meetings provide an important platform for cross-learning and collaboration. A central focus is enhancing youth engagement at the country level, recognizing that young people play a vital role in systems strengthening and reform. The latest WHO Atlas data (2024) shows that youth engagement in service planning remains challenging in many countries: fewer than half of national governments collaborate with service users, including the youth. This represents a decrease from 2020 across all regions, with participation even more limited in young people.",
          "As part of the knowledge exchange initiative, WHO is supporting countries to gather data on service availability and systems performance, using a standardized data collection instrument. The Child and Adolescent National Systems Assessment Tool was developed as an adapted version of the WHO-AIMS tool . The tool maps mental health services, policies and systems for children and adolescents at national and district levels; identifies data gaps across health, education; and social service sectors and offers insights into facilities delivering mental health services, by engaging young people and their caregivers to understand care pathways and access barriers.",
          "Initiative outcomes",
          "The projected outcomes of the systems assessment data collection exercise include a national overview of the mental health system for children and adolescents, which will enable policy and service dialogues to inform programming and allocations by national stakeholders. In many countries, the tool facilitates baseline data collection for the first time, providing a broad picture of existing mental health systems for children and adolescents. This serves as a catalyst for reform and supports evidence-based planning and investment in child and adolescent mental health.",
          "This project is supported by the Public Health Agency of Canada, Botnar Foundation and Iconiq .  Countries leading Phase I of the initiative include Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, The Gambia, Lesotho, Senegal, and Mozambique. A planned Phase II will expand participation to include additional countries from the African region and other regions.",

          "On an intensely hot day in early 2024, Doan Thi Hien, 77, walked into Nhi Binh commune health station in Ho Chi Minh City, not far from where she lived.",
          "Following her hypertension diagnosis nearly two decades ago, Ms Hien had previously needed to ask her son or daughter-in-law for help to travel more than 10 kilometres to the Hoc Mon district health centre.",
          "But now Ms Hien, for the first time, can get a health check-up and pick up her medicines in her own neighbourhood.",
          "“At times, a trip to the district health centre would take me almost a day just to get a checkup, consultation, and medicines, but now it only takes a short while here and the station is just half a kilometer away from my home. Due to my age, being able to get my medicines and health checkup here at the commune health station is greatly appreciated,” said Ms Hien.",
          "Since late 2022, a project supported by WHO, through the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Partnership , and a nongovernmental organisation (NGO), the Resolve to Save Lives (RTSL), is bringing essential primary health care (PHC) closer to Ms Hien and millions of people living with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in Ho Chi Minh City.",
          "The work focuses on improving the quality of care at PHC for NCDs across the city and has learnt lessons from an earlier project that took place across nearly all provinces in Viet Nam.",
          "WHO, through the UHC Partnership and RTSL, supported the Ministry of Health to develop and implement an NCD management model from 2016-2022. This included simple protocols, and an online reporting system to monitor the progress of individuals aggregating data from the community to national levels.",
          "The problem of NCDs",
          "Around the world, NCDs including cancer, chronic lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, kill 41 million people each year, equivalent to almost three out of every four deaths globally. In Viet Nam, NCDs are responsible for 80% of deaths. The country has made great improvements in mother and child health and in reducing infectious diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, but NCDs are a growing and significant health challenge, with many people living with undiagnosed conditions. An estimated 75% of people with hypertension or diabetes are not being treated.",
          "The nearest health care is often the best health care",
          "Early detection and timely treatment are the keys to successfully managing NCDs. However, many people living with NCDs may not show any symptoms until the disease has substantially progressed. One way to help address this challenge is proactive community-based testing and long-term treatment.",
          "Ho Chi Minh City is Viet Nam’s largest city with more than 9 million inhabitants (before merging with two other provinces in July 2025). Having strong primary healthcare facilities near people's homes enables healthcare workers to provide more frequent and timely support. They can offer advice on lifestyle factors such as smoking, exercise, alcohol consumption and diet, which can ultimately help to prevent, delay or manage NCDs.",
          "“Commune health stations serve as the bridge between community members and the health system. We know our patients very well, not only their health conditions but also on a personal level. We know their families and understand exactly what triggers each patient’s condition, such as their drinking, smoking or sleeping habits,” said Dr Pham Van Nghia from the Nhi Binh commune health station.",
          "Reaching people in the community",
          "Since late 2022, 43 out of 310 commune health stations and 10 of 22 district health centres benefited from taking part in the project. In 2024, the model began to be rolled out to the remaining commune and district health care facilities in Ho Chi Minh City, before being scaled up to the entire country. By June 2025, the project had reached about 180 of 273 commune health stations (commune health stations were merged to reduce the number from 310 to 273) in 11 of 22 districts of HCMC.",
          "Between February 2023 and January 2024, the number of hypertension patients visiting commune health stations nearly doubled, and the number of diabetes patients increased nearly 4 times. With focus on better grassroots care, 20% more patients had controlled blood pressure, and 56% more patients had controlled blood glucose. There has also been improvement in essential medicine supply, with more commune health stations having enough supply of the three types of hypertension and two types of diabetic medicines.",
          "“It is important to create a stronger and more integrated primary health care system to help meet essential health needs for all. We are very proud to collaborate with the Ministry of Health, local health authorities and health partners, with the support of Resolve to Save Lives and the UHC Partnership, to strengthen hypertension and diabetes management in primary health care, so that people can be screened and treated for their conditions in a timely way,” said Dr Angela Pratt, WHO Representative in Viet Nam.",

          "Everyone has an equal right to adequate food, but not everyone has equal access. In many places around the world, cheap, ultra-processed foods often crowd out healthier options. 1 , 2 Children are particularly vulnerable to the health effects of poor diets, so it’s vital to ensure good nutrition from the earliest years. 3",
          "Schools play an essential role in creating an enabling environment for good nutrition. They not only provide access to nutritious foods, but also help set lifelong habits. 4 However, the school food environment doesn’t always support healthy choices. 5 To change this, strong school nutrition and food procurement policies must promote healthy options and limit children’s exposure to items that are high in salt, sugars and fats, or ultra-processed.",
          "The city of Córdoba, Argentina is showing how this can be achieved. In 2021, Argentina enacted a law establishing national measures to promote healthy diets such as front-of-package warning labeling, regulation of food and beverage advertising, and transforming school environments. 6 As the country’s second-largest city, Córdoba has since been working to apply these regulations in its public schools through an initiative called “Córdoba Elige Agua” (Córdoba Chooses Water). This initiative aims to transform school food environments by promoting water consumption and regulating the supply of ultra-processed foods in school kiosks and canteens.",
          "The city used a step-by-step approach. Rooted in local data, the first phase focused on 38 municipal schools. Hydration points were installed to encourage water instead of sugary drinks. Awareness and food education activities were rolled out with students, teachers, and families. The city also developed “Healthy Food and Beverage Guidelines,” in collaboration with the Partnership for Healthy Cities .",
          "Scaling up required a new municipal policy to make sure all schools followed the same standards. In June 2024 the Mayor of Córdoba issued Decree No. 310/2024 which established school kiosks providing exclusively healthy food, restricting advertising of unhealthy products, and promoting water as the drink of choice. The measure applies to all municipal education institutions, with a phased implementation plan and clear enforcement guidance.",
          "Results so far have been striking. Today, 100% of municipal schools provide safe, free drinking water. In 2025, the city also received a Partnership for Healthy Cities award in recognition of its policy achievements around school food. As one of the first cities in the country to apply the national law via local regulations, the city has positioned itself as a leader in the school food space.",

It offers concise, focused guidance on the most important statistical and data management concepts researchers need to plan a study with confidence.",
          "Rather than teaching theory in isolation, the series connects concepts to real-world research planning and implementation challenges by drawing on examples from HRP-supported studies. Each video is designed to clarify essential aspects of research planning, framing a research question, designing a hypothesis, planning for data collection and analysis, so that research teams can avoid common pitfalls and develop protocols that are not only methodologically sound but also practically feasible.",

          "Frontline minds: putting a human face on mental health in emergencies",
          "When a crisis strikes, the headlines are often filled with images of destroyed homes, overcrowded camps, and urgent calls for food, water, and shelter. What is less visible — but no less devastating — are the psychological wounds carried by people caught in conflict, disaster, and displacement. In every emergency, the struggle is not only for survival, but also for dignity, hope, and mental well-being.",
          "Globally, one in five people living through emergencies experience a mental health condition — about twice the global average. That means behind every camp, every makeshift clinic, every aid convoy, are people grappling with psychological distress. For them, the crisis is not just external, but internal. And for the mental health workers who step in—themselves dealing with the psychological consequences of emergencies—the task is essential.",
          "This feature series highlights WHO staff in the field offering comfort and connection in the aftermath of earthquakes, helping children regain a sense of safety after witnessing violence, delivering psychotropic medicines where supply chains have collapsed. Their stories show us what it takes to preserve humanity when the world around has been shaken.",
          "At the same time, these human accounts are part of a much larger picture. In 2024, Member States at the World Health Assembly adopted a landmark resolution calling for the integration of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) into every stage of preparedness, response, and recovery. The momentum is real: coordination mechanisms for MHPSS exist in 71% of emergencies today , compared to less than half just five years ago. More than half of crisis-affected countries now use the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s Minimum Service Package — setting a baseline for what people should be able to expect, even in the darkest of times.",
          "But progress is fragile. In 2025, requests for essential psychotropic medicines in emergencies plummeted by 96%. Not because the need diminished — but because funding did. The result: people with mental health conditions common and severe are being left untreated in conflict zones and refugee camps, where conditions are already stacked against them. In places like Gaza, Syria, Myanmar, and Afghanistan, the stakes are measured in human lives and futures.",
          "That is why investing in MHPSS is crucial. Evidence shows that supporting mental health in emergencies helps people and communities to cope, survive, and recover faster. It strengthens families, helps rebuild economies, and lays the foundation for stronger health systems long after the crisis has passed. Put simply: without mental health, there is no full recovery.",
          "WHO plays a unique role in this space — coordinating responses in more than 40 crises, deploying experts on the ground, and building lasting relationships with government and local NGOs to strengthen mental health systems. It also sets the global standards that guide governments, NGOs, and humanitarian partners in scaling up support.",
          "These are the technical achievements. But what they mean in practice can be understood only through the people living them, people such as those featured here. Their voices remind us that mental health in emergencies is not abstract policy, but human resilience in action.",
          "We invite you to read their stories — and see the extraordinary humanity of those who heal minds as well as bodies on the frontlines of crisis."

          "A steadfast presence in turbulent times For more than two decades, Ms Rajiah Abu Sway, Mental Health Lead for the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (oPt), has worked at the intersection of health, gender, and protection. Since joining WHO in 2003, she has built trust across ministries, humanitarian actors, and communities—ensuring that mental health, protection from sexual exploitation and harassment, and gender-based violence are integrated into emergency responses. Her work is marked by a careful balance: responding to acute emergencies while laying the foundations for a long-term, resilient system of care. The urgency of that balance could not be clearer. More than 85% of Gaza’s population—around 1.9 million people— has been displaced in the past two years. Gender-based violence is rising. More than 76 000 students have been unable to sit for their secondary school exams. In the face of overlapping crises, Abu Sway remains steady. “The most important thing for us is to try to have long-term projects and funding,” she explains. “That’s how you build activities, systems, and sustain emergency responses. oPt is a protracted emergency. We must remain flexible to respond when needed, but always with a long-term vision.” Building systems amid emergencies Under Abu Sway’s leadership, WHO’s country office has supported the Ministries of Health and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in both Gaza and the West Bank to: integrate mental health into general hospitals and primary care. strengthen community-based services and rehabilitation programs. provide Psychological First Aid (PFA) and “helping the helpers” support for humanitarian workers. develop national strategies on mental health, suicide prevention, and human resources. train education emergency teams to deliver school-based psychosocial support—a lifeline for children and adolescents living through instability. This dual focus—responding to immediate emergencies while steadily reinforcing national systems—has enabled a kind of resilience unique to oPt. “When I started, stigma around mental health was overwhelming,” Abu Sway recalls. “Communities were struggling, and it was important to create spaces where people could be heard. Now I see younger generations, especially young women, asking questions and actively seeking support. That openness has changed the landscape.” Holding space for colleagues and communities Beyond systems-building, Abu Sway’s passion lies in supporting those most at risk, particularly girls and women affected by gender-based violence or exploitation. She supervises a team of nine, co-chairs the MHPSS Working Group in the West Bank, and advises the Ministry of Health’s mental health thematic group.",
          "When war broke out in 2023, her focus shifted to colleagues in Gaza.",
          "“I was really focused on our staff,” she remembers. “It was about being there for them—listening, witnessing, validating what they were saying. They were in survival mode. They needed water, food, security, transportation—but also a safe place. That’s what I was providing.”",
          "Her leadership reflects her personal values: connection, presence, and support. “This work is very close to me,” she says. “Providing support is rewarding—it is my passion. With all my years at WHO, what matters most is always the people.” Investing for the future",
          "The oPt illustrates a broader truth: decades of investment in mental health systems create the scaffolding for emergency response. The WHO supported integration of mental health into hospitals and primary care means that services exist even in times of disruption. Community-based models and trained education teams provide continuity for young people when schools are shuttered.",
          "WHO published Building Back Better , a report that showed how countries recovering from crisis can use that moment to strengthen mental health services in lasting ways. The approach is simple but powerful: invest during emergencies not only to respond, but to leave behind stronger, more resilient systems.",
          "The oPt experience shows how those principles work in practice: system building makes response possible, and crisis response, in turn, accelerates system change."

          "Caring as a personal and professional anchor",
          "Dr Nabil Samarji cares. You feel this instantly upon speaking with him: his heart worn on his sleeve, a smile stretched across his weary face. He is tired, but he is full.",
          "That care reflects both his role and his reality. As WHO’s Mental Health Officer in Syria, he supports vulnerable populations—children, young and older people, and women—through years of conflict, displacement, and disruption. At the same time, his own family life deepens his perspective. His mother lives with dementia, a journey he describes as an “ambiguous loss, where the person you love is both here and not here.” “Caretaking has deepened my appreciation for what families endure,” he says. “It reminds me daily that behind every patient, there is a family carrying the invisible weight with resilience and tenderness. For me, caregiving is not only a duty – it is a blessing of life. It is an opportunity to teach my children, not by words but by actions, what it means to love, to care, and to remain committed even in the most difficult times. And it is why in my professional role, I advocate not only for patients, but for the families and caregivers who walk this journey alongside them.”",
          "Integrating mental health into primary care",
          "Personal motivation alone cannot meet the scale of Syria’s needs. Since 2011, the country has faced protracted conflict, displacement, poverty, drought, and most recently, the devastating earthquake in 2023. Against this backdrop, Dr Samarji works with the Ministry of health, United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations, and other partners through the national Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) technical working group.",
          "Their efforts focus on integrating mental health into primary health care (PHC)—a strategy that brings mental health services into the same local clinics where people already receive routine care. This makes support more accessible, especially in areas where specialized services are scarce. Today, one in three PHC centres in Syria offer integrated MHPSS services.",
          "Thousands of health workers have been trained through the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) . mhGAP equips non-specialist health workers—such as general doctors, nurses, or community health workers—with the knowledge and tools to identify and treat common mental health conditions. In Syria, it has become a cornerstone for expanding access to care beyond the limited number of specialists. Specialized hospital services have also been strengthened, and WHO continues to support access to essential psychotropic medicines—still in severe shortage locally.",
          "Responding to urgent and emerging priorities",
          "The work does not stop at integration. Together with local partners, WHO has expanded services to address pressing concerns such as substance use and suicide prevention. Community-level interventions include mobile outreach teams, helplines, and Psychological First Aid (PFA) in disaster-affected areas.",
          "“The mental health situation in Syria today is one of immense need, but also remarkable resilience,” Dr Samarji explains. “We see rising levels of psychosocial distress, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, and substance use. At the same time, families continue to protect their children, communities support one another, and frontline workers show extraordinary dedication.”",
          "That dedication comes not only from his colleagues, but from Dr Samarji himself. Recognizing the risk of burnout, he emphasizes the importance of supporting frontline health and humanitarian workers.",
          "“Even within the working environment, frontline health and humanitarian workers carry heavy burdens,” he says. “Burnout and chronic stress are common, yet their commitment remains steadfast as they continue to serve others. All of these struggles are compounded by poverty, insecurity, and displacement. Mental health needs are not confined to any one group; they are everywhere, touching every family, every community.”",
          "Moments that reshape a life",
          "For Dr Samarji, the motivation to care is constantly renewed by encounters with families affected by crisis. One moment stands out: meeting a displaced mother in Aleppo who had lost her home and several relatives.",
          "“She told me: ‘We can survive hunger, we can survive cold, we can survive pain, but how do we survive the silence of grief in our children’s eyes? I need to talk to my son and check on him if he is okay, and that I am okay.’ That question changed me. It reshaped how I communicate, how I train others, and how I practice even the simplest interventions.”",
          "This mother’s words affirmed for Dr Samarji what he already knew: mental health care is not optional—it is essential."

          "From personal experience to professional commitment",
          "“No one asked me how I was doing, what I was feeling here,” recalls Dr Israel Ying Ding, reflecting on his childhood in a conflict-affected region of Myanmar. That memory—of being overlooked amid chaos—shaped his determination to work in mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in emergencies.",
          "Now serving as a WHO Technical Officer in Myanmar, Dr Ding channels that early experience into his work today. He leads a train-the-trainers programme in partnership with local civil society organizations. The focus is on enhancing basic psychosocial skills—active listening, normalizing emotions, encouraging hope, and supporting independence.",
          "It is a model of peer support that can be sustained with little reliance on external funding: a practical example of the community-based service implantation needed to address staggering levels of mental ill-health worldwide.",
          "Training for sustainable support",
          "Dr Ding trains volunteers who have years of experience in the medical system but lack MHPSS-specific skills. While acknowledging the importance of their medical background, he insists it must be complemented with tools that help people cope with the psychological toll of crisis.",
          "“Human basic needs are the first layer, and we have to acknowledge them and see what we can do about that,” he explains. “That's why coordination and advocacy work is very important: as a mental health person, this is part of my job. But there is also a psychosocial part. I educate people—we can teach them skills, we can help them manage stress, so that they can navigate their struggles better. At the end of the day, we want them to be independent as much as possible.”",
          "The need for such support is acute. In March 2025, an earthquake struck Mandalay , killing more than 4700 people and injuring over 5100. For a region already marked by conflict, displacement, and political instability, the disaster compounded existing challenges. With limited resources, humanitarian organizations have had to find innovative solutions to meet needs that stretch from food and water to psychosocial support.",
          "Beyond survival: community belonging as a basic need",
          "Programmes like the one Dr Ding leads offer an essential bridge, but he recognizes the difficult reality: many people still struggle for food, water, and shelter. Meeting these survival needs helps mental health, yet Dr Ding insists that belonging, hope, and social cohesion are just as critical.",
          "“People think, ‘If I have food to eat or if I can send my children to school, then my problems will be gone,’” he explains. “Their priority is on those needs. But we also need to build community belonging, social cohesion.”",
          "This principle reflects the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s Minimum Services Package (MSP) —a global standard that defines the most essential mental health and psychosocial support to be included in every humanitarian response. The MSP highlights that protecting mental wellbeing is not optional, but an essential intervention alongside food, water, and shelter.",
          "For Myanmar, where conflict and political instability have slowed the development of a comprehensive mental health system, Dr Ding emphasizes both capacity building and coordination.",
          "“There’s still a lot of capacity building needed. MHPSS is still weak in terms of prioritization and funding,” he says. “For advance level care, we need a system. NGOs or private organizations are doing counselling or psychological support. But we still have a long way to go to integrate the clinical parts. Each level still needs a lot of work.”",
          "Creating safe spaces for healing",
          "Despite the systemic challenges, Dr Ding takes joy in the community spaces he helps create for people displaced or otherwise affected by instability.",
          "“We don't use fancy words to describe it,” he says. “People come, they make soap together, they cook and eat together, children draw, they tell jokes. Having this space to talk about their emotions, they begin to know that mental health is not just about seeing a counsellor or doctor and going home. It's about their daily life.”",
          "In this daily life—sharing food, laughter, and creativity—people begin to recover a sense of belonging. For Dr Ding, that is the heart of his work: transforming his own childhood memory of being unseen into a career that ensures others are heard, supported, and connected."

          "Responding to crisis within hours When a powerful earthquake struck Afghanistan’s Kunar province in the waning hours of 31 August 2025, communities already living with conflict and displacement faced another blow. The exact toll is difficult to quantify but reports from local and international media suggest at least 2200 people killed and more than 3600 injured across Kunar and neighbouring Nangarhar provinces. WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office also noted that confirmed numbers remain fluid as assessments continue.",
          "For Dr Abdul Alimi, the national Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) officer in Afghanistan, the disaster was both urgent and deeply personal. Having spent nearly two decades building mental health into Afghanistan’s health system, he knew that rapid psychosocial support would be just as critical as physical care.",
          "Within 48 hours, WHO—working alongside national authorities and partners—mobilized three mobile MHPSS outreach teams to the affected areas. Before the earthquake, WHO trained over 612 healthcare staff in the eastern region, including 207 community health workers, in psychological first aid (PFA) and stress management.",
          "Within a week, Dr Alimi was on the ground with them. WHO produced and distributed 56 000 leaflets and posters on loss, grief, and self-care; and Dr Alimi co-led the first meeting of the MHPSS technical working group to coordinate the response across agencies — all done by 7 September.",
          "His colleague Dr Basharat Hussain, WHO Technical Officer for Mental Health, underscores the urgency: “People were coming to the regional hospital with injuries, but also with grief, insomnia, and psychosocial distress. We needed to be there.”",
          "Building local capacity for sustainable support",
          "Dr Alimi has spent much of his career focused on capacity building—ensuring that mental health services reach the community level from hospitals. That investment proved vital in the Kunar province response. From 21-22 September, Dr Basharat and Dr Alimi coordinated with MHPSS stakeholders, implementers and authorities to conduct PFA training to 105 community health workers. PFA is a simple but vital technique: offering comfort, active listening, and practical support in the immediate aftermath of crisis.",
          "Prior to the earthquake, WHO also trained 344 Afghan doctors in the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) —a WHO initiative that equips general health workers with the skills to recognize and manage common mental health conditions. In Afghanistan, this approach is crucial given the shortage of mental health specialists.",
          "WHO and partners established referral centers, which serve both earthquake survivors and returnees from Pakistan. Coordination with other agencies through the health cluster has helped reduce duplication and extend services further into affected communities.",
          "Gaps and challenges in the system",
          "Despite progress, Dr Basharat and Dr Alimi are clear-eyed about the challenges. “We have trained more than 300 doctors in the eastern region, but the needs are immense,” they said. Nearly 3000 people have received MHPSS consultations since the earthquake, according to WHO field reports, yet shortages of psychotropic medicines and trained psychosocial counsellors remain.",
          "Local authorities urged WHO to deploy more female counsellors to reach women in Kunar province. Specialized services at Kunar Provincial Hospital are still limited, leaving many referrals dependent on Nangarhar regional hospital in Jalalabad. And while international agencies and funders, including the Asian Development Bank, World Bank and UNICEF, are coordinating to provide medicines nationally, these have not consistently reached government health facilities – so Dr Alimi and his colleagues help fill the gap.",
          "At the same time, WHO and partners continue to build long-term capacity. The training-of-trainers programmes for mental health gap action programme (mhGAP) and Problem Management Plus (PM+) —a WHO intervention for stress management—and the Thinking Healthy manual for perinatal depression are being contextualized for Afghanistan. A self-care intervention for humanitarian workers helps protect the wellbeing of staff delivering services under immense pressure.",
          "A career built on advocacy and care",
          "Dr Alimi’s commitment to mental health stretches back to 2006, when it was not yet part of Afghanistan’s Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS). “We started a pilot project in some provinces,” he recalls. “When we presented our results, the Ministry of public health accepted mental health as a component of BPHS. When I spent five years in mental health services, in different provinces and mostly in capacity building, I decided I should specialize in this field. Now I am happy working with our team. We are providing mental health services and working at primary and secondary levels, and community levels.”",
          "His colleagues echo his dedication. Dr Hussain recalls his first experience in the 2005 Pakistan earthquake, when survivors told him: “We don’t need anything, but we need someone to sit with us, to talk with us.” Dr de Lara reflects on decades of advocacy: “MHPSS is not a minor program. It must be integrated—it is about saving lives.”",
          "Together, their efforts highlight what Dr Alimi has always known: that mental health support is inseparable from humanitarian response."

          "In humanitarian emergencies, shelter, food and safety are often seen as the most urgent priorities. Yet, one at-risk group is often left out of the response: people who use substances and those living with substance use disorders.",
          "Substance use doesn’t pause for conflict, displacement or disaster. In fact, the stress and upheaval can make it worse, leaving people even more isolated and at risk. Yet, support for those struggling with substance use is still largely absent from many humanitarian responses.",
          "Humanitarian workers – from camp managers to teachers – encounter individuals grappling with substance use every day. These interactions are moments of critical importance. However, they are often left without the necessary guidance or tools to respond with empathy, dignity and effectiveness.",
          "Substance use in humanitarian contexts is not a peripheral issue – it is a growing concern that must be part of emergency responses.  Until recently, however, there was little clarity on how to provide supportive, nonjudgmental care.",
          "In a large refugee settlement in Northern Uganda, for example, substance use is a pressing concern among youth. “Humanitarian actors are often the first and sometimes only point of contact for affected individuals, yet many remain under-equipped to recognize and respond to substance-related conditions,” said Mukasa Moses Bwesige, Inter Regional Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) officer at Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) in Uganda.",
          "Similarly, challenges are reported in Afghanistan. Many humanitarian actors “are not familiar with the concept of substance use disorders as health problems and the availability and effectiveness of health responses to address them,” said WHO Afghanistan Technical Officer for Mental Health and Substance Abuse, Dr Alireza Noroozi.",
          "A new approach to humanitarian response",
          "To address this gap, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (IASC-MHPSS) in emergency settings took decisive action. Its dedicated thematic group on substance use – co-chaired by WHO, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) – launched a new initiative to transform how humanitarian responses address substance use.",
          "The group developed orientation materials for humanitarian workers and their communities, using interactive activities, stories and role plays to challenge stigma and reframe substance use disorders as a complex public health issue rather than a moral failing.  Between 2024 and 2025, these materials were field-tested with 342 frontline workers across eight crisis-affected locations: Afghanistan, Iraq, Myanmar, Northern Uganda, Northwest Syria, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda.",
          "The results were clear: with the right mindset and tools, responders can transform not only the support they provide but also the way people with substance use disorders are perceived.",
          "Stories of transformation",
          "In Myanmar, field facilitator Mr Hkawng Haung saw attitudes shift during the orientation sessions organized with UNODC. “Substance use is often treated as a moral issue in our communities, but this orientation helped shift our perspective to view it as a public health condition,” he said. “It’s critical that humanitarian workers understand this shift, especially as we engage with people facing such challenges in camps for internally displaced people. We witnessed a powerful transformation – participants began to view people who use drugs not as problems but as individuals needing support.”",
          "Facilitators in Northern Uganda also observed a powerful change: “The orientation not only increased participants’ technical knowledge, but also shifted their attitudes toward substance use, reframing it as a complex interplay of trauma, poverty and psychosocial distress,” they reported. For refugee para-counsellor Phillip Joseph Deng, trained by Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) and working in a large refugee settlement, the link between trauma and substance use is personal. “While I was in South Sudan, the community members tied up nine of my family members and killed them before my eyes.… That trauma pushes me to drink alcohol so that I can more easily forget the moment.” His experience underlines why responses must be rooted in empathy and appropriate care.",
          "In Afghanistan, the field testing was jointly organized by WHO and UNODC Country Offices. Co-facilitator Dr Alireza Noroozi explained that participants working in a Transit Centre in Herat often provide basic health and social support to Afghan returnees from Iran — some of whom struggle with drug use disorders and opioid withdrawal. “The participants found the content of the orientation quite relevant to their work,” Dr Noroozi said. “They realized the importance of linking people with drug use disorders to drug treatment services.”",
          "The way forward",
          "Feedback from the field testing will inform an updated version of the orientation materials, making them more practical and responsive to the realities of humanitarian work. But the initiative is about more than information materials: it is about changing attitudes, empowering humanitarian actors, and ensuring that evidence-based approaches to substance use become part of every emergency response.",

Like many older adults in remote areas, she had been living with poor near vision for years, assuming it was simply part of aging. Reading, threading a needle, and even recognizing faces up close had become increasingly difficult.",
          "Motivated by the chance to help, Sitaram sat his grandmother on the back of his motorcycle and drove her more than an hour across rough terrain to reach the mobile eye camp. The ride was not easy; unpaved roads, steep inclines, and dusty paths made the journey challenging, particularly for someone of Lalita’s age.",
          "At the camp, she underwent her first-ever vision screening. The results were clear: she needed near-vision eyeglasses. The pair she received was simple but effective, tailored to her needs on the spot.",
          "With a smile, Lalita proudly showed off her new eyeglasses to her grandson. She then turned to the camp staff and volunteers, equally proud to introduce the young man who had made this possible: the grandson who waited patiently through the entire process.",
          "“Due to my age, I can no longer manage tasks that require mobility as easily, but I can still help in the kitchen and prepare religious threads for lighting lamps,” Lalita said.",
          "As the sun began to set, the two climbed back onto the motorcycle. They reached their village just before nightfall, carrying with them not just a new pair of eyeglasses but a renewed sense of connection and a reminder of the difference even a single intervention can make in someone’s daily life.",
          "“Lighting lamps is a task many grandmothers do. She is happy when she can support the family with these things - these are all near-vision activities, and with her reading glasses, she is able to do these kinds of things again,” Sitaram said.",
          "This story is one of many coming out of GoodVision’s supported eye care initiatives that aim to bring essential services to underserved communities. For Lalita, it meant the simple joy of seeing clearly again. For Sitaram, it was a small act of love that will be remembered for a long time.",
          "Presbyopia is a frequent eyesight issue tied to aging that starts after you hit 40. It makes focusing on things up close hard, which can turn activities like reading, threading needles, or spotting small details into a challenge. It’s not an illness; it happens as the lens in the eye becomes less flexible with age. The most cost-effective treatment for presbyopia is eyeglasses. Since presbyopia happens with age, you can't stop it from occurring. Regular eye checkups help to detect it and avoid its effects.",
          "Thanks to mobile eye camps, people living in remote villages can also have access to essential eye care. In the so-called screening camps, a small team—usually consisting of optometrists, assistants, and an optical fitter—travels to the remote mountain regions of Nepal. There, they conduct eye examinations, distribute eyeglasses where needed, and identify patients suffering from cataracts. These patients are later treated either at a nearby eye hospital or at a specially organized surgical camp directly on-site.",

          "For more than thirty years, Regina Pérez—now 57—has been a dedicated worker at Mercado 4 market in Asunción. She started walking its aisles as a child, hand in hand with her mother, learning how to select vegetables, negotiate prices, and warmly serve each customer. Market 4, one of Paraguay's largest and most traditional markets or shopping centres, is a vibrant network of stalls, galleries, and early mornings: it is a meeting place for producers, artisans, merchants, and families who find their daily livelihood in this ecosystem. In this context, Regina developed a professional and community identity that has stayed with her throughout her life. She lives in the city of Luque, alone with her mother, who is over 90 years old, and her work is the main source of income for the household.",
          "Over the years, however, the onset of cataracts in both eyes began to fog her world literally. The gradual loss of vision made routine tasks uncertain: walking through narrow aisles, recognizing bills, weighing products, or identifying familiar faces in the dim light of dawn. \"I couldn't see well any longer. Walking down the street had become dangerous for me,\" she recalls. The situation forced her to make a painful decision: to leave her job, cutting off the source of income that supported her household and her independence.",
          "In 2025, Regina visited Fundación Visión seeking an answer. The evaluation confirmed bilateral cataracts requiring surgery. The institution coordinated the entire process: preoperative assessment, surgery, and postoperative follow-up. Additionally, she received the lenses recommended by the medical team to enhance her functional recovery. The aim was not only to restore her vision but also to regain specific abilities: selecting vegetables, recognizing her customers, and moving around safely.",
          "The results were remarkable. After the surgery, Regina regained her visual clarity, along with her independence and joy. As is customary and clinically advised, she was prescribed postoperative eyeglasses: far from being an “extra,” they complement the surgery and enhance the focus to achieve the best possible vision in everyday life. The combination of surgery (which removes the opacity of the lens) and eyeglasses (which correct the residual refractive error) restored her confidence and precision in her activities.",
          "With her recovery and the help of her eyeglasses, Regina was able to resume her routine: getting up early to leave Luque for Asunción by public transport, travelling more than 20 km on a journey of about an hour and a half each way. She opens her stall in Mercado 4 at 7:00 a.m. and works until 6:00 p.m., checking her merchandise, tidying her stall, and greeting those who saw her grow up among bags, tents, cardboard boxes, and wheelbarrows. Poor vision is no longer a barrier to moving safely around the city or caring for her mother at home.",
          "Her experience has also made her an advocate for eye health in her community. She advises other working women not to delay seeing a doctor and to overcome their fear: she took a friend to Fundación Visión to begin her treatment. “Don't wait like I did. Fundación Visión is there to help us. There's no need to be afraid,” she insists.",
          "In contexts such as Mercado 4—with its high mobility, attention to detail, and rapid transactions—seeing clearly is not a luxury; it is a prerequisite for dignity, productivity, and economic inclusion. Today, Regina has not only regained her sight: she has regained her place in the Mercado 4 community, the commercial heart of Asunción that saw her grow up alongside her mother and now sees her again—with clear vision—opening her stall every day, ready to serve those who trust in the quality of her vegetables and the history of hard work behind every sale.",
          "Cataract is cloudiness in the lens of the eye, leading to increasingly blurred vision. It is the leading cause of blindness globally, impacting 94 million people worldwide. Vision loss due to cataract can be restored with a simple and cost-effective surgery. In adults, the risk of developing cataract increases with age, but other factors can accelerate their development. In children, they can be congenital (present at birth) or develop later, often due to genetic factors, infections, or other underlying conditions. While cataracts may not be entirely preventable, there are lifestyle changes and habits that can be adopted to reduce the risk and delay their onset.",
          "After cataract surgery, eyeglasses often remain important for optimizing vision. They provide a safe, non-invasive way to fine-tune sight and correct any remaining refractive error. Many people still need eyeglasses for near tasks such as reading or other near work. A check for new eyeglasses is usually recommended once the eye has healed and vision has stabilized, typically a few weeks after surgery.",

          "Jemima Manguelle Lindjeck, a four-year-old from Mom village in Cameroon's Centre Region, has been diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes. She was so dizzy that she needed help walking and had to drop out of school after her first semester due to her inability to see. She spent the majority of her time at home, where her father, Joel, and great-aunt Madeleine assisted her with even the most basic duties. Jemima's issue first became apparent when she began seeing things differently. Then, white dots appeared in her eyes. Her family had no idea what was wrong with her, so they turned to their neighbors for help.",
          "Her family refused to go to the hospital because they were warned that physicians would \"take her eyes out.\" They sought herbal cures because they were afraid and had no idea what else to do. Her condition worsened, and she was unable to play with other children or accomplish basic tasks on her own. The Magrabi ICO Cameroon Eye Institute (MICEI), which collaborates with Christian Blind Mission (CBM), an organization in official relations with WHO, hosted an event in Mom that provided optimism. Doctors informed Jemima that she needed surgery since she had cataracts in both eyes. Her father, Joel, worked as a security guard and earned a modest income so that he couldn't afford the surgery. Jemima had to go a considerable distance to Obak, the hospital where the procedure would be performed. They examined her and declared her to be okay. Her father, Joel, prayed for her recovery, and the surgery went smoothly. CBM assisted MICEI in covering the costs of Jemima's surgery, transportation, and food, allowing her to return to the doctor. Jemima and her father were relieved when the bandages were removed, and overjoyed to see her vision restored, which was made even sharper once she tried on her new eyeglasses.",
          "Today is Jemima's first day of school, and she is wearing her new bright pink eyeglasses, which had her very excited.  Her newfound confidence shines through in every smile and every laugh. She can now balance her homework and socializing with her friends. Her father, Joel, who has recently started teaching at the same school, observes with calm pride and thanks God for her restored vision and bright future. Jemima's story underscores a broader issue: millions of children have untreated eye conditions because they can't afford to see a doctor, don't know how to treat them, or are too impoverished. Many families wait too long to seek treatment, resulting in blindness and the loss of critical developmental years for their children. Simple interventions, such as eyeglasses or surgery, can help children return to school and achieve independence. Joel now recommends that other parents ensure their children receive timely treatment for their vision concerns.",

          "Sri\r\n Lanka is taking a proactive approach to reduce hospitalizations and\r\n    deaths from seasonal influenza by focusing on rapid testing and timely\r\n    treatment. National clinical guidelines recommend the use of oseltamivir\r\n    for high-risk groups, helping to prevent severe illness and shorten the\r\n    duration of infection. This strategy not only saves lives but also\r\n    supports local pharmaceutical production, ensuring a steady supply of\r\n    antivirals for both seasonal outbreaks and future pandemics.",

Today,\r\n    pregnant women with fever and respiratory symptoms are urged to seek\r\n    medical care immediately, with oseltamivir prescribed within 24–48 hours\r\n    of symptom onset when appropriate. Health education campaigns and\r\n    antenatal clinic training ensure that women recognize the signs of\r\n    influenza and seek care without delay. This approach has been effective\r\n    at substantially reducing maternal mortality from influenza.",

Together, they\r\n    explored how Sri Lanka can build on its antiviral strategy by\r\n    incorporating influenza vaccines into a broader, more holistic\r\n    prevention and control programme.",
          "Looking ahead to 2025–2026, the\r\n    Ministry of Health plans to analyze the burden of influenza and the\r\n    number of hospitalizations, deaths, and absenteeism that could be\r\n    prevented through vaccination. These studies will complement recent\r\n    research by the University of Ruhuna and Duke University, which\r\n    demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of introducing influenza vaccines in\r\n    Sri Lanka. WHO is also supporting efforts to include influenza\r\n    vaccination guidance in the national immunization handbook, paving the\r\n    way for more effective vaccine use.",

          "Building national influenza preparedness capacities Originally\r\n developed in 2012, the National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and\r\n    Response Plan (NIPPRP) has long served as Bhutan’s guiding framework for\r\n    managing influenza threats. In 2024, it underwent a comprehensive\r\n    update to incorporate evolving global and regional guidance, lessons\r\n    learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, and new capacities developed under\r\n    the PIP Framework. The revised plan is now more explicitly aligned with\r\n    Bhutan’s broader emergency and disaster risk management frameworks,\r\n    ensuring a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to pandemic\r\n    response. As an effort to strengthen national pandemic\r\n    preparedness, Bhutan organized three national-level training sessions\r\n    followed by simulation exercises on influenza pandemic preparedness and\r\n    response at five sentinel hospitals between April and May 2025, with\r\n    support from the PIP PC .\r\n The training brought together more than 140 health professionals and\r\n    partners from across the country, focusing on operationalizing the\r\n    NIPPRP. Over three days during each training session,\r\n    participants engaged in interactive sessions on key components of\r\n    pandemic response, including infection prevention and control, clinical\r\n    case management, activation of rapid response teams and risk\r\n    communication. The training underscored the importance of multi-level\r\n    coordination, timely communication, and robust legal and policy\r\n    frameworks to enable swift and effective outbreak response. A key\r\n    highlight was a full-day simulation exercise, during which participants\r\n    applied standard operating procedures in a mock influenza outbreak\r\n    scenario. This hands-on exercise strengthened clarity of roles and\r\n    enhanced coordination across agencies – critical elements for real-world\r\n    emergency response. Credit : Ministry of Health Bhutan Caption : Participants of 3-day national influenza preparedness and response training in Bhutan. Testing preparedness in sentinel hospitals Following\r\n the trainings at the national level, simulation exercises were\r\n        conducted in May 2025 at five sentinel hospitals in Paro, Trashigang,\r\n        Punakha, Samdrup Jongkhar, and Tsirang. These exercises tested the\r\n        practical application of influenza preparedness protocols and revealed\r\n        operational gaps. Common challenges included insufficient clarity in\r\n        staff roles and responsibilities, weak internal communication\r\n        mechanisms, inadequate crowd management practices, and infrastructure\r\n        limitations such as the lack of designated triage areas. To\r\n address these gaps, hospitals were advised to develop micro-plans\r\n        clearly outlining staff roles and responsibilities, strengthen internal\r\n        communication channels, and invest in basic emergency infrastructure.\r\n        Furthermore, regular refresher training and simulation exercises\r\n        recommended annually will be critical to sustaining influenza pandemic\r\n        preparedness and ensuring a coordinated and effective response during\r\n        future outbreaks or epidemics. Bhutan’s efforts reflect the\r\n        broader objectives of the PIP Framework to strengthen regional and\r\n        global readiness for pandemic influenza. By aligning with the Global\r\n        Influenza Strategy (2019–2030) and the International Health Regulations\r\n        (IHR), PIP PC-supported activities continue to deliver tangible results\r\n        in enhancing influenza preparedness and response capacities in the\r\n        country. Importantly, Bhutan’s progress also contributes to efforts in\r\n        the South-East Asia region as well as globally, demonstrating how\r\n        targeted investments and capacity-building can translate into stronger\r\n        pandemic preparedness systems, particularly in newly designated PIP PC\r\n        recipient countries."

          "In a city facing rapid, unplanned urbanisation and urban density, social and community participation are key. The city of Bogota, Colombia, has embraced the WHO Initiative on Urban Governance for Health and Well-being , using it to strengthen a collective health vision in their local government through co-creation practices, social participation, and intersectoral action. The initiative has had a particularly positive impact in the locality of Kennedy, which has the highest percentage of persons with disabilities in the city. The locality focused on improving participatory processes with persons with disabilities and their careers, to determine their needs and priorities. By strengthening the leadership of the members of the Local Disability Council, the locality has seen significant improvements in social participation and has strengthened health governance.",
          "“Health governance demonstrates that if we have a decent healthy environment, and we have good air quality, open spaces, spaces to do sports and culture, we all grow. And of course our health, not only physical but mental, also grows,” said Yeimy Carolina Agudelo, local mayor of Kennedy.",
          "One of the carers who has been positively impacted through the initiative is Gloria Estrada, the mother of a person with a disability. She explained: “The Local Disability Council was established to develop policies for people with disabilities. This success story invites us to continue generating all those participatory processes in the community, because they’re quite important and they are the ones that actually give successful results to cover the needs of the people.”",
          "The initiative began in 2022 with two prioritization workshops, as part of the WHO Urbanlead program, in collaboration with the Kennedy Local Mayor’s office. Inclusive strategies were identified to enable persons with disabilities to engage, and training was provided for local leaders.",
          "“It was quite an important training process,” said Ms Estrada. “Because, in our role as both leaders and caregivers, what moves us the most is the love and interest that push us into increasing the visibility of our own needs.”",
          "Local physician and Disability Council member, Oscar Moreno agreed: “What I liked most was the way they made us understand what we needed to communicate, how we had to look for the needs and the way of knowing what the priorities were in the needs that we had as citizens and as caregivers.”",
          "In 2023, more than 10 workshops were held to strengthen capacities in collective health, social participation, and intersectoral action. These workshops also helped narrow down priority areas by community actors: the need to ensure inclusion of adults with disabilities in health and social services. As a result, a proposal was put forward to develop an Interactive Well-being Center for people with disabilities, including their caregivers, and families. Such a center could simultaneously address and improve issues related to health care, mental health and education. A US$1 million budget was allocated to the project, and a full proposal was developed with the technical assistance of WHO.",
          "“The center aims to motivate people, so they continue to strengthen their leadership,” said Ms Estrada. “How nice it would be to strengthen this community so that other leaders continue to emerge who can represent the community and support each other.”",
          "By taking an equitable and empowering approach to health and well-being in their locality, Kennedy is demonstrating how disability inclusion and participation can strengthen health governance and help communities thrive.",
          "The WHO Initiative on Urban Governance for Health and Well-being (2020–2028), supported by the Swiss Agency for Cooperation and Development, aims at improving the health status and well-being of populations in cities through participatory and multisectoral urban governance. The Initiative is implemented in six core cities: Khulna (Bangladesh), Douala (Cameroon), Bogotá (Colombia), Mexico City (Mexico), Pasig City, Metro Manila (Philippines), and Tunis (Tunisia).",

          "The campaign began in Ward 30, one of the hardest-hit areas, where stagnant water had turned into mosquito breeding sites. Through community meetings, residents co-designed practical solutions: drain stagnant ponds, improve waste disposal, and raise awareness.",
          "On cleanup day, residents worked alongside city officials, ward commissioner, and volunteer groups including the “BD Clean”, clearing the pond and surrounding areas within hours. The effort not only improved sanitation but also galvanized community spirit.",
          "Credit:\r\nWHO Bangladesh / Asif Ahmed",
          "To maintain momentum, a community committee was formed—bringing together residents, civil society, and local leaders to monitor progress and coordinate future activities.",
          "These joint efforts were supported by Khulna’s Healthy City Platform, launched under the WHO Initiative on urban governance for health and well-being to promote participatory and multisectoral urban governance. The Platform is guided by an advisory group of 36 senior representatives from government, civil society, and academia. It connects Khulna City Corporation with other government entities, community groups, academic institutions, and volunteers—enabling a unified and collaborative response to urban health challenges.",
          "Through the Platform, ward commissioners raise local concerns, while WHO and city officials provide technical and logistical support.",
          "“Community engagement is not an add-on — it’s the foundation of effective urban governance,” says Dr. Rajesh Narwal, Deputy WHO Representative in Bangladesh and Team Lead for the Healthy City Initiative. “Khulna’s experience shows that when communities are empowered and involved from the start, they can drive real change — translating policies into tangible, on-the-ground action.”",
          "Inspired by the success in Ward 30, other wards have begun adapting the model—some focusing on waste management, others promoting physical activity in schools and public spaces. The Healthy City Advisory Committee has recognized this approach as key to advancing Khulna’s Healthy City Action Plan.",
          "Challenges\r\nremain. Political transitions in 2024 brought leadership changes, and limited\r\nresources continue to stretch routine operations. Yet, Khulna’s\r\ncommunity-driven model—grounded in participation, collaboration, and shared\r\nownership—demonstrates that sustainable progress is possible.",
          "Looking ahead, Khulna City Corporation aims to institutionalize the approach through the Healthy City Platform, reinforcing ward-level partnerships and feedback mechanisms. Meanwhile, in Ward 30, Molla Maruf Rashid and his neighbors are preparing for the next community cleanup.",

          "As part of WHO Initiative on Urban Governance for Health and Well-being , the district mayors of the city of Douala, Cameroon, under the leadership of the Mayor of Douala, Roger Mbassa Ndine, worked closely with local communities to strengthen participatory governance mechanisms and multisectoral action. The goal was to promote health and well-being and better address their determinants, as identified by over a hundred stakeholders from municipal authorities, regional delegations of relevant technical ministries, civil society organizations—including community leaders—and academic partners.",
          "With a population of nearly four million, Douala is one of the two largest cities in Cameroon, representing 20% of the country’s total urban population. Home to the main seaport, it is also Cameroon’s economic capital. The city faces various sources of pollution. In 2016, 39% of the country’s businesses were concentrated in the city and it hosts the largest industrial zones, which have a significant impact on the urban ecosystem. Sanitation and drainage systems are inadequate—of an estimated 250km of drainage needed, only 50km have been constructed. Access to water is also a challenge; only 42% of households in the city have reliable access to potable water (within 500 metres of a tap). This situation contributes to the prevalence of waterborne diseases, the most common being malaria, typhoid and cholera. Cholera, in particular, has become endemic since October 2021.",
          "Using a participatory and multisectoral approach to address the priorities of the city of Douala, the Urban Governance for Health and Well-being initiative was launched in December 2020. In 2021, among the five priorities identified by stakeholders in the city, the top one was improving access to safe drinking water. Stakeholders collectively selected the Brazzaville neighborhood—home to over 30 000 residents—for piloting a Small Intersectoral Project (SIP) aimed at improving access to drinking water. The area was experiencing a severe shortage of potable water. Private wells and boreholes, residents' only water sources, provided water of questionable quality during an active cholera outbreak. Additionally, the neighborhood faced socioeconomic and health challenges, including poverty, poor sanitation and inadequate drainage.",
          "Led by the first cohort of Urbanlead champions, this SIP contributed, among other achievements, to strengthening the commitment of the Mayor of Douala 3rd Municipal District, Mr. Epoupa Bossambo Valentin. He spearheaded advocacy efforts that led to the adoption of a municipal resolution and issued a decree in favor of improving access to drinking water across his municipality. This was followed by the establishment of the Brazzaville Water Management Committee, the transfer of local water facilities (including a water tower and related infrastructure) to this committee, and the training of more than 150 residents on WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) in collaboration with UNICEF, the Nylon Health District, the Regional Delegation of the Ministry of Water and Energy, and with technical and financial support from WHO.",
          "As the SIP action plan was steadily progressing in the Brazzaville neighborhood, its effects triggered similar action in other neighborhoods and Municipal Districts of Douala. The Mayor of Douala’s 3rd Municipal District extended a field visit to all 118 neighborhoods and villages within his jurisdiction to gain a firsthand understanding of local conditions. More than 1 500 points were recorded, with the majority found to be in a critical sanitary condition, including some public boreholes with questionable water quality that had been taken over by individuals – limiting access for the broader community.",
          "The outcomes of this field visit led to a range of follow-up actions, including the systematic scaling up of the Water Management Committee model in neighborhoods with public water points or boreholes, and the launch of a major chlorination campaign by the municipal hygiene services to make water safe for drinking.",
          "To date in Douala’s 3 rd Municipal District, more than nine Water Management Committees have been established in other neighborhoods, and over 15 boreholes have been constructed or rehabilitated. It is estimated that more than 37 500 people have improved access to safe drinking water as a result of this initiative.",
          "The momentum initiated by Douala’s 3rd Municipal District through the SIP has had a ripple effect across other municipal districts in Douala that face similar challenges in accessing safe drinking water. The clear success of the intersectoral water project approach helped demonstrate the vital role of participatory and multisectoral urban governance, as well as community engagement, in promoting health and well-being. A similar model could be applied to address public health challenges in Douala’s markets.",
          "The WHO Initiative is an integral part of the Douala Healthy City Action Plan 2023–2025, an initiative coordinated by Dr. Roger Mbassa Ndine, Mayor of the city of Douala. The Healthy City Action Plan aims to promote sound local urban governance for health and well-being through citizen engagement and multisectoral coordination.",

          "Abortion is a safe procedure when carried out in line with evidence-based practices, many of which are reflected in the World Health Organization’s Abortion care guidelines . However, half of abortions that occur around the world are unsafe, meaning the procedure is carried out by a person lacking the necessary skills and/or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards. Life-threatening complications that may result from unsafe abortion include haemorrhage, infection, and injury to the genital tract and internal organs.",
          "“The problem is that many healthcare providers in some high-need countries have not had the opportunity to receive the formal education they need to provide family planning and comprehensive abortion care, but are then put in a situation where they are expected to provide essential care,” said Ulrika Rehnström Loi, technical officer and midwife at WHO. It is crucial that health workers providing safe abortion care have the skills to use recommended methods, manage pain and complications, and provide accurate information and counselling. They must also ensure care is respectful, confidential, rights-based, and linked to post-abortion and contraceptive services",

The 57 competencies define the essential knowledge and skills primary healthcare workers should develop during their education. The family planning and comprehensive abortion care competencies are designed to be suitable for developing learning outcomes (or learning objectives) both for formal education and for lifelong learning in the workplace. It is the actual learning achieved (the outcome) that matters.",
          "Competencies are a benchmark, not just for education but also for performance in the workplace. They help to define standards, and to plan and measure professional development, improving job performance as well as learning.",

Already facing hardship, Eveline herself is blind, and the family relies solely on Boniface’s strenuous work transporting water to survive.",
          "Eveline lost her sight in primary school. Ruth’s education suffered; she repeated grades and relied on her brother for homework. Vincent, still a toddler, couldn’t fully enjoy his surroundings. Eveline struggled to maintain their home and longed for her children to regain their sight.",

Boniface was overwhelmed with gratitude, calling it an answered prayer.",
          "A year later, the family’s life has transformed. Ruth now excels in school, especially in maths, and helps Eveline prepare meals, strengthening their bond. Vincent, though still too young for school, plays happily with friends. Eveline has joined a local “chama” for the first time, gaining financial independence and confidence. The community has taken notice. Neighbours who once looked down on the family now show respect, and even the area chief has been inviting Boniface to local events.",
          "Their journey shows how access to timely cataract surgery not only restores sight but also restores dignity, opportunity, and a sense of belonging.",
          "Cataract is the cloudiness in the lens of the eye, leading to increasingly blurred vision. It is the leading cause of blindness globally, impacting 94 million people worldwide. Vision loss due to cataract can be restored overnight with a simple and cost-effective surgery. In adults, the risk of developing cataract increases with age, but other factors can accelerate their development. In children, they can be congenital (present at birth) or develop later, often due to genetic factors, infections, or other underlying conditions. While cataracts may not be entirely preventable, there are lifestyle changes and habits that can be adopted to reduce the risk and delay their onset. After cataract surgery, eyeglasses often remain important for optimizing vision. They provide a safe, non-invasive way to fine-tune sight and correct any remaining refractive error. Many people still need eyeglasses for near tasks such as reading or other near work. A check for new eyeglasses is usually recommended once the eye has healed and vision has stabilized, typically a few weeks after surgery.",

          "A substantial proportion of medicines for maternal health care are substandard quality, including those used to manage postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), the leading cause of maternal death. In many countries, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, healthcare providers cannot trust the effectiveness of medicines they depend on.",
          "Join Senator Oral Ataniyazova of Uzbekistan and member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Committee on Health, and Professor Tari Turner, Chair of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Group (STAG) of the UN’s Special Programme in Human Reproduction (HRP), as they discuss actions parliamentarians can take to improve access to quality-assured medicines that can save the lives of pregnant women and their newborn babies.",
          "Professor Tari Turner (T.T.): As a researcher passionate about evidence-based policymaking for women and children, I see quality of medicines as vital to realizing the right to health, but also to ensuring trust in health systems. I know that policymakers are also facing all kinds of other challenges, so I’m intrigued, among the important health issues the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) focus on: Why do you think it is important to prioritize quality-assured medicines for maternal health?",
          "Senator Oral Ataniyazova (O.A) : For the past 20 years, the IPU has led the way in getting parliaments involved in health. It focuses on making sure everyone has better access to health services and to make health outcomes fairer for all.",
          "Women dying during childbirth due to lack of access to quality-assured, safe and effective medicines is a deep injustice and one we can fix. It’s often the poorest women who suffer most, and that is unacceptable.",
          "Maternal death rates are stagnating in many places, and stronger laws and regulation can make a real difference. Parliaments have the power to break this cycle – ensuring quality-assured medicines is not just about saving lives, it is about driving progress across health, equity, and development.",
          "Health is a political choice, and strong parliaments and strong democracies are key. They help build equity, participation, accountability and transparency, in health and beyond.",
          "T.T.: How has your experience as a physician informed how you approach your role bridging science and policy?",
          "O.A. : Firstly, by recognizing that pregnancy and childbirth are physiological processes, not a disease. There are many inter-connected factors which contribute to health, including the socio-economic status of the family, the availability of quality medical services, public awareness on the possibilities of safe motherhood, a critical analysis of each case of maternal or infant mortality, a regular monitoring of the entire system for providing effective maternal and child services.",
          "All these rest on the relevant legislative and regulatory frameworks of each country and the use of WHO standards.",
          "Scientific experience, as a research process of searching for an evidence base, is the most important connecting link. Without critical and reliable analyses, it is impossible to correctly assess risks – in the healthcare system or in any other sector. Any error in interpreting data leads to erroneous conclusions, erroneous decisions, and ultimately to the misuse of the budget and the adoption of ineffective programs, increasing the risk for public health.",
          "I highly appreciate the role of the IPU Committee on Health, since it provides, among others, the possibility of promoting parliamentary strategies for safe motherhood at the global level.",
          "T.T.: As you know, there are huge challenges to ensuring quality-assured medicines across countries and regions; limited data, low awareness, inconsistent regulation, and infrastructure gaps, to name a few. A new resolution which passed at the 59th session of the Human Rights Council urges multi-sectoral action. In your view, what are the most impactful things parliamentarians can do to address these issues?",
          "O.A.: Parliamentarians can change the narrative: framing access to quality-assured medicines not just as a technical issue, but as a matter of health equity and smart investment in people. When health is seen as an investment, not a cost, it becomes central to national development.",
          "Demonstrating political will means backing this vision with tangible action, including consistent investment in health systems and regulatory infrastructure. Without proper funding, gaps in medicine quality and access will persist.",
          "Parliaments also play a key role in aligning national laws with international standards, ensuring that regulators have the authority to act decisively. Clear, consistent legislation signals that maternal health and quality-assured medicines are a political priority.",
          "T.T.: Multi-sectoral action means all have a role to play. How can scientists and researchers like me help parliamentarians like you to make meaningful progress on the issue?",
          "O.A.: Scientists and researchers play a vital role in helping parliamentarians make informed, effective decisions, especially on complex issues like access to quality-assured medicines. One of the biggest barriers we face is the lack of accurate, timely data. Collaboration with technical experts like you is crucial, not just to provide evidence, but to help translate findings into policy-relevant insights.",
          "At the same time, we need to strengthen data literacy among parliamentarians and our staff to foster a more evidence-informed culture within parliaments.",
          "And evidence alone is not enough: we must also connect with the people behind the numbers. Your research, paired with real-life stories and community voices, can help humanize the issue and drive home the urgency of action. Together, we can bridge the gap between data, people, and policy.",
          "T.T.: Through the IPU’s partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), you have engaged with WHO for many years. Looking ahead to five years from now, what would success look like to you? What signs would tell you that your parliamentary efforts have made a real difference for women and families?",
          "O.A. : The partnership between the IPU and WHO has been instrumental in bringing the scientific and parliamentary communities closer together. This collaboration is fundamental to sustaining global parliamentary advocacy, ensuring that political leadership and scientific evidence move hand in hand. It also creates valuable spaces for parliamentarians to learn from one another’s experiences, understand what works in different contexts, and adapt successful approaches to their own countries.",
          "At a time when global focus often shifts to conflict and security – the short-term response to crises – real progress would mean we have got our priorities straight, placing the health and lives of women and children at the center of national agendas.",
          "I would see signs of impact in revised legislation that strengthens medicine regulation, increased health budgets that protect maternal health, governments procuring the right medicines in the right volumes, and parliamentarians working across party lines and publicly debating and demanding action on these issues."

          "At just four years old Muhammad was diagnosed with bilateral cataracts. This condition, often associated with older adults, can also affect young children, depriving them of their sight, their curiosity, and their simple joys in life. “My eye started closing a little bit. I was scared,” he shares.",
          "Muhammad, a young boy living in Kaduna, Nigeria, struggled with basic tasks like drawing or playing football. In April 2022, his mother passed away due to complications from sickle cell disease. Since then, his grandmother, Halima, has cared for him.  “Muhammad’s future was uncertain without the surgery. He couldn’t see or understand things. I was worried about what would happen to him next.” she said.",
          "Muhammad’s father, Dawud Abubakar, did his best to support the family, but paying for surgery seemed impossible. “I felt helpless,” he admits. “I wanted my son to keep his vision, but I didn’t know how to make that happen.”",
          "Bringing back sight and hope",
          "Sightsavers, a non-governmental organization in official relations with the World Health Organization, helped Muhammad get referred to the National Eye Centre in Kaduna. There, under the guidance of ophthalmologist Dr Amina Hassan, a 40-minute surgical procedure was performed. This involved removing the cloudy lens and fitting a clear artificial lens, which changed Muhammad’s life. The next day, a nurse removed Muhammad’s bandages, and his eyes lit up. “I see my father,” he said happily. He hadn’t been able to see his father clearly, his favourite person, for many months.",
          "Starting over",
          "At the age of 6, life changed for Muhammad  after his cataract surgery. “Now I can play better,” he says. He spends his days colouring, watching TV, and running on the field with friends. With his vision restored, he feels confident at school. His grandmother watches him play with a bright smile. “Seeing Muhammad happy and running around gives me peace,” she says, “This surgery gave him back his childhood.” Muhammad has started dreaming again. He wants to join the military, inspired by the bravery of soldiers. At the same time, he hopes to learn sewing skills like his father.",
          "A look at what is possible",

          "To Muhammad, reuniting with his father was just the start.",
          "Cataract is the cloudiness in the lens of the eye, leading to increasingly blurred vision. It is the leading cause of blindness globally, impacting 94 million people worldwide. Vision loss due to cataract can be restored overnight with a simple and cost-effective surgery. In adults, the risk of developing cataract increases with age, but other factors can accelerate their development. In children, they can be congenital (present at birth) or develop later, often due to genetic factors, infections, or other underlying conditions. While cataracts may not be entirely preventable, there are lifestyle changes and habits that can be adopted to reduce the risk and delay their onset. After cataract surgery, eyeglasses often remain important for optimizing vision. They provide a safe, non-invasive way to fine-tune sight and correct any remaining refractive error. Many people still need eyeglasses for near tasks such as reading or other near work. A check for new eyeglasses is usually recommended once the eye has healed and vision has stabilized, typically a few weeks after surgery.",

          "Vanuatu’s islands are known for their rich cultural heritage, but beneath this beauty lies a pressing challenge: the country faces persistent public health threats, exacerbated by limited infrastructure, frequent disasters, and the growing impact of climate change. As one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, Vanuatu is highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks, which can quickly overwhelm its health-care system.",
          "Disasters can disrupt access to clean water, sanitation, and health care, while displacement, overcrowding, and interruptions to routine services like vaccination and surveillance further increase the risk of disease spread, especially in a context where health systems are already strained.",
          "In response, the Ministry of Health has been enhancing its public health capabilities through digital innovation. As outlined in the Vanuatu Digital Health Strategy 2025–30, the country is prioritizing sustainable, data-driven health systems that are agile and responsive to threats.",
          "A key part of this strategy is Go.Data, a critical platform in the country's surveillance toolkit. Go.Data is a digital tool that supports case investigation and contact tracing through real-time data entry, even in low-connectivity settings, with integrated datasets, analytics, and features to organize and monitor field operations.",
          "Originally adopted for the COVID-19 response, Go.Data is now expanding its role, with planned integrations to support climate-sensitive disease surveillance and AI-driven forecasting.",
          "Go.Data: a vital tool for outbreak response",
          "Go.Data, a tool developed by WHO in collaboration with Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners, was introduced in Vanuatu in early 2022. Its initial purpose was to support the COVID-19 pandemic response by enhancing case investigation, contact tracing, and data management. However, once Go.Data proved its value, the Ministry of Health expanded its use to manage other outbreaks, including measles, leptospirosis, tuberculosis, and yaws.",
          "Before Go.Data, disease surveillance in Vanuatu was a more fragmented and labour-intensive process. Health workers, especially those in remote areas, struggled to manage data whilst coordinating outbreak investigations. Without reliable internet access or the ability to digitize field investigations, responses can be delayed, with health workers relying on phone calls, paper notes, and ad hoc spreadsheets to track disease spread. This made it difficult to quickly respond to outbreaks.",
          "With Go.Data – a flexible, offline-capable platform designed to address these very challenges – health workers can now digitize data in real-time, even in areas with no internet connectivity. Its integration with the Ministry’s core health information system has helped streamline reporting functions, making outbreak intelligence an integral part of Vanuatu’s national health surveillance and reporting infrastructure.",
          "\"By working with the Ministry of Health and our global partners, we’re not just addressing today’s health challenges, we’re building a resilient, innovative future for Vanuatu. This collaboration ensures that Vanuatu’s health system is ready to face whatever comes next, with the strength and support of a united global community,\" said Dr Revite Kirition, Liaison Officer, WHO Country office, Vanuatu.",

          "Expanding Go.Data’s role in climate and AI-driven disease forecasting",
          "The future of Vanuatu’s health surveillance system lies in the integration of innovative technologies, particularly in climate-sensitive disease surveillance and AI-driven disease forecasting. Climate change is already contributing to shifts in disease patterns across the region, with new and emerging threats driven by changing weather patterns, increased flooding, and more frequent natural disasters.",
          "In response to this, the Ministry of Health plans to expand Go.Data’s role in forecasting disease outbreaks, not just monitoring current ones, based on climate data. The tool’s integration with the National Laboratory Information System and the refinement of standard operating procedures for multi-disease outbreak response are key initiatives in this effort. These integrations will enable health officials to predict and monitor disease trends with greater precision, allowing them to act before an outbreak reaches a crisis point.",
          "\"The Ministry of Health has always understood that to secure the future of our people, we must be ahead of the curve. With Go.Data, we are not just responding to today's challenges – we are proactively shaping the future of public health in Vanuatu. By recognizing the emerging trends and embracing the best tools for our country, we are ensuring that our health system is not only resilient but ready to meet the evolving needs of our communities. This is about making decisions today that will safeguard the health and well-being of future generations\" said Rachel Takoar, Digital Health Manager at the Ministry of Health.",
          "The future of Vanuatu’s digital health system also lies in its adoption of AI-powered models for disease forecasting. By combining data from Go.Data, the existing health information system, and climate models, Vanuatu aims to develop predictive tools that can forecast disease trends based on factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall.",

          "A model for other island nations",
          "Vanuatu’s journey with Go.Data shows how digital health tools can revolutionize public health systems in small island nations. By leveraging technology, Vanuatu has improved its ability to respond to outbreaks, protect its communities, and build a more resilient public health infrastructure.",
          "\"Vanuatu is offering an emerging model for integrating health and climate data. The integration of Go.Data with climate data and the application of AI for predictive disease forecasting is setting a bold precedent for the Pacific. While still evolving, this work reflects a promising direction: anticipating threats before they manifest and taking action before they escalate. Efforts like these show that, with appropriate tools and partnerships, island nations can strengthen their resilience to the intersecting challenges of climate and health,\" said Silvia E. Morreale, Go.Data focal point at the GOARN Operational Support Team.",
          "As other countries in the Pacific region and beyond face similar challenges, Vanuatu’s experience with Go.Data offers a blueprint for harnessing the power of data, digital tools, and innovative technologies to build health systems that can withstand the pressures of climate change, natural disasters, and emerging health threats."

          "Learn more about vaccines – from how they work to how they’re made – in WHO’s Learn more about vaccines – from how they work to how they’re made – in WHO’s Vaccines Explained series Vaccines are made up of carefully selected components that work together to protect against disease.  Each vaccine component serves a specific purpose, and each ingredient is tested in the manufacturing process. All ingredients are rigorously tested for safety. Active components: antigens or their blueprint (DNA or RNA) Vaccines contain antigens or the blueprint for making the antigens. An antigen generates an immune response and may be a small part of the disease-causing organism, like a protein or sugar, or it may be the whole organism in a weakened or inactive form. In place of an antigen, vaccines may also contain genetic material (DNA or RNA) that instructs the body to make specific antigens. Although DNA or RNA vaccines are relatively new, the technology behind them, including their mechanism of action, has been researched for several decades. mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccines have safely protected millions against severe disease and death due to COVID-19. mRNA vaccines are held to the same standards of safety, efficacy and quality as all vaccines. Different ways to design a vaccine There are three main approaches to designing a vaccine. Their differences lie in whether they use a whole virus or bacterium; just the parts of the germ that triggers the immune system; or just the genetic material that provides the instructions for making specific proteins and not the whole virus. The whole-microbe approach Inactivated vaccine The first way to make a vaccine is to take the disease-carrying virus or bacterium, or one very similar to it, and inactivate or kill it using chemicals, heat or radiation. This approach uses technology that’s been proven to work in people – this is the way the flu and polio vaccines are made – and vaccines can be manufactured on a reasonable scale. However, it requires special laboratory facilities to grow the virus or bacterium safely, can have a relatively long production time, and will likely require two or three doses to be administered. Live-attenuated vaccine A live-attenuated vaccine uses a living but weakened version of the virus or one that’s very similar. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the chickenpox and shingles vaccine are examples of this type of vaccine. This approach uses similar technology to the inactivated vaccine and can be manufactured at scale. However, vaccines like this may not be suitable for people with compromised immune systems. Viral vector vaccine This type of vaccine uses a safe virus to deliver specific sub-parts – called proteins – of the germ of interest so that it can trigger an immune response without causing disease. To do this, the instructions for making particular parts of the pathogen of interest are inserted into a safe virus. The safe virus then serves as a platform or vector to deliver the protein into the body.  The protein triggers the immune response. The Ebola vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, and this type can be developed rapidly. The subunit approach A subunit vaccine uses only the specific parts (the subunits) of a virus or bacterium that the immune system needs to recognize. It doesn't contain the whole microbe or use a safe virus as a vector. These subunits may be proteins or sugars, or a combination of both. The subunits can come directly from the germ or produced recombinantly, using genetic engineering. Because subunit vaccines do not use whole viruses or bacteria, they can safely help the body build protection without causing disease. Most of the vaccines on the childhood schedule are subunit vaccines, protecting people from diseases such as whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria and meningococcal meningitis. The genetic approach (nucleic acid vaccine) Unlike vaccine approaches that use either a weakened or dead whole microbe or parts of one, a nucleic acid vaccine just uses a section of genetic material that provides the instructions for specific proteins, not the whole microbe. DNA and RNA are the instructions our cells use to make proteins. In our cells, DNA is first turned into messenger RNA, which is then used as the blueprint to make specific proteins. Other ingredients in a vaccine Aside from antigens or their genetic material, vaccines also contain other ingredients to help keep them safe and effective. These ingredients are included in most vaccines and have been used for decades in billions of doses. Preservatives Preservatives prevent the vaccine from becoming contaminated once the vial has been opened, if it will be used for vaccinating more than one person. Some vaccines don’t have preservatives because they are stored in one-dose vials and are discarded after the single dose is administered. The most commonly used preservative is 2-phenoxyethanol. It has been used for many years in a number of vaccines, is used in a range of baby care products and is safe for use in vaccines, as it has little toxicity in humans. Another preservative used in some vaccines is thiomersal (also known as thimerosal), which is present in multi-dose vials. Thiomersal prevents germs from contaminating the vaccine vial every time a dose is taken. Thiomersal contains ethylmercury, a type of mercury that is rapidly cleared from the body.  Thiomersal has been used safely for decades, and studies from many countries have found no evidence of harm. There is no link between thiomersal and autism. Stabilizers Stabilizers prevent chemical reactions from occurring within the vaccine and keep the vaccine components from sticking to the vaccine vial. Stabilizers can be sugars (lactose, sucrose), amino acids (glycine), gelatin, and proteins (recombinant human albumin, derived from yeast). Surfactants Surfactants keep all the ingredients in the vaccine blended together. They prevent settling and clumping of elements that are in the liquid form of the vaccine. They are also often used in foods like ice cream. Residuals Residuals are tiny amounts of various substances used during manufacturing or production of vaccines that are not active ingredients in the completed vaccine. Substances will vary depending on the manufacturing process used and may include egg\r\n        proteins, yeast or antibiotics. Residual traces of these substances which may be present in a vaccine are in such small quantities that they need to be measured as parts per million or parts per billion. Diluent A diluent is a liquid used to dilute a vaccine to the correct concentration immediately prior to use. The most commonly used diluent is sterile water. Adjuvant Some vaccines also contain adjuvants. An adjuvant improves the immune response to the vaccine, sometimes by keeping the vaccine at the injection site for a little longer or by stimulating local immune cells. The adjuvant may be a tiny amount of aluminium salts (like aluminium phosphate, aluminium hydroxide or potassium aluminium sulphate). Aluminium has been used in vaccines for many years. The amount of aluminium in vaccines is very small—much less than the aluminium we get from food and water. Even after receiving all their childhood vaccines, children still get far less aluminium than from their everyday diet. Extensive evidence shows that aluminium in vaccines does not cause any long-term health problems, including autism."

          "In Nigeria, rabies continues to claim an estimated 10,000 human lives annually; this figure is likely an underestimation. This disease mainly affects suburban and rural communities where prevention programs are limited. Surveillance remains one of the most under-resourced pillars of rabies control. Without reliable surveillance, cases are underreported, and rabies is neglected, but in Cross River State, a unique effort is changing this narrative.",
          "In 2022, the Department of Veterinary Services in Cross River State partnered with the Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC) to address this long-standing challenge of weak rabies surveillance. GARC provided technical support and tools to enable real-time dog vaccination , dog bite incidents  and both human and animal rabies  case tracking using a DHIS2-based mobile app.  For the first time, systematic tracking of rabies was possible in the region.",
          "The DHIS2-based rabies surveillance app displaying real time bite and case reports across Cross River State. Source: Cross River Rabies Surveillance Team",
          "Rabies surveillance, however, requires more than just technology. Once a suspected rabies case or bite is reported, responders must act quickly: travel to the site (sometimes hours away), conduct investigations, identify suspected animals and victims, collect samples, and send for confirmation.",
          "Leading this rabies surveillance and response efforts are Dr. John Bassey and Dr. Moses Efenji, veterinarians based in Cross River State. In a state where it can take up to nine hours to travel from the southern to the northern end, logistics posed a signifiant challenge. The solution was to recruit and train the state’s existing network of para-veterinarians, who are civil-service trained animal health workers already stationed in each local government area. Once a suspected human or animal rabies case  is flagged, the nearest trained officer is deployed to investigate, collect data and samples. While samples are sent to the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) in Vom, Plateau State, for confirmatory testing, the project has also strengthened its diagnostic capabilities and response protocols by establishing rapid field-testing procedures to speed up risk assessment and response .",

          "Tracking rabies: Cases and challenges.",
          "The results are startling. In just two years of systematic surveillance, 22 rabies cases (21 dogs and 1 human) were identified in a state that had reported zero cases for over a decade. This confirmed what many public health experts had long suspected; rabies was present but undocumented, silently claiming lives. Animal cases ranged from free roaming dogs to owned animals, including one bought for consumption, underscoring the need for locally tailored, multifaceted prevention strategies.",
          "Despite these successes, the team faces persistent challenges. With no formal government support, the project relies on personal commitment and volunteer effort. Cultural practices also complicate efforts: In Cross River State, dogs are both pets and a meat source, creating pressures for investigation and sample collection. Of the 21 animal cases reported, 12 were laboratory confirmed and 9 classified as probable based on clinical signs witnessed by community members before the dogs were slaughtered. “Carcasses of rabid animals should not be consumed under any circumstances,” emphasizes Dr. Eze Adaeze, a veterinary epidemiologist documenting rabies surveillance in Nigeria. “Surveillance must go hand-in-hand with community education and responsible dog ownership.”",

          "Visibility Saving lives; Data for Action",
          "A surveillance system's true measure of success lies in its impact on human health. When  an animal rabies case is reported, bite victims can access lifesaving post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Yet, access and cost of PEP remains a critical barrier. A complete regimen costs  approximately $150 with rabies immunoglobulin costing around $100, more than the monthly minimum wage in Nigeria ($46). The patient must bear the complete cost. Hence, the surveillance teams found themselves not just identifying cases but also financially assisting victims to access treatment.",
          "\"Every case of rabies is heartbreaking when you know that it could have been prevented, sometimes the difference between life and death comes down to $150.\" says Dr. John Bassey.",
          "The documented rabies burden led to Cross River State receiving over 10,000 anti-rabies vaccines between 2022 and 2023 for dogs through the World Bank's REDISSE project, demonstrating how effective surveillance can mobilize resources for prevention and control. However, since the project ended the same year, vaccine supplies have dwindled with no new funding, highlighting the ongoing challenge of sustaining intervention resources.",
          "The Cross River model is now being considered for national adoption. Late last year, stakeholders from human health, animal health, environment and wildlife sectors gathered with GARC and other partners (FAO, WHO)  to develop a National Rabies Rapid Response Toolkit for Nigeria which provides a One Health framework for rabies prevention and response. As Nigeria aims to eliminate dog-mediated human rabies by 2030 , Cross River model offers a scalable blueprint both nationally and regionally in Africa. But for this momentum to last, there must be government engagement and sustained investment. With countries like Nigeria tapping into new global opportunities like GAVI’s human anti-rabies vaccine program and renewed World Bank funding, coupled with this surveillance system, community awareness, responsible pet ownership, affordable PEP for bite victims, sustainable vaccine supply for animals, Cross River's approach could become a fully integrated One Health success story .",

          "The Sustaining a Polio-Free World: A strategy for long-term success (SPW) defines the global technical standards for functions that are essential to achieve and maintain a polio-free world: vaccination, surveillance, outbreak preparedness and response, and poliovirus containment. The strategy includes core activities that will be needed after certification of wild poliovirus type 1 eradication and elimination of variant poliovirus type 2 to support progress toward the global certification of eradication for all types of polio.",
          "The Polio Transition Strategic Framework offers the operational pathway to achieve the goals of the SPW strategy. It supports countries to assess readiness, plan transition, and progressively integrate polio essential functions into national health systems. This work is already underway in countries that have fully transitioned from Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) support, as well as in other polio transition priority countries. By aligning national and regional polio transition planning with SPW, the Framework enables a flexible, context-specific approach that reflects each country’s capacity and timeline for assuming responsibility for polio essential functions.",
          "The Framework will remain relevant throughout the SPW era. By the time the SPW strategy begins, many countries will have already transitioned away from GPEI support. These countries are expected to sustain the technical standards set out in the SPW independently, with limited technical support provided by WHO and partners. Meanwhile, countries unable to fully take over polio essential functions as GPEI support to them winds down will remain in intermediate transition – a time-limited period during which external support will continue, particularly for critical functions such as surveillance. WHO and partners will continue to support these countries during  the transition process. Sustained and flexible support, paired with increasing national ownership, will be essential to protect eradication gains and secure a polio-free future."

          "Uruguay, a country of just over 3 million people, is among the countries in the Americas with the highest suicide rates. Recognizing that previous suicide attempts are a strong risk factor for future suicide, Uruguayan health authorities have made it a national priority to improve the way these events are detected and followed up. Its recent launch of a nationwide digital registry system is enabling faster, more accurate responses to suicidal behavior – and offering valuable insights that are informing both clinical care and public health policy.",
          "From paper to digital: building a national surveillance system",
          "Uruguay’s journey toward a robust surveillance system began with the implementation of a paper-based registry in 2013. While this was an important first step, it had limitations – particularly in timeliness and usability. In 2022, the Ministry of Public Health launched a nationwide digital suicide attempt registry, making it mandatory for all 97 emergency departments (EDs) across the country to register every suicide attempt presenting to an ED within 24 hours of the event.",
          "This digital system was developed by an operational group within the Ministry, led by professionals from the National Mental Health Department. A technical advisory group of clinicians, academics, and health administrators helped determine which data variables were most important – balancing epidemiological value with clinical feasibility. Insights were also drawn from international experiences and from the WHO Practice manual for establishing and maintaining surveillance systems for suicide attempts and self-harm (For Spanish translation see here ).",
          "The system was designed to be concise and practical, minimizing the burden on already stretched ED staff. An evaluation found that on average registration took just five minutes.",
          "Nation-wide implementation",
          "To ensure seamless implementation, a dedicated team comprising the Ministry’s e-government, mental health, and health surveillance departments coordinated with healthcare providers across the country to deliver training for accurate and timely data entry. A comprehensive, multi-layered quality assurance process has been established. The data once entered is initially validated by a mental health specialist and reviewed daily by the surveillance department of the Ministry. Quarterly audits are further conducted to assess completeness and identify gaps.",
          "From early detection to targeted follow-up care",
          "The benefits of Uruguay’s system are already being felt. On the clinical front, authorised mental health professionals can access real-time data on recent suicide attempts, enabling rapid follow-up, consistent with WHO LIVE LIFE guidance for suicide prevention. Furthermore, Uruguay’s national clinical guidelines for the management and follow-up of individuals with suicide attempts mandates all individuals presenting to the ED should be followed up by a trained mental health professional — such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or mental health specialist nurse —  within  48 hours and 7 days post-attempt. The surveillance system and daily quality assurance reviews supports adherence to this clinical protocol. In this way, the national surveillance system and clinical guidelines are complementary mechanisms promoting timely intervention and continuity of care.",
          "Credit: Ministry of Public Health, Uruguay.",
          "Impact at the policy level",
          "At the policy level, the system provides rich data on the demographics and circumstances of suicide attempts. Policymakers are using these insights to monitor trends, assess variations across time and regions, and tailor interventions to high-risk populations.",
          "“Having timely, reliable data has transformed the way we work,” says the team from the National Mental Health Department of the Ministry of Public Health. “It allows us to work more closely with healthcare institutions across the National Health System, strengthen the quality of mental health care, and ensure timely, coordinated responses for those at risk. At the same time, it guides the design of multisectoral policies grounded in national evidence, helping us move from reactive measures to proactive prevention.”",
          "By establishing a national infrastructure for real-time monitoring, Uruguay is laying the foundation for smarter prevention – grounded in evidence, collaboration, and rapid response. The data is already informing the design of Uruguay’s next national suicide prevention strategy.",
          "Credit: Ministry of Public Health, Uruguay.",
          "Lessons for the region and the world",
          "Uruguay stands out as a regional and global leader in real-time surveillance of suicide attempts, and offers a compelling model for other countries seeking data-driven public health approaches to suicide prevention. Critical success factors include: high-level political commitment and mandates, technical collaboration across sectors, simple and user-friendly tools, strong quality assurance processes, and continuous engagement with healthcare providers.",
          "While no system or intervention alone can prevent suicides, Uruguay’s national surveillance registry linked to clinical guidelines for suicide attempts, marks a major step forward. By capturing the warning signs early, connecting people to care, and providing decision-makers with timely information, Uruguay is proving that well-functioning surveillance isn’t just about numbers – it’s about saving lives."

          "The Republic of Maldives is advancing its commitment to universal eye health through the launch of the World Health Organization’s SPECS 2030 initiative and the development of a National Eye Health Strategy. Supported by WHO, the Ministry of Health convened a three-day national workshop in the capital city, Malé, from 14 to 16 July, bringing together a wide range of stakeholders to shape a forward-looking plan for equitable and integrated eye care services across the country.",
          "The Honourable Minister of Health, Mr Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim, officially inaugurated the workshop, underscoring the critical role of vision in overall health and well-being. “Good vision plays a key role in staying healthy,” he noted. “Through SPECS 2030, we will strengthen our services so that no one in the Maldives is left behind in terms of access to eye care.”",
          "“The launch of WHO’s SPECS 2030 initiative in the Maldives marks a pivotal step toward achieving universal access to quality eye care,” said Ms Payden, WHO Representative to the Maldives. “Through strengthened training, greater public awareness, and enhanced service delivery, we can reduce the burden of vision impairment and bring life-changing care closer to communities.” The opening session featured a global overview of eye health presented by Mitasha Yu, Consultant on Vision and Eye Care at WHO Headquarters, followed by remarks from distinguished guests, including Ms Payden, WHO Representative to the Maldives. The event marked the official introduction of SPECS 2030 in the country, aligning national efforts with the WHO South-East Asia Regional Action Plan on Integrated People-Centred Eye Care (2022–2030).",
          "The workshop gathered representatives from the Ministry of Health, the WHO country office, regional and headquarters experts, education professionals, private sector stakeholders, and international partners, including the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB). The aim was to co-develop a comprehensive national strategy to ensure accessible, affordable, and high-quality eye care services for all by 2030. Moving from ideas to action The first day of the workshop focused on understanding the current landscape of eye health. Sessions covered how global, regional, and local contexts shape this field. Partners, such as the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB), shared insights about how other countries have attempted to integrate and expand eye care services. Group activities provided participants with an opportunity to review available data, determine priorities, and identify the Maldives' most pressing eye care needs. The inclusion of private sector perspectives in these discussions marked a new step for national eye care planning in the country. On the second day, the emphasis shifted to building a theory of change. They built \"problem trees\" to map out root causes, identify solutions, determine stakeholders, and pinpoint potential barriers to progress. This teamwork helped shape a shared vision and mission to guide the Maldives Eye Health Strategy 2030. During the last day, they turned priorities into clear plans of action. The groups set specific objectives, chose key activities, and put together a framework to monitor progress using global WHO indicators. The workshop concluded with participants sharing reflections, committing to next steps, and reaffirming their dedication to achieving universal access to eye care services. A vision for 2030 By the time the workshop concluded, stakeholders had shaped a draft plan for the nation's eye health strategy. This plan recognizes the Maldives’ specific needs while aligning with global efforts to prevent preventable vision problems. The Maldives Eye Health Strategy 2030 outlines a plan to integrate patient-focused eye care into the country's healthcare system. It aims to address issues such as refractive errors and ensure that everyone can afford and access eye care services. “The Maldives is ready to rethink and strengthen its eye care system,” said Fathimath Hudha, WHO National Professional Officer in the Maldives. “This strategy is more than just words; it acts as a guide to improve vision health throughout the islands.” As the Maldives embarks on its new path, the promises outlined during the SPECS 2030 launch will shape the nation’s journey to ensure that everyone gains access to healthy eyesight. This will help improve learning, job opportunities, and overall living standards for everyone. Photos: WHO / Mitasha Yu."

          "Training sessions on Go.Data for health professionals from various states of Brazil to support the response to outbreaks and health emergencies [2022]. © Pan American Health Organization, Brazil.",
          "Brazil, a vast country covering approximately 8.5 million km², is divided into 27 states and 5570 municipalities across five regions: North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South. These regions are home to about 212 million people. Given this extensive territory, implementing new technologies and innovations to ensure quality healthcare access throughout the country is a significant challenge.",
          "The COVID-19 pandemic exposed several gaps in the public health system, particularly the need for an effective contact tracing strategy. In Brazil, there were no specific tools available for this purpose, prompting many localities to rely on monitoring spreadsheets or develop their own strategies.",
          "In response, the first implementations of the Go.Data tool began in August 2021. Developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with partners at the Global Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Go.Data is a software designed to support outbreak response, particularly contact tracing efforts. It enables users to identify exposed individuals, monitor their health status, and visualize transmission chains. Two municipalities stood out in their use of the tool, applying it to investigate contacts in various situations, including within educational institutions. In these instances, more than 30 000 contacts were recorded. The implementation of the tool facilitated standardized contact tracing, allowing multiple professionals to collaborate concurrently. Furthermore, it supported the real-time creation of transmission chains, thereby offering crucial support in informed decision-making.",
          "Following the success of various initiatives and the emergence of mpox in Brazil in 2022, efforts were made to implement state-level servers with support from the National Council of Health Secretaries. As a result, approximately 15 states installed the tool within their infrastructures, expanding its use across different contexts. Subsequently, the Ministry of Health also adopted the tool, integrating it into its infrastructure while complying with all necessary security protocols and requirements. This marked a significant milestone for Brazil, enabling all states to access the tool.",
          "In 2023, once the server was established at the Ministry of Health, Go.Data was utilized to monitor individuals exposed to animals with avian influenza. During this process, a centralized server was recommended to consolidate information, allowing 15 states to access the same server. This model represented progress in hierarchical access management and the geographic distribution of information, thereby strengthening epidemiological surveillance in the country.",
          "Building on this experience, since 2024, the Ministry of Health, in partnership with the states, has been working to structure the national adoption of the tool in the context of measles and other diseases. To support this effort, two focal points have been trained in each state to ensure a timely response to epidemiological investigations in November 2023 by Pan American Health Organization (WHO Regional Office for the Americas or PAHO) and the Ministry of Health.",
          "Epidemiology team from the state of Rio de Janeiro using Go.Data in response to an outbreak [2025]. © Pan American Health Organization, Brazil.",
          "The implementation of Go.Data has streamlined contact investigations by providing a single online platform with regional access permissions, which enhances tracking and monitoring efforts. Brazil has successfully integrated this tool into its official case notification system, ensuring alignment with national guidelines. Furthermore, Go.Data is equipped with integrations for Power BI and Shiny, which improve data analysis and visualization capabilities. The development of guides and training courses focused on operational procedures has standardized processes and strengthened user competencies.",
          "Felipe Lopes Vasconcelos, a national consultant for PAHO, reflects on the tool's progress in the country. \"We had the opportunity to understand the various realities at the state level in Brazil. Before introducing Go.Data, contact tracing was slow and lacked standardization. Today, we have already seen significant advances at different levels, and I believe we are moving toward a more timely response to outbreaks,\" Felipe says.",
          "The technical support provided by the WHO has been crucial in this process. Since 2020, the WHO team has offered continuous assistance, addressing all questions, needs, and suggestions from Brazil, which has contributed to the tool's development over the years."

          "Mrs Nifouth Al-Bahar didn’t simply start a job when she entered nursing; she pursued a purpose. With a strong desire to heal others and make a genuine difference in patients’ lives, she didn’t just join the field of nursing; she helped redefine it.",
          "A graduate of Princess Mona College of Nursing Nifouth joined Jordan’s Royal Medical Services determined to make a difference in the lives of patients and the future of healthcare in her country. That determination would eventually position her as one of Jordan's most respected and pioneering ophthalmic nurses.",
          "From the start, Nifouth was drawn to the world of eye surgery.  The precision and transformation it could bring to someone’s life. Her skills earned her a place in a historic moment—she became one of the first female military ophthalmic nurses to assist in Jordan’s first-ever corneal graft surgery. “It was a big step forward in ophthalmology here,” she says. “I worked alongside the top doctors in the country on important surgeries, and people began seeing me as one of the leading experts in this field.”",
          "Her passion for achieving high standards continued to grow. Nifouth received training in advanced skills, including retinal detachment and vitrectomy surgery, at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, a respected institution. She later introduced these pioneering surgeries to the Royal Medical Services in Jordan, making these treatments available there for the first time.",
          "Her career spanned both the military and private sectors over the years. While serving as Director of operating rooms, she focused on supporting and guiding others. \"I shared the key details nurses needed to improve, and I always made sure to acknowledge their efforts—this boosted their self-esteem and helped them excel,\" she explained.",
          "\"An ophthalmic nurse does much more than assist in surgery,\" she explains. \"We help patients prepare, support them as they heal, and teach them how to take care of themselves after treatment.\"",
          "She has aimed to raise awareness about eye health in the community. \"People must learn ways to protect their eyes at work, for instance, like wearing safety eyeglasses while farming, and why sticking to treatment plans matters,\" she shares. \"We also need to spread more knowledge about the importance of cornea donations.\"",
          "Although she has achieved a great deal, she acknowledges that people in Jordan continue to struggle to access eye care. The high cost of eye care services, travel difficulties, and the sheer number of patients in cities make it challenging to access proper care.",

From policy-making to clinical settings and community services, this compendium outlines actionable steps to uphold the rights, needs and preferences of women, newborns, parents and families.",

          "A: I recall a situation from early 2018, when I was working on a donor-funded maternal, newborn and child health project in a government health facility in one of our states in Nigeria. During our visit, I discovered that a woman who had given birth just the day before was detained in the facility because she couldn’t afford to pay for the birth and her overnight stay. The staff had been unable to contact her husband or any relatives, and as a result, she was not allowed to go home.",
          "Before leaving, I spoke with the matron in charge. She explained the situation and told me that, unfortunately, this was a regular occurrence. However, she also shared something hopeful: she had recently attended a training on respectful maternity care and was now determined to address this issue with the management of the health facility. Motivated by what she had learned, she had already begun discussions with management to explore more respectful approaches to find solutions.",
          "When I followed up the next day, I was relieved to learn that the woman had been discharged. Even more promising was that the matron was actively working with facility leadership to introduce more respectful policies that took into account the stress this could have on women."

          "A: Over the years, I’ve been deeply involved in building the capacity of health workers across various aspects of maternal, newborn and child health care. This includes participating in supportive supervision of health facilities and staff. One of the most persistent challenges I’ve encountered is changing attitudes among health workers, particularly towards pregnant women who may have lower levels of education or come from lower socio-economic backgrounds.",
          "These biases that health workers may have can be difficult to shift, but it’s important to understand that they don’t exist in isolation. Often, the root causes of mistreatment lie in the broader working environment, including the policy structures. Health workers themselves are frequently under pressure, facing systemic issues that shape how they engage with women and newborns.",
          "Achieving respectful care, therefore, requires more than individual behaviour change; it demands a multi-faceted focus on ensuring a supportive policy environment, addressing power and gender hierarchies, and promoting a health system environment that ensures access to quality commodities and infrastructure so health workers are able to provide high quality and respectful maternal and newborn care."

Integrating respect and dignity into care requires intentional action at every level of the health system. Whether you are a health worker, programme manager or policy-maker, this compendium offers practical tools to help every woman and newborn receive care that respects their rights and promotes a positive experience of care."

          "“We capitalized on lessons learned from previous experiences, which allowed for a more effective and sustainable approach. Joint work with local actors and the incorporation of intercultural dialogue and community-based health care were essential in closing historical access gaps. Furthermore, the implementation of intersectoral work reinforces the positive impact of this cooperation. This experience confirms that international collaboration, aligned with national priorities, can generate real and lasting transformations in health systems,” Dr Haydee Padilla concluded.",
          "The UHC Partnership operates in over 125 countries, representing over 3 billion people. It is supported and funded by Belgium, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Japan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and WHO."

To support countries in reaching this global target, the World \r\nHealth Organization (WHO) has developed a package of quantitative and \r\nqualitative resources - the Behavioural and Social Drivers of Influenza \r\nVaccination ( referred to as the BeSD IN).",

          "To ensure applicability \r\nacross regions and contexts, WHO, with partners including the Task Force\r\n for Global Health, and national focal points, field-tested the BeSD IN \r\npackage in Argentina, Jordan and South Africa in 2023. Additional \r\ncountries, including Australia and Spain, have recently used the BeSD IN\r\n resources to gather and use local data to improve their influenza \r\nvaccination programmes. With support from the PIP Framework, Jordan \r\nrecently published its findings in Vaccine: X ,\r\n highlighting pragmatic actions that the Ministry of Health and health \r\nfacilities can take to enhance influenza vaccine uptake. These include \r\ntargeted public health campaigns to correct misconceptions, especially \r\namong the elderly and pregnant women; improving accessibility by \r\norganizing mobile clinics; offering subsidized vaccines; and giving \r\nhealthcare providers the necessary training to respond to hesitancy \r\namong the priority groups. In 2024, Argentina conducted a BeSD survey \r\namong pregnant women, focusing on the drivers of and barriers to \r\ninfluenza, COVID-19, and RSV vaccination. Results of this study will be \r\nused to tailor interventions to improve coverage in this group.",

          "Bhutan has initiated a significant plan to enhance eye care for all. This process began with a three-day workshop in Paro from 1 to 3 July 2025. During the event, Bhutan unveiled SPECS 2030. The Ministry of Health is spearheading this initiative with support from the World Health Organization (WHO). The workshop brought together over 60 individuals from various sectors. These included health workers, representatives from religious group, teachers, persons with disabilities, NGOs such as the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) and Cure Blindness Project, government officials and WHO representatives. Over the course of three days, the group engaged in intensive discussions and planning. They aimed to identify the nation’s priorities, develop a shared vision, and establish goals to enhance Bhutan’s eye health system. “We want to make sure everyone in Bhutan can see well, get help on time, and live with dignity,” said Dr Dechen Wangmo, who leads the Eye Department at Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital. “This marks the beginning of creating a complete and inclusive strategy to improve eye health for the country.” The strategy will build on the results from the WHO Eye care situation analysis tool (ECSAT), which participants updated and reviewed during the meeting. This tool enables countries to assess their eye health systems and identify strengths and weaknesses in areas such as leadership, funding, workforce, data collection, service provision, and infrastructure. “Bhutan is setting an example that others can follow,” said Mitasha Yu, WHO HQ Consultant for Vision and Eye Care. “This evidence-based and community-driven process demonstrates how countries can reshape eye care systems to become more equitable and more inclusive.” “Integrated people-centred eye care is not just a policy goal—it is a public health imperative,” added Tashi Tobgay, WHO Regional Adviser for Disability, Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation. “Bhutan’s commitment to working across sectors to design solutions for the next generation sets a powerful example for other countries in the South-East Asia Region.” At the opening session, a community member shared a heartfelt personal story about regaining eyesight after prompt cataract surgery. This firsthand account emphasized the tangible impact that quality eye care can have. “Hearing how restored vision transforms someone’s life reminds us why this work is so important,” said Sonam Peldon, National Focal Point for Eye Health. “We aim to turn our shared vision into meaningful action.” The workshop achieved several essential outcomes: A refreshed analysis of the country’s eye health status Identification of main focus areas to address A draft vision, mission, and strategic goals to guide the Bhutan Eye Health Strategy 2030 Plans that outline primary objectives, activities, and a way to monitor progress.",
          "These outcomes will support the development of Bhutan’s national eye health strategy, which is expected to be completed later this year. This represents significant progress in Bhutan's efforts to achieve universal health coverage aligned with the WHO World Report on Vision and global efforts to promote integrated and people-centred eye care. “This goes beyond being a health project; it’s a movement to include everyone, educate communities, and drive social change,” said Pema Lethro, the National Professional Officer for Noncommunicable diseases, WASH and Environment Health Programmes at the WHO Bhutan country office, who moderated the workshop. “By 2030, we picture a Bhutan where preventable vision loss no longer excludes anyone.” Photo: WHO/ Mitasha Yu"

As one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, Vanuatu requires resilient, adaptable health systems to respond to public health emergencies quickly and effectively.",
          "To strengthen its outbreak response, the Ministry of Health adopted Go.Data, a tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with GOARN partners, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially deployed in January 2022 to support COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing, Go.Data has since been expanded to cover measles, leptospirosis, tuberculosis, and yaws due to its usability and flexibility. This expansion reflects a strategic shift from reactive, one-off emergency use to an integrated digital surveillance platform embedded within Vanuatu’s broader public health infrastructure.",
          "Before Go.Data, disease surveillance relied heavily on manual reporting, ad hoc spreadsheets and fragmented communication. Health workers, especially in remote provinces, found it difficult to coordinate and respond effectively. Limited radio and mobile phone coverage further delayed case investigations and contact follow-ups. These constraints placed already vulnerable populations at greater risk during disease outbreaks.",
          "Recognizing the need for a flexible, offline-capable digital solution, the Ministry of Health implemented Go.Data with support from WHO. Go.Data was introduced to meet this need, offering a way to digitize and streamline field investigation, contact management and data-driven decision-making during outbreaks. Its integration into the Ministry’s core public health system, DHIS2, now ensures that outbreak intelligence is part of the national health surveillance and public health reporting system.",
          "Implementation included training provincial health surveillance teams, Health Information System (HIS) officers, and public health staff. The rollout prioritized capacity building, with follow-up mentoring and field-based support from the HIS team to ensure sustainability. One of the most transformative features has been Go.Data’s offline functionality, enabling field teams to continue working even in areas with no internet connectivity.",
          "Community outreach campaign in Tanna Island,  Vanuatu © WHO / Aya Yajima",
          "Go.Data has significantly improved the country’s ability to detect and respond to outbreaks swiftly. It has supported faster containment, more precise mapping of transmission chains, and better public health messaging. Rachel Takoar, the HIS Manager at the Ministry of Health reflected, “Before Go.Data, we relied on phone calls and paper notes. Now, we can see the spread clearly, act quickly, and help protect our communities.”",
          "Today, Go.Data continues to be a cornerstone of Vanuatu’s digital health system. Aligned with the Digital Health Strategy 2025–2030, the Ministry of Health is advancing efforts to expand the use of Go.Data through continuous training to health and non-health actors; the refinement of standard operating procedures for multi-disease outbreak response; integration with the National Laboratory Information System; and the exploration of its role in climate-sensitive disease surveillance and integrated One Health initiatives. These efforts reflect a strong commitment to building a more resilient, data-driven public health system capable of responding to both current and emerging health threats.",
          "Key lessons from implementation underscore the importance of contextual adaptation, sustained capacity-building and continuous learning. Vanuatu’s experience illustrates how digital tools, when effectively implemented, can strengthen public health systems, enhance epidemic preparedness and safeguard communities during times of crisis."

          "For the past 10 years, Edith Chávez has been a dedicated advocate for older adults in Lima, Peru, through her work with the social assistance programme, Pensión 65—a Peruvian government programme that provides financial support and social services to seniors living in poverty. She is passionate about this programme because of the meaningful difference it makes in the lives of those whose needs are often overlooked. Based in the district of Comas, where more than 2,600 seniors are enrolled in the programme, Edith has become a trusted presence in the communities she serves. One of her key roles is promoting Pensión 65’s eye health and wellness campaigns through the Para Verte Mejor (“To See You Better”) programme, which offers free vision screenings and near-vision eyeglasses to Pensión 65’ s older adults. Most adults’ near vision begins to deteriorate as they age, a condition known as presbyopia. The most common cause of vision impairment globally, affecting 826 million people, presbyopia is easily corrected with a pair of near-vision eyeglasses.",
          "Over the past three years, Edith has helped organize and support more than 70 vision screening events in the Lima area, bringing clearer vision—and renewed independence—to hundreds of seniors. These campaigns are essential, she says, because many older adults simply cannot afford to visit an eye doctor or purchase eyeglasses.",
          "“With Pensión 65, these reading glasses are free,” Edith says proudly. For her, the Para Verte Mejor programme is about more than dispensing near-vision eyeglasses—it is about restoring dignity and enhancing the quality of life through improving self-sufficiency and productivity. The seniors that she serves tell her so. “With these eyeglasses, I can see better,” one said. “They help me to read, write, and do things that I couldn’t do before.”",
          "Para Verte Mejor delivers vision screening and near-vision eyeglasses across the country. The initiative is a partnership between the National Solidarity Assistance Programme of the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion, Pensión65, and Management Sciences for Health (MSH)-Perú, a local NGO, with the support of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and RestoringVision, the global nonprofit dedicated to tackling the challenges of presbyopia. RestoringVision partners with MSH-Perú to provide high-quality near-vision eyeglasses and technical support. Locally, MSH-Perú collaborates with Pensión 65 and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to implement vision screening and eyeglasses campaigns. To date, this partnership has given the gift of clear sight to more than 328,000 Pensión 65 beneficiaries across Peru.",
          "In Lima, the numbers do not matter to Edith; what matters is the satisfaction she gets from helping each person. “It is support that gives them visual clarity, and therefore, a better life,” she says. “I feel happy. I enjoy my work with Pensión 65.”",
          "Presbyopia is a frequent eyesight issue tied to aging that starts after you hit 40. It makes focusing on things up close hard, which can turn activities like reading, threading needles, or spotting small details into a challenge. It’s not an illness; it happens as the lens in the eye becomes less flexible with age. The most cost-effective treatment for presbyopia is eyeglasses. Since presbyopia happens with age, you can't stop it from occurring. Regular eye checkups help to detect it and avoid its effects.",

          "In 2017, Dr Mohamed Abdukadir Kalif made a decision that surprised many: after completing his optometry studies in Pakistan, he returned home to Somalia — a country grappling with insecurity, fragile infrastructure and chronic underinvestment in healthcare. He could have pursued a comfortable career in the Gulf but instead chose to go where help was needed most. “I wanted to make real change where it was needed most,” he says simply.",
          "Based in Mogadishu, Dr Kalif leads a life of tireless dedication. Each afternoon, he treats patients in his private clinic, offering essential eye care in a setting where such services are scarce. He also teaches at the only optometry faculty in southern and central Somalia—home to the majority of the country’s population.",
          "In addition, he is the Project Manager of Charity Vision Somalia, overseeing the country’s first free comprehensive vision eye care center. And every Friday, he travels 30 kilometers outside the capital to run eye camps, providing checkups for villages who, in many cases, have never had their eyes examined in their lives. Dr Kalif’s commitment is deeply personal. In the early 2000s, his grandmother was left aphakic (the condition of having no lens in the eye) after undergoing cataract surgeryand forced to rely on thick  +10.00 diopter that left bruises on her face. \"Her glasses were so heavy they left painful marks on her nose,\" Mohamed recalls. \"I used to tell her that one day, I’d become an eye doctor and make things better for her.\" Although she passed away before he could finish his education, her struggle remains a powerful source of inspiration behind his misión to make eye care more accessible for everyone.",
          "Somalia lacks resources, and eye care does not receive much attention. But Mohamed refuses to let these challenges hold him back. Using simple tools and a single donated room in a voluntary hospital, he and his team treat over 100 patients every month for free. He focuses on creating solutions with what is on hand. \"You don’t need magic,you just need a system.\"",
          "Technology is helping him build that system. After discovering the WHOeyes app through LinkedIn—a free vision screening tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO)— Dr Kalif contacted WHO to translate the tool into Somali.",
          "Today, he encourages families to check their eyesight and identify early signs of vision impairment. He also collaborates with local health platforms to spread awareness and plans to promote the app through social media videos. “It is easy to use and very effective,” he explains. “In a country like Somalia where awareness is lacking, this app could change lives.”",
          "One of the biggest obstacles, he says, is a widespread lack of knowledge. Many parents and teachers don’t realize that children might be struggling with their vision. Over the years, Dr Kalif has screened hundreds of schoolchildren and discovered preventable conditions going unnoticed. He recalls a 17-year-old girl who lived with blurred vision in one eye her whole life. “She told me, ‘I thought everyone’s left eye was like this,’” he says. “When she smiled after getting her glasses, that’s the moment that keeps me motivated.\"",
          "But Dr. Kalif’s ambition reaches beyond individuals—he is focused on transforming the entire system.  He played a key role in setting up Somalia’s first optometry training program, which celebrated its first group of graduates in 2024. He is also teaming up with the National eye health coordinator of the Ministry of Health and the WHO country office in Somalia to complete the first ECSAT (Eye care situation analysis tool) and prepare a national eye health strategy.

          "Today, more than one billion people, about one in eight globally, are on the move, driven by war, conflict, disasters, environmental degradation or economic instability. Migration and displacement are powerful social determinants of health, shaping how and whether people can access the health conditions they need to survive and thrive.",
          "Climate change, recognized as a \"threat multiplier\", worsens food insecurity, disrupts livelihoods, and fuels further displacement. Whether by choice or forced, being on the move is a part of human life, but for many, it brings disproportionate exposure to risk, inequality, and exclusion from basic health services.",
          "Refugees, migrants, and internally displaced persons (IDPs) frequently face unsafe journeys and precarious living conditions, often with limited access to clean water, adequate nutrition, sanitation, or shelter. Their susceptibility to communicable diseases is increased by the environmental risk factors related to their precarious living and working conditions. Many also face barriers to managing noncommunicable diseases, accessing maternal and newborn care, or receiving mental health support.",
          "Thanks to the support of donors and partners, WHO works with governments and communities to deliver inclusive, equitable, and context-sensitive health services to people on the move. This includes immunization, disease surveillance, chronic disease management, reproductive and mental health care, support for health system resilience, amongst other efforts.",
          "These contributions are grounded in the recognition that health is a human right, and that universal health coverage must be inclusive of all people, regardless of migratory status. The stories presented below show how rapid, compassionate action can protect lives and advance dignity, equity, and resilience, especially in times of crisis."

The provinces of Tanganyika, Haut-Katanga, Sud-Kivu, Maniema, and Tshopo are among the most affected.

It commemorates the day in 1990 when the World Health Assembly stopped classifying homosexuality as a mental disorder.",
          "Stigma and discrimination persist as powerful barriers to health access for LGBTQ+ people. This is especially harmful in the context of access to HIV and STI services, where fear of judgement or mistreatment can delay, or even prevent, individuals from seeking testing, treatment, and support. In several countries of the Asia-Pacific region, including the Philippines, these barriers have contributed to rising rates of HIV and other STIs, particularly among young key populations who are least likely to access services despite having the greatest need.",

Some of these clinics are certified by the Department of Health and are included in the health insurance system, becoming an integral part of the national health system.",

We learn how to address both – without shutting down their stories or identities.”",
          "Through partnerships with hospitals, private and community-run clinics, and the Department of Health, LoveYourself trains health professionals on topics such as sexual health, transgender care, and mental well-being. These sessions integrate conversations about stigma and discrimination, which are often overlooked in formal medical training. The organization also supports the development of HIV workplace policies and public health messaging and more recently has also focused on mpox prevention.",

          "In Tamil Nadu’s village streets where medical care often feels out of reach, Muthuramalingam now 67, has dedicated nearly to fifty years bringing vision to the underserved. His journey began in 1977, with a random encounter that turned into a lifelong mission — restoring sight, one pair of eyeglasses, one child, one elderly villager at a time. What started as a simple act of kindness grew into a lifelong pursuit, transforming thousands of lives across rural India.",
          "“I thought I’d just end up as a postmaster in my hometown,” says Muthuramalingam with a soft chuckle. “But life had other plans”.",
          "It all began at a Lions Club eye camp, where Muthuramalingam got involved in helping as a volunteer. He had no medical training, only a strong desire to help. His dedication caught the attention of visiting doctors and trainers who saw potential in him. Encouraged by their support, he began learning about eye care and refraction—planting the seeds of what would become his life’s mission. That  decision changed his life and brought hope to countless others. Armed with simple tools and a firm resolve, Muthuramalingam rode his bicycle from one village to another, transforming school verandas and shaded spots beneath trees into makeshift clinics. His goal was clear: to  restore sight to those overlooked by regular healthcare. “Eye care is not just treating vision,” he says. “It is giving people a whole new life.” Over  the years, he witnessed  community eye care evolve – from humble beginnings with basic tools to well-equipped camps with trained teams and  modern facilities. Still, the heart of the work stayed focused on reaching  people who needed help the most. One of Muthuramalingam’s most cherished memeories comes from a school screening in Melur, a town near Madurai. There, he met  a 12-year-old boy who  struggled  in school and  appeared withdrawn. The reason: a severe refractive error. “Once he started wearing eyeglasses, he became one of the best students in his class,” Muthuramalingam recalls with pride in his voice. “That single pair of eyeglasses completely changed his path in life.” Muthuramalingam estimates that over his decades-long  career, he has screened and treated tens of thousands across Tamil Nadu. From Madurai to Salem, Erode to Coimbatore, he has travelled tirelessly, village by village, ensuring that no one is left in the dark. The journey has not been easy – marked by cultural barriers, grueling travel. and constant exhaustion. Yet, the community trust and the visible impact keep him going. “Back then, we handled everything—planning, counseling, and eye exams. Now there’s support, but the mission  remains the same,” he says. Muthuramalingam still organizes school screenings and guides families through care. What motivates him to keep going? “A child smiling after seeing for the first time. That’s all I need,” he says. As India grapples with rising  preventable vision problems, his journey highlights the crucial role of  grassroots health workers . “We can’t sit back and wait for people to come to the hospitals,” he explains. “We have to reach them. That’s how we build stronger, healthier communities .” In a time  when most step back from work, Muthuramalingam refuses to slow down. “The body might feel its age,” he says, “but the spirit should never get tired.” Community health workers (CHWs) are health care providers who live in the communities they serve and typically receive less formal education and training than professional health care workers such as nurses and doctors. They provide health education and referrals for a wide range of services, and support individuals, families, and communities with preventive health measures and access to appropriate curative and social services. CHWs act as a vital bridge between health, social, and community services and populations that may have difficulty accessing care. This human resource group has enormous potential to extend health care services to vulnerable populations, such as communities living in remote areas and historically marginalized groups, to meet unmet health needs in a culturally appropriate manner, improve access to services, address inequities in health status, and improve health system performance and efficiency. This story was developed based on an interview conducted and photographed by Aravind Eye Foundation."

          "Jane Waithera's childhood memories in a Kenyan village lack clarity because good vision was a luxury few could afford. Today, she holds a Master's degree in Organizational Development. Her journey from a struggling student to a successful professional demonstrates the profound impact that something as basic as a pair of eyeglasses can have on a person’s life.",
          "Growing up, Jane remembers the daily struggle of trying to see the blackboard at school. She often had to hold her book just inches from her face to read, drawing ridicule from classmates and reprimands from teachers who mistook her poor eyesight for a lack of effort.",
          "In Jane’s village, residents lacked access to eye care. When she was ten, a mobile eye clinic visited her village—and everything changed. “That was the first time someone told my grandmother that I needed eyeglasses,” she recalls. Yet while the diagnosis brought clarity, it also marked the beginning of a new set of challenges. At the time, Jane and her family were struggling to make ends meet—putting food on the table was the priority, and eyeglasses were out of reach. “The hospital later ran a low vision programme, and they provided me with my first pair of eyeglasses,” she recalls. That small intervention changed everything. “I would never have stayed in school. I wouldn’t be the person I am today.” Today, Jane is a champion for expanding access to vision correction services and affordable eyeglasses, particularly in underserved communities. She firmly believes that “every child, no matter where they are born, should have access to basic eye screenings and the optical devices they need.” When asked about the most urgent improvements needed today, Jane is clear: “Ensuring universal access to eyeglasses will boost people’s confidence and productivity—and it has a direct impact on the global economy,” she says. With so many individuals in need of vision correction, she warns that failing to address the issue amounts to a massive loss of human potential. Jane emphasizes that eyeglasses do more than support learning or job performance—they also contribute to a person’s sense of pride and dignity in everyday life. “Sundays are for family, caring for the kids, cooking, and cleaning. There’s no extra time for doctor visits,” she explains. “But when your vision is blurry, everything becomes harder. The things you want to do just don’t get done.” For Jane, the message is simple: access to a basic pair of eyeglasses can unlock opportunities for education, employment, and self-confidence. The impact, she says, extends far beyond the individual—transforming families and entire communities. Myopia or shortsightedness is a condition where distant objects appear blurry, while close objects are seen clearly. It often begins in childhood and can worsen over time. Eyeglasses are the most effective, affordable, and immediate solution for correcting myopia. Other treatments include contact lenses or surgery. While myopia can't always be prevented, early detection through regular eye exams can reduce its impact. Spending more time outside and cutting back on screens as a kid might slow it down. In underserved communities, cost and availability of eye care services allow for early diagnosis and treatment. Outreach eye clinics and low-vision programmes, like the one Jane used, help bring care to families in need in remote or lower-income areas. This story was developed based on an interview conducted and photographed by Light for the World."

          "Amid the constant hum of sewing machines in a garment factory in Viet Nam’s Binh Duong Province, Nguyen Thi Trang deftly threads a needle—something she now does with far more ease than just a few years ago. A veteran employee at Domex Factory, Trang has spent over two decades on the sewing line, accustomed to long shifts and meticulous work. But when her eyesight began to deteriorate, even the most routine tasks became a challenge.",
          "As she sits by a collection of newly sewn garments, Trang recalls the moment she realized something was wrong. “Focusing got hard,” she says. “I started making mistakes when working with dark fabrics. At home, I couldn’t read the labels on my children’s medicine or help them with their homework.”",
          "Trang, 43, is one of millions dealing with presbyopia—a common age-related condition that affects near vision and typically begins to surface in individuals around 40 years of age. Like many living in low-income communities, Trang was unaware her eyesight was deteriorating. With three children to care for and only one day off work each week, scheduling an eye exam was out of reach both financially and logistically.",
          "That changed when VisionSpring partnered with local health workers to bring on-site eye screenings directly to Trang’s workplace. The initiative was part of the “Clear Vision Workplaces” project, aimed at improving eye health among low-income workers. During the visit, Trang was diagnosed with presbyopia and received her first pair of eyeglasses. She laughs as she recalls her first experience wearing glasses. “At first, they made me feel dizzy,” Trang recalls. “But then everything came into focus. It felt like I had a brand-new pair of eyes.” The impact was immediate. Trang’s productivity at work improved noticeably, and at home, she was once again able to read bedtime stories and help her children with their schoolwork—small routines she had deeply missed. Perhaps most meaningful of all was her children’s reaction. “They told me I looked prettier wearing glasses,” she says with a smile.",
          "Trang’s experience is far from unique. More than a billion people worldwide live with vision problems that are either preventable or easily treatable. In many cases, all that’s needed is a simple eye exam and a pair of eyeglasses. Yet for countless individuals like Trang, accessing even these basic services can feel as out of reach as the stars.",
          "“Eyeglasses are expensive, and workers like us simply can’t afford them,” Trang explains. “Without support, we just keep working—until we no longer can.”",
          "For factory workers, precision is everything. When vision falters, so does job security—often leaving workers with a difficult choice between struggling through or losing their livelihood. Trang believes that access to basic eye care should be a fundamental right, not a luxury.",
          "Trang’s call for action is well-founded. Experts agree that both companies and governments must do more to prioritize vision care—by providing regular eye screenings and educating workers on the importance of maintaining their eye health. When Trang speaks to those in positions of authority, her message is simple: clear vision transforms both work and daily life. “It’s not just about being able to see,” she says. “It’s about dignity.” It’s remarkable how simple solutions can have such a profound impact. In many cases, providing someone with a properly fitted pair of eyeglasses is enough to transform their lives. Presbyopia is a frequent eyesight issue tied to aging that starts after you hit 40. It makes focusing on things up close hard, which can turn activities like reading, threading needles, or spotting small details into a challenge. It’s not an illness; it happens as the lens in the eye becomes less flexible with age. The most cost-effective treatment for presbyopia is eyeglasses. Since presbyopia happens with age, you can't stop it from occurring. Regular eye checkups help to detect it and avoid its effects. Trang and many other low-income workers often miss out on access because of cost, busy schedules, and lack of awareness. Programmes such as VisionSpring’s \"Clear Vision Workplaces\" can close this gap by bringing care right to these communities.",

          "Bangladesh takes steps to strengthen MHPSS preparedness through inter-agency training, preparedness assessment, and stakeholder engagement.",
          "In May 2024, WHO Member States adopted a new resolution emphasizing the critical importance of \" Strengthening mental health and psychosocial support before, during and after armed conflicts, natural and human-caused disasters, and health and other emergencies.” Bangladesh, which hosts  over 1.1 million Rohingya refugees and faces increasingly severe monsoon seasons, recurring infectious disease outbreaks and ongoing social and political challenges, has taken significant steps to act on this resolution and integrate mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) into efforts to reduce and manage disaster risks. In a country where more than 3 out of 4 people live in areas at-risk of natural hazards, this integration is increasingly recognised as a fundamental public health priority that strengthens overall resilience and response capabilities.",
          "In December 2024, the WHO Country Office for Bangladesh, in collaboration with the Government of Bangladesh and UNHCR, led a series of national MHPSS preparedness activities—marking a milestone in advancing the integration of MHPSS within disaster risk management, enhancing preparedness for more effective emergency response.",
          "Training for MHPSS Preparedness: Building National Capacity",
          "From 2–4 December, WHO and UNHCR co-organized a three-day inter-agency workshop in Cox’s Bazar focused on operationalizing MHPSS preparedness as part of disaster risk management. This workshop was part of broader efforts under the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health (SIMH) to expand sustainable mental health services in Bangladesh. More than 50 participants from across government and the humanitarian and development sectors joined the workshop. The MHPSS Ready training package aims to strengthen the capacity to manage risks to mental health and ensure timely and effective mental health and psychosocial support before, during and after emergencies.",
          "To further support implementation, WHO and partners piloted the forthcoming MHPSS Preparedness Assessment Toolkit, using the toolkit’s capacity checklist to assess MHPSS readiness in SIMH-supported districts and in Cox’s Bazar refugee camps. To further assess readiness, two community risks and capacities focus group discussions were held in Cox's Bazar to gather feedback from adults living in the refugee camps. Visits to health centres and community discussions further enriched findings, with more district-level assessments planned for 2025.",
          "Building on these activities,, a national stakeholder workshop on MHPSS preparedness was also held on 10 December in Dhaka. The workshop brought together representatives from the National Institute of Mental Health, NGOs, and UN agencies to define key challenges and next steps. Among the priorities identified were expanding community-based mental health systems, strengthening multisectoral coordination, and embedding MHPSS within national emergency and disaster management planning and structures.",
          "These initial steps mark important progress in strengthening MHPSS preparedness in Bangladesh. Through investment in coordination, capacity, and data, the country is moving toward more resilient systems. Strengthening MHPSS is  essential to protecting population well-being during emergencies, and boosting universal health coverage",

          "In February 2025, stakeholders from across the eye health sector in Laos were convened in Vientiane for a two-day event titled the Laos Eye Care System Situation Analysis and Systems Leadership Workshop. Meeting participants included Ministry of Health officials, World Health Organization (WHO) representatives, the Laos Eye Care Working Group (LECWG), the International Agency for Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) and local partners. The key objective of the event was to shape the road map for an updated National Eye Health Strategy.",
          "This event kicked off the official launch of the  \"WHO Eye Care Situation Analysis Tool\" (ECSAT) findings report in Laos. This tool is designed to evaluate the state of eye care services, identify systemic gaps, and inform national planning efforts in line with global eye health targets.",
          "Dr Fabrizio D’Esposito, the Western Pacific's IAPB Regional Head, stressed the importance of this work: “The ECSAT workshop in Laos is a critical step in strengthening evidence-based planning for eye health in the region. By bringing together key stakeholders to reflect on the findings, we’ve laid the groundwork for a National Strategic Plan for Eye Health that is rooted in local data, aligned with health system priorities, and responsive to the needs of the population. The ECSAT has proven to be a valuable tool in identifying system strengths and gaps, and in guiding a clear path forward for action.”",
          "During the course of the two-day meeting, participants engaged in breakout sessions to discuss the key results from the ECSAT and to identify opportunities to inform strategic planning for the future. Engaging local actors in systems leadership was a key goal of the workshop to ensure that any approaches developed to tackle systemic obstacles to eye care delivery were jointly created.",
          "The event also put a spotlight on insights shared by the Fred Hollows Foundation on Cambodia’s eye care reform journey, offering lessons learned for overcoming systemic challenges.",
          "The results of this meeting will shape the development of the \"2025 National Eye Health Strategic Plan\" which aims to be in line with WHO's \"Integrated People-Centred Eye Care\" (IPEC) approach and the UN's call to action, \"Vision for Everyone.\" As the Vientiane workshop concluded, the next steps begin. With strengthened collaboration and shared objectives, Laos aims to improve access to affordable and quality eye care services across the country.",

          "Last November, Thailand took a major step forward to overhaul its national eye health. National leaders launched the “WHO SPECS 2030 initiative” to ensure that everyone who needs a refractive error intervention has access to quality, affordable and people-centred refractive error services. The event brought together leading doctors, decision-makers, teachers, and NGOs. Together, they forged a daring strategy to tackle uncorrected refractive errors by 2030.",
          "Kicking off the event, Dr Warapat Wongsawad, the head of the Thai Public Health Ophthalmology Society, and Professor Dr Wanicha Chuenkongkaew, who leads the Royal College of Ophthalmologists of Thailand, provided opening remarks. Dr Andreas Mueller from WHO then delivered a keynote highlighting the importance of addressing refractive errors.",
          "“Refractive error isn’t just about health—it creates societal and economic barriers. With the WHO SPECS 2030 initiative, nations get a worldwide strategy to eliminate these barriers by creating lasting, all-in-one eye care solutions,” Dr Mueller explained in his main speech.",
          "Local progress and challenges",
          "In the morning, Thailand’s current efforts took the spotlight. Projects like “Good Sight for Thai Children” and strategies from the Ministry of Public Health were on display. Presentations highlighted both progress and persistent challenges, from service access disparities to integration hurdles across public and private sectors.",
          "Mr Udom Wongsing from the Office for Teacher and Education Institution Quality Development  illustrated how supporting children with vision impairment in the classroom is essential to building more equitable and inclusive societies.",
          "In the afternoon, everyone looked ahead to Thailand's upcoming strategy. They split into smaller teams to dive into the five SPECS 2030 pillars: S ervice design, P ersonnel development, public E ducation, C osting, S urveillance and research. Participants from a range of stakeholder groups put their heads together to discuss solid srategies to boost Thailand's eye health.",
          "Each working group shared its insights during a debrief session, emphasizing integrated solutions such as training multidisciplinary visual care teams, educating the public on eye health literacy, and developing robust data systems to monitor outcomes. Dr Kulawan Rojananuangnit pointed out that the seminar laid the foundation to put Thailand at the forefront of bringing WHO SPECS 2030 to life with solid practical shifts.",
          "Moving forward",
          "As everything wrapped up, the participants agreed on one thing: turn the insights from the get-together into a plan for the nation. People from the health, education, private and policy circles in Thailand are banding together feeling hopeful that their homeland might just show others in the region how to tackle vision issues head-on.",
          "Countries aim to hit the WHO's worldwide goal to lower wrong refractive errors by 40% by 2030. Thailand's initial push shows strong determination and true potential.",
          "During the launch week, both the Royal College of Ophthalmologists of Thailand and the Optometry Association of Thailand extended an invitation to Dr Andreas Mueller from WHO to present on SPECS 2030. Both professional bodies expressed strong interest in collaborating together with WHO to advance the initiative.",

          "The earth in Adıyaman, Türkiye, trembled violently on February 6, 2023. For 35-year-old Hamzanur Burak Kızıl, everything changed in an instant as buildings collapsed, and people died. He lived for 72 hours trapped beneath the debris, but at a terrible cost. When he was finally rescued his condition was critical. The road ahead seemed impossible. Hamza was rushed to Adıyaman Training and Research Hospital, where doctors fought to save his life, but unfortunately, both his legs and his left arm required amputation, and he had severe injuries to his remaining hand. The severity of his condition meant he was airlifted to Bilkent City Hospital in the capital city of Türkiye, Ankara, which contains a specialist rehabilitation center, where a multidisciplinary team from neurology, orthopedics, and intensive care units stabilized him. As he adjusted, a new, unbearable reality set in—his parents hadn’t survived the disaster. Grief and shock overwhelmed him. “I wasn’t fully aware of what had happened to me,” he recalled. “I thought my body was intact. I couldn't believe it when the doctor told me the truth.”",
          "Over 33 days in intensive care, he received not only medical treatment to stabilize him, but also began his journey of recovery, including profound emotional support from doctors and nurses who helped him cope with trauma and grief. For weeks, Hamza lay in a hospital bed, struggling to process everything. Then, in April, rehabilitation became his lifeline. He was the most severely injured among those who had limb damage at the hospital. Yet, within those walls , they formed friendships, and supported each other. At first, even sitting up felt impossible. But his therapists wouldn’t let him give up. “I will never forget my first physiotherapist, Nadide,” he said. “She told me to put in the effort, so I did. If they trained me for one hour, I trained myself for four.” His rehabilitation plan was intense—physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and strength training. Learning to use prosthetic limbs was gruelling. At first, he could barely stand for 30 seconds. Then a minute. Then three. Now, he can walk nearly a kilometre with the aid of a cane. He’s also seeing improvement in his hand function: “Grasping was impossible at first. Now, I can hold a cup of tea,” he shared. “It’s the little victories that matter.” But the most significant battle wasn’t physical—it was mental. Losing his independence hit him the hardest. “For 14 months, someone else had to feed me,” he admitted. “That was the most difficult part.” Still, he kept pushing forward. “Every morning, seeing my doctors and therapists gave me strength,” he said. “They never gave up on me, so I didn’t give up on myself.” But the biggest credit goes to my companion, Hayrettin Ayaz, who has been with me for the entire 19 months. He did what most of my relatives wouldn’t have done. Hamza’s journey is a powerful reminder that rehabilitation isn’t just about medical treatment—it’s about rebuilding confidence, reclaiming life. “Prosthetics alone won’t help without effort,” he said. “But with training and determination, even the impossible starts to feel within reach.” Now, 19 months into his recovery, he’s focused on one goal: full independence. He acknowledged, \"I still have challenges ahead, but I've overcome so much already.\" His advice to those going through comparable difficulties:\" Never give up. Continue. Rehabilitation is about believing in yourself, not just about the physical body. Hamza's story demonstrates that life after tragedy is not only possible but can be extraordinary with perseverance, support, and unwavering will. This story was developed based on an interview conducted and photographed by WHO Türkiye / Tunç Özceber."

          "Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) have been a cornerstone of malaria prevention efforts over the past 2 decades, and their widespread use has been instrumental in preventing the disease and saving lives. Since 2000, the global malaria response, including through ITN distribution campaigns, has helped prevent more than 2 billion cases and nearly 13 million deaths.",
          "Despite progress, malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in many areas have developed resistance to the insecticides commonly used on ITNs – especially pyrethroids – reducing their impact and undermining gains in malaria prevention. This rising threat has prompted researchers to accelerate the development of new types of nets that offer more durable protection against malaria.",
          "In 2017, WHO recommended the first ITN designed to enhance efficacy against pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes. While this marked an important step forward, further innovation was needed to develop dual-insecticide nets, assess their efficacy in managing resistant mosquitoes and their impact on malaria transmission, and to evaluate their cost-effectiveness.",
          "This photo story, published ahead of World Malaria Day 2025 , highlights the research, development and scale-up of dual-insecticide ITNs – made possible through years of collaboration among countries, communities, manufacturers, funders and a range of global, regional and national partners.",

          "The nets were first deployed in 2019 in Burkina Faso, and then Benin, Mozambique, Rwanda and the United Republic of Tanzania were added in subsequent years to test how the nets performed in different settings.",
          "By the end of 2022, the New Nets Project, together with the Global Fund and U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative deployed more than 56 million mosquito nets in 17 countries across sub-Saharan Africa where insecticide resistance had been reported.",
          "Clinical trials and pilot studies found that dual-insecticide nets improved malaria control by 20–50% compared with standard pyrethroid-only nets. Additionally, clinical trials in the United Republic of Tanzania and Benin demonstrated that the pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets significantly reduced malaria infections in children between the ages of 6 months and 10 years.",
          "“The New Nets Project significantly advanced malaria control by accelerating access to dual active ingredient nets, an important tool in the fight against malaria,” said Dr Philippe Duneton, Executive Director of Unitaid. “The success of this initiative is the result of strong partnerships that helped us overcome access barriers and reach communities faster. Together with our partners, we continue working to explore and support innovations that reduce malaria transmission and save lives.”",

          "It is 40°C outside. The power supply for the refrigerator is unreliable as the electricity either fails or the voltage fluctuates, and there is no fuel for the generator. The person who monitors the temperature of the health unit’s refrigerator – the one storing vaccine vials for tomorrow’s immunization session – is out sick and the ice packs are already starting to melt.",
          "How do you keep the vaccines cold? How do you know the vials have not been exposed to heat? Can you still transport them safely to a neighbouring community 20 kilometres away? And how do you transport them?",
          "These were challenges that John Lloyd, an architect by training, noticed as he began his career designing hospitals in different countries in the early 1970s.",
          "An architect of the vaccine cold chain",
          "Frustrated by the lack of healthcare access for poorer communities, John took a sabbatical from architecture to study primary healthcare facilities in Kenya and Tanzania. During his sabbatical, he discovered that inadequate vaccine storage infrastructure was leading to vaccines losing effectiveness in high temperatures.",
          "Around the same time, in 1974, WHO established the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) to provide universal access to protect all children against 6 childhood illnesses – tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, and measles. With EPI, WHO and countries were also encountering similar challenges to safely store and distribute vaccines.",
          "Based on his findings from Kenya and Tanzania, WHO hired John, along with other experts, to collaborate with the Government of Ghana – an early adopter of EPI – to develop and test a new cold chain system and technologies that could be used to keep vaccines stored at safe temperatures and be delivered to health centres.",
          "Working with the Ghana health authorities, John quickly discovered that domestic refrigerators and picnic boxes made in Europe could not compete with 40°C heat nor the long shipment. Most were damaged on delivery, and spare parts would be difficult to find. Since all but one of the original EPI vaccines were sensitive to heat and a few sensitive to freezing, there needed to be a way to monitor storage temperatures to keep the vaccines effective.",
          "In 1977, John published a strategy paper outlining Ghana’s first vaccine cold chain and how this could be replicated in a low-income country. This model was later reproduced and adopted by like-minded logisticians, immunization managers, and cold chain experts and implemented globally.",
          "The cold chain described in a 1987 article in the WHO Chronicle",
          "As part of the strategy, he envisioned a system that managed to keep vaccines at the correct temperatures from the point of arrival in the country, usually the national vaccine store in the capital city, all the way to the health facility or immunization campaign site. However, John and other experts were still concerned that vaccine vials could be exposed to too much heat throughout the journey rendering them ineffective.",
          "By the late 1970s, John and other WHO consultants began working with PATH to track the heat exposure of individual vaccine vials. Their contributions later led to vaccine vial monitors, a heat sensitive label that changes colour progressively each time the vial is exposed to temperatures which are too high. Today, these monitors are affixed on all vaccines produced by UNICEF for global immunization programmes.",
          "A vaccine vial monitor on a bivalent oral polio vaccine vial. Credit: WHO / Rod Curtis",
          "“John’s journey from hospital architectural design to healthcare development in low-income countries is a testament to his unwavering determination and compassion. His work has transformed the lives of many and serves as a shining example of what can be achieved when one is driven by a noble cause. This was just the beginning,” said James Cheyne, a former WHO EPI Technical Officer.",
          "Always ahead of the game",
          "Over John’s 25 years at WHO, he convinced several companies to design and manufacture the needed equipment based on his original cold chain strategy and the challenges he continued to encounter in various countries. His work led to the development of new and improved cold boxes, vaccines carriers, multi-energy refrigerators, ice-lined refrigerators, and solar-powered refrigerators.",
          "Later his focus stretched to other challenges facing immunization programmes. By the 1980s, reports of unsafe injection practices, syringe re-use, and needle-stick injuries increased, which exposed health workers to infection. John collaborated with other agencies to increase awareness of the risk and worked to encourage companies to develop auto-disable syringes that automatically locked down the syringe’s plunger after an injection.",
          "WHO-recommended auto-disable syringes are now available at a low-cost routinely and procured and delivered by UNICEF for the vaccination of children worldwide. He also worked to develop inexpensive cardboard safety boxes that health facilities use to store used needles and prevent needle-stick injuries.",
          "Developing human resources to manage and implement the immunization supply chains was also a part of John’s legacy. In 1989, he launched TechNet, which began as a group of experts committed sharing best practices on strengthening immunization. Today, the group has evolved into a global immunization network of immunization professionals committed to strengthening immunization services by building relationships, sharing knowledge, coordinating activities, and aligning priorities and goals.",
          "Beyond improving the immunization supply chain, John was instrumental in launching the Kick Polio Out of Africa campaign with the African Football to raise awareness and funds for polio eradication. He designed the \"Kick Polio Out of Africa\" logo with his daughter, polio vaccine \"day carriers”, and a stool-specimen collection kit. He also wrote a popular regional polio eradication song sung by Koffi Olimode of the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
          "The “Kick Polio Out of Africa” vaccine carrier being used in the Bredjing Refugee Camp in Chad in 2024. Photo credit: WHO / Jean-Marc Giboux",
          "John’s story shows what can be done through vision, collaboration, and support among different partners and agencies. Throughout his career, John worked with WHO, UNICEF, governments and other partners to ensure vaccine safety, to provide equal access to vaccination, and to adopt new innovations to improve immunization services. He worked with a team of committed logisticians, immunization managers, and industry partners who continue the work to achieve this vision.",
          "Today, millions of vaccine doses are delivered in the right quantities, at the right times and at the correct temperatures to protect tens of millions of children each year from vaccine-preventable diseases, thanks to the work of John and all those he collaborated with throughout his career.",
          "“John Lloyd is one of these unsung heroes of public health who was never in the news. He has remained discrete, silent and humble and never stopped being innovative, creative and committed,” said Michael Zaffran, Retired Director, Polio Eradication at WHO.",

          "Every year, an estimated 21 million girls aged 15–19 years in low- and middle-income countries become pregnant. Adolescent pregnancy leads to higher risks of maternal and infant mortality, a greater chance of mental health problems, and constraints for educational and economic prospects, which contributes to cycles of poverty and inequality that can span across generations",
          "In many parts of the world, adolescents lack access to the information and resources necessary to make informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive health (SRH). This leaves them vulnerable to unintended pregnancies; child marriage further fuels the risk.",
          "The World Health Organization (WHO) recently released an updated guideline for preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries, providing evidence-based normative guidance in two key areas: preventing child marriage and improving adolescents’ access to contraception. The recommendations highlight the importance of enabling laws and policies and education to achieve these goals."

          "Many countries around the world have recently stepped up to make child marriage illegal. Colombia is one of these, with members of congress abolishing  a law in November 2024 that allowed marriages from the age of 14. Importantly, the new bill they introduced also includes measures to restore the rights of children and adolescents affected by underage marriages and unions, with a special emphasis on supporting indigenous people and other vulnerable communities.",
          "A joint effort by authorities and society is required to eradicate this practice and guarantee the protection of girls' rights. Tamara Ospina / Government of Colombia’s Vice Minister of Women",
          "“The effective implementation of this law shows a change in the social norms that perpetuate child marriage. A joint effort by authorities and society is required to eradicate this practice and guarantee the protection of girls' rights,” said Tamara Ospina, the Government of Colombia’s Vice Minister of Women. \"It is essential to advance a campaign for cultural change that allows for the dismantling of traditional family views and promotes the participation of girls in different sectors, especially in the educational sector, to foster greater opportunities.\"",
          "The WHO guideline recommends the formulation and implementation of such laws and policies that prevent marriage before age 18, in line with human rights standards. However, the guideline acknowledges, in agreement with the Human Right Council Resolution , that simply making child marriage illegal is not enough. Without additional support programmes, this approach could marginalize and stigmatize girls and families, and lead to more informal or unregistered marriages, unintentionally increasing the practice.",
          "This is why a comprehensive approach, that includes efforts to address the root causes of child marriage, such as poverty, gender inequality and access to education, is so important. The guideline also suggests the approach should also mobilize youth and adolescents, as well as political and governmental leaders, alongside religious, traditional and other influential people in the community to promote girls’ rights."

          "The WHO guideline reinforces the interagency technical guidelines on sexuality education , emphasizing that comprehensive sexuality education is key to preventing adolescent pregnancy and improving contraceptive uptake. In Colombia, implementation of the law is facilitated by work led by adolescent girls to ensure that girls have access to sexuality education.",
          "Ángela Rosa Cervantes Bravo is a teen activist from a rural indigenous village in Colombia where she is heavily involved in an NGO called Sinumar Foundation that focuses on girls and sexuality education with the aim to prevent adolescent pregnancy in her community. Every year, the foundation organizes an entire week of speakers on sexual education. “During this time, our mothers, children in the community, and we, as young women, are guided and filled with knowledge about our bodies, contraceptive methods, and more. We sit down with boys and girls in mixed circles, talking about sexual education, violence and any other issue that might be relevant to the community,” Cervantes Bravo said.",
          "Discussing topics, such as adolescent pregnancy or child marriage, comes with its challenges due to the social stigma and traditional beliefs around it. “Some parents still get upset when they hear us discussing these things, but they need to understand that we are at a stage where these conversations are necessary,” she said. The experiences of Cervantes Bravo reinforce the need to engage parents and other community members in supporting adolescents, which is highlighted as another recommendation in the updated guideline.",
          "Support tools for policy makers and programme managers will be rolled out to guide decision making and ensure that interventions are contextually relevant, to support the work of countries like Colombia and of NGO’s like Sinumar Foundation.",
          "Avni Amin, Unit Head of Rights and Equality Across the Life Course at WHO and the UN Special Programme on Human Reproduction (HRP) concludes: “While these guidelines offer a solid foundation for countries to address adolescent pregnancy and prevent child marriage, the true measure of their success lies in their implementation. It is essential that these guidelines are not only read but acted upon, integrated into national policies, and adapted to fit local contexts. Our goal is to see tangible changes on the ground that will empower young girls and protect their rights.”",
          "Other countries that have taken recent measures to act on child marriage include Sierra Leone and Belize. Sierra Leone's Prohibition of Child Marriage Act eliminated all exceptions that previously allowed marriage under 18, ensuring a strict nationwide ban. Similarly, Belize amended its Marriage Act to raise the legal marriage age from 16 to 18, without any exceptions, reinforcing its commitment to ending child marriage."

For instance, we conducted a three-day class on sexual and reproductive health and rights in rural Nepal, where child marriage rates are high. We taught young people about consent, healthy relationships, and that girls should have a say in their relationships. Later, we learned that some of them had successfully stopped child marriage by speaking with their parents and convincing them to wait until the legal age of 21. We also did a monitoring visit back to the area, and it was amazing to see how the young people we taught had become educators themselves.

For me, activism is about challenging the status quo and creating opportunities for youth to lead change. In Nepal, adolescents make up a very large group of our population, so it is ensuring that our rights are respected and prioritized. We are often misheard and misrepresented and put aside, when in reality adolescent needs are vast and concrete, especially for adolescent girls.",

The initiative has the mission to support Member States in achieving the 2030 target endorsed by the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly on effective refractive error coverage.",
          "The journey to integrate eye care into Assam's health system made significant progress during the SPECS 2030 strategic workshop. This event took place on November 21-22, 2024, in Guwahati, Assam, with WHO working alongside top government bodies to host it. Their primary goal was to develop a draft action plan for the “Assam Model” to implement SPECS 2030, integrating individual-focused eye care into the region's healthcare system. This effort aligns with the WHO's broader mission to achieve universal health coverage, focusing on expanding high-quality eye care services to less-served areas.",
          "The event commenced with an opening session that featured top government officials, WHO representatives, and key stakeholders from the health, education, and social justice sectors. The Assamese edition of WHO TAP site (WHO’s online trainining in assistive products) and WHO Eyes app (a free mobile app designed to check near and distance visual acuity) going live marked a significant milestone, demonstrating a commitment to making information about eye care accessible to speakers of the Assamese language.",

WHO officers, health organizations from the region, and key eye care entities shared their expertise on comprehensive eye care strategies and teamwork across different sectors. They emphasized the need to collaborate to deliver comprehensive, accessible, and sustainable eye care in Assam.  .",

This first-hand involvement enabled meeting participants to observe challenges, consider potential solutions, and gather key information for developing the \"Assam Model\" to implement SPECS 2030.",
          "The second day was dedicated to discussing key issues in working groups, such as caring for children's eyes, training eye care personnel and determining where to allocate resources. Experts gave talks about innovative models to provide eye care, including examples from Aravind Eye Care, LV Prasad Eye Institute, and Sri Sankaradeva Nethralaya. Plenary discussions followed, sharpening an \"action plan\" that addresses all five pillars of SPECS 2030: improving access to Services, building the capacity of Personnel to provide refractive services, enhancing population Education, reducing the Cost of refractive services, and strengthening Surveillance and research.",
          "The session concluded, and meeting participants began discussing the next steps to roll out SPECS 2030 in Assam. The big plan was sketched out; it’s focus was integrating eye care into Assam’s healthcare system. WHO, local authorities and non-government stakeholders all have key roles to play in implementing the plan and monitoring its progress. The ideas and experiences generated from this meeting will set the stage for more initiatives like this in India and beyond, demonstrating how teamwork in policymaking can advance global eye health goals.",
          "The Assam model is seen as a pilot for SPECS 2030 initiative across wider India.

Better nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, and longevity. Healthy children learn better. People with adequate nutrition are more productive and can create opportunities to gradually break the cycles of poverty and hunger.",
          "Today, the world faces a double burden of malnutrition that includes both undernutrition and overweight. Undernutrition as well as obesity result in diet-related noncommunicable diseases.",
          "WHO's support to initiatives to tackle malnutrition is not possible without funding. For core work like this, WHO needs sustainable financing that is predictable, flexible and resilient, enabling the Organization to have the greatest impact where it is needed most.",
          "In parallel to providing fully flexible funding, donors also invest in specific WHO activities across the globe to address malnutrition. The examples reveal a wide range of donor support, not only in emergency contexts with vulnerable or displaced populations but also as a long-term and deeply embedded concern for many countries. This support is even more vital in the face of rising conflict, poverty, food insecurity and rising food prices coupled with easy access to cheap and highly processed foods across all income levels."

Thailand has also tightened its national definition of obesity. While WHO's definition states that \"a body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese\", in Thailand citizens with BMI greater or equal to 25 are registered as obese – which allows the health stakeholders to expand the reach and support to broader population groups.

          "It’s time. A pregnant woman in Punjab, Pakistan, dials 1-0-3-4, toll-free. Her journey to safe childbirth has been complicated by a lack of transportation. She is connected to a call centre in Lahore that receives 5000 calls a day from pregnant women and their caregivers in need of transportation for delivery or antenatal complications. The call centre was established in 2017 and currently employs 87 call agents. Utilizing Google maps, GPS trackers and text messaging, the call centre operator dispatches a driver to collect labouring women from their homes and transfers them to a primary care centre, where they will deliver their babies with access to interventions to ensure healthy beginnings for both mother and baby.",
          "Call agents in Lahore processing calls and dispatching driver s. © RAS Call Center Lahore / IRMNCHN Program",
          "In 2007, the maternal mortality ratio in Punjab was 227 deaths per 100 000 live births . This was a result of poor socio-economic conditions, challenges in accessing health care in rural areas, and a lack of decision-making power among young women. At the time, approximately 30% of maternal deaths in Pakistan were attributable to delays in reaching health-care facilities, with many women facing long travel distances to give birth as well as lack of access to transportation.",
          "Over the last two decades, the Government of Punjab has scaled up around 2500 basic health units and equipped 1800 with 24-hour basic obstetric care services. These basic units, the country’s first-level health-care facilities, play a crucial role in addressing maternal and child health issues, especially in rural areas where access to health care is limited. Based on the 2023 census, nearly two thirds of Pakistan’s population resides in rural areas.",
          "Under the national universal health coverage essential package of health services, the Government of Punjab has now funded a fleet of over 600 ambulances to transport pregnant women from their homes in rural areas to birth centres for delivery. The same service also transports sick children (under age 5 years) for urgent medical care. On average, the rural ambulance service transports 2800 women each day across the province, including public holidays. The cost per transfer for a typical case is approximately US$ 10–15. The service is vital for the more than 30% of pregnant women in Punjab who cannot reach health facilities for safe delivery. Without the service, they would be forced to deliver at home, without access to emergency obstetric and neonatal care.",
          "\"We promote the rural ambulance service through a combination of community outreach and public awareness campaigns. We visit homes, hold community meetings, and distribute informational materials to ensure that every pregnant woman knows about the toll-free number 1-0-3-4 and how to access the service. During the first antenatal care visit, the staff facilitates the registration of pregnant women for the ambulance service. Their personal touch and deep knowledge of their respective communities make a significant difference in spreading the word effectively,\" said Saeeda Khan, Lady Health Worker, Ali Raza Abad, Lahore.",
          "The government’s Integrated Reproductive, Maternal and Child Health & Nutrition Programme oversees the technical and financial aspects, while the central call centre and daily operations are managed by a telecom operator and a private car rental company, respectively. The rental company supplies fuel, drivers and maintains the ambulance, with performance tracked via a dashboard that requires the engine to start within two minutes of case assignment.",

          "The real-time dashboard shows GPS-tracked ambulance locations, allowing call centre operators to assign the nearest vehicle to waiting women and their caregivers. Once assigned, both the driver and the woman receive a call and a text message with their respective contact information. The text messages enable communication between drivers and women and allow drivers to pinpoint exact addresses, a task that is often difficult in rural areas.",
          "\"We prioritize calls based on the urgency of the situation, with high-risk pregnancies and emergencies at the top of the list. If a connection drops or a phone battery dies, our system automatically sends text messages to both the driver and the client, ensuring they can still communicate. Additionally, Lady Health Workers and Skilled Birth Attendants are always ready to step in and provide support, ensuring that no woman is left without assistance,” said Bilal Ahmed, District Transport Officer, Outsourced Management Firm.",
          "Since its debut in 2017, the ambulance service has facilitated the transport of over 3 million women from their homes to health facilities, approximately three and a half million women from primary care to secondary or tertiary hospitals, and around 10 000 children for urgent referrals. It is estimated that at least half of the 500 000 emergency referrals to secondary and tertiary care hospitals have effectively prevented severe morbidity and mortality among mothers and newborns in Punjab.",
          "\"Without the rural ambulance service, my birth experience would have been incredibly stressful and risky. I would likely have had to deliver at home without skilled medical assistance, which could have jeopardized both my health and my baby's. The timely support from Lady Health Workers and Skilled Birth Attendants ensured that I received quality care and safe delivery at a health facility. Their presence and the ambulance service made all the difference,” said Keenza Faisal, Beneficiary, Allama Iqbal Town, Lahore.",
          "Today, there are 157 maternal deaths for every 100 000 live births in Punjab, a decrease of more than 30% from 2007. This decrease has resulted from interventions related to improved access to maternal health services, in addition to addressing the underlying causes for maternal deaths – for instance, through improved access to family planning.",
          "Still, there is work to be done.",
          "Removing barriers like discriminatory social norms, financial constraints and limited decision-making power for women is essential to advancing maternal and newborn health outcomes. Ellen Mpangananji Thom / Deputy WHO County Representative, Pakistan",
          "“Sustainable progress demands more than just service delivery: health systems must address gender inequalities, strengthen sexual and reproductive health and rights, and ensure equitable access to quality emergency obstetric and newborn care, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Removing barriers like discriminatory social norms, financial constraints and limited decision-making power for women is essential to advancing maternal and newborn health outcomes,” said Ellen Mpangananji Thom, Deputy WHO County Representative, Pakistan.",
          "This story was originally brought to life on the WHO-UNFPA Learning by Sharing Portal (LSP), which highlights the critical work of various stakeholders in improving access to sexual and reproductive health and rights services within the broader context of universal health coverage. The LSP seeks to create a repository of implementation stories on effective health system interventions and serves as a valuable resource for shared learning, advocacy and capacity building at global, regional and country levels.",
          "In follow up to World Health Day, please join the WHO-UNFPA Learning by Sharing Portal (LSP), WHO Pakistan, and the Primary & Secondary Healthcare Department, Punjab, Pakistan, on 9 April at 13:00 CET for an interactive discussion with experts and implementers involved in the roll out of the rural ambulance service in Punjab, Pakistan.

When Maloka became pregnant again, Fatima, a Lady Health Worker, vaccinated her against tetanus, ensuring that both the mother and newborn would be protected.",
          "Maloka’s story highlights how the Government of Pakistan, in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), has transformed the prevention of maternal neonatal tetanus (MNT) across the country. Around 80% of Pakistan’s population (190 million people) now live in areas where the spread of neonatal tetanus is under controlled limits – less than 1 case of tetanus per 1000 live births. Islamabad Capital Territory and Pakistan-administered Kashmir achieved elimination in March 2025, Sindh in December 2024 and Punjab in 2016.",

For mothers like Maloka, Lady Health Workers are heroes, but they do not work alone. More than 140 000 Lady Health Visitors, Lady Health Supervisors, Lady Health Workers and midwives work across Pakistan, covering even the most remote areas, keeping mothers and newborns safe.",
          "Maloka lost her first child, a baby girl, to neonatal tetanus. The pain of that loss fueled her determination to protect any future children. When Maloka became pregnant again, Fatima was there, a steady source of support and guidance. She ensured Maloka received the necessary tetanus vaccinations, advised her on safe delivery practices and provided antenatal care. Today, Maloka cradles her healthy 1-year-old son, a symbol of hope and resilience.",
          "Maloka's story underscores the crucial role of frontline health workers like Fatima who provide advice from mother to mother. Fatima acts as a bridge between communities and the health care system, building trust and empowering women to take control of their health.",
          "Fatima prepares to administer tetanus-diphtheria vaccine to Maloka in a remote area of Sindh. Photo: WHO Pakistan",

          "WHO will continue to partner with Pakistan and its frontline health workers as they work to eliminate MNT from the country and protect future generations from this preventable disease.",
          "As the sun sets over the Thar desert, casting long shadows across the sand dunes, health workers like Fatima are bringing hope for a healthier future to the most remote settlements. “Initially, it was an uphill battle,” Fatima recalls. “Many were hesitant, bound by traditional beliefs and misconceptions about vaccines. Now, the smiles of healthy babies and the relief in mothers' eyes are the greatest reward. It is a reminder that, even in the most challenging circumstances, we can make a difference, one vaccine at a time.”"

However, thousands of women are still dying due to haemorrhage every year, making up 27% of all maternal deaths. Nearly all these women are from sub-Saharan Africa, where a number of challenges persist, including a lack of access to prenatal care, skilled birth attendants and high-quality medicines in health facilities."

This new way of detecting and treating postpartum haemorrhage early combines the most effective interventions into a quicker, life-saving method that is being scaled up in the places that need it the most.",
          "“In the last year or two, we’ve seen a real difference. Even the cleaners and staff in the labour ward say the new way is a great innovation. Before, blood would flow onto the beds and floors. Now, with the drape, the blood is collected in a pouch,\" said Dr Galadanci.",
          "This plastic pouch, or drape, is the first step in the new approach that takes the guesswork out of estimating blood loss. The drape itself is not new, but its consistent use is, and the difference has been immediately felt.",

By the time we decide to intervene, many women are already in shock – thirsty, disoriented, fading away before our eyes,\"​ said Dr Zahida Qureshi, principal investigator of the E-MOTIVE trial in Kenya and Professor of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Nairobi.",

Dr Quresh explained that throughout her career she took part in multiple trials that laid the groundwork for where we are today – on the brink of altering the course of maternal mortality.",
          "Studies like the WOMAN trial on tranexamic acid and the CHAMPION trial on oxytocic drugs, generated useful evidence that was foundational to the components of the E-MOTIVE package, or PPH bundle. Scientists and doctors at WHO, the UN’s Special Programme on Human Reproduction (HRP) and the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, built off the foundation of these trials and devised the PPH bundle to address the very specific needs of women who are most at risk of dying in childbirth.",

When we have scarce resources, we cannot afford to ignore proven solutions.”",

In the E-MOTIVE trial, researchers had to test brands and identify those that were effective. “Countries need systems to routinely check drug quality, not just once at registration, but on an ongoing basis,” Dr Osoti added. In the absence of such systems, facilities risk relying on poor-quality medications that fail when they are needed most.",
          "To address maternal mortality now that resources are scarce, it is essential to put funding into solutions that we know work. This means training health workers on the complete PPH bundle, regular monitoring on drug quality and consistent monitoring and evaluation of the intervention, which helps ensure that success in one hospital can be replicated in others.",

          "PAHO conducted training sessions and knowledge dialogues on topics such as family planning, prenatal care, identification of warning signs, and childbirth care. Meetings have yielded results that can benefit the entire region, such as the development of the tool for promoting culturally safe childbirth .",

          "At 15, Yeliza Natali began to notice a deformation in her spine, but no one around her paid much attention since she was too thin, and some bones protruded more than others. Growing up in rural Colombia, her constant back pain was attributed to hard work in the fields. Over the years, the discomfort became a barrier to her daily life, even forcing to change her job as a waitress to a lower-paying one, that was less physical.",
          "At the age of 24, her reality changed when she was diagnosed with scoliosis. The medical recommendation was blunt: surgery. The possibility of undergoing surgery on her spine generated fear and uncertainty. However, before reaching that point, she was recommended to do rehabilitation with a physiotherapist to strengthen the muscles surrounding her spine. Thus began a long process of transformation.",
          "Physical therapist Marcela Bustamante played a big role in helping her recover. She supported her at every step of the treatment focusing on both her body and mind. At first, the therapy sessions were tough and awkward. Yeliza, determined to skip surgery, stayed committed. Over time, the improvements were easy to see. Her posture got better, her pain lessened, and she could move much more . When Yeliza visited the neurosurgeon again, the update was shocking. Her progress had been so good they decided surgery was no longer needed.",
          "Her journey to live without pain didn’t stop there. She spent a full three years in rehabilitation.",
          "Getting the therapy she needed wasn’t simple. Since her town lacked a specialized center, she had to travel six hours to Medellín. She covered expenses like transportation, lodging, and daily allowances out of pocket. The physiotherapy sessions were paid for by Colombia’s Health Promoting Entities (EPS), but her recovery wasn’t easy. Delays in seeing specialists and limited resources in her community made the process much harder.",
          "Even though Yeliza encountered many struggles, she turned her life around. Now, without pain, she runs her own catering business and takes part in activities she never imagined doing before. Her journey shows how powerful rehabilitation can be.",
          "\"If I hadn't gone through rehab, I couldn't even walk on my own now,\" she explains. She urges the authorities to act  saying it is important to invest in rehab programs. \"Health is the most important thing we own.\"",
          "Yeliza's experience shows how Colombia struggles with access to rehabilitation services outside cities. Without these services in smaller towns, many individuals will struggle with money and travel difficulties to get the care they need to improve their lives."

From private practice to academic and professional leadership and advocacy at national and international levels, his career spans the full spectrum of the profession—and beyond. Yet, his journey began like many others: with skepticism. But like many other journeys, his started off unclear.",
          "“I wanted to become a medical doctor,” Lyle admits, reflecting on his early ambitions. Searching for a pre-medical course, he stumbled upon occupational therapy without knowing what it truly entailed. “I didn’t even understand what occupational therapy was until I started working with patients,” he says. During these early patient interactions, the true scope and impact of occupational therapy became clear. Occupational therapy considers the whole person—their physical, psychological, and social needs. “As we say in occupational therapy, we work to help people do what they want to do, need to do, and are expected to do in their everyday lives,” Lyle explains.",

While primarily a clinician specializing in pediatric and neurological rehabilitation, he also operates his therapy center in Tarlac City, two and a half hours north of Manila. Beyond clinical work, he has been an academic, a member of the national professional regulatory board for occupational therapy, and an advocate for his profession. One of his proudest achievements was helping to pass the Philippine Occupational Therapy Law in 2018. Finally, the “law recognizes the unique value of our profession.” Today, as part of the Interim Professional Regulatory Board for Occupational Therapy, Lyle continues to shape the future of the field. His leadership extends globally. As a former Program Coordinator for Education at the World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT), Lyle has worked with emerging occupational therapy programs worldwide—from Argentina to China. “I’ve had the opportunity to witness how occupational therapy is developing in different cultural, educational, and healthcare contexts,” he says.",
          "For Lyle, the most profound moments in his career come not from policy victories but from the patients he has helped. One story stands out: a young lady who has Down syndrome. When Lyle first met her at around five, her future was uncertain. But she defied expectations with the support of an interdisciplinary team and a dedicated family. Brina graduated from college and became an Ambassador for the Special Olympics, even meeting former U.S. President Obama at the White House. “Her success wasn’t just about therapy,” Lyle emphasizes. “It was about collaboration and understanding the whole person.”",
          "This approach focuses on the patient and considers their overall well-being. Occupational therapy often involves helping a stroke survivor eat again independently or aiding a child with special needs to start school. The work feels personal and makes a real difference.",
          "“It’s the small milestones that matter,” Lyle says. “Being able to sit through a TV show without fatigue or simply visiting a neighbour—these are life-changing achievements.”",
          "Occupational therapy plays an important role but deals with many issues in the Philippines. The Department of Labor and Employment has labeled it as a profession with shortages. Less than 6000 registered occupational therapists work to serve the country's population, which exceeds 100 million.",
          "Equitable access is another hurdle. “Most therapists remain in urban areas,” Lyle notes. “But we need them in rural communities where services are scarce.” He continues to advocate for both increased numbers of professionals and better distribution across the country.",
          "When asked what advice he would give young people considering occupational therapy as a career, Lyle’s answer is clear: “If you want to positively impact people’s lives while working in diverse settings, occupational therapy is for you.” The profession has given him the freedom to work in private therapy centers, universities, homes, and communities—sometimes all in the same week. “I need variety,” he laughs. “And occupational therapy has never stopped challenging me.” For Lyle Duque, the journey that began with skepticism has become a lifelong mission to improve lives—one patient, one policy, and one professional at a time.",
          "Occupational therapy is a client-centred health profession concerned with promoting health and wellbeing through occupation. The primary goal of occupational therapy is to enable people to participate in the activities of everyday life. Occupational therapists achieve this outcome by working with people and communities to enhance their ability to engage in the occupations they want to, need to, or are expected to do, or by modifying the occupation or the environment to better support their occupational engagement (The World Federation of Occupational Therapists, 2012) .",

          "At 22, Maddi's life took a dramatic turn in New York City, shifting her path from being a stroke survivor to becoming a strong voice supporting rehab services. Her experience shows how powerful complete care can be.",
          "Maddi's journey started when doctors planned brain surgery to remove an arteriovenous malformation, or AVM. But things took a sudden twist. While undergoing pre-surgery tests, she developed a blood clot that ruptured, leading to a severe stroke. This led to a rushed emergency surgery.",
          "When she woke up, everything was different, and she realized how serious her situation was. \"The first thing that hit me was being paralyzed on my left side,\" Maddi says. \"I couldn’t move my main arm or leg, and I couldn’t even sit up by myself. My left face was frozen too. Talking and swallowing were hard.\" These intense physical struggles showed the tough road ahead and how much she would rely on rehab to get better.",
          "As Maddi began to grasp her new situation, she realized that the road ahead wouldn’t be short or simple. But she knew that to regain her freedom and rebuild her life, rehabilitation was essential. \"I was furious and heartbroken at first, but it hit me fast that I had a tough and drawn-out recovery journey waiting for me,\" she says.",
          "That moment of acceptance gave her a purpose. It marked the start of her journey to heal.",
          "A group of rehabilitation experts set Maddi on the path to recovery. They combined skill with compassion throughout her progress. Physical therapists worked with her to restore strength and movement. They helped her move from a wheelchair to walking with just a cane, and to walking on her own. Occupational therapists helped her handle daily tasks again letting her rebuild her independence step by step. Speech specialists focused on swallowing and communication issues, and cognitive therapists helped her sharpen her focus and improve mental skills. Maddi appreciates not just their expertise but also their dedication calling them \"invested\" in helping her succeed.",
          "Her recovery method shows how it can give people a sense of control. “I figured out how to change my perspective,” Maddi explains. “I won’t improve unless I put in the effort to regain the abilities I used to have but overlooked.” Each tiny win—moving her fingers for the first time or standing alone—was a potent reminder of her determination and the slow yet meaningful progress that recovery brings.",
          "Maddi’s recovery wasn’t about healing her body. Her rehabilitation helped her regain self-belief and tackle the emotional struggles that came with recovering from a stroke. “It isn’t about getting back to how you were,” she says. “It’s about creating new possibilities and figuring out how to thrive .”",
          "Maddi’s story highlights how important it is to offer rehab services to stroke survivors everywhere. Her journey from being unable to move to living on her own shows how life-changing proper care can be. It goes beyond just gaining back physical abilities. It is about helping survivors take control of their lives again.",
          "Now, Maddi speaks up to push for better access to these services. She calls on leaders to see how much of a difference they make. “Rehabilitation isn’t something extra; it’s essential,” she explains. She points out how starting treatment and making programs fit each person’s needs can help.",
          "Her story offers hope to stroke survivors and urges healthcare providers and policymakers to take action. Maddi’s experience shows that proper care allows survivors to regain independence, enjoy a better quality of life, and uncover new strengths.",
          "Maddi keeps sharing her story, and her message stands out. Rehabilitation isn’t part of getting better. It builds the base for a hopeful future for stroke survivors around the world."

          "When Jayme-Lee Hanekom couldn’t speak anymore, she worried that her career might be over. She had built years of success as a musical theatre performer captivating audiences in shows such as Frozen, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and The Book of Mormon. Th en, in April 2022, her throat started to feel ticklish during warm-ups. It was a small sign, but it hinted at a problem that would test her understanding of both her abilities and her identity.",
          "“I felt like I needed to cough every time I sang,” Jayme-Lee recalls. “The effort I was putting in wasn’t matching the sound I was producing.”",
          "She was able to access a speech pathologist who specializes in voice disorders – Debbie Phyland – through her theatre. The assessment showed inflammation of her vocal cord likely caused by fatigue and acid reflux from excessive gum chewing for her role as Violet Beauregarde in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The management options were progressively more serious: complete vocal rest or referral to an ear, nose and throat specialist for steroid injections, or surgery. Jayme-Lee chose the rest option first and stayed silent (except for short periods of 5 minutes) for two weeks. Despite sticking with the regime, the symptoms persisted, and further investigation from an ear, nose and throat specialist confirmed the presence of a polyp on her left vocal cord. For a singer, the mere mention of vocal surgery is terrifying. “My brain immediately went to ‘no, no, no’,” she admits. But when rest and steroids failed, surgery became inevitable. “I cried and cried,” she says. “But I trusted my speech therapist, Debbie, and knew I had no other choice.”",
          "Jayme-Lee underwent surgery in July 2022. The rehabilitation process was gruelling. For five days, she was completely silent, relying on a whiteboard and text messages to communicate. Then came weeks of careful vocal exercises, steaming, and nebulizing to reintroduce sound to her healing cords.",
          "“I could only talk for one minute every hour at first,” she says. “And when I finally started singing again, it wasn’t immediate magic. It took time.”",
          "But as she began auditioning for new roles, something still felt off. A second examination revealed the devastating news—her first surgery hadn’t removed the entire polyp. She needed to go through the entire process again.",
          "“I was devastated,” Jayme-Lee admits. “But this time, I had no shame. I knew it wasn’t my fault.”",
          "After her second surgery, Jayme-Lee knew her rehabilitation regime well – and stuck to it rigidly. Within a few days, she could tell that the process had been a success: her voice was back.",
          "“On the fifth day, I whispered a word, and I knew—I could feel the difference.”",
          "Jayme-Lee continued the gradual progression of voice rehabilitation – under the guidance of her speech therapist and voice coach (who had experienced a similar injury during her career).",
          "Three months later, she stood on stage in Tina: The Tina Turner Musical , singing some of the most challenging songs of her career. “A year before, I wasn’t even speaking. Now I was belting out Tina Turner,” she says with pride.",
          "Jayme-Lee’s journey through rehabilitation highlights an often-overlooked issue in the performing arts. Vocal injuries remain a taboo topic in the industry, with some producers hesitant to hire performers with a history of voice problems. Yet, as Jayme-Lee’s experience proves, these injuries are as much a part of the profession as sprained ankles are for dancers.",
          "“I refuse to keep this a secret,” she says. “Rehab isn’t something to be ashamed of. It’s about healing, learning, and coming back stronger.”",
          "Now, Jayme-Lee is using her voice in more ways than one—not just on stage, but also to educate young performers on vocal care. “Warm-ups, hydration, and rest are key,” she emphasizes. “And if something feels wrong, get checked. Early intervention can save a career.”",
          "Her next dream? To take Tina to the West End. And this time, she’s ready to sing like never before."

          "Shaibu Issa, a 29-year-old health advocate in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, vividly remembers watching as his brother, Latifu Dini, suffered repeat stomach aches in 2017. A visit to a doctor and follow-up tests identified the problem; Latifu had chronic hepatitis B, a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus. Later, Latifu encouraged Shaibu to get tested; his result was also positive.",
          "“I never showed any symptoms,” Shaibu said. “Even now I'm looking healthy, but I live with this disease. That's why we call hepatitis a silent killer.”",
          "After being diagnosed, isolation and grief set in. Shaibu and Latifu were separated from classmates. Due to inadequate awareness and knowledge about the disease, health workers refused to touch them due to fears of contracting the disease and their community shunned them.",
          "Recounting the pain he experienced, Shaibu said, “Viral hepatitis changed my entire life, because from there I started to face stigma. That’s when I started to understand the importance of how people should be treated.”",
          "Credit: WHO / Vicky Markolefa",
          "Caption: Shaibu Issa looks at an old photograph of his brother Latifu Dini, who passed away due to liver cancer resulting from chronic hepatitis B.",
          "Beyond stigma, Shaibu and his brother faced another hurdle. The cost of treatment was more than their family could afford, and it required travelling to Dar es Salaam from their rural home near Mtwara in southern Tanzania.",
          "The family sold everything and fundraised but it wasn’t enough to cover the brothers’ ongoing treatment, in addition to their university fees. Later, Shaibu and Latifu would overcome all odds and finish university, but Latifu would lose his life to liver cancer.",
          "“After losing my brother, it was very bad because I believed I was next,” recalls Shaibu. “But I came to realize many people globally are suffering with this disease and face stigma and discrimination. My brother inspired me to take responsibility to represent these people.",
          "I can't let many people die out there while I can speak,” he says.",
          "Using social media to inspire change",
          "An estimated 254 million people globally are living with chronic hepatitis B infection, and roughly 1.1 million people die each year from the infection, mostly resulting from cirrhosis or liver cancer.  In Tanzania, there are roughly 1.9 million people living with chronic hepatitis B, and most of the tests and treatments for the infection are either unavailable or unaffordable.",
          "Despite many people living the disease in Tanzania, few people are aware of how the disease is transmitted, its symptoms or how it can be prevented. This lack of awareness and resulting misinformation is a key reason people like Shaibu face stigma and discrimination.",
          "For Shaibu, this presented an opportunity. When Shaibu was first diagnosed, “nobody talked about viral hepatitis,” he said. “The only information that prevailed was false information. I thought that if I needed to raise awareness to people, it's very easy to meet many people on social media.",
          "Today, Shaibu uses multiple digital platforms and also speaks at conferences, schools and universities to raise awareness about the importance of getting vaccinated against the disease as well as getting tested and treated.",
          "Credit: WHO / Vicky Markolefa Caption: Shaibu Issa looks at an old photograph of his brother Latifu Dini, who passed away due to liver cancer resulting from chronic hepatitis B.",
          "Since Shaibu was not vaccinated as a child against hepatitis B due to the vaccine not being available where he lived, he also works to educate parents about the importance of vaccinating infants at birth, as recommended by WHO.",
          "A national plan to tackle hepatitis",
          "To respond to the hepatitis burden in Tanzania, the Ministry of Health with support from WHO, developed the Integrated Health Sector HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections National Strategic Plan, which aligns to the WHO Global HIV, Hepatitis and STIs strategies 2022-2030.  In 2023, the country also launched a new integrated HIV and hepatitis programme known as the National AIDS, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Hepatitis Control Program. This programme now plans, budgets and implements activities for each of the diseases in unison.",
          "“We recognize the immense dedication of advocates like Shaibu, who are at the forefront of this battle against hepatitis in Tanzania,” said Dr Charles Sagoe-Moses, WHO Representative in Tanzania. “The ongoing collaboration between the Ministry of Health, WHO, and local advocates is critical to reducing the burden of hepatitis and achieving a world where no one suffers in silence.”",
          "In addition, the Ministry of Health has updated integrated HIV and hepatitis guidelines and is continuing to increase awareness about viral hepatitis through mass, print and social media engagement, including through World Hepatitis Day activities.",
          "The Ministry of Health is also providing hepatitis vaccination and treatment for at risk populations, such as, people who inject drugs, people with multiple sexual partners, healthcare workers, people living with chronic liver and kidney disease and diabetes, and immunosuppressed individuals, including people living with HIV.",
          "With support from advocates like Shaibu, as well as efforts by the Ministry of Health, in partnership with WHO, the country is committed to fighting hepatitis. For Shaibu, this would be his dream.",
          "“My main goal is to make Tanzania, Africa and the world free of hepatitis by encouraging people to get tested and to be vaccinated, but also those who are already infected to access timely treatment,” he said.",

          "New Caledonia, a French archipelago in the South Pacific, is home to 271 407 residents (according to the latest 2019 census). The territory boasts a high-quality health-care system, integrating modern public and private hospitals with a network of medico-social centres. The Médipôle Hospital is near the capital, Nouméa, and the Kuindo-Magnin Clinic is within the city. A public hospital also serves the Northern Province. However, disparities in health-care access persist between urban and rural regions.",
          "The COVID-19 crisis, which began in March 2020 in France, highlighted the urgent need for an effective epidemiological management tool to track individuals infected with the virus and their contacts, and analyse real-time data to inform public health strategies.",
          "Initially, management efforts relied on paper documentation and Excel spreadsheets. A comparative analysis of digital solutions was completed in November 2020 with the selection of the Go.Data platform as the most viable option.",
          "Go.Data is an innovative digital tool developed by the World Health Organization in collaboration with GOARN partners specifically designed to support field-based outbreak response teams by facilitating case investigation and contact tracing activities. It offers more integrated and standardized data sets, real-time analyses to guide field operations, and various features to better organize and monitor contact tracing efforts.",
          "By February 2021, Go.Data was successfully installed on secure local servers, fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and accessible only to public health service personnel. Follow-up forms were customized and the import of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid diagnostic orientation test (TROD) results from medical laboratories automatized.",
          "Go.Data was operational during the increase of COVID-19 in September 2021. However, the rapid increase in cases rendered contact tracing unmanageable, limiting the tool's application to confirmed positive cases. To address the challenges encountered, case import files were developed utilizing R scripts to efficiently identify new cases and reinfections, and to avoid manual entry of large volumes of data, which can be extremely labour intensive. Additionally, a dashboard was created in R to facilitate ongoing monitoring of the epidemic.",
          "Building on insights gained from this experience, New Caledonia decided to expand the use of Go.Data for other diseases. As of December 2024, Go.Data has been implemented for pertussis, hepatitis E, leprosy, meningitis, measles and tuberculosis.",
          "Epidemiology and investigation team using Go.Data in response to an outbreak, New Caledonia, France. © Directorate of Health and Social Affairs of New Caledonia, France",
          "The implementation of Go.Data has brought together the investigation and epidemiology teams on a single platform, eliminating the need for duplicate data entries across various systems and data discrepancies across teams. Go.Data has now been integrated into New Caledonia’s information system, allowing the data team to centralize data production within a single software environment before its transfer to the data centre for anonymization. Subsequently, the anonymized data is made accessible to the teams, enabling them to develop relevant dashboards. Jean-Baptiste Gaumery, investigation nurse, reflects on his experience:",
          "\"Before Go.Data, contact tracing was a real headache, often managed on paper or with scattered files. Today, we have a centralized platform that allows us to visualize the chains of transmission in real time and optimize our interventions.\"",
          "Throughout this process, the WHO team’s support was instrumental, providing essential guidance and expertise for a successful digital transition."

          "Drawing on the lessons from tackling the HIV epidemic 20 years ago, South African society is now pulling together to address obesity. In South Africa today, more than half of the adult population – including more than two thirds of women – are living with overweight or obesity. Prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically over the last two decades and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are now responsible for more deaths and disability than HIV and AIDS or tuberculosis. Costs associated with overweight and obesity now account for 15% of government health spending.",
          "Faced with a heavy burden of HIV in the early 2000s, health advocates and the medical community in South Africa famously fought the fight – and won – to reduce the stigma around HIV and AIDS and the government ensured access to antiretroviral treatment for all those in need. This is proving to be valuable experience for current efforts to reduce stigma around obesity and facilitate access to healthier environments and comprehensive health services, including new classes of medications to treat obesity.",
          "An effective response to tackling obesity requires evidence-based multisectoral actions. This needs to include policies to create healthy environments and address wider determinants of health, as well as ensuring that all people who need to can access the right health services for obesity care and treatment. To support countries to design and implement their obesity response, WHO hosted a pre-launch webinar to announce a new Technical Package to Stop Obesity on 4 March for World Obesity Day 2025. Watch a full recording of the webinar here using passcode: uS8v^K#t.",
          "The Government of South Africa is taking the obesity challenge seriously. As a frontrunner country of the WHO Acceleration Plan to Stop Obesity, South Africa has shown strong political commitment and leadership to create healthier environments and has been a champion country leading the way on health system reforms. “While obesity prevention efforts must continue, obesity care and treatment are also critical. Not only must obesity prevention, treatment and health-care services be brought up to scale, they also need to be provided where people can access them, at primary care and community level,” explained Dr Jeanette Hunter, Deputy Director General Primary Care at the National Department of Health.",
          "© WHO / NOOR / Benedicte Kurzen",
          "The\r\ncountry has already taken some bold moves to transform the food system, enable\r\nequitable access to healthy food and physical activity and provide healthy\r\nmeals to children through the National School Nutrition Programme. \r\nSpecifically, as part of efforts to create healthier food environments, a\r\nsugar-sweetened beverage tax, introduced in 2018, has helped reduce sugary\r\ndrink purchases, and regulations to reduce salt in processed foods has reduced\r\nsalt intake.",
          "Obesity\r\nchronic care programs now need to be scaled up across all levels of the\r\nhealth system with a focus on community and primary care and referral and back\r\nreferral to secondary and tertiary care. “The task is now to replan, reorganize\r\nand reorient health services and train health-care providers to expand access\r\nto all those in need and offer services where people are, with an impetus never\r\nseen before, ” said Professor Francois Venter, Director of Ezintsha at\r\nthe University of the Witwatersrand. “And there are many lessons from our\r\nexperience in implementing large scale HIV programmes that are highly relevant,”\r\nhe added.",
          "As\r\nwith the HIV response in the early 2000s, the voices of health advocates and\r\nresearchers are critical to ensuring a person-centred, rights-based response to\r\naddressing obesity in South Africa. Robust civil society is a strength of South\r\nAfrican society that can be leveraged to combat obesity. A key player, the\r\nDesmond Tutu Health Foundation (DTHF), expanded the HIV focus of its research\r\nand advocacy to cover HIV within the broader health context of NCDs and mental\r\nhealth in 2020. “Obesity is the new South African epidemic, with many parallels\r\nto HIV. Both require lifelong care and impact every part of society. The same\r\nlevers that drove South Africa’s HIV response – advocacy, community engagement,\r\ncollaboration and long-term commitment – are just as crucial for tackling\r\nobesity and sustained action beyond World Obesity Day,\" noted Dr\r\nNomathemba Chandiwana, Chief Scientific Officer at DTHF.",
          "On\r\nthe same line, the Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA) has been running\r\neducational campaigns on healthy living for decades. As well as educating the\r\npublic and enabling research, CANSA strives to influence policymakers on cancer\r\ncontrol issues and advocates to protect people’s right to health care.",
          "© WHO / Barry Christianson",
          "To\r\ntackle obesity, action is needed across different areas of government\r\nincluding, among others, health, social services, finance, education, trade and\r\nurban planning.  Government efforts can be amplified by collaboration with\r\nresearchers who can help with problem solving and filling knowledge gaps with\r\ntargeted research. At the same time, supportive non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs) and community groups – joining forces with the government and scientists\r\n– can call for robust, rights-based public health action.",
          "By\r\nharnessing the superpower of joint government, civil society and academia\r\naction, and building on the hard-won success of HIV programmes, South Africa is\r\nleading the way and delivering the change that is needed to respond to the\r\nobesity challenge."

In 2023, MoHSS in collaboration with AMR quadripartite organizations, commemorated the week under the theme of ‘Preventing antimicrobial resistance together’ with the slogan ‘Antimicrobials: handle with care’. The event brought together the Ministry of Health and Social Services, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform, and the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism.",
          "Namibia launched its infection prevention and control action plan and national guidelines . WHO provided support to a range of activities for this including distribution of information, education and communication materials around infection prevention and control, regional orientation on quality standards, in-service training focal points, and training on water, sanitation, and hygiene for hospital quality improvement plans. Thanks to capacity-building support from WHO, Namibia also reached a significant milestone for the first submission of data on AMR to GLASS in December 2023.",
          "“AMR is extremely serious. If left unchecked it means we are heading to a world where medical treatment of routine ailments or operations is life threatening and a greater number of people might stop responding to drugs. It challenges all our efforts to strengthen health systems and achieve universal health coverage. WHO commends the Namibian Government for the strategic and multiple approaches taken through collaboration between sectors and work across the region to raise awareness amongst the public,” said Dr Richard Banda, WHO Representative to Namibia."

Antibodies to one pathogen generally don’t protect against another pathogen except when two pathogens are very similar to each other, like cousins. Once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an antigen, it also creates antibody-producing memory cells, which remain alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies. If the body is exposed to the same pathogen more than once, the antibody response is much faster and more effective than the first time around because the memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that antigen.",

Over many years and several decades, polio vaccination, using routine immunization visits and mass vaccination campaigns, has taken place in all continents.

          "When Rahmi (Mimi), a midwife from Pangkajene Islands (Pangkep), Indonesia, was young she used to wonder why her mother was always going away. “Now I understand,” she says. “She was fighting for us, her children, and also serving the island community, where her skills were desperately needed.”",
          "At the time, her mother, Rabiah, was also a midwife. She provided care to remote island communities—places that could take her up to 24 hours to reach by boat if the weather and Flores Sea cooperated. As the only health worker on the islands, Rabiah had to do it all: deliver babies, conduct health screenings and health promotion activities, and ensure everyone in the community was up-to-date on their immunizations.",
          "Though Mimi stayed home while her mother was at work, she’d often spend her free time playing doctor. Years later, Rabiah, a single mother, would send Mimi to midwifery school following in her footsteps. Her three other siblings would also become health workers.",
          "“She is the greatest inspiration in my life,” says Mimi. “Since I was a child, I saw her fighting for the community. So, I also feel the desire to be like her, to be dedicated to the island communities.”",
          "Braving big waves to prevent diseases",
          "With over 17 500 islands in Indonesia, many people face challenges accessing sufficient medical care, including routine immunizations. As a result, the risk of disease is very high, especially for vaccine-preventable diseases, like measles.",
          "On Sanane Island in South Sulawesi Province, where Mimi provides care, more than 95% of children have received their routine immunizations, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of the country’s health workers and health cadres.",
          "Because some islands are small and remote, it is difficult for each one to have a dedicated immunization centre or clinic. Without an immunization centre, some islands lack the ice or refrigeration needed to keep vaccines cold.",
          "Midwife Rahmi (Mimi) prepares vaccines at Baring Primary Health Care Centre in Pangkep, Indonesia, for transport to a remote island, while her daughter watches. © WHO / Harrison Thane",
          "However, the District Health Office organizes specific vaccination days in the communities where Mimi works. On those occasions, Mimi wakes up well before dawn, gathers her vaccine carrier and collects the vaccines she needs from the primary health care centre. She then boards a boat and starts her long journey to the island, storing her vaccine carrier within the boat’s ice box to further keep the vaccine vials cold—the same journey her mother took throughout her career before retiring in 2013.",
          "Once she arrives on the island, she and other health workers and volunteers spend the afternoons educating families and caregivers about the importance of immunization, and building trust among the community, a skill Mimi’s mother handed down to her.",
          "“When you go to an island, first, be nice to the people,” advises Rabiah to Mimi. “Be kind to them. Promote your work well, using gentle words. If they don't accept your promotion the first time, try again.”",
          "The efforts to build trust in the community have paid off. On this day, Mimi is vaccinating children at Pala Island Public School #24 in South Sulawesi against human papillomavirus (HPV) and measles and rubella depending on each child’s immunization schedule.",
          "Kurniati Yasin, Pala Island Public School #24 headmistress says, “When the health workers came to our school, braving the big waves, I felt happy, moved, proud. The programme at our school has helped our students understand the importance of health, how to take care of themselves, how to protect themselves, especially through the immunizations they received.”",
          "Rahmi (Mimi), a midwife, applies an adhesive bandage to 10-year-old Fitriani, after she receives her vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV). © WHO / Harrison Thane",
          "The immunizations have improved the children’s health, says Mimi. “I see that the children are healthier. The diseases that usually affect children who aren't vaccinated don't affect the children who are vaccinated. That's why I continue this immunization programme.” Besides providing immunization for children, Mimi also provides immunization for pregnant women, protecting them against tetanus and diphtheria.",
          "Reaching all children with immunizations",
          "The Government of Indonesia has been intensifying efforts to address the decline in immunization rates caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on reaching un- and under-vaccinated children, particularly in remote and underserved areas like Pangkep, where Mimi operates. The pandemic caused significant disruptions to routine immunization services in the country, resulting in a drop in immunization coverage from 85% in 2019 to 67% in 2021.",
          "In response, the government has implemented comprehensive and multi-faceted strategies to restore immunization coverage. A new electronic immunization registry has been introduced to ensure accurate tracking and improve follow-up efforts.",
          "To catch up on missed vaccinations, three rounds of nationwide periodic intensification of routine immunization have been conducted, targeting children under age 5 who missed their doses. Technical assistance has been strengthened for priority provinces, and WHO’s Sustainable outreach services approach ensures immunization services are delivered to even the most remote communities, such as those on isolated islands.",
          "\"Every child, no matter where they live, has the right to immunization to protect them from life-threatening diseases. Together, let’s ensure no child is left behind—because every dose matters, and every child counts,” says Dr Prima Yosephine, Director of Immunization at the Indonesia Ministry of Health. These combined efforts aim to rebuild immunization coverage, strengthen health systems, and protect every child in Indonesia from preventable diseases.",

          "Congratulations to Niger – the country has been verified by the World Health Organization (WHO) for eliminating transmission of onchocerciasis.",
          "This is a historic milestone in the history of global health achievements of Africa. Niger is the first country in Africa to be declared free of onchocerciasis, a parasitic disease caused by the Onchocerca volvulus worm, transmitted through the bites of infected black flies.",
          "Niger has been significantly impacted by this disease, affecting communities primarily along riverbanks of fast-flowing rivers where these flies breed, hence the disease is also known as river blindness.",
          "Robust commitment and a strong national elimination programme have enabled Niger to achieve this goal. Partners in the effort to wipe out river blindness included the Ministry of Health of Niger, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Helen Keller International, the End Fund’s Reaching the Last Mile Program (a Crown-Prince of Abu Dhabi legacy), WHO, thousands of community-based volunteers and many others.",
          "When onchocerciasis was widespread in West Africa, communities near rivers experienced higher rates of infection. Consequently, millions of people left these regions, often giving up farming on family land. Those who remained suffered severe symptoms such as blindness or incessant itching, which greatly limited their productivity.",
          "Professor Daniel Boakye, Entomologist and Senior Technical Advisor to the END Fund, explains the relevance of vector control interventions in Niger’s elimination strategy: “Between 1976 and 1989, Niger implemented vector control measures that nearly eliminated onchocerciasis. Black fly breeding sites were regularly treated with a rotation of larvicides, as overusing a single chemical can lead to larvae developing resistance. The Onchocerciasis Control Programme (1974–2002) utilized five different insecticides to target larvae in the rivers of Southwest Niger. The use of helicopter for larvicide treatments was costly but effective. By 2002, the prevalence of the disease had dropped to nearly zero, with only a handful of cases remaining in hard-to-reach areas.”",
          "Ongoing surveillance from 2002 to 2015 confirmed low disease rates. Ultimately, Niger has successfully been verified for elimination of onchocerciasis transmission mainly through effective vector control. Lastly, mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin and albendazole targeting lymphatic filariasis between 2008 and 2019 undoubtely benefited in eliminating any remaining pockets of transmission. Once the parasite was eliminated, people could return to the river basins and resume their economic activities.",
          "His Excellency Dr Garba Hakimi, Minister of Public Health, Population and Social Affairs of Niger, comments: “ Through hard work and collaboration, we have managed to eliminate this terrible disease. Our health workforce, local leaders and international partners have made this possible, and we celebrate them and this achievement. We may be the first endemic country in Africa achieving verification of onchocerciasis elimination, but we will not to be the last one. Niger is a blueprint for more countries in the region to achieve elimination and ensure that generations can live without the fear of river blindness. ”",
          "Dr Salissou Adamou Batchiri, Niger’s national coordinator for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, highlights: “ After almost 50 years combating river blindness, Niger’s success is a testament to the power of long-term, sustained investments, country ownership of health goals and effective public–private partnerships. ”",
          "“ Niger’s achievement is truly inspiring,” says Dr Yaobi Zhang, Helen Keller International’s Senior Scientific Advisor and onchocerciasis focal point: “ The country has demonstrated remarkable leadership and resilience on its long and challenging journey to eliminate river blindness. This commitment has generated billions in economic benefits for Niger and will create significant momentum in the global NTD community. Investing in NTDs is regarded as a “best buy” in global health, as the cost per supported treatment is less than US$ 0.50 per person. ”",
          "WHO has set ambitious targets for the elimination of transmission of onchocerciasis. Elimination of onchocerciasis, while achievable, faces several challenges and requires continued efforts, including sustained MDA, enhanced surveillance and research into new tools and strategies, which will be crucial to reach this goal. Onchocerciasis is one of the three diseases targeted for elimination of transmission in the WHO NTD road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021–2030 , the other being leprosy and the gambiense form of human African trypanosomiasis. The aim of the 2030 targets is to stop MDA with ivermectin in at least one focus area in 34 countries, in more than 50% of the population in at least 16 countries, and in the entire endemic population in at least 12 countries.",

          "Ymyt Berdibekova, a 66-year-old pensioner from Bishkek, is saving an estimated 10% of her spending on hypertension medicines thanks to a new initiative of the Ministry of Health of Kyrgyzstan.",
          "Ymyt has been struggling with hypertension for over 36 years and must take medicine twice daily. She used to spend half of her monthly pension on her treatment, and she worked in a local shop to earn extra money as she could not meet her basic needs. In 2023, life became a bit easier for her and many others because, for the first time in Kyrgyzstan, prices of selected medicines were regulated, making them more affordable and accessible to the population.",
          "In May 2023, a government decree introduced price controls for all imported medicines included in the country’s list of essential medicines, including several medicines used to address the burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as hypertension. The price control mechanism has reduced the cost of medicines for hypertension for around 420 000 people in Kyrgyzstan.",
          "Ensuring financial protection to achieve UHC",
          "Although this change has had a positive impact for Kyrgyzstan’s population, progress is under threat since the recent removal of medicines from the value added tax (VAT) exemption list. The introduction of a VAT on medicines, including those on the country’s list of essential medicines, may offset the financial benefits of the price control mechanism for people such as Ymyt.",
          "While other benefits of the price control mechanism remain, such as ensuring the availability of lower-priced medicines when people need them, constant vigilance and advocacy are needed to ensure that the population is better protected from financial hardship.",
          "Across the WHO European Region, financial hardship is largely driven by out-of-pocket payments for outpatient medicines, medical products and dental care – services that are commonly delivered or managed in primary care settings – indicating significant gaps in the coverage of primary care in many countries.",
          "For this reason, WHO suggests that countries consider exempting essential medicines from taxation and that this is coupled with measures to ensure that the policy results in lower prices of medicines to patients and purchasers.",
          "With support from the UHC Partnership since 2018, WHO has worked closely with Kyrgyzstan’s Ministry of Health (MoH) to improve the affordability of medicines for people living with NCDs. This is critical for ensuring that people do not experience financial hardship due to accessing health care, a fundamental element of Universal Health Coverage .",
          "The UHC Partnership operates in over 125 countries, representing over 3 billion people. It is supported and funded by Belgium, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Japan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and WHO.",
          "WHO cooperation in Kyrgyzstan",
          "In November 2023, WHO and the Ministry of Health signed a 7-year Country Cooperation Strategy for 2024–2030 seeking to achieve clear targets in 7 strategic priority areas, within all of Kyrgyzstan’s 7 oblasts.",
          "Hypertension is the first strategic priority area in the strategy, and the MoH and WHO will build on the advances supported by the UHC Partnership to support more people like Ymyt to ensure that their high blood pressure is effectively controlled without financial hardship.",
          "As well as improving the health and financial protection of individuals, these changes will also bring co-benefits to the wider Kyrgyz economy. Evidence suggests that the economic payoff of improved treatment of hypertension outweighs the cost by about 18 to 1.",
          "“WHO’s work in Kyrgyzstan is focused squarely on improving population health. Reducing the rates of undiagnosed and uncontrolled hypertension is a strategic priority for us for the next 7 years. Enhancing access to reasonably priced, high-quality essential medicines for those with hypertension, and for all who need them in Kyrgyzstan, will help to reduce morbidity and mortality and accelerate health and developmental gains throughout the country,” said Liviu Vedrasco, WHO Representative to Kyrgyzstan."

          "Background",
          "The RMIS is not only about health information systems and indicators, but also, and primarily, about making data-based decisions in rehabilitation. It is amazing (to see) how you can conclude on various rehabilitation areas from a few seemingly simple numerical data and, hereby, look for the best ways to strengthen the system. The RMIS toolkit is a reliable tool that, I believe, healthcare systems will be increasingly eager to use. Ms Weronika Krzepkowska, WHO/EURO",
          "Strengthening rehabilitation in health systems requires considerable planning and decision-making in countries, which should be underpinned by quality data and information. Therefore, a key action to strengthen rehabilitation is to collect relevant information, including facility-level rehabilitation data, data on sector capacity and performance, and information on functioning.",
          "The WHO Rehabilitation Management Information System (RMIS) toolkit , one of the technical products developed as part of the Rehabilitation 2030 Initiative, contains a guidance document that lists standard indicators for routine health facility reporting. This resource serves as a global standard to guide Member States in capturing information from health facilities that reflects the status of rehabilitation services in the country.",

          },
          "To support country implementation, the toolkit comes with a digital package developed in DHIS2 at the University of Oslo. This package facilitates data reporting, analysis, and quality assurance. DHIS2 is an open-source platform for data collection, storage, and analysis. Countries with their own digital platform may adapt this package based on the proposed rehabilitation metadata.",
          "Global training in Dakar (Senegal)",
          "A 3-day global training workshop for 15 participants from all WHO regions was held from 29 to 31 October 2024, in Dakar, Senegal, and supported by USAID, WHO AFRO, and WHO Senegal Country Office.",
          "The workshop aimed at building the capacity of WHO staff from regional and country offices to support countries in strengthening their routine data collection and reporting on rehabilitation services utilizing the WHO RMIS toolkit. In addition, it was designed for external experts who are anticipated to technically support countries for specific implementation steps.",
          "Participants of the Global training on the Rehabilitation Management Information System during the workshop in Dakar. Photo credit: Wouter de Groote",
          "Participants coming from very diverse settings shared some of the same challenges when trying to integrate rehabilitation data into routine health information systems, and when using those data to manage rehabilitation services and programs at facility and regional levels. I was very happy to have the chance to take a deep dive into the WHO recommended rehabilitation indicators, especially those for case-based reporting. Dr Vinicius Ramos, Director at University São Paulo",
          "Typically, implementation involves WHO, the Ministry of Health (usually represented by the department for monitoring and evaluation), national or local rehabilitation service providers, and other partners at country level. With the support of WHO, the Ministry of Health commonly leads a process that includes a readiness assessment for routine facility reporting for rehabilitation, the development of a country indicator set, defining standard operating procedures, the configuration of the country DHIS2 system or other digital platform based on rehabilitation routine reporting requirements, and training of rehabilitation professionals for rehabilitation data capture and entry.",
          "The training was run in-person and included lectures, interactive activities, group work, and case studies. Sessions were led by Dr Wouter De Groote (WHO Rehabilitation Programme technical adviser), Mr Yury Rogachev (University of Oslo DHIS2 implementer), Dr Chu Anh (WHO Department for Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact), and Mr Gerald Okello (ReLAB-HS Uganda).",
          "Participants of the Global training on the Rehabilitation Management Information System during the workshop in Dakar. Photo credit: Wouter de Groote",
          "This training will give us the opportunity to improve the integration of rehabilitation data into our routine data collection system and into the DHIS2. The availability of data will help us to target interventions more effectively, adjust programs efficiently to meet changing health needs, optimize the use of resources and improve the quality and efficiency of health services. The sharing of flagship indicators tracked by the WHO in this area requires us to review or revise primary data collection tools in order to incorporate essential aspects of indicator measurement. This will facilitate harmonization of analysis and comparability with other entities and countries. All of this needs continued efforts, and we are counting on technical assistance and financial support from the WHO to make it happen. Dr Mansour Faye, Ministry of Health Senegal",
          "Next steps",
          "Training participants, such as WHO staff from across the organization and external experts, will further support Member States with implementing the WHO RMIS toolkit for improved rehabilitation data collection and reporting, making relevant information available for health authorities' decision-making. It is expected that many countries from across WHO regions will have the data available over the next few years, enabling the planning of a better response to their population rehabilitation needs.",
          "By embracing the RMIS toolkit, we're not just collecting data – we're paving the way for a future where every individual has access to the rehabilitation services they need.",
