          "In a world where record numbers of people need humanitarian assistance and disease outbreaks are a continual global threat, the systems needed to respond are under unprecedented strain. And the resources in shortest supply are field response staff – specialists who volunteer to take their skills to some of the world’s most threatening locations. \"Before the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2015, we deployed about 100 people a year, but for the Ebola outbreak alone we sent more than 1,000. It became clear that we did not have enough adequately prepared people,\" explains Renee Christensen, Training Co-ordinator for the WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN).",
          "GOARN brings together more than 200 technical institutions and networks worldwide to coordinate and provide staff and resources in response to acute public health events.",
          "In response to this growing need, WHO created the GOARN Outbreak Response Scenario Training, a tailor-made programme designed to prepare specialists by simulating the conditions of a real emergency deployment. Participants on the 6-day course can expect as little as 3-4 hours of sleep a night, erratic meals, stressful conditions and artificially chaotic circumstances.",
          "\"The purpose is to prepare people from some of the world’s top hospitals, universities, public health institutions and NGOs to work in a difficult, fragile, stressful field setting,\" said Ms Christensen. \"We test their skills, core competencies, including communication, teamwork, and security awareness, as well as their ability to adapt to different and changing environments, to work with national responders and local communities, and to fit seamlessly into a larger response.\"",
          "All those applying are already experienced specialists in their fields – which include epidemiology, case management, infection control, laboratory sciences, communications, and logistics – usually with some experience of emergency work. Nominations are made by the GOARN partner institutions, which are expected to release programme graduates for up to 6 weeks of deployment during the following 2 years.",
          "The training is built around a rapidly developing disease outbreak scenario in a fictitious South East Asian country, Gornali, which faces a range of security, developmental and public health challenges. The scenario is so realistic that participants have been known to Google the country for extra background.",
          "The training is intensive. Up to 15 trainers are needed to run simultaneous simulations for 3 teams of 8 people. The simulation may require work in as many as 5 fictitious locations – including Gornali’s capital city, at the Ministry of Health, local hospitals and clinics, and with local communities at other field sites.",
          "\"The teams comprise a mix of different nationalities, genders, languages, and profiles. We usually assign 3 epidemiologists per team, each trained in different approaches to data collection and case management, but they have to agree on a common approach,\" said Ms Christensen. \"They are deliberately put under intense pressure to see how they will cope. The trainers control the scenario and drive the developing outbreak with phone calls in the middle of the night, news media, and radio calls that the team must respond to immediately. We watch and assess both individual and group performance. Sometimes the teams go into meltdown, but then pick themselves up again.\"",
          "Most trainees enjoy the challenge. \"The experience was incredible and will serve as a foundation for navigating uncertainty in the field,\" says Aiden*, who recently attended a GOARN training course in Australia.",
          "Maya* attended the same course. \"I loved every moment of it – even the stressful ones. I got some really positive feedback. I feel like I've been on a deployment and now all I really want to do is go on an actual deployment.\"",
          "Occasionally, a trainee may realize that this kind of work is not for them, or they want to restrict themselves to deployments in more developed countries, or in capital cities. But, Renee Christensen says, this is also part of the process.",
          "\"They usually feel it before we do, which is a perfectly acceptable outcome. They still leave the training with more knowledge about how GOARN and WHO operate in outbreak response, the realities of working in the field, and their personal limits for deployment. It is better to find out from the training, to help them be prepared and ready, and not be surprised on mission.\"",
          "Five courses have been held since the training programme was revised just over a year ago – in Australia, Jordan, Mexico, the Philippines and Portugal. In total, about 120 public health experts from 80 GOARN partner institutions and 45 countries have completed the course.",
          "The course is constantly evolving, to stay up-to-date with shifting challenges. Animal health experts are now included in teams, in line with the ‘One Health’ approach. In 2018 a new, advanced level will be developed to train team leaders. More online training is in the pipeline – using self-directed modules, gaming and virtual reality technology.",

          "Infections can spread even more quickly than rumours, particularly when there is a lack of reliable, up-to-date information to detect, track and respond to outbreaks.",
          "Without a rapid response, infectious diseases are more likely to spread in humanitarian settings, putting people’s lives at risk and costing more money and resources in the long run.",
          "WHO’s answer to this problem is in a rugged-looking black suitcase, known as “EWARS in a box”. It’s the product of the Early Warning, Alert and Response System project.",
          "Inside the anonymous looking box is all the equipment needed to set up a disease surveillance system in difficult or remote field settings, within 24 hours. What’s more, it has been configured to work in places without reliable internet or electricity connections.",
          "Flip the locks and, encased in protective grey foam, are two layers of equipment. On top is an ordinary laptop computer, a DataHub about the size of a box of chocolates, and 60 Android mobile phones, all preloaded with some simple, customized software. Underneath this equipment are all the necessary connectors and batteries.",
          "A second, smaller case contains hand-held solar chargers so that the system can run without electricity.",
          "The kit has been specifically designed for maximum mobility. Its size and weight mean that it can be handled by one person and checked in as personal airline baggage.",
          "\"The equipment needs to be very simple so we can set the system up as quickly as possible after an emergency occurs,\" says Dr Chris Haskew, an epidemiologist who was part of the team that created the EWARS box.",
          "\"Each phone goes to one health clinic. We assume that each health facility has a catchment of 10 000 people, so one EWARS kit can cover half a million people, which is a significant emergency affected area or displacement camp.\"",
          "Once an EWARS box is on-site, the first job is to create an account and customize it for the specific emergency – language, locations, users, diseases to be monitored, data required, reporting frequency, etc.",
          "The customized form is then automatically loaded onto the mobile phones that are given to local health workers, who can immediately begin collecting information. Data gatherers can also use their own Android phones by downloading the app from the Google Play Store. Completed forms are automatically sent back via mobile signal to the DataHub, which is kept at the nearest emergency operations centre.",
          "This box allows the system to run entirely offline, so WHO and Ministry of Health staff are rapidly alerted to potential outbreaks. The system crunches the numbers into automated reports that can be shared almost in real time with partners in the field, and sent to WHO offices anywhere in the world.",
          "The system does more than just collect data, Dr Haskew explains. \"There are three parts to EWARS. For the early warning, it collects weekly data and publishes it as a bulletin. Another function is to generate and manage alerts, which are then verified and, where necessary, escalated to rapid response teams who assess the level of risk. The third element is outbreak response. If an alert is confirmed as a real outbreak, then we need to collect more detailed data on individual cases. This can be done through the same app by configuring and issuing another form directly to the phones of our frontline users.\"",
          "For example, with highly-infectious diseases like measles, one case triggers an alert. Other diseases like malaria have a moving average. Once an alert is triggered, phone notifications are sent, and verification and risk assessment procedures are set in motion.",
          "The app enables health responders to access and operationalize WHO guidance in the field, such as assigning a level of risk to an alert based on a recommended risk matrix. The system also works in remote locations, where there is no mobile coverage.",
          "\"There are places, such as in South Sudan, where you walk for a day to get the information. There, you may not be on a mobile network. But the phone stores the data and, as soon as it finds a connection, perhaps from the top of a hill, then it automatically syncs.\"",
          "In addition to internet and mobile phone coverage, the other major hurdle the EWARS creators faced was patchy power connections. So, the field equipment – the phones – can use solar chargers.",
          "The EWARS kit was first deployed in South Sudan in 2015, and it is “still running well”, despite the tough conditions, according to Dr Haskew. \"We used to see completeness rates of 20-30% in the previous system, which also faced lengthy delays in receiving and analysing reports at the central level. So far in 2017, overall completeness of reporting is over 70% and we are able to publish bulletins automatically each week.\"",
          "Since then it has been used in Chad, Ethiopia, Fiji, Nigeria and Yemen, with more deployments planned in Iraq, northern Syria, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Each kit costs around US$15 000."

          "Almost every day a white van painted with brightly-coloured hibiscus flowers sets out from the ‘puskesmas’ or community health centre in Senen, a sub-district of Jakarta, Indonesia. The van looks ordinary from the outside, but inside it is actually a medical clinic, equipped with essential supplies and staffed with health workers ready to offer health services to local populations.\r\nIndonesia has taken significant steps towards improving access to health care in recent years, including the introduction of a national health coverage scheme. However, a WHO report, jointly published with the Indonesian Ministry of Health, shows that inequalities persist and many people, such as those in urban neighborhoods like Senen, remain at a disadvantage. Peoples’ age, sex, economic status, educational level, employment or place of residence can all impact their health status and access to services.",
          "When the government found that only 30% of local residents in Senen were using the community health centre, it launched a mobile health initiative called Hibiscus in an effort to increase access to care. Launched in July this year, Hibiscus aims to deliver quality services, such as antenatal care, HIV testing, mammograms, immunization, blood pressure screenings and health education, directly to the more than 120 000 local residents.",

          "In order to reduce health inequalities and identify priority areas for action to move towards universal health coverage, governments first need to understand the magnitude and scope of inequality in their countries. From April 2016 to October 2017, the Indonesian Ministry of Health, WHO, and a network of stakeholders assessed country-wide health inequalities in 11 areas, such as maternal and child health, immunization coverage and availability of health facilities.",
          "“While some Indonesians have easy access to health services and prevention initiatives, others are at a disadvantage,” says Dr Siswanto, Head of the Indonesia Agency for Health Research and Development, Indonesian Ministry of Health. “Monitoring inequalities is a fundamental part of improving the health of those who are disadvantaged, and ensuring the country fulfils its commitment of ‘no one left behind.’\"",
          "A key output of the monitoring work is a new report called State of health inequality: Indonesia , the first WHO report to provide a comprehensive assessment of health inequalities in a Member State. The report summarizes data from more than 50 health indicators and disaggregates it by dimensions of inequality, such as household economic status, education level, place of residence, age or sex.",
          "The report finds that the state of health and access to health services varies throughout Indonesia and identifies a number of areas where action needs to be taken. These include, amongst others: improving exclusive breastfeeding and childhood nutrition; increasing equity in antenatal care coverage and births attended by skilled health personnel; reducing high rates of smoking among males; providing mental health treatment and services across income levels; and reducing inequalities in access to improved water and sanitation. In addition, the availability of health personnel, especially dentists and midwives, is insufficient in many of the country’s health centres.",

My chest was hurting, I was coughing a lot and I had no appetite, so I went to the hospital where I had a sputum test. I was given medicines and I was sent home, but after a week I returned to the hospital because I was not getting any better.",

They explained to me that TB is airborne and it can affect any one of us, anywhere, and that I had to go to the nearest TB Directly-Observed Treatment, short-course (DOTs) centre to start the treatment.",

When I started medication, I vomited every time I swallowed a pill because I was taking them on an empty stomach. I had no appetite. At the clinic they gave me food, like porridge, which helped me take the medicines.",

After some time I was asked to become a DOTs centre supporter and for the past two years I have been helping TB patients with periodical house-to-house visits, to ensure that they complete their treatment. I also educate family members and their communities on TB."

When it comes to serious issues like antibiotic resistance, the reality of the situation can be daunting and it can be hard to share information with the public without sending a message of doom and gloom. The good news is that everyone can play a role in slowing the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and countries like Finland, Japan and Switzerland have found creative ways of letting their audience know.",
          "In Japan the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is collaborating with “Gundam” a Japanese anime franchise, to promote awareness on antimicrobial resistance (AMR). One of Gundam’s popular fictional characters Amuro, a mechanic, pilot and protector, has now been tasked with a new challenge – protecting the public from AMR through education.",
          "\"Gundam has been recognized by many people across generations since 1979,\" said a statement from the Japanese Ministry of Health. \"We hope many will be interested to know more about AMR and optimal use of antibiotics through the products. More awareness raising not only among health care workers but also among patients and their families is critical.\"",
          "One of the character Amuro’s catchphrases 'Amuro ikimasu!' ('Amuro is heading out!'), is repurposed on the posters to suit the cause, he now cries, 'AMR taisaku ikimasu!' ('AMR countermeasures are heading out!').",
          "In Finland, a gaming company has released an innovative game to tackle misinformation about vaccines and the misuse of antibiotics. The Vaccine Board of the Parliament of Finland is very supportive of the game saying, ‘We are pleased to hear that the Finnish game industry is a forerunner in this matter. Finland wants to promote health all over the world this way’.",
          "\"The whole game is set under a slightly-futuristic microscope, where the player has control over the position and type of human immune cells,\" said lead game designer Matthew Bond. \"It draws the player into a complex yet thrilling adventure through the human immune system.\"",

          "In Switzerland, the canton of Vaud has found a creative way to reach health care professionals and the general public using a fun memory game. HPCi Vaud, a local government health unit for the prevention and control of infections, created a colourful game for health care facilities to use in their waiting rooms to educate their patients on antibiotics and antibiotic resistance.",
          "Following WHO and The Federal Office of Public Health’s work on antibiotic resistance, HPCi Vaud created the game as part of an awareness campaign. They are sending the games to health care facilities throughout the canton in the lead up to and during World Antibiotic Awareness Week on 13-19 November.",
          "\"Our goal is to inform the public about the function of antibiotics and their proper use,\" said May-Kou Ku Moroni, communications manager at HPCi Vaud. \"We wanted to simplify the problem by outlining the behaviours that can contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance, and by offering three simple practical tips to memorize and provide answers to frequently asked questions.\"",
          "The games are sent along with other materials designed to educate health care workers and facility management about the awareness campaign. This helps them to be better placed to inform patients and their families.",
          "\"We hope this campaign will help sensitize the population to rational consumption and to become actors in the fight against antibiotic resistance,\" said Ku Moroni.",
          "More and more countries and organizations are finding new and creative ways to reach out to the general public and educate them on the threat of antibiotic resistance. As this trend picks up pace, we hope to see it raising awareness worldwide and helping curb the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance."

          "Can you explain what mathematical modelling is, and how it can be used in the public health world?",
          "Simply put, we use mathematical modelling to improve our understanding of how the malaria parasite affects humans and mosquitoes, and then we use that information to inform how we fight the disease. Modelling is important, because things don’t\r\n        always work in a linear way – for example, you can give mosquito nets to 20% of people in a certain area, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you will get a 20% reduction in malaria. The people sleeping under the nets will be protected,\r\n        but the nets are also killing the mosquitoes that land on them – which indirectly benefits even more people.",
          "A tool’s effectiveness will also be determined by the level of exposure a population has to infective mosquito bites. In areas of high transmission, an individual can be exposed to 10 infective mosquito bites each night. Even if you cut this\r\n        exposure in half, that individual will still be exposed to 5 infective bites and will likely still get malaria. In that setting, you may need a much larger effort in order to see an impact. Modelling helps us understand how these different factors\r\n        predict the potential impact of various tools in different settings.",
          "You currently head the malaria modelling research group at Imperial College in London, but your early career focused on mathematics. How did you first get involved in malaria research?",
          "I earned my Masters degree in operational research, which was essentially applied modelling. We looked at things like how to time aircraft landing on runways. I can’t say I was particularly good at it, all my airplanes crashed. I moved into\r\n        epidemiology when I started my PhD work at Imperial College, and subsequently became interested in malaria during my time at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. The thing I find most interesting about malaria is the complexity\r\n        of the disease and the need to understand so many different facets in order to be effective in controlling it – epidemiology, biology, social settings, and so on.",
          "What are some of the key skills needed to be a good modeller?",
          "You need to be able to think in the abstract and ask the right questions. There is no one single model that can answer all of your questions. Instead, you must be able to know what question you want to ask and what abstraction will help you answer\r\n        that question. In many ways, it’s less about maths and more about the thought processes involved.",
          "Could you describe some of the most important ways mathematical modelling has contributed to the malaria fight in recent years?",
          "Models are helpful along the entire spectrum, from research and development to implementation. In the product development phase, we conduct randomized trials of drugs, vaccines, and other interventions at the community level. Some of these trials\r\n        are complex, and models are quite helpful for generating simulations that inform trial designs, as well as the interpretation and generalization of results.",
          "The thing I find most interesting about malaria is the complexity of the\r\n disease and the need to understand so many different facets in order to\r\n be effective in controlling it – epidemiology, biology, social \r\nsettings, and so on. -Professor Azra Ghani",
          "In terms of implementation, various interventions have been scaled up in different ways in different places. Modelling has been applied to help us determine the impact of these efforts. It can also be used to help us determine the impact of different\r\n        combinations of tools and the best rational use of existing resources.",
          "Modelling also helps inform country applications for funding. Donors look for results-based frameworks – they want you to write down plans and budgets that translate into coverage estimates and what the expected change in malaria burden is going\r\n        to be. That last bit is the hardest for anyone to do, because it requires projection. And that’s where modelling comes in. Do the impact projections generated by modelling match your end goal? If not, what can be changed?",
          "How would you respond to those who might suggest that there is a lot of uncertainty in the numbers that these models generate?",
          "In terms of accuracy, I think it’s is important to remember that we don’t even know exactly how many people there are in the world, so no one expects to have perfect estimates of the number of people that have a particular disease. So\r\n        yes, there is a certain amount of uncertainty around those estimates, but that’s because the raw data simply doesn't exist in many countries – particularly those with underdeveloped health systems that have the highest malaria burden.\r\n        As countries improve their data systems, this uncertainty declines. Thus, strengthening surveillance in malaria endemic countries is critical."

          "In 2006 a silent health emergency was spreading in Israel, an emergency which was invisible to most, including the Ministry of Health. The threat was Klebsiella , a gut bacterium which was infecting patients in health care facilities and had become resistant to carbapenems, the most potent class of antibiotics used to treat it.",
          "When the deadly drug-resistant Klebsiella was introduced to the health care system in Israel, it began to spread like wildfire. Unfortunately, there was no mechanism in place for the Ministry of Health to detect the threat and intervene, so the bug continued to claim lives. Luckily, when a group of infection prevention and control specialists gathered at one of their regular meetings, they were able to share data and realized that they were facing a national threat.",
          "Dr Mitchell Schwaber was one of the infection control specialists in this meeting. As a full-time staff physician working in hospital epidemiology and infection control at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, he understood immediately the massive implications of this situation.",
          "“Unchecked, this bug threatened to overrun the in-patient health care system in the acute care hospitals and put the safety of the hospital system in jeopardy,” says Dr Schwaber.",
          "Representatives of infection control leadership in Israel went straight to the Ministry of Health to present them with a picture of what was happening in hospitals around the country. The Ministry of Health swung into action, listening closely to the advice of the infection control group and made a plan to bolster their health system and combat this growing threat.",
          "“Two things were done at that time, one was to issue guidelines that became mandatory for all acute care hospitals for effective isolation of carriers of this resistant bug,” said Dr Schwaber. “The second element was to create a permanent body at the health ministry level and invest it with the statutory authority to collect data from health care institutions and also to oversee implementation of guidelines.”",
          "\"The first order of business was to contain the outbreak of this resistant Klebsiella.\" - Dr Mitchell Schwaber, Director of the National Center for Infection Control and Dr David Schwartz",
          "“The first order of business was to contain the outbreak of this resistant Klebsiella,” he says. “The second broader mandate was to track and contain all infection control threats, all resistant bacterial threats in the health care system.”",
          "With this new mandate and new guidelines in place, the Ministry of Health taskforce evolved into the National Center for Infection Control (NCIC) as a branch of the National Institute for Infection Control and Antibiotic Resistance, which played an important role in bringing this increasing threat under control.",
          "The NCIC team, which includes doctors, nurses, microbiologists, epidemiologists and data managers, has focused efforts on augmenting and strengthening the infection control staff at all health care institutions, so that each facility has its own professionals who know how to implement the guidelines.",
          "“The first and major success of the intervention has been to put into place a mechanism for identifying and effectively isolating the carriers of these resistant bugs, so that the healthcare system can continue to function and operate,” says Dr Schwaber. “Major success number two has been really building up the field of infection control in Israel.”",
          "In 2017 Dr Schwaber lent his expertise to a WHO-founded committee, tasked with creating global guidelines on Carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ).The guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations on the early recognition of these infections and the practices and procedures needed to control the spread of these infections in health care facilities.",
          "These guidelines target professionals in charge of planning, developing and implementing infection control programmes. At the national level, they provide guidance to policymakers responsible for the establishment and monitoring of national IPC programmes and the delivery of national action plans against antimicrobial resistance within Ministries of Health.",
          "“The thrust of the guidelines is to show what measures have been effective around the world to prevent the spread in healthcare systems of these bugs, to evaluate them based on the level of evidence that has been generated, and to give recommendations for implementation to the countries that are going to adopt the guidelines,” says Dr Schwaber.",
          "“The adoption of these guidelines should be a key priority for all countries to face the emerging threat of Carbapenem-resistant bacteria before it becomes too late,” says Dr Benedetta Allegranzi, coordinator of WHO’s Global Unit of Infection Prevention and Control. “Other bugs such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (known as MRSA) are now widespread in most countries because action was not taken soon enough”.",
          "The guidelines should be integrated with the core components of infection prevention and control programmes and National Action Plans for antimicrobial resistance. With effective implementation around the world, we will be one step closer to achieving strategic objective 3 of the AMR Global Action Plan adopted by all Member States at the World Health Assembly in 2015."

          "In Madagascar, where a severe plague epidemic has unfolded since August 2017, the number of new infections is finally in decline. WHO is supporting health authorities to respond to the outbreak, from setting up specialized plague treatment units in health centres, to distributing medicines across the country. A particularly effective action has involved training teams to find people who have been in contact with a pneumonic plague patient – a system known as \"contact tracing\" – to help ensure these contacts are protected from falling sick themselves. A sudden sickness Rakoto,* a 17-year-old man from Antananarivo, began feeling sick one day in October. Although he was coughing and spitting up blood for several days, Rakoto was reluctant to go to a health centre. The plague outbreak was in the news every day, and his family was concerned that he might be infected. When he eventually collapsed while visiting his aunt, Rakoto’s father took him to a clinic.",
          "Clinical analysis confirmed that Rakoto was indeed sick with plague. He was infected with the pneumonic form, which affects the lungs and can spread to other people if they come into contact with infected sputum. He was put under treatment.",
          "Understanding Rakoto’s movements before his arrival at the clinic became of primary importance. The fact that he was symptomatic for several days increased the number of people who may have become exposed.",
          "Health workers spoke to Rakoto and his family to get exact details on where he had been in the week leading up to his admission to the clinic. They learnt that he had been mostly at home, but had visited relatives. He had also been to church for a healing ceremony as he searched for relief from his symptoms.",
          "The health workers passed the information along to the contact tracing team in their area, headed by WHO epidemiologist Harena Rasamoelina. They worked together to build a list of people who had been in close contact (i.e. under 2 metres) with Rakoto while he was symptomatic. These people became “contacts” who would need to take medication to ensure they did not fall sick as well.",
          "In Madagascar’s capital, Antananarivo, there are nine teams of contact tracers headed by WHO epidemiologists. The teams work with two community health workers in each of the city’s roughly 900 sectors. At the peak of the outbreak, these teams and similar ones in other districts followed over 1 000 contacts each day.",
          "Since WHO began supporting the Ministry of Health to establish the system in October, over 7 000 people have been identified as close contacts. Some 99% of them were provided with counselling and sufficient antibiotics to eliminate the plague bacteria in their system in case they had been infected. Follow-up teams visited them twice a day for a week to ensure they were still feeling well, that they were taking medication, and to answer any questions they might have.",
          "\"It is encouraging that out of the over 7 000 contacts identified across the country, only 11 developed symptoms,\" said Dr Ngoy Nsenga, who leads the WHO team responding to the plague outbreak. \"This is because we found them quickly and they received preventive treatment right away. Pneumonic plague can spread between people in close proximity. Contact tracing is one of the best tools to stop transmission in its tracks.\"",
          "As the plague epidemic was spreading quickly through September, WHO identified contact tracing as one of its most urgent interventions. By mid-October, nearly 4 000 contact tracers and team supervisors had been trained across the country.",
          "\"The Ministry of Health teams were overwhelmed. They did not have enough staff to follow up on all the cases to identify contacts,\" said Freddy Banza, WHO’s regional field coordinator for Antananarivo. \"We needed to expand the pool of contact tracers.\"",

          "The health workers passed the information along to the contact tracing team in their area, headed by WHO epidemiologist Harena Rasamoelina. They worked together to build a list of people who had been in close contact (i.e. under 2 metres) with Rakoto while he was symptomatic. These people became “contacts” who would need to take medication to ensure they did not fall sick as well.",

The teams work with two community health workers in each of the city’s roughly 900 sectors.

Some 99% of them were provided with counselling and sufficient antibiotics to eliminate the plague bacteria in their system in case they had been infected. Follow-up teams visited them twice a day for a week to ensure they were still feeling well, that they were taking medication, and to answer any questions they might have.",

          "You’ve worked in entomology for more than 40 years and recently had a mosquito subgenus named after you. How did you first get involved in the field?",
          "Quite by accident. My father had moved to a town in northern South Africa in the early 1970s where they had a malaria institute. While I was visiting, he suggested that I apply for a job there. I thought to myself, I can identify malaria parasites –\r\n    why not? I applied to the parasitology unit and got a position as a medical technologist, but then was switched to the entomology unit.",
          "When I started out in entomology, I didn’t even know that insects had 6 legs (laughs). I ended up working there for 7 years, and had the most amazing mentor, Dr Botha de Meillon. He was in his 80s at the time, and was one of the first people to\r\n    demonstrate that using insecticides inside people’s homes was an effective way to interrupt malaria transmission. His enthusiasm was infectious, and he really ignited in me an interest in mosquitoes.",
          "What was it like working as female scientist at that time?",
          "Females were not allowed to go into the field to do fieldwork. There was a sense that fieldwork was just something girls didn’t do. I was one of the first women to be permitted to work in the field at that institute. The first time I went, I was\r\n    sent to a little town on the border with Mozambique, south of the Kruger National Park. The sum total of my fieldwork was sitting in an abandoned railway station office waiting for the men actually doing the fieldwork to bring me mosquitoes to dissect.",
          "But it was actually a big breakthrough for us women. By the time I left to become a full-time student, they had changed their whole attitude and women were allowed to do the same work as the men.",
          "That was in the 1970s, and then in 2011 you won a prestigious award for women scientists.",
          "Yes, I was one of 6 women who received the African Union Kwame Nkrumah Scientific Award for Women, which recognizes female excellence in scientific research. Rose Leke (another former member of the WHO Malaria Policy and Advisory Committee) and I were\r\n    both recipients of the senior awards for lifetime achievements, while there were other young women who won awards for promising up-and-coming scientists.",
          "Do you have any advice for young women who are encountering obstacles as they try to begin careers in science?",
          "The advice I would give is don’t be dissuaded by negativity. If you’re interested in what you’re doing, if you’re really passionate about it, then go for it – you will succeed.",
          "Can you talk about what impact some of your research has had?",
          "In the 1990s, we established facilities in our lab to do molecular investigations of mosquito species that had not been studied at this level before. In addition, we wanted to improve our ability to test mosquitoes to see if they were developing resistance\r\n    to the insecticides we were using to control them. And we were curious to understand the underlying causes of resistance, if found.",

          "In 1999, South Africa had a huge malaria epidemic. Thanks to the research we had been doing, we realized that Anopheles funestus mosquitoes had developed resistance to the pyrethroids we were spraying inside homes, causing a massive increase in the number\r\n    of malaria cases. We were able to recommend a switch back to using dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and the South African malaria control programme set up a mosaic scheme to manage the resistance – meaning that some houses were sprayed\r\n    with DDT, while others were sprayed with pyrethroids. This approach helped to end the outbreak, and South Africa has not had a major epidemic since.",
          "In your opinion, what is an area where more research is needed?",
          "I recently co-authored an article showing that one of our outdoor-biting mosquitoes is now a vector of malaria. Previously, it had been understood that mosquitoes that transmit malaria generally bite people when they are indoors at night, but a group\r\n    of our students found malaria parasites in mosquitoes that bite people outdoors.",
          "This is a major concern and has been documented by other researchers in Africa as well. Most of the interventions we have don’t target mosquitoes that bite outside, yet many people sit outside in the evenings to socialize and cook – putting\r\n    themselves at risk of contracting the disease. More research in this area will be needed to reach the ultimate goal of malaria eradication."

          "You’ve spent the last 25 years working as a medical anthropologist. Can you talk a little bit about how medical anthropology is applied in the fight against malaria?",
          "Medical anthropology helps us gain a better understanding of the contexts within which malaria occurs and the factors that contribute to its persistence. For example, if you think about malaria from a clinician’s perspective, you tend to focus on\r\n    the disease and the specific preventive or treatment actions an individual needs to take.",
          "From the perspective of a medical anthropologist, malaria is just of one of the many things people have to think about and cope with in their daily life. A person may know when they need to seek malaria treatment, but there are many factors that determine\r\n    whether or not the person will actually be able to get treatment. The road to the clinic might be flooded. Or maybe the person doesn’t have money to go to the clinic, or they can’t leave because their crops need to be brought in. Or they\r\n    might know that the clinic might be out of drugs or diagnostic tests.",
          "The key point here is that malaria does not exist in a vacuum. Medical anthropology looks at all of the different factors that influence malaria transmission and why people do what they do. Rather than focusing just on curing an individual, we seek to\r\n    understand the broader contextual and structural issues that can help or hinder health-seeking behaviour.",

          "Understanding the strength of country health systems and the level of political will to provide access to high quality preventive and treatment services is key. If health facilities are closed due to staff shortages, or patients are left untreated or\r\n    undiagnosed due to stock-outs of drugs and rapid diagnostic tests, then health education programmes or new malaria treatments are unlikely to impact on treatment seeking or malaria.",
          "Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) is one example. WHO recommends that for women living in areas with a high risk of malaria, IPTp is administered at least 3 times during pregnancy, starting after the first trimester. Accurately dating\r\n    pregnancy can be difficult without ultrasound and nurses may be reluctant to provide services unless they are certain the woman is beyond the first trimester.",
          "IPTp is only one of many services provided at antenatal clinics and a lack of staff may lead to some services being overlooked; sometimes the recommended medicine (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) is simply not available. Admitting you are pregnant can be challenging\r\n    in some countries resulting in delays in accessing antenatal services; these delays are often compounded by financial and structural barriers to accessing health facilities. Identifying and addressing all of these challenges requires a multidisciplinary\r\n    approach, and that’s where anthropology comes in. I think the discussion always comes back to the relationship between the public and the health system. When you have a good system, you have good malaria control.",
          "How effective has the malaria community been in approaching the disease from this perspective?",
          "I think the malaria field is starting to recognize the need for this type of perspective. We’ve evolved from thinking about new tools and technologies as a silver bullet for fighting disease, to a broader understanding of what it actually takes\r\n    for these tools and technologies to be successfully implemented. There’s a better understanding of the role health systems play and a greater emphasis on the need for health systems strengthening.",
          "We’re also seeing more funders acknowledge this approach. For example, a call for proposals for a new vaccine will also request a strategy for how that vaccine will be implemented and how it will fit in with existing Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) programmes. Twenty years\r\n    ago, no one was thinking about things like that. So it’s a step in the right direction.",
          "What has been your experience as a woman in the science field, starting out for the first time?",
          "Well, as an anthropologist, you’re already viewed as a bit of an outlier – perhaps as useful as someone who does underwater knitting (laughs). But in terms of gender, I would say that it was never really an obstacle for me, though there were\r\n    certainly far fewer women in the field at that time than there are now. I remember attending the first Southern Africa Malaria Conference in Maputo in 1997. The meeting was predominantly men, and so I and a few other female attendees decided to set\r\n    up a buddy group. We called ourselves SAM, short for Sisters Against Malaria, and we’ve met at every Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) conference since then.",
          "It’s been a great space for us to meet over the years – and drink cocktails (laughs again). But things have really changed since we first formed our group. Now when you go to the conferences, there are a huge number of women, with more women\r\n    scientists, project leads and technical staff. It’s really great to see.",
          "How has the application of social sciences in global health evolved since you first began your career?",
          "Working as a social scientist in public health can be tough. It can often feel as if you’re stuck in the middle between traditional anthropology and hard biomedical research. It can be a fine line, and it does take some time to learn how to walk\r\n    it and be effective. But I love what I do. It’s incredibly interesting and challenging. You have to be really interested in others’ views and perspectives, and able to listen to and work with all sorts of different people. I think that\r\n    the more that programmes use social scientists in their work, the more pleasantly surprised they are when they discover what they learn and how useful this approach can be."

The treatment for malaria is affordable and the benefit is perceived by the patient immediately.

In the era when chloroquine (CQ) was widely used as first-line treatment for malaria, the change to second-line treatment with sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP), when resistance to CQ emerged, was patchy leading to even further CQ resistance across the whole country. In 2005, India introduced ACTs in areas showing CQ or SP resistance.",
          "From 2009, India started systematically monitoring drug resistance to first-line antimalarial medicines. Based on these studies, India’s National Malaria Control Programme scaled up the use of ACTs nationwide in a phased manner. We managed the complete changeover to ACT only in 2010. However, since CQ is effective for treating P. vivax malaria, it was retained for this purpose.",
          "In addition, we managed to get 5 ACTs registered for marketing by completing regulatory trials. Now we are considering a change to a fixed dose ACT which is effective in both malaria parasite species ( P. falciparum and P. vivax ).",
          "Can you briefly explain what pharmacovigilance of antimalarials is and why it is important?",
          "Pharmacovigilance is the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects of medical drugs. All new medicines are introduced after phase III trials which are done in a limited number of patients. When the same medicines are used in larger populations, some of the less frequent adverse reactions will be detected. Since there can be different responses in different populations, data on adverse responses needs to be collected from each country.",

The most impressive part is that although she has to deal with critical issues every day, she is always calm and cool. She is a big proponent of teamwork, both at the national or international level.",

That is a turning point of their life. Some sustain the pressure and strike a balance, but others leave science for some duration or even permanently.",
          "In India, the percentage of women in undergraduate science courses is approximately 40 % but that decreases to 15% at the scientist/ faculty level. So many will obtain a degree, but will not go on to use it in a professional capacity.

          "What interests you most about working in malaria?",
          "If you talk to any malariologist, they will say it is the most interesting disease. There must be some truth to it (laughs)! What makes it interesting is the complexity of the disease. It manifests differently in different parts of the world. In Africa, the disease occurs mostly in children and is associated with higher fatalities, while in Asia and Latin America, it tends to affect adults more. The malaria parasite goes through many phases as it develops in both its human and mosquito hosts – it’s in the liver and then the red blood cells of humans, it’s in the midgut and then the salivary glands of mosquitoes.",
          "The parasite has also evolved over very long periods of time and has developed mechanisms that enable it to survive, such as by becoming resistant to medicines. In fact, even the evolutionary history of humans is marked by this parasite – in parts of the world, malaria has selected human populations with various genetic attributes because they provide some resistance to the parasite. From a scientific point of view, it’s a very rich disease to study.",
          "How did you make the transition from clinician to malaria researcher?",
          "My clinical career was actually short. I was living in Sri Lanka at a time when there was a lot of malaria, and became interested in studying the disease. I conducted research on immunology and transmission blocking vaccines for my PhD thesis in London. I had planned to continue working on vaccines in animal models when I returned to Sri Lanka, but quickly became interested in working on the immunological aspects of human malaria which was very timely, given that there were many malaria patients in the country at the time.",
          "I established a malaria research unit in the Faculty of Medicine where I worked and I found myself leading a group of young scientists and, together, we were able to greatly enhance this work. We worked together for about 20 years and made some interesting scientific contributions to malaria during that time.",
          "Given Sri Lanka’s recent success in eliminating malaria transmission nationwide, wasn't this a very interesting time to be doing this work?",
          "Yes, it was. Sri Lanka had both a good malaria control programme, and a very good health system. Access to healthcare is robust, and is provided free of charge. The country was able to use the existing system to improve access to malaria diagnosis, treatment, and prevention tools. And the fact that they were able to do this during a 30-year civil war makes the accomplishment even more admirable.",
          "The tools we have are not perfect, but they are effective. If Sri Lanka can achieve elimination, we know that many others can as well."

          "As a researcher in the University, I had contact with the malaria control programme and worked closely with colleagues in this programme. And in 1998, I moved to Geneva to help plan and launch the Roll Back Malaria initiative and then lead malaria treatment and elimination efforts with WHO’s Global Malaria Programme. Being able to move from working at the national level to the global level was a great experience. When I moved back to Sri Lanka 12 years later, the number of malaria cases was so low, it was clear that elimination was imminent. The last case was reported in 2012, and the country was certified as malaria-free in 2016. The experience of working with a highly prevalent disease and being a part of its elimination from the country was a rare privilege.",
          "A word of encouragement to others: when I first started working in Sri Lanka, there was a lot of malaria. And then 30 years later, the disease was eliminated. The tools we have are not perfect, but they are effective. If Sri Lanka can achieve elimination, we know that many others can as well.",
          "What are some of the challenges Sri Lanka and other countries that have recently eliminated malaria face?",
          "Preventing reintroduction of the disease will be a challenge. The mosquitoes that transmit malaria are highly prevalent, and there is still a lot of malaria being brought into the country by travellers and cross-border workers. The national malaria control programme is doing a very good job of ramping up surveillance to detect and treat imported cases of the disease as well as keep a tab on the prevalence of the mosquito vector.",
          "The country must also ensure that awareness of the disease among clinicians remains high. When malaria is eliminated, physicians become less familiar with it and are less likely to look for it, which can delay diagnosis. Every day a patient remains untreated, it threatens that patient’s life and contributes to transmission. This is one way a disease re-establishes itself. To avoid this, every new case of malaria in the country must be rapidly diagnosed and treated, carefully scrutinized, and an investigation conducted to determine if the case is imported or if local transmission is occurring. It is also necessary to intervene to ensure that the patient’s infection does not spread onwards through mosquitoes.",
          "You’ve been working in malaria research for decades. What was it like working as a woman in science when you first started out?",
          "Sri Lanka is a great place for professional women. The culture is very supportive and, in fact, in 1960 we became the first country in the world to elect a female prime minister. I never felt like I was at a disadvantage because of my gender. Several of my post-graduate students were women, and are now senior professors and infectious disease experts in their own right. For my own career, what has been most important is the collaborations I have had with extremely good scientists abroad. Mentorship in this field is critical."

This was made possible by 19 volunteers who travelled around Damascus, providing advice and talking to pharmacists about the danger of dispensing antibiotics without a prescription from a doctor.

          "The discussion also allowed countries to share best practices and ideas on how human rights and the right to health can reinforce and significantly advance the implementation of SDGs, especially SDG 3. The event also underscored how health is both an outcome and a determinant for sustainable development for which a political commitment and stronger leadership is required.",
          "The expert panel included Ephraim Leshala Mminele, Deputy Permanent Representative of South Africa; Jennifer Reid, US advocacy and research officer at MSF, Kate Gilmore, UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights; Dr. Nata Menabde, Executive Director of the WHO Office at the UN; and Dr. Dainius Pῡras, Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.",
          "Dr. Nata Menabde highlighted the importance of advancing health and human rights through multi-sectoral approaches and noted that health is a factor that transcends all SDGs and sectors. She stressed the need to focus on the most vulnerable populations such as migrants, women and children, persons with disabilities and persons with mental health illnesses, and shared WHO’s efforts in promoting health, equity and human rights through universal health coverage and people-centered approaches. Dr. Menabde concluded by outlining WHO’s continuing commitment to the issue in providing guidance, technical assistance, building synergies and sharing best practices to successfully implement the SDGs.",
          "Kate Gilmore stressed the urgency of responding to unprecedented changes, opportunities and challenges such as global mobility, conflict, contagion and demographic shifts by strategically investing in health. She also introduced the key recommendations made by the High-Level Working Group on the Health and Human Rights of Women, Children and Adolescents and concluded by addressing the lack in leadership - the greatest barrier to the realization of the right to health, and urged countries to demonstrate that the lives of women and children matter.",
          "Dr. Dainius Pῡras proposed several recommendations for the achievement of universal health coverage, including investing in early childhood development, adolescent-friendly healthcare services, better integrating sexual and reproductive health services and mental health services and encouraging community and civil society participation. He urged countries to focus on accountability, universal health coverage, violence and primary care to achieve the SDGs.'",
          "Mr. Mminele stressed the importance of recognizing the right of universal access to health care as a constitutional right. He shared the South African experience on human rights and SDGs, which includes increased allocation of resources towards the operational realization of the right to health, private sector collaboration and developing strategic health targets that adapt to the country’s national disease profile. He noted that provision of universal health coverage, implementation of health insurance schemes, addressing the social determinants of health and promoting healthy lifestyles and behaviors are essential for achieving the SDGs.",
          "Jennifer Reid focused on the negative impact of laws and policies, such as intellectual property and monopoly pricing, on the access to life-saving medicines all over the world. She underscored the fact that MSF encourages countries to implement public health safeguards and patent law reforms to reduce prices and realize the right to health.",
          "A number of interventions took place from the floor, including the Mission of Ecuador who noted that access to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health must be addressed as a multidimensional phenomenon and that developing countries face specific challenges, which must be acknowledged and supported by mobilizing more resources. The Mission of Thailand spoke about health as a constitutional right and their efforts in improving universal health coverage and the health of migrants while the Mission of Chile shared their most recent human rights-based health policies and frameworks to decrease inequalities and promote the 2030 Agenda.",
          "The Mission of Senegal addressed the issue of making smart investments for health, while civil society representatives engaged in a dialogue that reaffirmed the benefits of civil society participation. The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Andrew Gilmour, closed the session by noting that OHCHR and WHO will continue to support Member States in their efforts to advance the right to health and human rights within the sustainable development agenda.",

          "In 2011, when she was 64, Umpun, from Thailand’s northern Angthong Municipality, was diagnosed with high levels of cholesterol and the dietary fat triglyceride. This raised the threat of suffering from a cardiovascular disease, Thailand’s – and the world’s – leading cause of death, including of people aged under 70.",
          "“My doctor advised me to start physical activity and change my diet, and after I started exercising I later found that my triglycerides and cholesterol level had decreased,” says Umpun, now 70 and a village health volunteer. “I enjoyed very much this physical activity and I felt much stronger and healthier so I continue with it.”",
          "So much so she joined a government-led drive to help fellow Thais increase levels of physical activity to curb the threat of heart and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which combined are responsible for 7 in 10 deaths in Thailand."

Public parks are becoming beacons for health, with tai chi, yoga, dancing and other healthy programmes the norm.",
          "Globally, cardiovascular diseases, like stroke and heart attacks, killed an estimated 17.7 million people annually, and almost half of the worldwide death toll associated with NCDs. The other main NCDs are cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes.",

          "Dr Pairoj Saonuam, of Thai Health, says promoting physical activity requires action from many sides, including political support, a social movement, and economic investment. “We need to change the paradigm: exercise is not just activity you do in your free time,” says Dr Saonuam. “We can be physically active during our daily routines, by walking to work, cycling to school and using less motorized transport.”"

Prayuth Chan-o-cha, who launched a weekly programme, each Wednesday, for civil servants to take one hour to be physically active at work. In 2016, Thailand hosted the 6th congress of the International Society for Physical Activity and Public Health.",

          "Chronic diseases are on the rise. There are now an estimated 422 million adults with diabetes globally. Among its serious complications, people living with diabetes can suffer vision loss. Often by the time a person notices a problem with his or her vision, the damage is irreversible.",
          "Diabetic retinopathy, which contributes to 2.6% of blindness in the world, can be a challenging disease for many countries to manage, because doing so involves two different parts of the health system, that which cares for patients with diabetes and that which cares for patients with vision loss. A lack of coordination can lead to people missing out on essential services, enduring long waits or traveling far from home to receive care.",
          "To help countries better ensure timely diagnosis and access to treatment for diabetic retinopathy, WHO developed the Tool for Assessment of Diabetes and Diabetic Retinopathy or “TADDS” in 2015. Among the first countries to make use of this new tool was Nepal, where the Ministry of Health had been concerned by the increase in diabetes and diabetic retinopathy, and wanted to use TADDS to make sure it was taking the appropriate actions in response.",
          "Mr Sailesh Kumar Mishra, National Programme Coordinator of the Apex Body for Eye Health in the Ministry of Health said “At the time Nepal had taken a step forward by listing noncommunicable diseases as a priority health concern, but it was lacking the specific health policies, plans and programmes to address diabetes and diabetic retinopathy in particular. TADDS has helped move us in the right direction.”",
          "The assessment was made possible through the direct assistance provided by the WHO Country Office in Nepal to the Ministry of Health; the Office supported the field work, monitored the progresses and provided effective and timely feedback to the WHO HQ in Geneva.",
          "TADDS was used to collect data and information about the current situation in the country, including the level of coordination – or lack thereof – across the two services, the extent to which data are shared, and the ways that patients are educated on how to manage their diabetes and prevent vision loss from diabetic retinopathy.",
          "The findings of the assessment were not surprising. There had been insufficient collaboration between the diabetes management and eye care sectors, making it difficult for health care providers to know when and how they should be working together. There were also some areas where disease management guidelines needed to be updated to reflect current best practice. It was also clear that patients needed to be better educated about how to manage diabetes and diabetic retinopathy.",
          "With support from WHO, a national policy discussion was held in 2016 based on the report during which immediate actions were defined for the Ministry of Health and its partners, including patient associations, to rectify shortcomings in the system.",
          "Since then, the Government of Nepal has been making good progress. A National Strategy for the Integration of Diabetic Retinopathy Eye Care Services into the Public Health System and several clinical guidelines for managing diabetic retinopathy have been developed in part based on WHO guidance and are about to be approved. Diabetic retinopathy has also been included in the National Eye Health Policy which is also nearing completion.",
          "Work has been done too to build the capacities of health care workers, with diabetic retinopathy included in curriculum developed for primary care assistants who focus on noncommunicable diseases. In fact the Ministry of Health is promoting a new model for its workforce in communities which supports better integration and referrals in primary eye care, with diabetic retinopathy one of the key issues addressed.",
          "To complement these ongoing efforts, the Ministry of Health has initiated public awareness campaigns targeted at people with diabetes on the importance of having their eyes checked regularly for any sign of vision loss.",
          "Mr Mishra noted “We now know best where to place our energies, so that people with diabetes get the eye care they need to prevent any unnecessary loss of vision. And we have been able to do this because we made sure we had the buy in of all the stakeholders involved.”",
          "The Ministry of Health is expecting to conduct the TADDS assessment again in two years. This will help monitor the progress of specific actions, and make sure that future work continues to address the most important needs.",
          "Experiences from countries like Nepal in implementing TADDS and other similar WHO tools for glaucoma, refractive errors and vision rehabilitation will help to inform WHO’s World report on vision which is currently under development, and scheduled for release in late 2018."

          "“My brother died from a stroke when he was 50, my mother suffered from hypertension, and I had a stroke and was overweight,” says Marissa, now 54. “I had to become healthier – not just for me but for my children and grandchildren.”",
          "Seeking out medical help, particularly to improve her diet and physical activity levels, has made a huge difference. In just over two years, Marissa has shed 30 kilograms, thanks to regular Zumba classes, eating more fruits and vegetables and cutting out junk food. She no longer suffers from hypertension or high blood sugar.",
          "Key to this turnaround has been the hands-on care and counselling provided by health authorities in the Philippines capital. This effort recently received a boost through the new WHO-backed HEARTS technical package for cardiovascular disease management in primary health care , which helps countries deliver targeted services for people at risk of heart attacks, strokes, hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions.",
          "Starting in one area of the capital, Manila District VI, the HEARTS pilot project aims to step up prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, the world’s number one killer, responsible for one-third of all deaths in the Phillipines.",
          "“It’s clear if the people of Manila District VI were more physically active, ate healthier foods and avoided tobacco, they would soon see the rewards in terms of healthier hearts,” says Dr Dolores Manese, coordinator for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) at the Manila Health Department. “We cannot expect people to suddenly change long-standing habits, so it is up to us to ensure people have access to the information they need to make wise decisions and can consume products that ensure good health.”",
          "Through the HEARTS project in Manila, WHO and partners like the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), are supporting the training, planning and other essentials needed to beat the epidemic of cardiovascular diseases. Similar pilot projects are ongoing in Barbados, Nepal, Tajikistan and elsewhere and have the potential to generate dramatic results.",
          "In Manila, HEARTS is focused on helping health providers implement the Philippine Package of Essential NCD Interventions for Primary Health Care (Philippine PEN). Adapted from WHO guidelines, Philippine PEN standardizes and strengthens care for NCDs, including cardiovascular diseases.",
          "In July this year, guided by HEARTS technical package, Manila health authorities developed a plan identifying problems, including irregular availability of NCD medicines and supplies, such as cholesterol strips, as well as the limited capacity of health workers to counsel patients and families on healthy life choices and recovering from a heart attack.",
          "The project will expand to other districts of Manila and help health authorities in 10 health centres improve access to care by systematically addressing barriers, including access to medicines, and avoiding unnecessary treatment costs.",
          "NCDs, primarily cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic lung diseases and diabetes, impact all age groups in the Philippines, especially the nation’s young.",
          "“All over the world, including in Manila, cardiovascular diseases pose the biggest threat to people’s health,” says Dr Gundo Weiler, WHO’s representative to the Philippines. “But when health services improve care and counselling for people and their families affected by heart disease, they go a long way to improving their patients’ health and preventing avoidable suffering.”",
          "The HEARTS project is part of the Global HEARTS initiative, which also includes the MPOWER tobacco control package, and the SHAKE salt reduction plan. Supported by WHO, the WHO Regional Office for the Americas, US CDC, the World Heart Federation and others, Global Hearts strives to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular disease and save lives.",
          "Dr Carmela Granada, who heads work on cardiovascular diseases and diabetes at the Philippines Department of Health’s Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, says strong collaboration across all levels of health system is essential for providing the best possible care to all.",
          "“At least informally, there are networks in place which allow better resourced health centres to share personnel, medicines and supplies with other health centres in need,” Dr Granada says. “While this works in the short-term, we need a sustainable solution to the NCD challenge if we are to decrease the number of deaths and the disability they cause.”"

Intradermal vaccination is safe, effective and 60-80% cheaper than traditional intramuscular PEP, and WHO encourages its uptake in other endemic settings.",

          "“We are now seeing a decrease in the number of cholera cases and a remarkable reduction in the number of deaths,” says Ghulam Rabani Popal, WHO Representative for Somalia. “We will continue to combat the spread of cholera through integrated health, water, sanitation and hygiene interventions.”",
          "In northeastern Nigeria, In another effort to halt the spread of a cholera outbreak, WHO together with the Ministry of Health and other key partners, completed an Oral Cholera Vaccination campaign (OCV) in September this year, targeting 900 000 people. The early detection of cholera cases in this region of Nigeria, which is suffering from an ongoing humanitarian crisis, allowed for a rapid response to the outbreak and effective use of OCV.",
          "So far in 2017 more than 1.5 million doses of OCVs were given to help protect people from the disease in 2 separate campaigns in South Sudan. The country provides a good example of how a multifaceted approach to cholera that focuses on preventative vaccination campaigns together with programmes to improve water and sanitation, work well to prevent and control the spread of the disease. “Transmission has been successfully interrupted in areas where OCV has been deployed,” says Dr Joseph Wamala, a WHO epidemiologist in South Sudan."

          "“Hold your Breath” presents the story of Russian artist Paulina Siniatkina’s fight against tuberculosis (TB). In 2015, Paulina spent 6 months and 17 days in a TB clinic in Moscow. She went through fear, misunderstanding, anger, despair, loneliness, silence, love, friendship and hope, and left the hospital with a series of artworks that tell the stories of people who shared her fate. She created these works of art to fight the stigma attached to TB. The exhibition \"Hold your breath\" has been travelling the world since then, fighting stigma and urging people not to be afraid to talk about TB.",
          "On 24 March 2017, on the occasion of World TB Day, a series of prints from \"Hold your breath\" were exhibited at the headquarters of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva.",
          "The paintings will be exposed at the first WHO Global Ministerial Conference on Ending TB in Moscow on 16-17 November 2017.",
          "When I heard my diagnosis for the first time I was not afraid because I had never really heard about tuberculosis (TB) before. During my stay in the hospital I learned many things. I learned that TB is a very dangerous disease; I learned that millions of people are dying because of it, and I learned that there is a stigma surrounding this disease. \r\nPeople who are not infected react aggressively; they blame or avoid communications with those ill with TB. As a result, TB patients are afraid to speak out and they hide or lie about what is actually happening to them.\r\nIn my experience my doctor advised me not to tell anyone I had TB, otherwise I would be branded for life. I believe that this is the main reason why humanity still cannot beat TB. As long as people are afraid to talk about it, this disease will continue to spread. I realized that I want to fight TB and the only weapon I can use is art.",
          "It is the X-hour for everyone who is affected with tuberculosis (TB). \r\nTB can only be cured after a long course of treatment whose results and outcomes can only be observed every two months with an X-ray. Everyone waits this important day. You will often hear: “I have X-rays tomorrow!” or “Mine is next week”. And then, with a racing heart you are praying for a miracle. Doctors love to say: “I have only seen a cavity like this healing maybe five times before. It’s a sort of miracle”. And you wish to be that miraculous exception.\r\n\r\nEveryone has a completely unique story. Some suffer for 2 years, hoping for the slightest change every two months, while others are quickly cured. Some people simply stop caring about it. This disease lives its own life; it ignores the laws of logic or justice. Doctors don’t dare to give predictions. Therefore, it is necessary to believe in a miracle.",
          "I made a self-portrait looking at the mirror in my hospital room. This is how I saw myself every morning when I woke up, for 7 long months. With my self-portrait I wanted to cheer up my hospital friends, I wanted to show them that I am not afraid to paint myself suffering from tuberculosis (TB). I think I inspired them to go forward with my project – they were very curious and they posed for my paintings with pleasure. The most important thing to me is that they were not afraid to speak anymore.\r\n\r\nSo with this self-portrait I make my confession, and so do the people in my paintings.  We say to everybody that we are not afraid to speak out and we want to inspire other people to break this silence, so TB patients can live without the fear of being stigmatized.",
          "Tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes are two major diseases, which are closely interlinked to each other. People with diabetes have a higher risk of getting TB than people without diabetes. \r\nThere was a whole floor of diabetes patients with TB in our hospital. Maga was one of them.\r\n \r\nWhen I got to the hospital, he had already checked into the hospital for the second time. However, he was not worried about it and he never lost his spirit. I think that he strived, like many others, to make hospital life enjoyable, if that is even possible, otherwise one would go crazy, constantly thinking about the pain and sorrows. Today Maga is rapidly getting better.",
          "When I arrived at the hospital, I was shocked to find out that tuberculosis (TB) very often affects mothers right after they give birth to their children. I found it terribly sad. \r\n\r\nAll mothers are immediately separated from their children, even if they have a non-infectious form of TB. At the hospital I had two roommates who were mothers, Natasha and Anya, and I saw how deeply they suffered. This inspired me to make this painting.\r\nI did not paint the reality, I painted their dream. In their dreams they were together with their children.",
          "When Natasha got into the hospital, her youngest daughter was only 9 months and her son was 2 years old. There had been no warning signs – she always led an active, healthy lifestyle. Immediately after her diagnosis, she realized she would be separated from her children for an unknown amount of time. She, unlike me, did not waste time crying, but began to actively fight the disease to return to her family as soon as possible. I remember that she only cried twice when it became just too difficult.\r\n\r\nWe checked into the hospital almost at the same time and we stood together, shoulder to shoulder. We shared sorrow, pain and joy, but I mostly remember the times we were happy. Natasha has become my friend, and I have learned a lot from her. She has a strong will and she is an optimistic person. After 8 months in the hospital, having gone through surgery, Natasha fully recovered and went back home.",
          "Ayka surprises people when they find out how badly sick she is. This incredibly beautiful girl has come from Dagestan to Moscow, because tuberculosis (TB) cannot be treated in her homeland. \r\n\r\nAyka was the first source of inspiration to me. I think she is the embodiment of beauty, not only on the outside but also on the inside. She doesn’t know envy or anger, but for some reason fate put her to a severe test. She has been fighting the disease since she got to the hospital in December 2014, up to now.\r\nIn her homeland, Ayka studied Economics, but she now dreams of becoming a fashion designer.",
          "There are currently five types of chemotherapy for tuberculosis (TB) patients in Russia. The strongest is the fifth type, which is used to treat XDR (Extensive Drug-Resistant) TB patients.\r\nZhanna was one of them. She had been in the hospital for three months already when I arrived. At about this time, the tests showed that her infection was extremely resistant to TB treatment. She was immediately transferred to the surgery department to prepare her for an operation.\r\n\r\nThe fifth type of treatment is used when no other medications help. These drugs are very toxic, so they have several side effects. Zhanna was waiting for all of this to end with patience. She saw many people come and go. The faces in her hospital room were constantly changing. Fortunately, after a while, the doctors noticed an improvement and Zhanna didn’t need surgery after all. \r\nShe’s now at home, she was discharged from hospital a moth after me. Zhanna spent 10 months in the hospital."

          "Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. In 2015, there were more than 200 million cases of malaria and 437 000 deaths. More than 90% of malaria deaths occur in Africa.",

WHO and partners are planning monthly rounds through to October. WHO hopes that the US$ 2.5 million needed for this emergency intervention can be mobilized in time to have a significant impact. WHO is relying on the existing infrastructure of thousands of polio vaccinators to carry out this complex, logistically challenging operation in areas still facing security threats from Boko Haram.",

It’s a necessary temporary fix to reduce malaria deaths for the next 6 months.”",
          "WHO has trained community health workers to provide a basic package of health services to communities where many people have not had consistent health access for several years. The health workers are always on the lookout for signs of malaria. They offer rapid diagnostic tests to determine if people have malaria, provide treatment, and advise on prevention. In addition, with more funding, WHO plans to reach more areas in Borno state with antimalarial drugs and support overall malaria control interventions.",

In just four months since this partnership has been developed, more than 10 000 patients have been tested for hepatitis B and C and, where needed, treated free of cost without discrimination. This programme, based on guidance from WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is now being expanded to 25 districts across the province of Punjab.",

          "Tetanus can be prevented with an inexpensive vaccine, but women who are poor or live in remote areas often lack access to essential services such as immunization and are at greater risk.",
          "That was the situation in Indonesia in 2012. Immunization programmes had eliminated tetanus in three of the sprawling archipelago’s four regions, but lower vaccination rates in the poorest West Papua region meant that the disease remained a major threat there.",
          "After a concerted effort by Indonesia’s government to improve access to health services in remote regions and to increase vaccination rates in the most disadvantaged areas, the nation was declared to have eliminated tetanus last year, meaning less than one case of neonatal tetanus occurs per 1000 live births in each district.",
          "“Eliminating tetanus was a major achievement for Indonesia,” said Dr Jihane Tawilah, WHO's representative to Indonesia. “Neonatal tetanus is a symbol of health inequality. It affects the poorest and the least educated part of the population.”",
          "Indonesia is one of many countries working to improve access to health services for the most disadvantaged people, as part of its commitment to “leave no one behind” in pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Among the 17 goals, SDG 3 focuses on ensuring healthy lives for all people at all ages, while SDG 10 calls for a reduction in inequality within and between countries.",
          "While many countries have made progress in improving the overall health of their populations on a variety of measures, national averages don’t tell the whole story. Groups of people can miss out on health services for a variety of reasons: their gender, where they live, how much they earn, their education, and other social and cultural reasons.",
          "But in order to improve the health of the most disadvantaged people and to increase their access to health services, data are needed about the health state of all population subgroups including the most disadvantaged.",
          "“Monitoring health inequality is essential to ensure no one is being left behind,” said Dr Ahmad Reza Hosseinpoor, who leads WHO’s work on health equity monitoring. “WHO has developed a package of resources and tools to encourage the practice of and build capacity for global and national health inequality monitoring.”",
          "One of the key products in the package is the Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT), a software application which was launched by WHO last year that enables countries to analyse, interpret and report data on health inequalities in order to shed light on where investments are needed to expand services to those who don’t have them and to improve their health.",
          "When it was first launched, HEAT was restricted to data from WHO’s Health Equity Monitor database, which contains data on reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health for 102 countries. The new edition of the toolkit, called HEAT Plus, enables users to upload data from their own sources, making it a much more powerful tool for analysing and reporting health inequalities across a range of topics.",
          "HEAT Plus, which was tested in Indonesia, allowed the country to analyse and interpret inequalities in many other health topics using vast amounts of its own data.",
          "As a result, Indonesia is now developing its first national report on the state of health inequality, which will be published by the end of the year and will give policy-makers valuable insights that will help them to make strategic decisions to improve health. The nation has committed to integrating health inequality monitoring into its national health information system.",
          "WHO has been working with Indonesia’s health ministry to map the country’s data sources for health inequality monitoring and identify data gaps, analyse the data and report the results.",
          "In addition to HEAT Plus, WHO this week launched two other products to help countries dig deeper into health inequalities, including a step-by-step manual to help countries embed health inequality monitoring in their health information systems, and the statistical codes needed to analyse household survey data to reveal where inequalities lie."

          "Within a minute, a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake – the worst to strike the region in more than 80 years – had laid waste to large parts of the city, wreaking destruction that would leave about 9000 people dead and another 22 000 injured.",
          "Half an hour later, Dr Ghimire, a national professional officer at WHO’s country office in Nepal, was at the Health Ministry to join the team assembled at the health emergency operation centre. He was put in charge of coordinating the blood transfusion services, including the availability of blood and blood products in earthquake response operations.",
          "“Immediately after the earthquake, we assembled and started taking stock of what had happened,” he says.",
          "An initial assessment revealed extensive damage to the nation’s blood supply infrastructure. Out of about 100 blood transfusion centres, 9 were completely destroyed and 21 were partially damaged. The Central Blood Transfusion Service building in Kathmandu had large cracks in its walls and was deemed structurally unsound.",
          "There were also deaths and injuries at two of the sites carrying out blood collection activities that day. One Nepal Red Cross staff member, one volunteer and seven donors had died, and others remained trapped in a collapsed donation centre, awaiting rescue.",
          "But Nepal had long feared a devastating earthquake and had made some preparations. The country’s first solar-powered emergency blood transfusion service centre had been inaugurated just five days before the earthquake struck. The designers had predicted that power would be a significant problem after a natural disaster; the rooftop solar panels meant that this was not an issue.",
          "Made from shipping containers bolted together for reinforcement, the design meant the centre was able to withstand an earthquake that have would have damaged brick or concrete structures. The equipment inside was attached to the walls to reduce the risk of damage.",
          "In the days following the earthquake, hundreds of volunteers came forward to donate blood. More than 600 units of blood were collected over the first three days, helping the blood service to provide an adequate, safe and timely supply of blood and blood products to almost all earthquake victims.",
          "“In the end, there were more donors than were expected,” Dr Ghimire says.",
          "Crucially, Nepal already had a substantial supply of blood when the earthquake struck, thanks to years of work to build a culture of voluntary blood donation.",
          "WHO estimates that blood donation by 1% of the population can meet a nation’s most basic requirements for blood.",
          "“Even before the earthquake, we’d almost reached 1%”, Dr Ghimire says.",
          "The number of donations underway at the time the earthquake began is yet another reminder of how through regular voluntary blood donations, ordinary people unknowingly pre-empted a tragic disaster and stopped it from claiming even more lives.",
          "Since 2009, the Ministry of Health had invested effectively in a National Blood Programme, aimed at developing the sort of nationally-coordinated blood transfusion service that would be able to cope with emergencies.",
          "The programme was developed in partnership with WHO and the Nepal Red Cross Society, as part of the government’s five-year National Strategic Plan. The Red Cross was tasked with managing the blood transfusion service, while WHO was involved in providing technical support to the government and to partners in strategic planning and ensuring patient safety through quality assured screening of all collected blood.",
          "“For a patient, a blood transfusion can be matter of life and death. By regularly donating blood, countless Nepalis provide a regular supply of blood, which has proven not only essential in daily life, but even more so during natural disasters” said Dr Jos Vandelaer, WHO’s representative in Nepal.",
          "Voluntary blood donation rates are not usually high in the South Asian region, but Nepal is a notable exception. In fact, the nation has more than 500 blood donor groups in the country, such as “Club 25” which encourages young people to make 20 donations by the time they turn 25, in the hope they will remain regular donors throughout their lifetimes."

Mosquitoes can transmit, among other diseases, malaria, lymphatic filariasis, Japanese encephalitis and West Nile; flies can transmit onchocerciasis, leishmaniasis and human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness); and bugs or ticks can transmit Chagas disease, Lyme disease and encephalitis.",
          "Together, the major vector-borne diseases kill more than 700 000 people each year, with populations in poverty-stricken tropical and subtropical areas at highest risk. Other vector-borne diseases, such as tick-borne encephalitis, are of increasing concern in temperate regions.",
          "Rapid unplanned urbanization, massive increases in international travel and trade, altered agricultural practices and other environmental changes are fuelling the spread of vectors worldwide, putting more and more people at risk.

          "Around the world, many people are left behind from accessing the health services they need or they experience financial hardship as a result of using them. Some who live in remote or rural areas may need to spend money and time travelling extensive distances in order to reach services appropriate to their condition. Yet others may be forced to use the hard-earned money that goes to feeding and housing their families to pay for life-saving medications – or they may not be able to afford costs at all. Others may experience adverse gender norms, roles and relations that, especially when intersecting with factors like lower income and education, contribute to differential exposure to risk factors and impede access to services. These are just some of the barriers that can hinder and prevent adequate coverage and contribute to health inequities. In many contexts, socially and economically disadvantaged subpopulations continue to suffer disproportionately from health inequities because of discrimination based on different grounds and compounded social exclusion processes. WHO advocates for “Leaving no one behind,” an underlying principle of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. One of the ways that it does this is through its work on health systems strengthening towards the goal of universal health coverage, so that all people can get the quality health services they need without experiencing financial hardship. Applying a progressive universalism approach, so that disadvantaged subpopulations benefit at least as much as more advantaged subpopulations in reforms towards UHC, is central to this.  Making health sector plans more equity-oriented, rights-based, and gender-responsive contributes to progressive universalism, as well progressive realization of the right to health. Strengthening the focus on “Leaving No One Behind” in subnational health sector planning With the aim of identifying subpopulations being left behind and working towards better addressing their needs, a process is being undertaken in 2016-2017 to reinforce this focus in subnational health sector planning in Mongolia.  The process is co-organized by WHO in conjunction with Mongolia’s Ministry of Health, the Ulaanbaatar City Health Department and Aimags’ Department of Health, with inputs for follow-up from a range of partners. During September – November 2016, more than 100 health managers from all of Mongolia’s 21 provinces and Ulaanbaatar’s  nine districts were engaged in the workshops for a “leaving no one behind” approach.  Issues brought forth by participants included but were not limited to the following in relation to disadvantaged subpopulations: enhancing the focus on health promotion and prevention, increasing outreach capacity to generate demand in disadvantaged areas, strengthening family health centres and soum health centres, improving the referral system, addressing barriers to financial protection including the costs of medicines, overcoming transportation and geographical remoteness barriers (including through mhealth), better understanding the barriers to tertiary and specialized care by poorer subpopulations, enhancing the skills of health professionals in disadvantaged areas, improving intersectoral action for addressing health inequities, fomenting social participation mechanisms accessible by marginalized communities, and enabling improved coherency and integration of measures aiming to overcome social disadvantage (facilitated by the Aimag Governor’s office). The workshops supported the inclusion of a strong focus on “leaving no one behind” in the health-related subnational planning for the 2017-2021 phase of Mongolia’s 2030 Sustainable Development Vision, which charts the country’s development path until 2030. The Minister of Health of Mongolia, Dr Tsogtsetseg Ayush, noted that the planning workshops on leaving no one behind were not only helpful in reflecting on those in most need, but timely in drafting the long-term State Policy on Health at the national level. The “Leaving No One Behind” principle will also be reflected in five-year health plans  developed on the local level to implement the State Policy. A handbook on incorporating the “Leaving No One Behind” principle in formulating national health programmes and policies, developed by WHO staff at all three levels, will soon be published, further detailing ways in which subnational health authorities can strengthen systems to provide quality health care when and where needed, without causing financial hardship. “It will be an invaluable tool for Mongolians and for the international community interested in Mongolia’s sub-national health system strengthening,” said Dr Soe Nyunt U, WHO Representative in Mongolia. In January 2017, the State Policy on Health was adopted by the Mongolian Government , thus creating the framework for mainstreaming the “Leaving No One Behind” principle in health service provision. The Minister of Health has issued an order for aimags and Ulaanbaatar city districts “to revise their local plans to reflect the implementation of the State policy on health including the “Leaving no one behind” approach. All subnational plans will be approved and signed by the Minister of Health and local governor. The WHO Country Office for Mongolia is undertaking follow-up activities supporting a strong focus on “Leaving No One Behind” in the implementation of the State Policy. For instance, the  WHO Country Office has conducted regional followup trainings covering 18 aimags/provinces and follow-up visits to some aimags to provide advice on the revision of the subnational plans and advocate for the importance of bringing in multi-sectoral cooperation at local government levels and implementing a “leaving no one behind” approach. A capacity-building workshop on “Leaving no one behind in the context of subnational health system strengthening” was also organized by WHO and in collaboration with Ministry of Health on 27-28 April 2017 for international volunteers working in local health facilities. Lecturers from the School of Public Health, Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences, also attended the training workshop with the aim of including the training’s concepts in their teaching programmes."

          "Being admitted to hospital in Chile during the 1980s could be a risky affair. In some hospitals, there was a 1 in 5 chance a patient would pick up an infection – some of them life-threatening – during the course of their treatment. Getting an infection was often considered a “normal complication” of healthcare.",
          "Many infections were due to poor practices by health care workers such as failing to clean their hands before performing medical procedures or use sterile equipment.",
          "“Thirty years ago there was a lack of awareness among health care workers that hospital care practices that were intended to help patients could frequently be the cause of hospital infections,” says Dr Fernando Otaiza, Chief of Infection Control in Chile’s Ministry of Health."

        "content": [
          "Starting in 1983 a national infection-fighting initiative led by Dr Otaiza, set about turning the tide. It started by targeting six infections commonly acquired in hospitals, including infections contracted during surgery, infections of the uterus after childbirth, urinary tract infections and others.",
          "First, the program focused on ensuring infections were recognised and reported. That meant training appointed nurses in every hospital to improve standards and change practices. Guidelines were developed on the safest way to perform surgery, insert catheters, use ventilators and so on.",
          "The results were dramatic and almost instantaneous. For some infections, such as those involving catheters, infection rates fell within months to drastically lower rates, and for the most part have stayed there.",
          "Between 2000 and 2009, infections during surgery fell by as much as 30%.",
          "“This is just good medicine,” Dr Otaiza says. “We’re not talking about very complicated stuff. It’s good medicine, good nursing, good care.”",
          "One of the secrets to Chile’s success is that the approach to tackling infections was multi-pronged and didn’t rely on any one intervention. But Dr Otaiza says hand hygiene was the single-most important measure in reversing the trend.",
          "“It’s not the only one and sometimes it doesn’t work alone, but without hand hygiene we wouldn’t have been able to show these kinds of results,” he says.",
          "Good hand hygiene is also helping to protect Chile against the threat of antibiotic-resistant infections. While Chile has seen a small number of infections that are resistant to carbapenems, the antibiotics of last resort, Dr Otaiza says the problem has not become widespread.",
          "“This is because we have good hand hygiene practices,” he says. “But we are aware that this can change at any moment.”",
          "Chile has about 180 public hospitals, and about the same number of private hospitals."

        "content": [
          "One of the key lessons, Dr Otaiza says, is that making progress against health care-associated infections isn’t just a matter of getting health workers to change their behaviours – it’s about getting the top levels of hospital management to see the need for change.",
          "“This doesn’t work unless you have leaders of the hospital on board. If you have data to show where the infections are, and if you can show that you can reduce the number of infections with the activities that you implement, you can effect change,” he says.",
          "Dr Otaiza remembers a day in the early 1990s when he and his team took chiefs of departments at a major hospital on a tour of the wards to visit every patient with a catheter.",
          "“At the end of the day they could see that 90% of the catheters had one reason or another why they shouldn't have been there,” he says. “So we started taking catheters out, or not putting them in to start with, or using better catheter systems, and the infections dropped immediately.”",
          "Dr Otaiza says the benefits haven’t only been in terms of infections averted and lives saved – they’ve also been financial. While the exact economic return is difficult to quantify, a Ministry of Health study a decade ago concluded the infection prevention programme could triple its budget and still save money.",
          "The challenge now is to sustain the gains and guard against health workers and hospital managers becoming bored with or complacent about hand hygiene. Changing technologies also present a challenge – every new medical device is a new opportunity for infections, often requiring a unique method for disinfection."

          "“The world is far better prepared for another Ebola outbreak,” said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, today at a celebratory event to recognize the Governments and people of the three most-affected countries for their contribution to the control of the Ebola outbreak in 2014-15.",
          "Dr Chan joined the President of the Republic of Guinea, HE Professor Alpha Conde, His Excellency Minister of Health, Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, and representatives from the Governments of Liberia and Sierra Leone, in celebrating the successful development of the world’s first vaccine against Ebola. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, Regional Director of WHO’s Office of the African Region, was also present at this celebration.",
          "“This truly remarkable achievement is thanks to collaborative efforts of the Government of Guinea, health workers, local and international scientists, public and private entities, international donors and, above all, the thousands of people who consented to be vaccinated in this vaccine trial,” she said.",
          "In December 2016, The Lancet published results of the WHO-led Guinea ring vaccination trial, showing that the world’s first Ebola vaccine provides substantial protection. Among more than 11 000 people who were vaccinated in the trial, no cases of Ebola virus disease occurred.",
          "Building on the work done to fast-track the development and testing of this vaccine, WHO established the R&D Blueprint to help cut the time in future for the development of new vaccines and treatments against new and emerging infectious diseases including Lassa Fever and MERS Coronavirus.",

          "In the busy corridors of a Yaoundé hospital, Esther Sabouangis is attending an antenatal appointment. She is in her early thirties and expecting her third child.",
          "\"I am sleeping under an insecticide-treated net and have taken the medication against malaria every time. I never had any fever during pregnancy – and I never got sick. I am very happy about this – for my baby and for myself.\"",
          "Esther is fortunate enough to live in a major city in Cameroon where communication about the risks of malaria in pregnancy is good. Her government antenatal clinic offers the 3 or more doses of medicine that WHO recommends to protect mothers and unborn children from the devastating impact of malaria infection. Even better, the medicine is available for free.",
          "\"This preventive therapy – known as intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy, or IPTp – was introduced in Cameroon about 11 years ago, but then the uptake was terribly slow,\" said Professor Philip Nana Njotang, Esther’s attending physician. \"It's a life-saving malaria preventive therapy and adding it to the existing antenatal care package, together with insecticide treated nets, seemed like an obvious and simple way to get it to expectant mothers.\"",
          "Approximately 52 million women living in sub-Saharan Africa become pregnant each year and are at risk of exposure to Plasmodium falciparum , the deadliest malaria parasite, and the most prevalent on the African continent. IPTp can prevent maternal and infant death, anaemia and the other adverse effects of malaria in pregnancy.",
          "IPTp is recommended by WHO for all pregnant women living in areas of stable malaria transmission in Africa. Doses should be given at routine antenatal care visits starting as early as possible in the second trimester.",
          "WHO has been tracking implementation of its recommendations for malaria prevention in pregnant women. The 2016 World malaria report showed important progress: nearly 1 in 3 eligible pregnant women received the recommended 3 or more doses of IPTp in 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.",
          "However, an estimated 69% of pregnant women are still not receiving the recommended number of IPTp doses. This year, on World Malaria Day, WHO is calling on all malaria-endemic countries in Africa, and their development partners, to urgently close the gap in access to IPTp and other critical malaria prevention tools.",
          "\"Today, in Yaoundé, I believe about 80% of our pregnant women can have access to all 3 doses of this medication. But in the periphery, in the rural areas – it's a different story,\" said Prof Nana.",
          "In rural areas, health services are more sparse and women frequently have less information. Even if they are aware of the benefits of IPTp, they often can only obtain it at private pharmacies, which can be cost prohibitive.",
          "\"Our national health system across the 10 regions of Cameroon is currently not robust enough to serve our population with this type of routine care. If our professional societies, such as the Society of Paediatricians and Society of Obstetricians, for example, could help to implement these recommendations, it would strengthen the capacity and promote such services and we would be in far better shape,\" suggested Professor Nana.",
          "Esther is indeed one of the lucky mothers. She has enjoyed three healthy malaria-free pregnancies and is looking forward to the birth of her third child."

          "Since 1981, when Leo Makita started working against malaria in Papua New Guinea as a way to pay for his graduation gown, he has overseen a major shift in tactics, away from indoor residual spraying to bednets.",
          "The mosquito net that has cut malaria’s threat to Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a simple tool, but the path required to achieve its widespread use has been anything but simple for public health workers like Leo Makita.",
          "Born in PNG, he earned a Diploma in entomology, parasitology and microbiology in Kuala Lumpur, then earned a degree in public health from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. But before all that schooling, Makita had already embarked on what was to become his life’s work: he joined the country’s malaria control programme just after graduating from the University of PNG in 1981. “I needed some money to pay for my graduation gown,” he said in a telephone interview last month from Geneva, where he was attending a meeting of WHO’s Malaria Policy Advisory Committee.",
          "He got it – and more. Makita has overseen a major shift in the tactics used to fight malaria, which were then centered on spraying the interior walls of dwellings with insecticides, known as indoor residual spraying (IRS). The government-run vertical programme was separated from other health services and administered from Port Moresby, the capital city where he is based. It was massive. “They had people employed in every province – sprayers , team leaders, microscopists, entomology teams, you name it.”",
          "After entomologists identified the mosquitoes responsible for malaria transmission, teams conducted house-to-house spraying.\r\nBut spraying ceased in the mid-1980s, as costs rose and its effectiveness declined. The insecticides had caused the mosquitoes to change their biting patterns. And the parasites had begun developing resistance to chloroquine, one of the workhorse anti-malarial drugs."

          "In the late 1980s, the government integrated the anti-malaria programme into the country’s general health services. Cutbacks in malaria staffing and funding followed. “Malaria control was more or less dead,” said Makita. In the 1990s, the Institute of Medical Research in PNG carried out studies that looked at the impact on malaria of nets dipped into the insecticide permethrin. “Results showed there was a lot of protective effect,” Makita said. But the nets needed to be re-treated every six months – a major drawback in a country like PNG, where most of the population at high risk of malaria can be reached only by helicopter.",
          "That problem was overcome around 2000, when long-lasting insecticidal nets, or LLINs, were developed and proved effective for 3 years. In 2003, the Global Fund began paying for nets for everyone who needed one, and for their delivery to people in often remote areas. Their impact was huge.",
          "“Our challenge now is to maintain those gains that we have made and even reduce cases further.” - Leo Makita, PNG National Malaria Control Programme",
          "Together with the preventive measures of LLIN distribution, PNG’s treatment policy was changed to the more effective artemisinin-based combination therapy. Rapid diagnostic tests were introduced country-wide, enabling accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment.Mass distribution of LLINs, RDTs and effective treatment has seen massive reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality.",
          "“Our challenge now is to maintain those gains that we have made and even reduce cases further,” Makita said. “Funding is our major problem at the moment.” The 80%-90% coverage in mosquito nets that had been achieved cannot be maintained in the face of the cutbacks, he said. “We need to now be very selective.” That may mean that residents of urban areas, where many people can afford to pay for their nets, will stop getting them free, he said."

That’s where people lose their lives.” Makita’s experience goes beyond what he learned in school. When he first started working in the field, he wound up with cerebral malaria but did not move quickly to treat it and suffered seizures. “I nearly even went into a coma.”",
          "Since then, he has gotten malaria twice more, but now he responds quickly. “I get myself treated as early as possible.”"

          "How did the decision to establish the WHO Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) come about?",
          "The decision to form the MPAC came from a desire to establish a clearer, more transparent system for the development of global policy recommendations on malaria. The initial push came from Rob Newman, the Global Malaria Programme’s (GMP) previous director, who wanted to ensure that there was a systematic and deliberate process for ensuring that policy recommendations were informed by a careful review of existing evidence by a group of experts with a wide range of experience. After a series of consultations to define the terms of reference and select members, the first MPAC meeting was held in January 2012.",
          "What is the role of MPAC now?",
          "MPAC formally advises GMP and the WHO Director General on malaria policy. The committee is comprised of 15 members with a wide range of experience representing different disciplines in malaria and with experiences ranging from policy to research to implementation. We meet every 6 months to review evidence and advise on whether new policy recommendations are needed. The global community has been very supportive of MPAC from the outset, but there were some people that said, “How can a group of 15 people possibly cover all of these topics?” And of course that is right, but that was never the intention for how MPAC would work.",

          "To ensure our recommendations to WHO are robust, we also often ask other key groups – both within and outside the malaria field – to participate. Together with the GMP Secretariat, MPAC will assemble standing technical expert groups or evidence review groups to help guide thinking around high priority areas in need of a policy decision. In addition, the MPAC meetings are open; anyone can register and attend. We have sometimes up to 80 people in the room, and we really welcome and encourage contributions from the floor, whether it’s questions or position statements. We also have a number of standing observers representing key partners, regional representatives, national programmes, and funders. There are a lot of active contributors, which is critical. Because in the end, policy is only relevant if it is useful to the people that have to implement it.",
          "How are new members selected?",
          "Anyone can apply or be nominated at any time, and we also issue calls for new members from time to time when there are open seats to fill. We keep a database of people who are interested in joining, and we refer to that database whenever there are vacancies on the committee. When we select a new member, we try to be as diverse and representative as possible in all terms: disciplines, geography, implementation vs research experience, and so on. The key requirement is that the group as a whole must be able to listen to, assess, and distill research evidence to form policies that are useful and can be effectively implemented in countries. Naturally, the group has been very diverse, and includes people that have been heads of malaria control programs and leaders of large research groups.",
          "At this year’s meeting, it was pointed out that progress in the malaria fight has continued despite the fact that funding has plateaued over the last several years. Why do you think this is the case?",
          "Well, let’s look first at the good news. Since 2000, we’ve seen an incredible increase in funding for malaria – from a couple hundred million dollars a year to more than US$ 2 billion. Funding levels have obviously plateaued over the last several years, but what is really striking is when you look at the trends for uptake of important tools like bednets, indoor residual spraying, and preventive therapies. Coverage with these tools has continued to steadily increase throughout this same time period. To me, that implies that we might be getting more efficient using a fixed amount of money.",
          "We know for certain that we need substantially more funding to realize the full potential of the interventions we have, particularly in terms of reaching malaria elimination."

          "You cannot continue to have constant improvement in coverage with flat funding, but it’s really encouraging to see steady improvement with no real sign of the trends slacking off. What you can’t say, of course, is whether those trends wouldn't have been even steeper with more funding. Maybe it speaks to the absorptive capacity – that the amount of money we had at the time was about right for what countries could absorb, in terms of implementation capacity.",
          "That doesn’t mean we should be complacent – it’s just an interesting observation. We know for certain that we need substantially more funding to realize the full potential of the interventions we have, particularly in terms of reaching malaria elimination. The majority of malaria cases are in 13 African countries with very high malaria transmission and coverage gaps with these tools. So clearly much remains to be done. We also know we are facing the possibility of drug resistance spreading and insecticide resistance getting worse. These potential threats are always in the background, and we need to be realistic.",
          "Do you think the current malaria research agenda is aggressive enough to address these potential challenges?",
          "Whenever we’re asked the question “Are we doing enough?” the answer is always no (laughs). You always want new drugs to be available more quickly, vaccine development to happen faster, and so on, but I think progress is good. New funding from the Gates Foundation and others has had a very positive effect on product development, and new private-public partnerships and groups like the Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) are driving the agenda. Options are increasing, additional technologies are being developed, the research community is developing new approaches like gene editing, which is basically engineering mosquitoes to be resistant to malaria parasites. There is quite a lot to be excited about.",
          "You have been the chair of the MPAC since its inception in 2012. What has your experience in this role been like?",
          "I just want to say that I’ve found it really enlightening and enjoyable to be working as a part of WHO over the years. WHO as an organization is absolutely critical to the global health sector, and it’s important that researchers, policymakers and funders recognize the fundamentally important role of the organization in pursuing a robust global health agenda. It’s worrying to see that global funding for WHO is somewhat precarious. It’s great that other large funders have been stepping in and supporting WHO activities, but we also need to see increased Member State contributions to WHO so that it can continue the important work of setting global standards and guidance across diverse health sectors."

          "Despite a rainy season that never ends, a limited infrastructure and near-inaccessible geography, Papua New Guinea has made major strides against malaria. Credit goes to its focus on preventive tools, including bednets.",
          "It would be tough to find a location more hospitable to the spread of malaria than Papua New Guinea (PNG). “This country has very, very difficult geography, with little infrastructure,” said Tim Freeman, a logistician for Rotarians Against Malaria. At 61, Freeman has spent more than half of his life fighting malaria. He is the kind of guy you want nearby if your car gets stuck in the mud, which he has seen happen a lot while overseeing the distribution of more than 5 million insecticide-treated mosquito nets in PNG. It contains areas so remote that, until the 1990s, tribes were being discovered whose members had had no previous contact with outsiders.",
          "Even now, some villages have no roads. Delivery of nets can require an airplane, helicopter, boat, truck and days of walking – often in the rain. “It is always the rainy season; sometimes the rainier season,” said Freeman. His teams distribute nets to all of PNG’s 20 000 villages – and keep track of their work. “We can tell you the history of the nets in every one of them,” Freeman said.",
          "It has been a group effort. A malaria adviser in the WHO country office works with Freeman’s teams, helping determine how many nets are needed and providing technical guidance. WHO also sets global policy and targets, and helps translate these into country-specific plans.",
          "Australia has contributed financial resources, and Population Services International (PSI), a US-based nongovernmental organization, has deployed outreach officers to teach communities how to use mosquito nets consistently and correctly, and how to identify the symptoms of malaria and seek treatment quickly. Both Rotarians Against Malaria and PSI implement their malaria activities through financial support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria."

          "Surveillance helps planners identify where to distribute bednets, and treatment of individuals prevents other cases from occurring, he said. “If there are people with malaria parasites walking around, the mosquitoes will get infected and transmit it to other people,” he said."

Malaria programmes in these countries will need to explore other funding arrangements, including increased support from domestic resources.",

That finding has alarmed public health officials, who depend heavily on these interventions.",

          "To help countries safely treat, manage and reuse wastewater, WHO developed the Sanitation Safety Planning (SSP) a risk management tool in 2016. The tool helps sanitation operators apply WHO's Guidelines for safe use of wastewater, excreta and greywater in agriculture and aquaculture and identify and manage the health risks along the sanitation chain. The multi-barrier approach used means risk can be reduced through simple measure even when expensive treatment is not feasible in the short term.",
          "Last year, WHO provided SSP training to 34 participants from 6 countries in the South-East Asia Region in order to create regional champions who could further support countries to safely manage their sanitation systems. To learn how to identify risks in sanitation systems, the participants visited the East Kolkata Wetlands and interviewed farmers in the area.",
          "WHO is now conducting a risk-assessment of the East Kolkata Wetlands utilizing the guidelines and SSP tool to help the city understand how to improve the system and reduce health risks to both fishermen and farmers who live in the area, as well as the wider community consuming the fish and vegetables produced.",

          "Medical teams supported by WHO set up mobile clinics in hard to access areas of north-eastern Nigeria. The teams are called “hard-to-reach” teams (HTR) because their mission is to reach remote and insecure areas to provide urgently needed care to populations deprived of essential health services. The 8-year conflict has caused widespread forced displacement and acute food and nutrition insecurity. Large areas of Borno state, the most-affected state, remain inaccessible to humanitarian assistance. The years of violent conflict in north-eastern Nigeria have deprived millions of people of even the most basic of health care services. The full scale of the humanitarian crisis begins to be revealed as towns and villages, previously occupied by armed groups, gradually become more accessible. Malnutrition is widespread and nearly 6 million men, women, children and infants urgently need health assistance. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Two-thirds of hospitals, clinics and other health facilities in the most affected states have been completely or partially damaged. Those that are functioning are often difficult to access, are short of health-care staff, lack basic medical equipment and medicines and seldom have access to safe water. As a result, the mobile teams set-up makeshift clinics under the shade of trees. Humanitarian partners are scaling up their response to the crisis, but with ongoing insecurity, reaching those in need in remote communities or internal displacement camps can be difficult and dangerous. HTR medical teams are bringing basic health-care services to remote communities and to populations displaced by conflict. Ongoing insecurity means the teams are often based in towns that can only be reached by helicopter. From these bases, they deploy on a daily basis to surrounding areas, setting up clinics under trees to provide life-saving health care. In a small village, a crowd of women and children wait patiently in the midday sun to be treated by one of the 24 HTR teams. Three-month-old Abubakar is the youngest of Zainab’s 7 children and is having breathing difficulties. But Zainab has a fever too. The health worker tests her for malaria and assesses Abubakar to see if he can be treated by the team or needs to be referred to the nearest functioning health-care facility. Malaria is the most common cause of disease and death in the conflict-affected zone, but acute respiratory infection also claims many lives. Screening for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is one of the key activities of the HTR teams. Malnourished children are particularly vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases, like measles and diphtheria, and to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases. The combination of these diseases together with high levels of SAM in Borno State has led to under-5 mortality rates up to 4 times higher than international emergency thresholds. Children and babies identified with SAM are referred to government- and partner-run facilities, where they can receive therapeutic feeding. Here the teams are attending induction training before deploying to the field. Teams are made up of nurses, midwives and community health workers. In addition to screening for SAM and testing and treating for malaria, the teams carry out a number of other vital primary health-care functions, including vaccinating children against polio, measles, yellow fever and other diseases normally included in routine immunization programmes. Pregnant women who have been unable to access basic antenatal care are monitored by the HTR teams, given folic acid and iron supplements and, where necessary, receive intermittent preventive treatment for malaria. The HTR teams return at least once a month, as the security situation permits, ensuring continuity of care for pregnant women and for routine immunizations. The teams dispense medicines to treat malaria and minor ailments, as well as vitamin A supplements and deworming tablets for children. The teams also carry out health promotion activities, teaching communities about important practices, such as hygiene and exclusive breastfeeding. The 24 HTR teams give consultations to approximately 4000 people every week. This is just one of the mechanisms put in place by the government, WHO and partners, and other organizations working to scale up the response to the crisis and deliver essential, life-saving health services to conflict-affected areas."

We waited for the first patients to arrive, but no one came.",
          "Ten hours later, at 15:00 in the afternoon, we were told that the first convoy was on its way. When I saw the first ambulance arrive, I started crying. I was not the only one –I noticed other colleagues hiding their tears. It was an unbelievable feeling of relief that this was finally happening. We had been waiting for this moment for the past 3 months. All of our plans were for this moment to happen.”",

His parents were on another bus and he had faced the long journey alone with a broken arm. Thankfully, one of the medical staff reunited him with his family. I will never forget his face when he first arrived, looking lost and alone. I am sure he will never forget this experience, too.”",

          "In total, 811 patients were referred to hospitals in west Aleppo and Idleb, including 100 women and almost 150 children.

          "“Despite the operational and political challenges, as we planned for the evacuations, the progress made was remarkable and reflects the professionalism and dedication of our teams. This was yet another example of solidarity and outstanding commitment to the humanitarian cause,” said Dr Pavel Ursu, WHO Representative in Turkey.",
          "“We consider the evacuations a landmark achievement within the context of this tragic crisis. And it was made possible through the strong coordination and collaboration of all partners on the ground who worked tirelessly under extremely challenging conditions, with almost no sleep, standing for days in the rain and snow to help the people of eastern Aleppo,” said Ms Elizabeth Hoff, WHO Representative in Syria."

          "On 26 January 2017, Dr. Peter Salama, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, joined Mr. Stephen O’Brien, UN Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator, and Mr. Amir Mahmoud Abdulla, Deputy Executive Director of the World Food Program, to brief the UN Security Council on the on-going challenges and UN system-wide efforts to provide protection, food, and medical supplies and care in Syria.",
          "Peter Salama, WHO, at the UN Security Council briefing on Syria",
          "Dr. Salama, connected via video link, highlighted the devastating impact the war has had not only on civilians but also on the Syrian health system – both in terms of human resources and infrastructure – noting that almost two thirds of health care workers have fled the country and that more than 100 attacks on hospitals have occurred in 2016. He emphasized the extent of the indirect toll of the war on civilian lives, particularly in regard to the substantial amount of children missing immunizations and at risk of developing mental health disorders, as well as pregnant women unable to access urgent care. Despite the challenges on the ground, WHO and its UN and NGO partners have found innovative means of service delivery and, with the support of the remaining Syrian health care workers, have been able to vaccinate 2.5 million children, deliver more than 10 million treatments and train 16,000 health care workers, as well as provide assistance in medical evacuations. WHO stands ready to scale-up programmes and provide medical supplies, given a logistic system is put in place to deliver them. Dr. Salama concluded with four requests to the Security Council to ensure the evacuation of critically ill patients, sustained and unconditional access for medical teams in all areas of Syria and essential health supplies into hard to reach and besieged areas, as well as an end to attacks on health care workers and ensuring that perpetrators are held accountable. Under-Secretary-General O’Brien referred to the overwhelming levels of devastation seen in 2016 as a “complete meltdown of humanity,” stressing that only a political solution will be effective and calling for a consolidation and extension of the current ceasefire. He highlighted, with utmost concern, the diminishing access and administrative delays which have been crippling the UN and relief agencies’ abilities to provide assistance on the ground and called on council members to do more to ensure the support of the Syrian government to deliver life-saving assistance through existing structures and mechanisms. Despite the obstacles faced, Mr. O’Brien recognized the reach of the UN system’s response, which has accounted for nearly 90 per cent of the supplies distributed. Last week 19 million USD was released from the OCHA-managed Syria Humanitarian Fund to support immediate life-saving and early recovery assistance and the UN maintains its capacity to respond to hundreds of thousands of people, should access be granted.",
          "Mr. Abdulla, WFP stressed that the situation remains grave – four out of five people are living in poverty and half of the current population is in need of food, agriculture and livelihood assistance – that is, 7 million people who are food insecure and an additional 2 million at risk. Further, food production has hit a record low, food prices have increased by up to 43% in hard to reach and besieged areas, fuel and land are in short supply, and agriculture infrastructure has been damaged in the conflict – all of which threatens to render Syria a nation of subsistence farming. Mr. Abdulla highlighted a high altitude parachute drop, an inter-agency operation, which although having been successful in delivering aid, has been suspended as of January 15 due to deteriorating conditions.",
          "Following the briefings, Uruguay and Bolivia both made brief remarks to express concern for the humanitarian situation in Syria."

          "The event highlighted New York City’s innovative approach to tackling mental health against the backdrop of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and shared best practices from countries and cities around the world. One of the innovative solutions established by NY City is ThriveNYC launched in 2015. Thrive NYC is a package of initiatives costing $850 million over four years that links action at local level with the 2030 agenda, and illustrates how NYC aims to meet all the SDGs though activities focused on health, the environment, etc.",
          "Chirlane McCray, the first lady of New York, shared the city’s recent experiences in implementing its new mental health agenda. She highlighted that one in five Americans struggle with mental health problems, substance abuse or both, New York not being an exception. The city has addressed this with several actions such as, increased the number of institutions treating mental health patients and number of mental health professionals and shifting tasks from health care professionals to other community stakeholders such as teachers and workplaces to ensure there will be enough health care professionals to respond to mental health needs. This has seen an 80 percent increase in treatment of postpartum depression in city-run hospitals and the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. Ambassador Dessima Williams, Special Adviser for the implementation of the SDGs in the office of the President of the UN General Assembly, stressed the interconnection of the SDGs and the need to prioritize the implementation of the health goal because there is no action without health. She mentioned important recent events that addressed mental health such as the World Innovation Summit for Health held in Qatar and the Universal Health Coverage day event hosted by WUN. Ambassador Caleb Otto of Palau spoke about the importance to discuss mental health more widely in order to reduce the stigmas, and to treat mental health disorders like any other disease. Richard Buery, NYC Deputy Mayor for Strategic Policy Initiatives underlined that mental health problems also lead to major economic losses and decreased safety. The key is to expand service availability and bring them closer to people, in collaboration with local communities. New York City has launched a project that enables obtaining a certification for “mental health first aid” and will send invitations and more information on such training to Permanent Missions in the coming weeks. Caleb Otto, Ambassador of Palau to the United Nations The expert panel included Dr Gary Belkin, NYC Executive Deputy Commissioner for Mental Health; Ana Bermudez, Commissioner, NYC Department of Probation; Dr Sidney Hankerson from Columbia University; Anna Ortega-Williams from Red Hook Initiative and Dr Kishor Malawade from Maimonides Medical Center. They discussed how health systems can better partner with other stakeholders and address the growing needs for care. Dr Malawade said that it is crucial to redesign health systems to respond to the needs and new modes of mental health care and this should start with engaging patients and health care providers in the primary health care setting, and to include behavioral- and mental health promotion and treatment. Commissioner Bermudez noted that the criminal justice system in its current form does not promote mental health goals but the opposite - it creates stigmas and intensifies existing health problems. NYC City Department of Probation is working on shifting the perspective from isolation of criminals to improving their well-being. Dr Hankerson stressed that young mental health patients need to be approached in their own language and level, otherwise messages do not reach them. He also provided examples of partnership with faith based organizations and how church communities are establishing mental health support groups for their members and communities. Several UN Member States took the floor to share their perspectives and mental health initiatives. Canada flagged that mental health is a national priority for the Prime Minister and that they had launched several programmes including collaboration with Bell telecommunication company that donates 5 cents to mental health care from every text message with the hashtag #let’s talk. Costa Rica noted that it is necessary to provide treatment and alternative solutions to the large populations with mental health disorders. Chile underlined mental health care as a solid part of the right to health. Belgium shared their experiences of piloting new community-based health care programmes for adults that are easily available, invest in early detection, and rely strongly on community health networks. If successful, the programme will be extended to include children and older people."

          "As the UN Resident Coordinator, Ms Claire Van Der Vaaren, indicated, “… the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development offers multiple avenues for cross-sectoral NCD responses.” and “… reducing NCD risk factors requires collaboration across sectors and stakeholders including the private sector, under the strong leadership of the government.”",
          "The Joint Mission discussed a series of next steps with the Royal Government of Cambodia to expand NCD prevention and control across the country and to strengthen multisectoral coordination. A key step would be the adoption of the NCD multisectoral action plan and having in place coordination, accountability and financing mechanisms. To support prioritization of resources and interventions, the 2016 NCD STEPS survey report will be published soon and the Global School Health Survey will be conducted in 2018.",
          "Furthermore, as a WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) 2030 participating country, the UN will support the Royal Government of Cambodia to develop an investment case to estimate the economic burden of tobacco use, the returns from investing in priority interventions, and the costs of inaction.",
          "The current UN Development Assistance Framework for Cambodia (UNDAF 2016-2018) is harmonized with the national planning process. The UNDAF reflects the growing challenge of NCDs and commits the UN to respond through a multisectoral plan of action and to support strengthening of the legal and policy environment. The next UNDAF is currently under development."

          "Soda tax in Mexico. Salt limits in South Africa. Plain tobacco packaging in Australia. National health insurance in Ghana. Mandatory motorcycle helmets in Vietnam. Health care in the United States of America.",
          "They're just some of the hundreds of examples of the vital role the law plays in safeguarding and promoting good health around the world.",
          "A new report from WHO, in collaboration with the International Development Law Organization (IDLO), the University of Sydney, and Georgetown University in Washington, DC, describes the many ways in which the law makes a crucial difference for public health. The report features case studies from around the world on how the law has improved the health and safety of populations, providing a resource for countries to learn from the experience of others.",
          "\"Some of the best examples in this report use population-wide interventions to reshape the environments in which people make their lifestyle choices,\" said Dr Rüdiger Krech, Director in the Health Systems and Innovation cluster at WHO in Geneva. \"This requires extraordinary government commitment, courage, and persistence in the face of powerful commercial interests.\"",
          "The right to health is enshrined in WHO’s constitution, which affirms that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health as one of the fundamental rights of every human. WHO provides assistance to countries that are seeking to use the law to improve their health systems, and to address health threats.",
          "As far back as 1875, lawmakers in the United Kingdom passed legislation requiring landlords to provide proper sanitation, ventilation and drainage to stem the spread of infectious diseases. Today, the control of infectious diseases is one of the most powerful illustrations of how the law can make a difference to health. From smallpox to more recent outbreaks of SARS and Ebola, public health laws can help to improve screening, reporting, contact tracing and quarantine, stemming the spread of infections.",
          "Health laws often make the headlines when they have a direct impact on the everyday consumption patterns of people, such as Mexico’s so-called soda tax, introduced in 2014 to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. In the same vein, Australia’s plain packaging laws for tobacco products have become a global standard-bearer in the effort to reduce smoking rates.",
          "\"The use of law to reduce smoking has been one of the great public health achievements, but there is so much more we could do with unhealthy foods, excessive alcohol use, injuries, and mental health,\" said Prof Lawrence Gostin, faculty director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. \"This report offers a pathway to using evidence-based legal interventions for human health and wellbeing.\"",
          "Countries also use the law in many unseen ways to strengthen health systems and help make progress towards universal health coverage. Some countries use laws to create the institutions that govern health systems, such as national health insurers, or agencies that regulate medicines or ensure quality health services are available to all people. The global response to HIV has demonstrated how law can protect people from discrimination, and facilitate access to harm reduction services and treatment.",
          "The law will be a vital tool for countries to make progress towards the health-related targets in the Sustainable Development Goals.",
          "\"There is tremendous, untapped potential to use law more effectively to strengthen health systems and change lives for the better,\" said Prof Roger Magnusson, professor of health law and governance at the University of Sydney, and one of the report’s authors. \"The law is a powerful tool to help people live longer and healthier lives, and for economies to be more resilient.\"",
          "While laws can help to protect health, their absence or neglect can expose entire populations to health threats. Weak regulation of tobacco products in some countries allows powerful companies to market those products unfettered, and to recruit young smokers. At a global level, WHO’s International Health Regulations and Framework Convention on Tobacco Control provide legal frameworks for responding to public health emergencies and the global tobacco epidemic. But the failure of some countries to comply with them puts the world at risk of potentially catastrophic outbreaks and the long-term costs and health impacts of smoking.",
          "And unfortunately, the law can and has been used to harm health. Laws have been used to incarcerate people with mental illness, and to deny them the rights and services they need. Likewise, travel restrictions during West Africa’s Ebola outbreak prevented medical personnel from getting into the affected countries, prolonging the epidemic.",
          "But when harnessed to protect, promote and advance the right to health, the law can be a potent ally.",
          "\"One of the most useful aspects of this report is that it links human rights to urgent public health challenges,\" said David Patterson, IDLO’s program manager for health law. \"This approach, based on non-discrimination, participation, transparency and accountability, is the best way to ensure that responses are locally appropriate and sustainable.\""

This scourge gravely concerns the Government of Guyana, which views the psychological and emotional well-being of its people as vital to ensuring quality of life. There is much to be done to scale up the mental health services provided to its citizens, and the government has been working closely with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and World Health Organization to do so.",

In 2015, the Mental Health Unit of PAHO implemented the online course “Integration of mental health into primary care” based on the mhGAP Intervention Guide, using PAHO’s Virtual Campus for Public Health platform.
