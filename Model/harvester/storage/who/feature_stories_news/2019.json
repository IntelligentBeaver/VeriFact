          "WHO and its many partners regularly deploy mobile clinics and medical teams to reach people cut off from access to health services. For many people access to these mobile clinics and teams may be their only source of health care. Mobile clinics offer flexible and viable options for treating isolated and vulnerable groups as well as to newly displaced populations. When coordinating crisis response, WHO arranges for mobile health care teams to go by foot, bike, moto, boat or vehicle. The demand for mobile units keeps rising. WHO may buy mobile clinics or supply them, or pay for partners to buy or supply them. For example, last year WHO provided 44 mobile clinics to Syrian health non-governmental organizations to serve populations in hard-to-reach areas.",
          "Below are series of photos illustrating some of the ways WHO uses mobile clinics and medical teams in emergencies.",
          "An inside look in the back of a WHO-supported mobile clinic deployed in the Syrian Arab Republic. Syrian children line up at a WHO-supported mobile clinic in western Aleppo. With the introduction of the mobile clinics and in partnership with nongovernmental organizations, WHO has provided humanitarian health support to the under-served populations. This includes areas where the health care system has been adversely affected by the crisis especially Dar’a, Aleppo, Rural Damascus, Al Hassakeh and Deir ez-Zor among others. A health worker for Al Ihasan Charity and Development Association, one of the local nongovernmental organizations providing support from WHO’s mobile clinics, treats a young patient.",
          "A young student receives his first oral cholera vaccination dose from WHO's Dr Salahuddin Hussein, a medical officer working in Dohuk Governate, Iraq. This WHO-supported mobile clinic in Ukraine shows one of the many ways a mobile clinic may look worldwide.",
          "People wait for a doctor’s consultation in front of an old building that functions as a primary health care facility in Synykha village, Ukraine. Halyna, 70, cries. She has heart disease, but it is almost impossible for her to visit a doctor.",
          "“The clinic is 30 km away, the bus runs only once a day, but even in town there is no cardiologist to consult with,” Halyna said. “I cannot afford medicines. We have not received proper health care for more than two years since the conflict started. Without the support provided by the mobile team, I cannot imagine how I would survive.”",
          "To address the needs of the population affected by the conflict in Ukraine and internally displaced persons, WHO has established mobile primary health care units in six regions in eastern Ukraine. The units are operated by Health Cluster partners, such as Ukrainian Red Cross and the Hippocrates Greek Medical Foundation.",
          "In the midst of widespread flooding in Myanmar after Cyclone Komen in August 2015, the mountainous region of Myanmar’s Chin state was hit by severe landslides, and in Rakhine state numerous villages could not be reached by vehicle.\nStaff of WHO’s Myanmar Country Office did not let tough access conditions deter their efforts to reach affected populations of Rakhine state. Mobile medical teams often could not find areas dry enough to set up temporary facilities. The decision was made to use shallow-draft boats, with doctors, nurses (wearing their traditional distinctive red skirts), and health assistants delivering clinical care and medicines while floating on the slowly receding flood waters. Rahab Al Jamal is one of 17 midwives working in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, where 100 to 200 women each day, most of them refugees from the Syrian civil war, go into labour under less-than-optimum circumstances. “We have to support mothers during delivery in extremely hard conditions,” she reports. Ms. Al Jamal also provides consultations on family planning methods and offers pre- and post-natal care to women at the camp."

          "Ghana’s government is striving to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC), yet financing issues remain a challenge. To address this issue, Ghana hosted a Health Financing Forum from 25 to 27 November 2019, under the theme, “Sustainable Health Financing for Universal Health Coverage (UHC).” To achieve UHC, Ghana has identified Primary Health Care (PHC) as one of the key strategies in implementing its National Roadmap for UHC. The purpose of the meeting was to identify priorities and actions for achieving sustainable financing for UHC, through the revision of the National Health Financing Strategy and Implementation Plan.",
          "Nearly 100 delegates from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance, Ghana Health Service, National Health Insurance Agency (NHIA), National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and international organizations such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Financing Facility (The GFF), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF),  the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO) were present.",
          "Addressing the audience, Minister of Health, Kwaku Agyemang-Manu said, “As Ghana initiates reforms geared towards achieving UHC, we must mobilize more domestic resources for health. Increasing funding is not enough. Resources must be used efficiently, and this underscores the need for improving the purchasing function of health financing, including reviewing the benefits package to guarantee essential service delivery for all Ghanaians.”",
          "Ghana was one of the first countries in Africa to have a National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) that was explicitly designed to go beyond the formal sector and help people access health care when they need it without experiencing financial hardship.  However, only one-third (37%) of the population are members of the scheme, with the reliance on individual contributions remaining a barrier to its sustained expansion.  The NHIS is also skewed towards providing curative care and gives little priority to the preventive and promotive services that are needed to enable sustainable progress towards UHC.",
          "Additionally, Ghana’s primary health care system receives funding from multiple sources that are channelled through various financing agents, and the fragmentation in financing flows is a source of inefficiency. Furthermore, many of these organizations have different planning and budget implementation and reporting systems leading to delayed payments to health facilities.",
          "Acting WHO Representative to Ghana, Dr Neema Kimambo said, “Ghana has made a strong political, legislative, and fiscal commitment to reforming its health system to achieve UHC.  Despite these efforts, more health financing reforms are required to accelerate country progress towards UHC. For instance, Ghana will need to mobilize additional revenues for the health sector by adopting sustainable fiscal space expansion mechanisms.”",
          "Dr Kimambo noted during her remarks that several of the signatory agencies to the Global Action Plan are ready to support Ghana’s reforms by offering collective and coherent support to the government."

Evidence was reviewed and communities were consulted in preparation for the launch of new consolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, testing and treatment for key populations in 2014, which were updated in 2016. In 2018, key populations and\r\n    their partners accounted for 52% of new HIV infections globally, and 75% outside Africa. In some regions, HIV epidemics continued to disproportionately affect other vulnerable populations, notably adolescent girls and young women in southern Africa.\r\n    Key populations continue to be left behind. If we do not deliver high quality and high impact services to key populations and address the legal and other structural barriers that contribute to their marginalization, including criminalization, we will\r\n    never see the end of AIDS."

A 2-3-month course of direct-acting antiviral drugs could result in cure rates of over 95%. However, the\r\n    initial cost of such treatment made it a distant dream for the vast majority of the 71 million people in need. From 2014, WHO intensified its commitment to and work on viral hepatitis through the Global Hepatitis Programme, which joined the Department\r\n    of HIV. By the end of 2019, WHO had launched a comprehensive set of hepatitis prevention, testing, treatment, care, costing and strategic information guidelines and tools to inform country-level hepatitis responses. Since the very first WHO hepatitis\r\n    C guidelines were released in 2014, the price of hepatitis C curative treatment has been reduced from about US$ 100 000 to US$ 1 000 in a wide range of countries, or even to less than US $50 per cure in some of the most heavily burdened low- and middle-income\r\n    countries.

WHO’s study aims to provide the necessary costing estimates to develop policies and mobilize\r\n    financial and political commitments to achieve elimination in countries. The estimates suggest that investing an additional US$ 6 billion into hepatitis services, as part of the overall investments for universal health coverage, will ensure the elimination\r\n    target is attained by 2030. Hepatitis B and C affect 325 million people worldwide, cause 1.4 million deaths a year. Hepatitis is preventable, treatable and, in the case of hepatitis C, curable. However, over 80% of people living with hepatitis are\r\n    still lacking prevention, testing and treatment services."

          "Over the past decade we saw some alarming signs of increasing drug resistance to treatments for HIV, tuberculosis and gonorrhoea. WHO has developed early warning indicators for HIV drug resistance, issuing reports in 2012 and 2017. The latest data from\r\n    2017 showed that half of the surveyed countries experienced HIV drug resistance levels above the WHO-recommended threshold. Also in 2017, WHO raised the alarm on the increase in drug-resistant or untreatable gonorrhoea in a large number of countries,\r\n    and advised intensified prevention efforts. These measures will be central in the global efforts for disease elimination in 2020–2030."

          "“We doulas build a bridge between the migrant women and the midwives. The midwives and doulas have different roles and by working together we create a calm environment, we make the women feel relaxed and safe,” says Rima Hanna, who has been a doula for over a year. Rima is originally from Syria but has been living in Sweden for more than 20 years. During her time as a doula, she estimates that she has helped about 70 women.",
          "“I meet the women several times before they give birth,” she explains. “I am present during birth and I meet them afterwards. We mostly meet at their place, where we can address any questions they might have and go through different exercises that are beneficial before, during and after birth. Afterwards, we also talk about breastfeeding and how the experience of giving birth has been for them.”",
          "Research indicates that refugee and migrant women in the WHO European Region have poorer pregnancy outcomes than non-migrant women. Rima is part of a Swedish project called Doula och kulturtolk that seeks to change this by improving migrant women’s experiences of care.",
          "Run by a nongovernmental organization, the project has received government funding through the Health and Medical Administration in Stockholm. Midwives train the doulas on various topics including Swedish health care, women’s rights in the health-care system, how to support women during birth, breastfeeding, contraception and female genital mutilation."

          "Speaking to the collaboration of midwives and doulas, Maria, a midwife who is part of this initiative, says: “It’s a wonderful project. Migrant women who are either new to Sweden or who have difficulties communicating well in Swedish can choose to be supported by a doula. The doulas speak the mothers’ native language, are familiar with their culture, and are educated in supporting expectant mothers during pregnancy and labour and after they have given birth.”",
          "Maria recalls a birthing experience in which the presence of the doula made all the difference. “The birthing mother was from northern Africa and didn’t speak Swedish. She was a survivor of female genital mutilation and she had no partner, so she was particularly vulnerable. When I attended the birth, the doula and the woman already had a bond, as they had established a relationship beforehand. That was wonderful, because the labour then progressed very well – it’s crucial to feel secure when giving birth.”",
          "The project involves about 40 community-based doulas who can work in 26 different languages. The partnerships between midwives and doulas bring a unique element to the birthing experience of migrant women.",
          "Rima describes how she sees her role: “I feel like a big sister or a mother to them. Sometimes the woman doesn’t want to let my hand go and won’t let me leave the room. I remember I was called to a delivery once where the birthing woman spoke some Swedish but was too tired to communicate and too scared to follow any instructions. I succeeded in soothing her and calming her and we soon started doing exercises together which resulted in a successful delivery.”",
          "“What makes me most proud is knowing that I am helping a person who is in a moment of need,” she continues. “Many women are scared, as I myself have been when giving¬ birth, so I understand what they are going through. I know how important the right support is, especially if it comes from someone who speaks and understands your language. I have always been a person who wants to help and support people, and that wish has intensified during my work as a doula.”",
          "Focusing on the health of refugees and migrants is an important part of International Migrants Day. Achieving universal health coverage is a vital part of WHO’s work, but this cannot be realized if migrants and refugees are left behind. The doulas play an important role in ensuring that women from a variety of backgrounds are able to access health services whenever and wherever they need them."

          "Measles is preventable by vaccination, and between the years 2000 -2018, immunization against measles alone is estimated to have saved around 23 million lives.",
          "Yet outbreaks in all regions and many countries - from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), to Samoa and Ukraine - as well as stagnant, inadequate immunization rates, threaten to derail these crucial gains.",
          "The causes of the outbreaks vary but failing to vaccinate people is at the root of them all, and in 2018, case numbers swelled to a near ten-year peak; close to 10 million, with over 140 000 deaths globally.",
          "By November 2019, case numbers had tripled compared with the same period in the previous year, with the most cases recorded worldwide since 2006.",
          "For a country to be safe from measles, 95% of the population must be immune. Yet global vaccination rates have stayed flat - at around 10% below the recommended threshold for the first dose and 25% for the second - for the last ten years.",
          "To fill the gap in routine vaccination coverage, WHO, with other members of the Measles & Rubella Initiative as well as Gavi, helped vaccinate 346 million children in 37 countries through mass vaccination campaigns in 2018.",
          "WHO also works to reduce the risk of death through timely treatment, especially for complications like pneumonia, trains and deploys health workers, supports efforts to strengthen health systems and works with countries in all regions to strengthen routine immunization.",
          "Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)",
          "DRC is suffering the world’s largest, most severe measles outbreak.",
          "All 26 provinces are affected, and in 2019 alone there have been over 250 000 cases and over 5000 deaths.",
          "The outbreak is compounded by low rates of immunization and high levels of malnutrition which push up the number of deaths.",
          "WHO supports emergency vaccination drives, and around 2.2 million children are to be vaccinated against measles in the latest campaign in North Kivu, where efforts are concurrently underway to curb the world’s second-worst Ebola outbreak amid persistent insecurity.",
          "WHO/John Kisimir",
          "“In the context of North Kivu, where the population is highly mobile, it is imperative that we reach out to travellers and ensure that their children are also covered. Every child should receive his or her vaccine so that they are well protected and can grow up healthy,” said Dr Deo Nshimirimana, WHO acting Representative in the DRC.",
          "The five-day campaign is being implemented by the Ministry of Health with the support of WHO and partners and is fully funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.",
          "WHO has also helped to train emergency medical teams to respond to measles across the country, including doctors, nurses, emergency medical technicians, epidemiologists and logistics personnel.",
          "The North Kivu campaign will be followed by a third and final phase planned to roll out across the 10 remaining provinces to be covered, with the mass follow-up campaign ultimately planned to reach 18.9 million children across the country by the end of the year.",
          "“While the Ebola outbreak in the DRC has won the world’s attention and progress is being made in saving lives, we must not forget the other urgent health needs the country faces,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.",
          "“This new vaccination campaign aims to protect children in North Kivu, as well as other parts of the country from a disease that is easily preventable with a vaccine.”"

          "With better data collection, the expansion of access to measles vaccination for all children aged between 1 and 18 years, and, later, the verification of every child’s vaccination status in school, immunization rates have steadily increased across the country.",
          "Today, 90% of Ukrainian parents ensure their children get their scheduled vaccinations against measles, yet for people displaced through conflict, as well as other groups, it can be harder for them to get access to immunization services.",

          "Across the WHO European Region, four countries recently lost their status as having eliminated measles. The status is removed if the disease reappears and spreads in the country for over a year.",
          "Beyond responding to outbreaks, nations and the global health community must continue to invest in high quality national immunization programmes and disease surveillance. The world has had a safe, proven measles vaccine for over 50 years. We need bold, clear and lasting political, practical and financial commitments to stamp out measles for good."

              "Nineteen countries in      sub-Saharan Africa      and India carried almost 85% of the global malaria burden. Six countries      accounted for more than half of all malaria cases worldwide: Nigeria      (25%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12%), Uganda (5%), and Côte      d’Ivoire, Mozambique and Niger (4% each).",

In the WHO African Region, case incidence levels also declined      from 294 in 2010 to 229 in 2018, representing a 22% reduction. All other      WHO regions recorded either little progress or an increase in incidence      rate.

Without accelerated change, the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030 (GTS) milestones for      morbidity in 2025 and 2030 will not be achieved.",

              "Of the 81 malaria endemic      countries that provided data for 2010–2018, resistance to at least one of      the four insecticide classes in one malaria vector from one collection      site was detected in 73 countries, an increase of five countries compared      with the previous reporting period 2010–2017. In 26 countries, resistance      was reported to all main insecticide classes.",
              "Resistance to pyrethroids –      the only insecticide class currently used in ITNs – is widespread and was      detected in at least one malaria vector in more than two thirds of the      sites tested, and was highest in the WHO African Region and in the WHO      Eastern Mediterranean Region.",
              "Resistance to organochlorines      was detected for at least one malaria vector in almost two thirds of the      sites. Resistance to carbamates and organophosphates was less prevalent      and was detected in 31% and 26% of the tested sites, respectively.      Prevalence was highest for carbamates in the WHO South-East Asia Region      and for organophosphates in the WHO South-East Asia Region and in the WHO      Western Pacific Region.",
              "All the standard insecticide      resistance data reported to WHO are included in the WHO Global Insecticide      Resistance database, and are available for exploration via the Malaria      Threats Map. This online tool was extended in 2019 to cover invasive      mosquito species, and currently shows the geographical extent of reports      on the detection of Anopheles stephensi .",
              "To guide resistance      management, countries should develop and implement a national plan for      insecticide-resistance monitoring and management, drawing on the WHO      Framework for a national plan for monitoring and management of insecticide      resistance in malaria vector. In 2018, a total of 45 countries reported      having completed plans for resistance monitoring and management and 36      were currently in the process of developing them.",
              "NMPs and their partners should      consider the deployment of pyrethroid-piperonyl butoxide nets in      geographical areas where the main malaria vectors meet the criteria      recommended by WHO in 2017, rather than being based on whether the whole      country meets the criteria."

He highlighted that vision impairment is not distributed equally, and 80% of vision impairment could be prevented, corrected, and treated. Moreover, out of 194 country health strategies, 191 did not mention eye care. Thus, we have a crucial role in this challenge to improve eye health of people globally by making eye care an integral part of the universal health coverage. The president of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB), Peter Holland, also shared important messages highlighting the impact of eye health on matters outside of healthcare, such as productivity, education and road traffic accidents. He emphasized the need to persuade governments of the importance of ensuring all people have access to eye care services.",

The discussion included the view of the panelists on some of the key challenges of vision, including the stigma that is associated with wearing glasses, and its integration in health systems.

          "The campaign achieved massive community mobilization resulting in the screening of around 25,000 persons (7% of the total population of Anjouan), and doubled leprosy annual detection from 275 new cases of leprosy in 2018 to 600 new cases in 2019. All detected cases of leprosy have since been treated with WHO recommended MDT",

          "Over the past several months, Pakistan hospitals have faced an influx of thousands of patients admitted with headache, muscle pain and high fever, all classic symptoms of dengue, a mosquito-borne virus that has struck large numbers of people across the country. Pakistan health officials say they are battling one of the worst dengue outbreaks the country has experienced. One city hospital in Rawalpindi admitted more than 2000 dengue patients in a single weekend in October, straining emergency services, converting ordinary wards into dengue wards, and forcing staff to work overtime.",
          "As of early November, more than 45 000 people in Pakistan have been infected with the dengue virus in 2019.",
          "Pakistan is not the only country confronting a surge in dengue cases this year. Bangladesh also has been in the grip of its worst dengue outbreak since the country first recorded an epidemic in 2000, with more than 92 000 cases reported. Health officials in the region blame the prolonged monsoon rains, which promote ideal breeding grounds for Aedes mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus and thrive in warm, humid conditions, laying their eggs in used tires, flowerpots, tree holes and any water-filled container.",
          "Numerous other countries in Asia, the Americas and Africa are reporting a higher incidence of dengue than previous years. WHO is working with local health officials to strengthen dengue outbreak alert systems and improve vector control strategies to halt the spread of the virus.",
          "“The rise in outbreaks this year is a wake-up call for governments, policymakers and researchers to strengthen surveillance and control programmes and to step up prevention strategies to control this phenomenal spread of dengue and other vector-borne viruses,” says Dr Raman Velayudhan, coordinator of WHO’s vector management programme in Geneva."

Known to exist in only 9 countries in the 1970s, dengue is now endemic in 128 countries and strikes as many as 96 million people each year, according to global data collected by WHO.",
          "The unprecedented surge in dengue epidemics across the globe in recent decades prompted WHO at the start of 2019 to include the virus in its list of the world’s top 10 public health threats.",
          "WHO is working with governments and health partners to scale up the global response to the escalation of dengue outbreaks through national vector control programmes aligned with WHO’s G lobal vector control response strategy . The strategy aims to strengthen vector control worldwide through heightened surveillance and monitoring of Aedes mosquitoes and other mosquito-borne viruses. It also aims to reinforce laboratories and community interventions to prepare for and respond swiftly to outbreaks of mosquito-borne viruses.",
          "“We need to further engage communities to push for more proactive, sustainable preventive measures rather than simply reacting to outbreaks,” says Dr Velayudhan."

The campaign has set up mobile medical camps in various neighbourhoods, distributed mosquito nets and insect repellents to residents, and provided free clinical services to more than 20 000 dengue patients. The government has set up a special task force to lead response activities across the country, with the support of the National Institute of Health, which is providing technical assistance and laboratory services to ascertain the dengue virus serotypes circulating in the various geographical zones.",
          "The WHO office in Pakistan has donated anti-mosquito fogging equipment, along with thousands of flyers, posters, banners and brochures distributed in schools, railway stations and other public places to provide information to explain the dengue virus and its symptoms. The campaign messages provide contact information for medical assistance at the onset of dengue symptoms and highlight ways to prevent mosquitoes from breeding – such as by emptying any containers storing water, where mosquitoes like to breed – and avoiding mosquito bites through proper clothing and use of mosquito repellent and bed nets.",
          "The dengue virus is transmitted to humans by two species of mosquito, the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus , mosquitoes that also transmit yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya and other viruses. The dengue virus causes flu-like illness and can develop into a potentially fatal severe dengue. There is no specific treatment for dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent severe cases from becoming fatal.",

In the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization is assisting communities to eliminate mosquito breeding sites around homes and public spaces and supporting training programmes for health professionals to improve dengue diagnosis and treatment.",
          "WHO’s Western Pacific Regional Office is taking a similar approach, training health professionals and preparing clinics and hospitals to respond more effectively to the influx of patients during an outbreak.",
          "In the Africa region, WHO is providing technical and financial support in all aspects of dengue response and vector control, including surveillance, lab testing, coordination and community engagement, which WHO is leading in response to current outbreaks in Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal and Tanzania.",
          "Previously confined to the tropics, Aedes mosquitoes in recent years have begun crossing into more temperate zones. Countries such as Nepal are beginning to report cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, as climate change expands the range of the Aedes habitat into cooler, higher elevations. The changing geographic distribution of mosquito-borne diseases is increasingly a cause of concern also in Europe. Since 2010, dengue cases have been recorded in France, Italy, Portugal and Spain.",
          "“As the global climate warms, we are sure to see Aedes mosquitoes extending their reach farther into territories previously untouched by dengue and other arboviruses,” says Dr. Velayudhan. “Climate action must include coordinated international efforts to ensure countries are prepared to respond effectively to the global challenge of battling dengue and other diseases that will escalate in an increasingly warmer world.”",
          "Concerted action by individuals, communities and countries will be critical to reduce the scale, frequency, and impact of dengue outbreaks, as WHO continues to mobilize governments and health partners to implement stronger, smarter strategies to combat the expanding footprint of the Aedes mosquitoes and the diseases they spread."

          "Dressed in pink, Sylvana, who is only five days old, lies in her mother’s arms. Her mother, Joséphine Ekoli, 28 is happy that she gave birth to a healthy baby after recovering from Ebola. Ekoli was infected with the virus and admitted to an Ebola treatment centre supported by WHO in December 2018.",
          "“You have to be careful; I had a safe birth. I thank God for allowing me to have a safe birth. Now I recovered, I do not have any diseases, and the baby was born healthy. I am very grateful for the great work that the team is doing. The mothers should not be afraid of dying from serious diseases. They are doing a good job at the hospital and the clinic,” says Ekoli.",
          "Dr Junior Ikomo, a doctor at the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), which runs this treatment centre, says Sylvana’s case is both intriguing and fascinating. They realized she was Ebola-free after running blood tests. “We did a sample on the newborn, we took a sample from the woman who gave birth, and we took a sample in the amniotic fluid, which made us fear a process of release of the virus. And after PCR (lab) testing, actually, the result came back negative. The reason why, we said to ourselves, that it was surprising and intriguing on a scientific point of view,” says Dr Ikomo.",
          "Historically, there have been very low survival rates for pregnant women infected with Ebola, and for their babies. “I knew that they were following women who appear to be survivors of Ebola, who were still carrying a healthy pregnancy. This was something that was close to unheard of, in the last epidemic. That was really something really exciting to see a woman giving birth to a child after the period that she survived Ebola,” says Dr Susan McLellan, WHO patient care focal point.",
          "Babies born to mothers with Ebola are usually born already infected with the virus. These infants almost always die. In this outbreak, however, because of pediatric care of infants, there have been several who have survived. As far as we know, this infant is the first to be born Ebola-free to a mother who was previously infected with Ebola. Doctors will continue to follow the baby and her mother’s health closely to ensure they both stay well."

          "A new report by the World Health Organization offers guidance and tools for urban leaders to tackle some of the leading causes of death in cities.",
          "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - like heart disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes - kill 41 million people worldwide every year, and road traffic crashes kill 1.35 million.",
          "“Over half the world’s people live in cities, and the numbers are rising,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.",
          "“City leaders take decisions that impact on the health of billions, and for cities to thrive, everyone needs access to services that will improve their health – public transport, safe, clean and attractive outdoor spaces, healthy food, and, of course, affordable health services.” WHO",
          "The report, titled ‘The Power of Cities: Tackling Non-Communicable Diseases and Road Traffic Injuries’ is geared towards mayors, local government officials and city policy planners.",
          "Funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, it highlights key areas where city leaders can tackle the drivers of NCDs, including tobacco use, air pollution, poor diets and lack of exercise, and improve road safety.",
          "“By replicating the most effective measures on a global scale, we can save millions of lives,” said WHO Global Ambassador for NCDs and injuries, and three-term New York City Mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg.",
          "“We’re working to raise awareness among city leaders and policy makers about the real gains that can be achieved when effective programs are in place.”",
          "From anti-tobacco actions in Beijing and Bogor, to road safety initiatives in Accra and Bangkok, a bike sharing scheme in Fortaleza, and actions to create walkable streets for seniors that have reduced elderly pedestrian deaths by 16% in New York City, the report aims to share knowledge between urban policy planners.",
          "Of the 19 case studies cited, 15 are from developing countries, where 85% of premature adult deaths through NCDs take place, and over 90% of road traffic fatalities are recorded. WHO",
          "Over 90% of future urban population growth will be in low or middle-income countries, and seven of the world’s 10 largest cities are in developing countries.",
          "The initiatives cited in the report are similar to those implemented under the Partnership for Healthy Cities initiative, a joint WHO, Bloomberg Philanthropies and Vital Strategies initiative that brings over 50 cities together to share policies and plans on tackling NCDs and injuries.",
          "The network, led by Mr Bloomberg, has helped ensure 216 million people are covered by at least one intervention to protect them from NCDs and road traffic injury since 2017.",
          "Some 193 countries have committed to reducing premature deaths from NCDs by a third by 2030, and halving road traffic deaths and injuries by 2020, through the Sustainable Development Goals."

          "In an historic announcement on World Polio Day, an independent commission of experts concluded that wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) has been eradicated worldwide. Following the eradication of smallpox and wild poliovirus type 2, this news represents a historic achievement for humanity. © WHO",
          "“The achievement of polio eradication will be a milestone for global health. Commitment from partners and countries, coupled with innovation, means of the three wild polio serotypes, only type one remains,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization and Chair of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Polio Oversight Board “We remain fully committed to ensuring that all necessary resources are made available to eradicate all poliovirus strains. We urge all our other stakeholders and partners to also stay the course until final success is achieved,” he added. © WHO",
          "There are three individual and immunologically-distinct wild poliovirus strains: wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) and wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3). Symptomatically, all three strains are identical, in that they cause irreversible paralysis or even death. But there are genetic and virologic differences which make these three strains three separate viruses that must each be eradicated individually.",
          "WPV3 is the second strain of the poliovirus to be wiped out, following the certification of the eradication of WPV2 in 2015. The last case of WPV3 was detected in northern Nigeria in 2012. Since then, the strength and reach of the eradication programme’s global surveillance system has been critical to verify that this strain is truly gone. Investments in skilled workers, innovative tools and a global network of laboratories have helped determine that no WPV3 exists anywhere in the world, apart from specimens locked in secure containment. © WHO/J.Swan",
          "At a celebration event at the headquarters of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, Professor David Salisbury, chair of the independent Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication, presented the official certificate of WPV3 eradication to Dr Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Wild poliovirus type 3 is globally eradicated,” said Professor Salisbury.  “This is a significant achievement that should reinvigorate the eradication process and provides motivation for the final step – the eradication of wild poliovirus type 1. This virus remains in circulation in just two countries: Afghanistan and Pakistan. We cannot stop our efforts now: we must eradicate all remaining strains of all polioviruses.  We do have good news from Africa:  no wild poliovirus type 1 has been detected anywhere on the continent since 2016 in the face of ever improving surveillance.  Although the region is affected by circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses, which must urgently be stopped, it does appear as if the continent is free of all wild polioviruses, a tremendous achievement.” © David Carvalho",
          "Eradicating WPV3 proves that a polio-free world is achievable. Key to success will be the ongoing commitment of the international development community.  To this effect, as part of a Global Health Week in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, in November 2019, the Reaching the Last Mile Forum will focus international attention on eradication of the world’s deadliest diseases and provide an opportunity for world leaders and civil society organizations, notably Rotary International which is at the origin of this effort, to contribute to the last mile of polio eradication. The GPEI 2019–2023 Investment Case lays out the impact of investing in polio eradication.  The polio eradication efforts have saved the world more than US$27 billion in health costs since 1988. A sustained polio-free world will generate further US$14 billion in savings by 2050, compared to the cost countries would incur for controlling the virus indefinitely.",
          "The GPEI is a public-private global effort made up of national governments, partners including the World Health Organization, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and a broad range of long-term supporters ."

          "WUN in collaboration with Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) commemorated World Food Day 2019 on the theme “healthy diets for a zero hunger world”, to raise awareness, share experiences and plan for future activities. The event brought together representatives from various sectors, including President of the UN General Assembly, Permanent Representative of Zambia, Deputy Permanent Representative of Japan, Director of the FAO Liaison Office at the UN, Professor of Nutrition from NYU, a professional chef, representative from World Economic Forum as well as farmers.",
          "WUN was represented by the Executive Director Nata Menabde, who presented the staggering numbers of people affected by malnutrition and stressed the importance of living up to the promises made in many resolutions and declarations, considering that all forms of malnutrition have immediate lifelong and inter-generational consequences that jeopardize the development and well-being of people, communities and nations. She also emphasized that ensuring access to a healthy diet is a double duty action that includes interventions, programmes and policies that have the potential to simultaneously reduce the risk or burden of both undernutrition (including wasting, stunting and micronutrient deficiencies) and overweight, obesity or diet-related NCDs (including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers). Participants agreed that Member States, UN Agencies, Civil Society organizations, private sector companies, researchers and other grass roots movements should all invest more in nutrition and publicly declare what concrete and smart policy changes they will make in different sectors. They urged companies to stop the practices of marketing of foods high in sugar, salt and fat to children and to stop violating the Code on marketing of breastmilk substitutes. In a video message the UN Secretary General announced that he hopes to convene a major Food Systems Summit in 2021, as part of the Decade of Action to deliver the SDGs. In 2020, WHO will actively participate in a Global Nutrition Summit hosted by Japan."

The programme will be implemented in 9 countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region: Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Sudan.",
          "It focuses on the challenges that mixed migration has on women and youth who are particularly vulnerable. These challenges include lack of migrant-sensitive health services in particular adequate sexual and reproductive health, mental health care and psycho-social support, non-existent or inadequate protection mechanisms and legal frameworks, gender-based violence, human trafficking and migrant smuggling.",
          "The objectives of the 5-year programme (2020–2024) are in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and with the comprehensive migration governance framework proposed by the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and its overarching principles and aims. It also builds on the momentum created by the landmark conference, which took place in Marrakech, Morocco, in December 2018. It presents a comprehensive and integrated response to the challenges of mixed migration management and so puts into effect the agreed priorities of the Khartoum Process, the Valetta Action Plan, and the Malta Declaration. The programme will establish a platform that can be utilized to initiate a \"’whole of government approach’’ to migration, aiming to harmonize national migration governance through national coordination mechanisms.",
          "In recent years, the MENA region experienced an unprecedented increase of mixed migration flows both as countries of transit and destination.",
          "Moreover, protracted humanitarian crises across the region have resulted in significant internal and cross-border displacement. Migrants who left their homes for reasons ranging from escaping hardship because of economic crises, protracted civil unrest, climate change, social marginalization and other reasons find themselves stranded in countries where their status and protection remain fragile. Many have irregular status in transit or destination countries, and are faced wit,h or exposed to, harsh conditions. This has often been exacerbated by lack of access to social, protection services, and intolerant attitudes, which often lead to socioeconomic exclusion and increased risk of violence, exploitation and abuse.",
          "The initiative builds upon and collaborates with ongoing regional and national level initiatives to address mixed migration-related challenges in the Middle East and North Africa and builds upon the strategic partnerships and comparative advantages of the United Nations Population Fund, the International Organization for Migration, the United Nations Office On Drugs and Crime, United Nations Education Science and Culture Organization and WHO, both at the regional and the national levels, with multilateral and regional partners, national governments and civil society organizations.",
          "The United Nations agencies will coordinate their actions and build on their specific expertise to implement multi-faceted and integrated actions and will establish strategic alliances with relevant actors in the MENA Region, such as the League of Arab States, the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, parliamentarian groups, academic institutions and the private sector."

Honourable Katsunobu Kato, Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan FAO’s Deputy Director-General for Programmes, Daniel Gustafson stated, “Nutritious foods that are mentioned under most voluntary guidelines are not always available, not always affordable for many people, and they are simply often beyond the reach of the poor.” He emphasized that a key objective is to lower the cost and improve the availability of more nutritious foods, especially fruits and vegetables and make healthy diets more accessible, more affordable, safe and more attractive.",
          "The representative of the Ministry of Health Viet Nam , explained that the fast-increasing burden of NCDs is a challenge for Viet Nam and that the country is determined to improve its efforts to achieve UHC by 2030.",
          "The Honourable Francisco T. Duque , Secretary of Health, Philippines described the efforts being made to tackle the NCD epidemic through implementing the WHO best-buy interventions, for example for reducing tobacco use and unhealthy diet. He concluded by stating that, “The Philippines is in solidarity with the global community towards our shared goal of addressing the NCD epidemic. We commit to sustaining our current efforts and advancing new ones. Together we can do more and together we can beat NCDs.”",
          "Colin McCiff, Deputy Director, Office of Global Affairs of the US Department of Health and Human Services explained that the approach of United States in tackling NCDs, both domestically and internationally, is to look for opportunities to engage a whole-of-society approach, which includes the private sector and the civil society. He highlighted the importance of seeing the Task Force continuing to support countries deliver multistakeholder and multisectoral action on NCDs in order to achieve UHC.",
          "Irene Khan, Director General, International Development Law Organization (IDLO) pointed out that legislative action plays an extremely important role in furthering policies and strategies to address NCDs. She continued, “That is why we continue to be actively involved in this area and believe that SDG 16 on justice and peaceful inclusive societies, and SDG 3 on universal coverage of health care for all people are closely linked.”",
          "Olivia Wigzell, Director-General, National Board of Health and Welfare of Sweden explained that the challenge in the country is existing health inequalities, “Most risk factors are more pronounced among people with low education leading to stubborn health inequalities. Sweden’s overall objective is to close avoidable health gaps within a generation. She added that, “Sweden is investing in the primary care sector by transferring resources from hospitals to primary care centres and to care delivered at home.”",
          "Manoj Jhalani, Additional Secretary and Mission Director (National Health Mission), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India emphasised the critical role that healthy diet and physical activity has in preventing NCDs. He described a range of actions being undertaken in India to respond to NCDs throughout the life course.",
          "Aksel Jakobsen, Deputy Minister of Development, Norway said that, “To combat NCDs and reach the most vulnerable and marginalised in low income countries, UHC is essential and will be a priority.” He highlighted that primary prevention is key in the fight against NCDs and that the Government of Norway is commitment to combatting climate change and air pollution to improve health and wellbeing.",
          "Dr Mandeep Dhaliwal, Director, UNDP HIV, Health & Development Group said that, “We see this Task Force as a major opportunity for the UN system to more broadly support countries, to address environment, climate and health outcomes together.” She added that UNDP and WHO have supported national NCD investment cases for a number of countries and are close to finishing 15 investment cases on tobacco control, as well as working to broaden investment cases to address air pollution and mental health.",
          "We see this Task Force as a major opportunity for the UN system to more broadly support countries, to address environment, climate and health outcomes together. Mandeep Dhaliwal, Director, UNDP HIV, Health & Development Group Dr Stineke Oenema, Secretariat Coordinator, United Nations System Standing Committee on Nutrition (UNSCN) pointed out that globally, 1 in 3 people suffer from a form of malnutrition and that every country bears a combined burden of malnutrition and NCDs. She stated, “We need to move to a multisectoral approach as the nutrition and NCD burden is simply too great for the health sector alone. The UNSCN is committed to support the 2030 agenda by maximising coherence and fostering coordinated action and enhance dialog and knowledge sharing.”",
          "Dr Svetlana Akselrod, Director, Partnership on NCDs, WHO assured those at the meeting of WHO’s commitment to lead the Task Force and strengthen action across the UN system to support counties in line with the Task Force’s 2019-2021 strategy.",
          "Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, Deputy Director-General, WHO, highlighted the importance of tax on health harming products as an effective tool to combat NCDs, as well as other effective evidence-based fiscal, legislative and regulatory interventions. Dr Jakab also highlighted the importance of the multi donor trust fund for NCDs and for mental health.",
          "The meeting also saw three publications launched. Dr Agnes Soucat, Director, Health Systems Governance and Financing (WHO), described the WHO primer on heath taxes, highlighting the importance of taxing health harming products to reduce levels of NCDs.  She added, “We are talking now about fiscal instruments that shape markets, shape behaviour and whose primary objective is not to raise money. Its primary objective is to improve health.”",
          "Dr Nick Banatvala, Head of the Task Force Secretariat launched a set of 10 UN agency briefs on NCDs and a set of NCD and mental health case studies from across the UN system .",
          "The 2019 Task Force awards were announced. The awards were in the following categories: (i) ministries of health (including agencies under ministries of health); (ii) ministries being health (including agencies under other ministries); (iii) non-state actors; and (iv) UN system agencies and country teams.  The awards recognise outstanding work on the NCD-related SDGs."

          "After major progress achieved globally in the control of communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are today the world’s largest killers. NCDs (namely cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes) cause\r\n    an estimated 38 million deaths every year, with a large part of these deaths being premature (i.e. before the age of 70 years).",
          "NCDs not only affect people’s health but they also negatively impact the socioeconomic development of countries by increasing the financial burden on the health system and through the loss of productivity of people who get ill or die too early.\r\n    Sadly, 85% of premature deaths due to NCDs occur in low- and middle-income countries, where resources are already scarce. Premature deaths from NCDs are largely caused by modifiable risk factors including tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity\r\n    and harmful use of alcohol. In Uganda, 33% of total deaths are due to NCDs and for every Ugandan citizen, the probability of dying prematurely from one of the four main NCDs is 22%.",
          "We have to streamline our support to NCDs with clear targets in the next UN Sustainable Development Framework 2020–2025 El Khidir Daloum, UN acting Resident Coordinator          Uganda Although tobacco smoking has been declining in Uganda, 15% of men and 3% of women still use tobacco products. Alcohol use is another NCD risk factor with relatively high prevalence in Uganda. Unhealthy diet and insufficient physical activity\r\n                    are all increasing problems in Uganda and the prevalence of overweight and obesity has been on the rise over recent years. Nearly one fifth of adults have raised blood pressure, and about 3% have diabetes. Furthermore, Uganda is one\r\n                    of the countries with the highest rates of fatalities due to road traffic accidents, with an estimated 29 deaths per 100 000 population in 2016.",
          "NCDs and their risk factors are closely tied to social, economic, environmental, legal and commercial factors, and must therefore be tackled by multiple sectors. Ministries of education, health, finance, trade, industry, agriculture and communication all have their say in building up a national whole-of-Government and whole-of society response to NCDs.",
          "The UN Joint Programming Mission was carried out in Uganda in the week commening 2 December 2019 by seven UN Agencies – UNDP, FAO, UNAIDS, WFP, IDLO, World Bank and WHO – and coordinated by the UN Interagency Task Force on NCDs (UNIATF), in\r\n    close collaboration with the WHO Uganda Country Office.",
          "The mission identified entry points for scaling up action on the NCD-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across the Government, the UN system, national and international development partners, the civil society and academia. Preliminary results\r\n    from the consultations with key ministries – health, finance, education, gender, labour and social development – as well as with civil society organizations and representatives from the academia, showed the state of national response to\r\n    the challenge of NCDs in Uganda.",
          "Uganda is already demonstrating significant commitment for action on prevention and control of NCDs. Examples include the 2015 Tobacco Control Act, which fulfils Uganda’s obligations to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Prohibition of smoking in public places, total ban on tobacco advertising and promotion, and prohibition of interactions with the tobacco industry, are some of the key elements that will most likely impact the consumption of tobacco products in the country. Another example of Uganda’s strong commitment in tackling NCDs is the recent launch of the Presidential Initiative on Healthy Eating and Healthy Lifestyle. Earlier this year, His Excellency President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni called on all Ugandans to take responsibility for their health by adopting healthy lifestyles and launched a set of recommendations specifically addressing the food environment and choices of the Ugandan population.",
          "However, the Mission identified the need to push forward the establishment and operationalization of the NCD National Coordination Mechanism, to overcome challenges in the implementation of the NCD agenda through whole-of-Government and whole-of-society\r\n    approaches.",
          "The mission also collected data for the development of an NCD investment case. NCD investment cases are designed to help countries understand the real cost of NCDs and the need to invest in their prevention and control. Implementation\r\n                    of a set of highly cost-effective interventions (WHO “best buys”) has significant positive impact on the economy and health of the population in all countries. The analysis for the investment case is performed through the\r\n                    WHO OneHealth Tool, an epidemiology-based population model developed by United Nations partners to enable strategic planning and costing of interventions and projection of the health benefits expected from their implementation. We need to know how much is being spent on NCDs and what the burden is, in order to advocate to more effective actions Honourable Dr Jane Ruth Acheng Minister of Health",
          "Preliminary results from the investment case identified the need for developing sustainable financing mechanisms for the health system response to NCDs, including the adoption of health taxes. Taxes on unhealthy products have the double result of reducing consumption of alcohol, tobacco and sugar sweetened beverages, for instance, and of raising additional revenues, which can be used for health promotion initiatives. The investment case explores this and other innovative and sustainable financing mechanisms to accelerate progress towards the achievement of the SDG target 3.4.",
          "Investing in prevention and control of NCDs will contribute to both the population's wellbeing and the country's economic development through decreasing the social and economic losses associated with NCDs."

          "23 September 2019, New York – The President of the 74th Session of the General Assembly, H.E. Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande convened a full day high-level meeting on universal health coverage (UHC), consisting of a plenary segment and two consecutive multi-stakeholder panels held in parallel to the plenary. This first High-level meeting on universal health coverage, held under the theme “Universal Health Coverage: Moving Together to Build a Healthier World,” was the most significant opportunity to date to mobilize the global community and secure political commitment from Heads of State and Government to accelerate progress toward achieving universal health coverage by 2030, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.",
          "Opening Segment At the outset of the opening segment, Member States approved an action-oriented political declaration agreed in advance by consensus through intergovernmental negotiations, to be adopted by the 74th session of the General Assembly. The General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande provided opening remarks, stressing the need for global solidarity and commitment to achieving UHC as part of the 2030 Agenda, while underscoring health a human right, not a privilege. UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, welcomed the political declaration on UHC as “the most comprehensive agreement ever reached on global health”. Emphasizing the moral and economic imperative of achieving UHC to address troubling inequities in the health sector, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), declared UHC a political choice and congratulated world leaders for signalling their readiness to make that choice. World Bank President, Mr. David Malpass, complemented these remarks from an economic and human development perspective, noting the returns on investment of sustainably financing health – one of the global economy’s largest sectors. The final remarks of the opening segment were presented by Dr. Gro Brundtland, member of The Elders, and designated eminent high-level champion of UHC. Dr. Brundtland issued a strong call for political leaders to “legislate, invest and collaborate with all of society to make UHC a reality,” with emphasis on equity, public financing, and the human right to health for all.",
          "Plenary Segment Over 160 Member States , as well as several Observers, inscribed to speak in the plenary segment. Due to time constraints national statements were presented by 84 officials, including Heads of State and Government and Ministers.",
          "Multi-stakeholder Panels Two multi-stakeholder panels, held in parallel to the plenary segment, provided a platform for multi-sectoral stakeholders to further discuss key elements for achieving UHC. The first panel, on the theme of “UHC as a driver of equity, inclusive development and prosperity for all,” was co-chaired by H.E. Ms. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh and H.E. Mr. Pedro Sánchez, President of the Government of Spain. Panelists included: Ms. Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; Ms. Maha Taysir Barakat, Chair of the Board of the Partnership to end Malaria; Ms. Winnie Byanyima, Deputy Director of Oxfam International; and Mr. Jeffrey Sachs, Professor and Director at the Centre of Sustainable Development, Columbia University. Interventions from the floor were made by: the Russian Federation, Uruguay, Brazil, Slovakia, Italy, Canada, Iceland, Nigeria, Singapore, France, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), Gavi, UHC2030 and the UN Major Group for Children and Youth. Throughout an interactive discussion, this panel explored health as a precondition for and an indicator and outcome of the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Participants noted existing barriers in the health sector, stressing that political commitment to overcome major gaps in funding will be necessary to achieve UHC. Consensus around primary health care (PHC) as the foundation for UHC was clear, with specific highlights on high impact interventions, such as immunization and approaches for addressing malaria. There was a clear call throughout the panel to engage all of society, particularly youth civil society, to ensure UHC reaches those most in need. The second panel, on the theme of “Accelerating multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder action and investments for achieving UHC”, was co-chaired by Dr. Adolfo Rubinstein, Minister of Health of Argentina and H.E. Don Pramudwinai, Foreign Minister of Thailand. Panelists included: Ms. Helen Clark, Chair of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health; Mr. Omar Ishrak, Chairman and CEO of Medtronic; Ms. Ngozi Okonio-Iweala, Former Minister of Finance of Nigeria and Board Chair of Gavi; and Mr. Keizo Takemi, Member of the Japanese House of Chancellor and WHO UHC Goodwill Ambassador. Interventions from the floor were made by: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Colombia, Indonesia, Nicaragua, Turkmenistan, Thailand, Estonia, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Sweden, Spain, the Philippines, UNICEF, The Global Fund, World Economic Forum (joint private sector statement), and IOM. The discussion in panel two focused on the investment case for UHC. As one of the main sectors of the global economy, the health sector has the potential to produce large returns on investment, both in terms of health gains and for equitable and inclusive economic growth. It was noted that although many countries are reforming their health systems, many gaps and challenges still remain, including an estimated additional $371 billion in annual health spending needed in low- and middle-income countries to achieve UHC by 2030. Countries from all regions and at all levels of income will need to mobilize more domestic resources (including reallocation within the budget and a net increase in some settings), increase the equity and efficiency of existing resources, and harmonize investments in health. Participants emphasized that optimizing spending for efficiency gains will involve not just policy and programme decisions within the sector but also smart inter-sectoral dialogue and allocation decisions for combined multi-sectoral policies. Recognizing that the transformative possibilities of technology can create the PHC of the future, participants also cautioned that much more understanding and research is needed on how best to invest and deploy this new technology to avoid driving greater inequality. Closing Segment The President of the General Assembly, H.E. Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, facilitated a brief closing segment, which included the participation of WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus; H.E. Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan; and Mrs. Melinda Gates, Co-chair and Trustee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, each calling to sustain the political momentum for UHC and take the political declaration forward at country level."

          "Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is a vector-borne neglected tropical disease. It is caused by three parasites; Wuchereria bancrofti , Brugia malayi , and Brugia timori - all of which are endemic in Indonesia and are transmitted between humans by mosquitoes. In the severest cases, LF may cause swollen limbs or thickening of the skin (known as elephantiasis) which typically inhibits mobility. Beyond the pain and disability, people who are affected by LF are also frequently ostracized by their communities as they are often unable to work and eventually sink into poverty.",
          "On 4 October 2019, the Indonesian Ministry of Health (MoH), in collaboration with WHO Country Office Indonesia and other implementing partners, launched the fifth and final round of LF Elimination Campaign in Malaka District, East Nusa Tenggara. The campaign is called “Bulan Eliminasi Kaki Gajah (BELKAGA)” or “LF Elimination Month”. The campaign aims to accelerate the delivery of preventive chemotherapy medicine to high-risk populations within 118 endemic districts. It is running in conjunction with the annual Mass Drugs Administration (MDA) for the entire eligible population which began on 1 October and is expected to be completed by 31 October 2019.",
          "In Indonesia, LF is considered a significant public health concern. In 2009, risk mapping identified a population of 124.5 million people needing treatment for LF. The country initiated a national level LF elimination campaign in 2015, addressing both disease prevention and management.",
          "As a result of this campaign, Indonesia achieved 100% geographical coverage in 2017 with 78.2% epidemiological coverage - higher than the effective coverage of 65% generally recommended by WHO to stop LF transmission. Now, according to the MoH Diseases Prevention and Control, approximately 40.7 million Indonesians in 118 districts and 20 provinces are at risk of contracting LF.",
          "The National LF Elimination Programme aims to eliminate the disease by delivering single annual doses of diethylcarbamazine citrate and albendazole to all eligible populations living in LF endemic districts. WHO Indonesia will continue to support the LF Elimination Programme in Indonesia by providing technical assistance and facilitating donations for preventive chemotherapy medicine to endemic districts in need.",

          "“Today, I’m one of the only psychiatrists in an area where about 3 million people live. Due to the war, the situation is tragic,” explains Dr Satoo, Psychiatrist and Managing Director of the WHO-supported Sarmada Mental Health Facility in north-western Syrian Arab Republic. “It affects everything: difficulties finding jobs and bad living conditions. No one is free from some sort of psychological problem. There are no official figures, but we are seeing more and more extreme cases each month.”",
          "The ongoing escalation of the conflict in the region continues to impact heavily on civilians. Between 1 May and 18 August, over 570 000 people were displaced. Access to health care has also been severely limited. There are only 2 psychiatrists for almost 4 million people, and only 2 facilities have the capacity to treat people suffering from severe mental health conditions through inpatient care.",
          "“There is no health facility but ours for severe mental and psychological illnesses. If this did not exist, where would families go? Some people are truly a danger to themselves, their family and their surroundings. Coming here is usually their last resort for dire situations,” Dr Satoo adds.",
          "Improving access to care",
          "Treatment options for people with mental health conditions are limited in north-western Syrian Arab Republic. Sarmada Mental Health Facility is one of 2 facilities with capacity to treat chronic mental health conditions that require hospitalization.",
          "WHO supports the Facility with 20 inpatient beds and an outpatient clinic that provides an average of 321 consultations per month. The Facility treats various mental health conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar conditions and psychosis.",
          "“Generally, we provide care to hospitalized patients for about a month. During that time, we hope patients are responsive to therapy and prescribed medicines. Afterwards, patients transition to our clinic for follow-up. We stress the importance of family members’ support in the treatment process,” Dr Satoo explains.",
          "“Some time ago,” he continues, “we started treating a young man in his 20s. He was aggressive and had attacked his parents on several occasions. They came to me one night, after he had almost killed his mother with a knife. Due to a chronic psychosis, he believed she was conspiring against him and he suffered from many hallucinations. He believed that his family tried to hurt and poison him, and that his mother was the reason his wife had left him. It was difficult at first, but his family supported his road to recovery.”",
          "WHO/AIsmail",
          "Overcoming stigma",
          "Receiving family support is vital for a patient’s recovery, but also one of the biggest challenges. “There is an element of stigma because no one would dare to admit that their family member suffers from mental health conditions,” Dr Satoo says.",
          "“Families can get very angry at the patient and the community can expel them. As a result, people postpone or don’t seek care. Despite our efforts to break this stigma, a lot of patients go to religious healers rather than a psychiatrist. They tell them they are possessed or under the influence of bad spirits. We want to expand our services to help these people,” he adds.",
          "Sarmada Mental Health Facility is operating at maximum capacity. One of the main barriers limiting expansion is a lack of specialist expertise. To fill this gap, WHO, supported by European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), is implementing the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), which is designed to address common mental, neurological and substance abuse conditions.",
          "By training general practitioners to treat mild to moderate mental health conditions, the burden on specialized staff is decreased. Despite his already heavy workload, Dr Satoo is the proud supervisor of 43 mhGAP trainees.",
          "He expresses hope: “Many of my colleagues have backed out of the specialty or were affected due to circumstances of the conflict. You need a specific character to enter this field, it is not easy. I hope that the trainees will stay here because people need someone to serve them. These are their people and they are children of this country. We cannot leave these people without specialist support.”"

          "Chowe village is a string of houses, nestling along a road cutting into the sides of seemingly vertical hills. This is spectacular country. Conical peaks brushing the clouds, coated with green, red soil tracks seaming the green.",
          "What is not so spectacular is the arrival of Ebola virus disease in Chowe. Ebola came quietly to Chowe, in a local woman, who had travelled to the North Kivu hotspot, Beni, to spend time with family there, and came into contact with several people infected with Ebola. After a time, she travelled home with her two young children to join her husband in Chowe.",
          "That quiet homecoming has now extended the massive geography of the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and parts of Ituri, in the eastern side of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), to another province, South Kivu.",
          "By the time this young mother had returned home -- it is a 700-kilometre journey by bus, boat and taxi -- she was weak and ill. She went to the local health care post, where, on August 14, soon after seeking care, she died. Aware that a death like this should be reported, the local health care worker alerted the authorities and a test was done on August 15.",
          "WHO/Margaret Harris Even before the results were known, WHO and the Ministry of Public Health sent responders to the site to identify people who had become infected with or who could have come into contact with the Ebola virus, to organise vaccination, to conduct awareness raising, and to provide medical care.",
          "“This rapid response is only possible because we have trained people who are ready and able to move as soon as we know a new area has become infected,” says Dr Socé Fall, WHO Assistant Director-General for Emergencies who is overseeing the Ebola response in the DRC. “It is hard work, difficult and expensive but it is what we have to do, and will continue to do, until we have found every last case and shut down every chain of transmission in the DRC.”",
          "The rapid response team arrived on the evening of August 15 ready to begin work immediately, and Ebola was confirmed as the cause of death that same day. The woman's son, just six months old, was showing signs of infection. With nowhere safe to isolate and care for him, one room of the family home was set aside.",
          "Equipment flown down by helicopter was used to provide treatment and also protect the medical staff caring for the child.",
          "‘We used bamboo sticks to set up a fence around the hut to isolate the space,\" said Dr Janet Diaz, lead for Clinical Case Management in the WHO Health Emergencies programme, and a member of the team sent to provide medical care for people in Chowe. “It was a struggle finding everything we needed, but we were still able to treat the baby for Ebola.”",
          "Since those early days, the baby and his father -- who also developed symptoms and has been confirmed positive for Ebola virus disease --have been moved to the local health post which has been turned into a temporary treatment centre.",
          "Dr Patrice Kabongo from the Ministry of Public Health, trained alongside Ebola veterans in Goma and Mangina, is now leading the fight to save their lives. “It’s very difficult. We don’t have much water, no light, we sleep on the floor but, we are here to do all that we can do to stop virus.”",
          "At the same time, a kilometre or so down the road, a vaccination team have set up their tables and are vaccinating not only those who came into contact with people confirmed to have Ebola, but also the entire village. “It’s an adaptation of the strategy,” says Alhassane Toure, WHO lead for vaccination. “We have vaccinated all the contacts and contacts of contacts but because it’s a small village, we are able to widen it to the whole village.”",
          "Overall, 35 WHO staff are now working in Chowe alongside many partners, including Medecins Sans Frontieres, UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the US Centres for Disease Control, to ensure that every person at risk is identified, followed up, that everyone is being vaccinated, that the people in the area understand the disease and why stopping transmission is essential to protect their lives and their communities, and that the best possible medical care is available to those who do develop Ebola virus disease."

          "“We never thought he had Ebola. He just had fever.” The man speaking looks down at his hands, as if somewhere in his palms lay answers to the terrible questions he is asking himself.",
          "“He was my nephew. But he always stayed with us and played with those children,” he says, pointing to a ragtag group kicking a deflated ball between them, sometimes letting it roll under tables set up between the houses where family, friends and neighbours of the boy with Ebola were lining up to get vaccinated. “We took him to a clinic. But he got sicker. And weaker. So, we took him to the hospital -- where he died.” This tragedy is sadly all too typical. Even though Ebola has been smouldering in the suburbs and villages surrounding Beni for over a year, few people recognise its early symptoms. So many other conditions are heralded by the early symptoms of Ebola -- fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pains -- that people are more likely to go to a local private clinic before calling the Ebola hotline or seeking help at an Ebola treatment centre. By the time the virus has ‘shown itself’ -- causing severe diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of consciousness, and death -- too many other people have been infected, and it is often too late to reverse the ravages it has caused. One reason for this has been distrust in Ebola responders, seen as outsiders bringing trouble to the communities in and around Beni. However, here in Malepe, Beni, there is deep sadness but no sense of wariness or distrust. People are crowding around, anxious to get vaccinated and to talk about what happened.",
          "So why is it different? One reason may be that this vaccination team --team 29 -- is composed entirely of Congolese vaccinators, who come from the region and speak the local languages. “This is an important part of our strategy -- to recruit and train people from the areas with Ebola, who can explain what Ebola is and what the vaccine is for,” says Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, team lead for vaccination in Beni. Dr Diallo, from Guinea, was a member of the first teams to give the experimental vaccine to people at risk during the West African Ebola outbreak (in 2014-16). He explains that having local vaccinators increases community trust. It also means that the expertise sorely needed to fight future Ebola outbreaks will stay in the Beni community."

          "Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)—mainly cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes—are the world’s biggest killers. More than 36 million people die annually from NCDs (63% of global deaths), including more than 14 million people who die too young between the ages of 30 and 70. Low- and middle-income countries already bear 86% of the burden of these premature deaths, resulting in cumulative economic losses of US$7 trillion over the next 15 years and millions of people trapped in poverty. To strengthen national efforts to address the burden of NCDs, the World Health Assembly endorsed the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020 in May 2013 [1] . The Global Action Plan provides Member States, international partners and WHO with a road map and menu of policy options which, when implemented collectively between 2013 and 2020, will contribute to progress on 9 global NCD targets to be attained in 2025. One of these nine targets specifically addresses the issue of access to medical technologies and aims at an increase up to “an 80% availability of the affordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major noncommunicable diseases in both public and private facilities“."

What will stop Ebola is … good surveillance, good infection prevention and control, good community engagement, excellent vaccination and the use of these therapeutics in the most effective way possible, in safe and humane Ebola treatment units. It’s not one answer. It’s many things.”",
          "With the recovery of Esperance Nabintu and her baby Ebenezer, there are currently no cases of Ebola in the city of Goma.",
          "However, the risk of national spread remains very high as the population in affected areas is highly mobile.",
          "With surveillance teams checking numerous alerts each week, WHO continues to work to ensure that any case of Ebola in Goma is identified and responded to immediately.",

          "Jackson Tipapa, a Kenyan cattle farmer from Loitokitok, explained the dire situation on his farm to a team of health and livestock experts. The 48-year old husband and father of four represented a distraught community whose cattle were dying. A strange\r\n    disease was threatening further loss of their goats, sheep and what was left of his cows.",
          "“The cattle are weak and ill with diarrhoea. Some have died while others have miscarried,” he told the visiting team. It was not just livestock that was affected. Some people in the community had fallen sick – with diarrhoea, high fever\r\n    and vomiting.",
          "Meanwhile, across the Tanzanian border in the town of Longido, another farmer explained a similar situation to a rapid response team of health experts and vets who were following up on an alert about the situation. They examined the animals and took dung\r\n    and blood samples for testing while health workers engaged members of the community and answered questions about their concerns.",
          "Fortunately for Jackson and neighbouring farmers, this scenario was part of a Field Simulation Exercise (FSX) that occurred in June 2019 at the Namanga One Stop Border Post (above) and the surrounding areas in both Kenya and Tanzania.",
          "The exercise was convened by the East Africa Community (EAC) and implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO) to test both countries’ preparedness and response to disease outbreaks. It covered various real-life simulations involving the health,\r\n    livestock, agriculture, tourism and environment sectors. The simulation that was presented was not unusual in the region, and highlighted the daily challenge of managing the risk of disease outbreaks.",
          "<p><img src=\"Item with ID: &#39;fdea22a9-bb22-4516-b8e6-5dabf843758c&#39; was not found!\" style=\"background-color:initial;font-size:inherit;\" sf-size=\"100\" sfref=\"[images%7COpenAccessDataProvider]fdea22a9-bb22-4516-b8e6-5dabf843758c\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" /></p>",
          "The exercise scenario depicted a cross-border Rift Valley Fever (RVF)-like virus outbreak (a fictitious virus described as East Rift Fever was created so as not to interfere with current public health efforts targeting real viruses circulating in the\r\n    region). The outbreak scenario impacted humans and animals, lives and livelihoods, agriculture, trade and tourism, peace and security and the overall regional economy.",
          "In response to the need to prepare EAC Partner States for Ebola due to the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) ,\r\n the fictitious exercise featured a RVF virus that mutated into a pathogen that could be transmitted between humans, causing a severe haemorrhagic fever that resulted in a high number of cases and deaths. This aspect of the simulation allowed for an\r\n    assessment and strengthening of EAC capacities to prepare and respond to an Ebola-like situation using the One Health approach.",
          "During the exercise, the rapid response teams acted on emergency alerts sent from a control room. The follow-up response was tested to examine how efficiently health and other emergency teams reacted.",
          "Infections and deaths in animals and human beings triggered the activation of national and regional preparedness and response mechanisms emphasising the importance of the One Health approach and of appropriate risk communications and cross-border collaboration.",
          "“Every possible element of the system is tested to examine preparedness for any public health outbreak,” said Frederik Copper, WHO Exercise Coordinator.",
          "The exercises were carried out in real-life settings to determine the level of preparedness and to assess operational capabilities at regional and national levels. The exercises focused on strengths and weaknesses in coordination and collaboration mechanisms,\r\n    emergency response deployment, logistics and administrative processes, risk communication and emergency management and leadership.",
          "The scope and complexity of the exercise drew the attention of other members of the EAC. Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, South Sudan and other countries from the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa Region acted as observers to the process.",
          "Convened by the EAC Secretariat, the exercise involved 150 experts from Tanzania and Kenya in 23 exercise locations. WHO was the lead technical agency responsible for developing, designing and coordinating the exercise, with financial support from the\r\n    Government of Germany.",
          "The simulation identified clear strengths, including functional multi-sectoral collaboration; the effective use of the One Health approach; rapid response to alerts and deployment by some rapid response teams; and functional use and activations of standard\r\n    operating procedures and guidelines.",
          "The exercise was not only intended to identify achievements and challenges in preparedness and response for a public health event affecting the East African Community, but also, by exposing participants to a realistic scenario, and to practise the roles\r\n    they would carry out in a real emergency.",
          "“The findings from the Field Simulation Exercise will be used to further enhance preparedness and response capacities in the EAC region and beyond,” said Christophe Bazivamo, EAC Deputy Secretary General. He noted that the effort by the EAC\r\n    countries and partners was timely given the Ebola epidemic in the DRC, which shares a border with five member countries.",
          "While the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the DRC has captured world attention, the threat of future epidemics and public health emergencies remains acute in the African region. WHO reports that all 47 countries in the region are at risk of health security\r\n    threats and more than 150 acute public health events strike the region annually.",
          "The success of this WHO-led simulation exercise will be measured by the effectiveness of early warning and detection practices at points of entry. The outcomes of this exercise will help Kenya and Tanzania work together with the EAC and partners to\r\n    build and maintain resilient national health systems, which can respond effectively to health emergencies. This exercise will also provide an example that other countries can consider their own preparedness and response to disease outbreaks and\r\n    natural disasters.",

The Summer School is delivered in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the European Public Health Association (EUPHA). It is a one-of-a-kind opportunity for countries on the front line of migration to access knowledge and share experience to address this growing phenomenon.",
          "“Migration is a defining feature of the 21st century. It is not a crisis or emergency limited in time. Almost 80% of refugees stay in host countries for at least 5 years, over 60% in urban settlements. Structural changes are needed. Local health systems must adapt systematically so that refugees and migrants face fewer financial, administrative, linguistic and cultural barriers to access to health services,” explains Dr Santino Severoni, Coordinator of Migration and Health at WHO/Europe.",
          "“Protecting the health of migrants and refugees is also the best way to protect the health of host populations. The way we respond today will shape the future health-care landscape for Europe, its people and its new arrivals,” he emphasizes."

              "a significant proportion of migrants and refugees affected by communicable diseases acquired the infection after they arrived in Europe – despite the widespread assumption to the contrary, there is only a very low risk of refugees and migrants transmitting communicable diseases to their host population."

          "“At WHO, we welcome this approach in line with the goal of achieving universal health coverage and reaching the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals,” he adds.",
          "Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, language and cultural differences have challenged Syrian refugees’ access to appropriate health information and services in Turkey. WHO has supported the vision of the Turkish Ministry of Health to train and integrate Syrian doctors, nurses and midwives, as well interpreters and community health staff, in the Turkish health system.",
          "More than 2100 Syrian health workers have been trained in 7 refugee health training centres to provide linguistically and culturally sensitive health consultations for their fellow nationals in 178 refugee health centres throughout Turkey. These health workers ensure that refugees receive proper health care and support during referrals to hospitals and specialized services."

The recent adoption of the Global Action Plan to Promote the Health of Refugees and Migrants at the Seventy-second World Health Assembly is a solid example,” notes Dr Severoni.",

          "In renewed efforts to vaccinate children traversing in and out of Nigeria, the World Health Organization (WHO) is supporting the government in an initiative to improve supplemental and routine immunization activities in the North Western region, which has a significant nomadic population. Nomadic pastoralists live beyond the reach of established health care programs that are designed to serve sedentary populations. As a result, these groups are often under-immunized and out of the reach of existing disease surveillance activities.",
          "Speaking on the intervention, Mallam Gwanda Mairakuma of Maiadua local government in Niger Republic said that, “with this intensified commitment, vaccination activities have reduced the number of complications associated with Measles infection on our children”."

        "content": [
          "Difficulties have been experienced in the past in tracking and reaching nomadic populations with services such as sensitization on early disease reporting, immunization activities and access to general healthcare services due largely to the nature of their movement, which often involves settling in hard-to-reach transit camps.",
          "Reaching the nomadic population in the cross border areas of the North Western region has been particularly difficult due to the nature of the population which involves settling in hard to reach and sometimes security compromised areas, making the zone  the highest with under-immunized children in the country. Jigawa and Katsina states in particular are maximizing efforts in reaching these populations by identifying major migrant groups and characterizing the movement of nomadic populations in the region for effective administration of vaccines.",
          "In collaboration with Katsina State government, WHO has intensified efforts to reach nomadic communities across the state with immunization services, sensitization on prompt disease reporting and on the need to access health care services.   The nomadic settlements span across 14 Local Government Areas (LGAs), wards and settlements passing through international borders with Niger republic. LGAs with nomadic routes include: Baure, Dutsinma, Kafur, Ingawa, Kaita, Jibia, Mashi, Charanchi, Musawa, Batsari, Maiadua, Zango, Danja, Kusada  LGAs among others.",
          "These communities are among the most marginalized, hard to reach and nomadic in nature who migrate across LGAs, States and international borders due to their transitory movement and settlement in camps and hamlets. The State conducts series of activities to enhance immunity and interrupt transmission of Polio and other priority diseases along transit exit points and settlements with nomadic routes through immunization. Jigawa State also shares international borders with Niger republic in two LGAs namely, Sule tankarkar and Maigatari.",
          "“WHO Nigeria supported a 10km strip vaccination along Nigeria-Niger border, using mOPV2 in October 2018 which was conducted along with vaccination at border cross points in March through April 2019,” says Dr Audu Sunday, WHO Jigawa State Coordinator. “WHO has also supported Jigawa state to establish in-between round vaccination teams providing routine immunization, polio vaccination and Measles vaccines along the border cross points as well as the Maigatari international market. Disease surveillance officers of both countries also conduct joint visits to health facilities in communities at the border using Standard operating procedures for cross border notification of VPDs,” he adds."

          "In Katsina state, 1,645 eligible nomadic children were reached during nomadic vaccinations in Ingawa and Maiadua LGAs between April and June 2019 from the conduct of Outbreak Response (OBR) and in between rounds, respectively.",
          "For the same period in Jigawa State, 6,280 Nigerien and 5,115 Nigerian children were vaccinated at the border crossing points. At least 8,608 children were vaccinated with mOPV2 in the 10km strip outbreak response in October 2018 in two districts of Niger Republic (Dungas and Magaria).",
          "Meanwhile, for in-between round activities at the border 10,183 children received bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) while 3,358 were vaccinated with Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) as well as 1,035 with measles vaccine.",
          "The Director Primary Health Care (DPHC) Jigawa State, Dr Shehu Sambo during a supportive supervision to Miga LGA appreciated WHO’s support in establishing the nomadic vaccination. “We are happy with WHO’s support and encourage health workers to take the opportunity to improve routine immunization coverage across the State.”",
          "Support for Polio eradication to Nigeria through WHO, is made possible by funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Department for International Development (DFID – UK), European Union, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Government of Germany through KfW Bank, Global Affairs Canada, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Community Chest Korea, KOFIH (Korea), Rotary International and the World Bank."

          "Much of 21 st century medicine is still spent battling ancient diseases. Malaria is such an old disease that there are references to it in China dating back more than 3500 years in inscriptions on bones, tortoise shells and bronzeware. The circular nature of transmission of the parasite, from human to mosquito and back to human, the ability of the parasites to form resistance to treatments and the mosquitoes to insecticides, and the complex life cycle of the parasites makes malaria a tough disease to eliminate. Yet many countries have made impressive strides in controlling and stamping out malaria. In 2016, WHO identified 21 malaria-endemic countries that could feasibly eliminate the disease by 2020. Together, these countries form the “E-2020 initiative” and are part of a concerted effort to drive indigenous malaria cases to zero within the 2020 timeline. In 2018, Paraguay became the first E-2020 country to be certified by WHO as malaria-free, and this year Algeria was awarded the same status.  Three other countries – the Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia and Timor-Leste – achieved zero indigenous cases of malaria in 2018. China and El Salvador, meanwhile, have been at zero since 2017, and Cabo Verde has been malaria-free since January 2018. WHO’s Global technical strategy for malaria, adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2015, calls for the elimination of malaria in at least 10 countries by the end of next year. “We are very much on track to have 10 E-2020 countries at zero cases in 2020,” says Dr Frank Richards, chair of the Malaria Elimination Oversight Committee – an independent WHO advisory body that guides countries in their efforts to eliminate malaria – and an expert in parasitic diseases at The Carter Center, Atlanta, USA. © WHO/Christine McNab This week, China is hosting the third E-2020 global forum of malaria-eliminating countries from 18-20 June in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, with a specific focus on eliminating malaria in populations at high risk of contracting malaria. China is a good example of what happens when a country is determined to eliminate malaria – this became the joint goal of 13 ministries, including health, finance, industry, and education. The results were impressive and the country has gone from 30 million cases in the 1940s to zero indigenous cases in 2017. The countries within the E-2020 initiative vary greatly in their geography and transmission patterns, yet despite their differences, they have many lessons to share with each other. “It has been gratifying to see how countries in the E-2020 are learning from each other,” says Dr Kim Lindblade, team leader of the WHO’s Global Malaria Programme’s elimination unit. “We have seen ideas move from country to country, and region to region. These linkages help diffuse innovations from one context to another.” WHO Certification of malaria-free status WHO grants a certification of malaria elimination when a country has proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the chain of indigenous transmission has been interrupted nationwide for at least the previous 3 consecutive years. In addition, a national surveillance system capable of rapidly detecting and responding to any malaria cases must be operational, together with an appropriate programme to prevent re-establishment of transmission. To date, 38 countries and territories having been certified malaria-free by WHO. The Malaria Elimination Oversight Committee bolsters countries’ efforts, says Dr Richards, by acting as an advocate “urging, if appropriate, more domestic political and financial support. That’s fundamental in the last mile of the elimination effort, and future sustainability of surveillance and response to prevent resurgence of malaria in the future.” Countries need a few key ingredients to get to zero, says Dr Kamini Mendis, a member of the Committee and professor emeritus at the University of Colombo in Sri Lanka, including “a very effective state-of-the-art surveillance and response system, uninterrupted funding, and a responsive elimination programme that can respond rapidly to changes.” These must be accompanied by strong technical leadership and people on the ground “with staying power until zero cases are achieved,” she adds. Once the WHO’s Malaria Elimination Certification Panel verifies that a country is malaria-free, however, countries cannot be complacent. Two years after Sri Lanka was certified free of malaria, an imported case from neighbouring India led to local transmission; Sri Lankan authorities quickly responded and prevented any further cases. Malaysia faces significant challenges of the disease being brought in from returning Malaysians who work outside the country in professions that are at high risk of malaria, such as plantation workers and loggers. Many other countries have porous borders, including China and Myanmar, where every morning Chinese market sellers traverse the border into Myanmar, and children from Myanmar cross over for free schooling in China. © WHO/Christine McNab While countries must be vigilant, with the support of WHO and others, to prevent re-establishment of the disease, “the E-2020 initiative is an opportunity to celebrate programmatic successes,” says Dr Lindblade. “We have to remember that national malaria programmes are made up of people who are dedicating their careers to eliminating a deadly disease from their communities. Recognizing their accomplishments is often emotional.” The initiative is also expanding. In 2020, Dr Richards expects the announcement of a new tranche of countries – the “E-2025” – that they expect will reach zero cases by 2025. These new ‘recruits’ will be able to look towards the example of countries such as China, which along with El Salvador, “could be up for certification next year,” says Dr Richards."

          "WHO/C. McNab It’s early morning and the light intensifies on the long line of tuk tuks laden with coloured bags of lettuce, green onions, sacks of rice and boxes of live chickens. The drivers – all market vendors – wait to advance and cross this\r\n        remote border post joining China and Myanmar. It’s an orderly morning ritual. And then a different kind of queue forms on the Myanmar side of the border gate. Children, about 30 of them, wait to be counted through the gate, one by one. They stride across the border area and up the road, tidy and smiling in their school track\r\n        suits, sporting oversized backpacks branded with well-known cartoon characters. Their pace quickens to a run as they spot the yellow school bus. As he does every morning, the headmaster, Mr Luo Jianging, greets each child as they board for a short ride to their school, just a few hundred metres away. These children from Myanmar\r\n        are educated for free at the Friendship Primary School in Daluo township, China. WHO/C. McNab The daily border crossing in this remote corner of south-west Yunnan Province forges closer economic and social ties between China and Myanmar. But it also comes with a risk: anyone coming into China could be infected with the parasites that cause\r\n        malaria. Malaria, like most infectious diseases, knows no borders. Myanmar has made a lot of progress against the disease, but it continues to take a toll on the health and livelihood of its people. According to WHO’s latest World malaria report ,\r\n the country had an estimated 117 000 cases of malaria in 2017 alone. For neighbouring China, limiting the spread of malaria is now more important than ever. The world’s most populous country reported its last indigenous case of the disease in August 2016. Soon, it will be eligible to apply for membership in a\r\n        small but growing club of nations officially certified malaria-free by WHO. As China welcomes these school children, the country is also taking measures to help ensure they do not inadvertently bring malaria with them across the border. Though if they did, China is also preparing students to help stop the disease in its tracks. Building awareness By 8:30 am at the Daluo Friendship Primary School, the children are settled in their desks alongside their Chinese schoolmates. Classrooms here are modern. The blackboards are giant smart tablets. Teachers write directly on them with their fingers and swipe through the screens from subject to subject. The children are serious, alert and focused on their studies. When asked, they recite back phrases, and raise their hands to answer questions. In a previous generation, several children would have likely been absent from school due to malaria, or\r\n        too tired or ill to learn. WHO/C. McNab Later in the morning the school headmaster explains how the students are made aware of a disease they have probably never seen. “Before, when we were younger, we were very scared about malaria,” says Mr Luo. “But we haven’t heard of any cases in the community for several years.” Still, he says, many students from Myanmar board at the school, and\r\n        he has a responsibility to prevent any infections they may bring with them from spreading to the local community. He also must keep them safe from illness should they be infected. Mr Luo explains that health and customs officials visit the school once a semester to teach students about malaria. They bring leaflets and booklets. “This is great,” he says. “It raises people’s awareness about a disease they\r\n        might not know otherwise.” Preventing new malaria cases Customs officials from the nearby border post also pass out hundreds of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) at the school. We’re invited to talk to 3 of the students in their dorm rooms about malaria. Nan Laodi and Yu Danban are both from Myanmar, and Huang Pei Pei is Chinese. WHO/C. McNab The girls demonstrate how they arrange the bed nets around their mattresses, careful to seal up any gaps where a mosquito could enter. WHO recommends the use of ITNs in all malaria-affected settings, even in those where transmission has been\r\n                markedly reduced. In countries that have eliminated malaria, continued use of ITNs is recommended for all populations at risk of the disease.",
          "“The bed nets help us to prevent mosquito-transmitted diseases like malaria,” explains 12-year old Huang Pei Pei.",
          "She’s never seen malaria, but knows that “if I had malaria, I would have fever and chills.” She adds: “It’s not good to have malaria and it’s not good to transmit it to other people!”",
          "WHO/C. McNab",
          "As malaria cases continue to decrease in countries bordering Yunnan Province, the aim is for the students at this school to know how to describe malaria symptoms, but to never know the disease first-hand.",
          "“Knowing about malaria, and protecting students from mosquito bites is really important,” explains Headmaster Luo. “Our school takes this very seriously.”"

          "In the deep rural areas of Rwanda, a new technology is saving lives. In the past two decades, Rwanda has created a high-quality national blood service, tripling its blood donation rates between 2000 and 2018. The use of innovative technology, like drones for delivering blood quickly to those in need, has been a key factor in the success of the service.",
          "Blood transfusion services started in Rwanda in 1975, and since 1985 they have been exclusively from voluntary, unpaid blood donors. The 1994 genocide devastated the health infrastructure and systems, but the government prioritised the rebuilding of blood transfusion services, realizing how pivotal access to blood is in saving lives. Stringent measures were put in place to improve the safety and availability of blood countrywide – this has contributed to the drop in child mortality by two-thirds between 2000 and 2015, and maternal mortality by three-quarters.",
          "Today the National Centre for Blood Transfusion (NCBT) provides safe and ample blood and blood products to all patients in need. This is achieved through 541 permanent mobile blood collection sites and five regional distribution centres serving 66 transfusing health facilities. Centralized supply chains and on-demand deliveries have allowed the NCBT to reduce waste and stock shortages.",
          "One of the country’s major challenges in providing blood to those in need, especially in rural and remote areas, is the country’s terrain - including impassable mountains - and damaged roads. Rwanda uses a drone technology called ‘Zipline’ which cuts blood delivery times down from four hours to just 15 minutes in some cases.",
          "“Every second you gain in saving a life is critical. When we saw that Zipline was a solution, we didn’t hesitate,” said Dr. Diane Gashumba, Rwandan Minister of Health.",
          "\"I used to see the drones fly and think they must be mad, until the same drone saved my life,\" said Alice Mutimutuje, a Rwandan mother.",
          "Maintaining a cold chain is another major challenge for many blood banks. In December 2016, Rwanda introduced an electronic cold chain monitoring system that tracks temperatures of blood products in real time. When the temperature gets too high or low, a warning text message and email are sent to the person monitoring the system.",
          "Blood donation is made even more efficient using apheresis machines, which collect separate blood components like plasma, platelets or red blood cells. This technology has had great benefits, particularly for cancer patients.",
          "But all this technology would amount to nothing without dedicated blood donors.",
          "Rwanda’s policy since 1985 is that blood must be donated by unpaid volunteers and provided to patients in need free-of-charge. Donors around Rwanda are eager to help.",
          "“I always am happy to save a life of someone, even someone I don’t know, because in our (Rwandan) culture, we believe that to be human is to do good things to someone without being remunerated,” said Euphrasie Uwase Maneno, a blood donor.",
          "But access to safe blood is not the norm in every country. World Blood Donor Day is on 14 June 2019 and this year WHO is calling for ‘safe blood for all’. Rwanda provides an example that should be emulated if the world is to have enough safe blood and blood products for everyone in need. Become a blood donor today and help save lives."

          "Today that rate has been cut to just 12%, thanks to strong teamwork across many different sectors and particularly the people in the local community.",
          "This success was recognized last week by the award of the 2019 Sasakawa Health Prize at the Seventy-second World Health Assembly in Geneva. When accepting the prize on behalf of the Peruvian Minister of Health, the director of the ministry’s Office of International Affairs thanked the authorities and the Andean and Amazonian indigenous people of the Iguaín Ayacucho region “for their achievement to prevent the severe long-term effects of anaemia on children’s development.”"

Municipal, regional and national authorities joined forces to introduce community surveillance centres to tackle this serious health issue.",
          "The work was done by a team of experts in health, education, social protection and law, with a wide range of professionals - nurses, midwives, food industry engineers, anthropologists, social workers, psychologists, doctors, school teachers, computer technicians, lawyers, mayors and town council members.",
          "Community leaders were engaged in the team’s each and every action. What really turned the tide was how local people embraced the initiative.",
          "The health authorities’ main aim was to support families to change their eating habits because, even though the initiative is exclusively focused on children, change in diet can bring health benefits all through the life-course.",
          "The key to success was the primary health care approach, with the community surveillance teams making home visits to talk with families and working to introduce a new food and nutrition model. This includes teaching and empowering people to improve their diets by consuming locally grown products, such as potatoes, quinoa and corn, some of them fortified with micronutrients provided by the government. The project also provided support to vulnerable people without comprehensive health insurance.",
          "From the perspective of the local actors, interest and support from a wide range of institutions, authorities and partners is vital to prevent, reduce and eradicate anaemia. People working in education, local production of agricultural products and health all must come together for the common goal of improving quality of life.",
          "“I want the entire community to work with mothers, parents and families - the ones directly responsible for children,” says Mayor of Iguaín, Mr Fidel Canales. “We also set ourselves new goals to reach, for instance in different age groups and with different solutions.”"

          "At national level, the Peruvian government sees this initiative as its commitment to implement the Alma Ata principle of health in all policies. It has endorsed a Multisectoral Plan to Combat Anaemia, which involves all sectors and 15 ministries and is led by the President of the Republic, uniting politicians, media, civil society and, most importantly, citizens across the country.",
          "“This work is not only about health,” says the Mayor of Iguaín Mr. Fidel Canales, “It contributes to the sustainable development of our region.” This has been recognized across the country, as the model applied in Iguaín is being rolled out and replicated in other parts of Peru.",
          "The message from Iguaín is that the district wants to continue to be an example to follow. For the national-level stakeholders, this is also key, as they set very ambitious, long-term goals. Anaemia is a serious public health problem in the country, but if all communities are as committed as the citizens of Iguaín, Peru will indeed be on track to reduce and eventually eradicate anaemia."

She later built capacities among health workers through international seminars on good clinical laboratory practice in the management of HIV/AIDS and co-infection of AIDS and hepatitis B patients.",

For instance, he led a big study of the cardiovascular health of bus drivers in New Delhi. “It was so obvious we needed to look into the health needs of those young men whose work conditions are tough - heat, crowded vehicles, polluted air,” he says. When the researchers captured the pattern of hypertension and other heart health risks, they found the bus drivers were at much higher risk than average for people of their age. This research led to action to address these health risks.",

He describes his team’s work on health effects of chewing tobacco. “Smoking is globally recognized as a lead cause of cardiovascular disease and death, but no attention was previously paid to chewing tobacco.” Hence he led a major study to discover that, when chewed, tobacco causes constriction of the coronary arteries and may lead to heart attackes. “Now the evidence is all there, and policy makers can take action - in India and other countries where it is widely practiced.”",
          "When Professor Bhargava speaks to policymakers, they listen. When he launches new ideas for creating affordable medical devices, the innovation community follows. When he publishes groundbreaking studies, scientists pay attention.",
          "His passion to know how things work, and to make them work, has resulted in a long list of innovative medical devices – affordable, created and applied in India. In cooperation with the Indian Institute of Technology, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and a devoted follower group of more than 100 young innovators, his work on developing low-cost devices is already saving thousands of lives.",
          "Professor Bhargava hopes to transmit this family tradition of helping others through his two sons who have also chosen medicine – one specializes in endocrinology, the other is an infectious disease specialist."

          "At the same time, WHO’s Director-General Dr Tedros was on a visit to Bunia to pay his respects to Ebola health workers far from their families and friends during the holidays. Accompanying Dr Tedros was a small group of doctors, including Dr Michael Ryan, the Executive Director of WHO Health Emergencies Programme and Jeremy Farrar, Director of the UK-based Wellcome Trust. They came to Mr Lwanga-Kikwaya’s aid.",
          "“Charles had spent a night, unconscious, without treatment in a hospital with very limited facilities, medicines or supplies,” says Dr Farrar. “We were able to stabilise his condition in the morning, but that was not an environment in which he could have recovered. We urgently needed to evacuate him if he was going to have a chance to survive.”",
          "“Charles was very badly injured, and he needed to be airlifted,” says Dr Ryan. “There was only one helicopter and that was the helicopter that was transporting the Director-General.”"

          "For the visitors from afar, and for the individuals who came under attack, the episode was a confronting reminder of the daily dangers faced by health workers in conflict zones. It also underscored how difficult it can be to deter people who choose to attack those working to save lives.",
          "“It’s a tragedy that mistrust, fear and the constant threat of violence, fuelled by decades of conflict and instability, leads to people like Charles being attacked while trying to help their neighbours survive this outbreak of Ebola,” says Dr Farrar. “I am humbled by the bravery of every one of those health workers putting their lives on the line day after day in DRC and around the world. We must honour their selfless dedication by offering them all the support we can to end the outbreak as soon as possible.”",
          "WHO recognizes the need to work together with communities to build trust between them and health workers. “We understand the sense of vulnerability that communities face when it comes to disease outbreaks,” says Hyo-Jeong Kim, who leads a WHO initiative called Attacks on Healthcare that aims to collect evidence and document best practices to prevent attacks on health care."

The electronic surveillance system allows WHO and partners on the ground to report on attacks in a consistent and systematic manner. The aim is to capture evidence in different countries, activate measures to further document their impact, and advocate at all levels for preventive and protective actions.",
          "From 1 January to 21 May 2019, 344 attacks on healthcare were recorded in the SSA, leading to 53 deaths and 262 injuries of health workers and patients. This data shows an average 17.2 attacks per week, or more than 2.4 attacks per day. Among all 7 countries that have reported attacks in 2019, Ebola-affected areas in DRC have recorded the highest number of attacks, showing the magnitude of the problem faced by health workers in this area.",
          "Collecting data is crucial to understanding patterns. “WHO is a scientific organization. Our job is to understand the problem: how big it is, where it is occurring. So, the world can see the problem and then use that information, together with other United Nations agencies, governments and NGOs, to advocate to stop the attacks,” says Dr Ryan. He knows first-hand what it means to survive an attack. In 1990, as a young doctor, he was held hostage in Iraq.",
          "For Dr Ryan, health systems and health workers are among the bedrocks of society. “Intentional attacks on healthcare are not only intolerable and illegal, but they also strikes at the heart of the community's capacity to survive. Directly targeting people takes away their means to be cured or helped if they become sick or injured,” he says.",

          "Breastmilk is the best source of food for all babies wherever they live but, in emergency settings where there is a high risk of diarrhoea, pneumonia and malnutrition, breastfeeding can be critical for child survival.",
          "Unfortunately, continuation of breastfeeding can be threatened in times of emergencies.",
          "“When women don’t have enough food to eat, they worry that they won’t produce enough milk. They are sometimes convinced they should switch to formula milk which is often made freely available by infant formula manufacturers who distribute their products as “aid”,” says Dr Hana Bekele, expert in child health and nutrition deployed from WHO’s office in Harare, Zimbabwe, to Mozambique for the response to Cyclone Idai.",
          "“What is most important right now, in this emergency, is to give breastfeeding mothers all possible support so that they can continue to breastfeed,” she says. “These people are traumatized, they have lost everything and are under a lot of stress so we need to support them to do the best thing for their children’s health. Breastfeeding women need everyone’s support.”",
          "In emergencies, the poor physical and mental health of mothers can create special challenges to breastfeeding. Displaced mothers may struggle to find comfortable, private places to breastfeed and their support network of family and friends is often not accessible in emergencies.",
          "With the right support – from a health worker, a counsellor or another mother – a woman who is already doing some breastfeeding can increase her milk production within days just by feeding her baby more frequently. This support could include establishing safe “corners” for mothers and infants, one-to-one counselling and mother-to-mother support in settlement camps or emergency clinics.",
          "In emergencies, all pregnant and lactating women, whether they are malnourished or not, should be given supplementary foods, such as extra energy- and protein-rich foods and supplements. Access to regular medical checks is important to ensure these women are in the best possible health to take care of their baby’s needs.",
          "“Given the situation here in Mozambique, the diarrhoea risk is high, people are displaced and living in crowded conditions in accommodation shelters,” says Dr Nellia Mutisse, specialist in child health from WHO’s office in Mozambique. “Breastfeeding is the best protection against diseases. Breastfed babies face much less risk of illness than babies who are not breastfed and, if they are sick, the duration of their illness is usually less.”",
          "In a statement issued just after Cyclone Idai hit, WHO, together with UNICEF, World Food Programme, Save the Children and World Vision International, called for all responders to the emergency in Mozambique to identify the needs of breastfeeding mothers as soon as possible and provide adequate protection and support.",
          "“We urge all stakeholders not to accept or distribute donations of breastmilk substitutes including infant formula, bottles and teats to the affected population,” said the joint statement. “It is crucial that breastfeeding is not unnecessarily disrupted by disease outbreaks or illness affecting mothers or children.”",
          "At times there might be a need for use of formula milk for infants and children but the products should never be targeted at women themselves and the tin should be a generic brand, without a label that markets the product, says Dr Mutisse.",
          "In Mozambique, WHO and partners are providing guidance on breastfeeding and breastmilk substitutes to nutritionists, administrators of temporary accommodation centres and technicians from the National Institute for Disaster Management who are responsible for the management of food and nutrition in this emergency.  WHO also trains health workers how, when and where they can use breastmilk substitutes in cases of emergency."

          "Eswatini has a largely rural population living close to venomous snakes that cause an estimated 200 - 400 cases of snakebite envenoming each year. Species such as the puff adder ( Bitis arietans ), Mozambique spitting cobra ( Naja mossambica ) and the much-feared black mamba ( Dendroaspis polylepis ) are responsible for most serious cases. Indeed most of the world – 5.8 billion people – are at risk of encountering a venomous snake. Every day, 7400 people a day are bitten by snakes, which kills as many between 81 000 and 138 000 people every year. Around 400 000 have permanent physical or psychological disabilities, including blindness, amputation and post-traumatic stress disorder. WHO has developed a global strategy to halve the number of snakebite induced deaths and disabilities by 2030 – the executive summary is released today (6 May 2019), and the full strategy will be launched at this year’s World Health Assembly. The strategy focuses on a combination of community empowerment and engagement, improved access to safe and effective treatments, measures that strengthen health systems and move countries closer to achieving universal health coverage, and greater cooperation and coordination between stakeholders in countries and across regions. Eswatini is one of several countries demonstrating the value of a community approach. The WHO strategy on Snake bite envenoming  is a welcome strategy the for control saving lives and reducing morbidy and disabilities linked to snake bite. A condition which affects the poorest of the poor who also have challenges accessing needed support in case of a snake bite. The implementation of the WHO strategy for the control and prevention of snakebite envenoming will address all the key snake bite attributable challenges in Eswatini  and as a result contribute  to Universal Health Coverage ” says WHO Representative to the Kingdom of Eswatini, Dr Cornelia Atsyor. “ This month WHO will launch the new strategy and I am very pleased to say that one of the experts consulted in the preparation of this plan was Eswatini’s own snakebite champion, Thea Litschka-Koen. ”",
          "Community education is critical in changing attitudes and healthcare-seeking behaviours",
          "People in rural areas face nocturnal home invasions by the Mozambique spitting cobra (Naja mossambica). Bites can cause debilitating and long-term disability from necrotic toxins in the venom. Outreach programmes run by the Swaziland Antivenom Foundation teach people how to prevent unnecessary contact with venomous snakes, dispel myths and teach them which snakes are venomous and what to do in case of a snakebite emergency.",
          "Prevention is better than cure - teaching people to avoid venomous snakes is key",
          "Educating people in communities in Eswatini about snakes and snakebite avoidance, and how to live safely in areas where venomous snakes occur, saves lives and limbs and is key to effective prevention and control. At the same time, the prevention of snakebite in communities has been bolstered by enlisting well-trained volunteer snake catchers to both remove dangerous snakes out of people’s way, and to preserve non-venomous snakes while also educating people and thereby maintaining the natural predatory balance between snake species. This reduces human-snake conflict and the risk of snakebite.",
          "Trained snake handlers can safely relocate dangerous snakes",
          "Who do you call when a 2-metre-long black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) makes its home in your bedroom cupboard? Eswatini’s team of well-trained snake handlers safely relocate dangerous snakes, avoiding the risk of a snakebite for members of the household, and ensuring the snake lives in its natural habitat.",
          "Working with traditional healers can improve health-seeking behaviour",
          "Traditional beliefs are an intricate part of Eswatini culture and for many people, there is much superstition and mythology surrounding snakes. Thus, traditional healers are often the first choice for treatment after a snakebite takes place. Training traditional healers to recognise the symptoms of the most serious effects of snakebite envenoming means they can now refer snakebite victims to health centres.",
          "First responders are being trained in pre-hospital medical care",
          "Early effective pre-hospital care and treatment for snakebite victims is an essential part of a functional first responder health service. Training first aiders and ambulance personnel to stabilise and safely transport snakebite victims to health care is an essential part of building a strong link between communities and health services. Implementation of a dedicated first response treatment protocol is improving time-to-treat, reducing mortality and improving tissue survival and recovery.",
          "Training health workers to diagnose and treat snakebites is essential",
          "The Swaziland Antivenom Foundation brings local and international experts on snakebite together through an annual medical symposium on the subject that is helping to define and implement best practice. Emphasis on continuous and improved wound management and skin grafting techniques, for the rehabilitation after cytotoxic envenomation is helping to tackle the burden of disability due to snakebites. A species-specific, locally relevant medical management protocol has made the treatment of snakebite easier.",
          "Local antivenom banks ensure that supplies are available to communities",
          "Around 2000 - 4000 vials of antivenom are needed each year in Eswatini, although it never has enough. The Swaziland Antivenom Foundation has established 11 antivenom banks across the country, funded by individuals and corporate donations, to maximise the use and effectiveness of this essential medicine.",
          "Snakebite is physically and mentally traumatic, and can devastate lives For every person who dies from a snakebite, another 3 – 5 people are left permanently disabled. Children can account for up to 45% of victims in some countries and the impact of disability on young lives is particularly damaging to communities. Many are unable to go back to their normal lives. For people who have the main income in a household, losing the use of a limb can make it impossible for them to return to work, sending their whole family into poverty and debt. Counselling and support is an absolute necessity after snakebite, but so too is the need to financially assist and support rural families recovering from mortality or morbidity of snakebite. Community-based surveys fill important gaps in our mapping of burden of disease",
          "Improving our knowledge of the epidemiology of snakebite and the burden of mortality and morbidity requires a combination of sampling methods and technologies. In Eswatini, a mobile phone-based App for health workers will not only provide access to urgent advice from specialists and access to treatment protocols, but will also make it possible to record snakebite cases and upload the data to a central repository. But not all victims go to hospital, and it is important to work with communities to ensure that these cases are identified and reported so that government can allocate appropriate resources to effective case management.",
          "Simple changes in behaviour, such as wearing shoes, can reduce the risk of snakebites",
          "Engaging with strategic partners, health providers, antivenom manufacturers, funders, government and other policy makers is vital. But equally necessary is the need for behaviour change advocates. Some changes in behaviour can include sleeping under malaria bed nets to avoid contact with nocturnal snakes, or wearing shoes and clothing that protect the feet and lower legs,  which can also prevent malaria and soil-borne helminths.",
          "Rehabilitation and recovery services are vital if victims are to return to their lives",
          "Mkhulu was a respected and proud subsistence Eswatini farmer until being bitten by a Mozambique spitting cobra changed his life forever. There was no antivenom available, and the bitten limb soon became necrotic leaving a large wound that simply would not heal, meaning he had to amputate his leg. When the the Swaziland Antivenom Foundation, came across him he was confined to his bed and full of bedsores. In his late 80s, he had never slept on a bed and was too weak to pull himself up to use a home-made crutch to move around the house, let alone get to his pit-latrine outside. The Foundation donated a new bed, a wheelchair and some much needed support, helping him to restore his dignity and his standing within his family and community."

          "In Ghana, a strong national health insurance scheme is helping people around the country access vital health services. While the insurance scheme has allowed Ghana to make huge strides towards universal health coverage, up until recently infection prevention and control (IPC) and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) were still not considered a priority in many health facilities. Policies were outdated, and health workers often did not understand the importance of IPC practices like hand hygiene, appropriate use of personal protective equipment and proper environmental cleaning.",
          "In 2016, 30% of facilities across Ghana did not have access to basic water services .",
          "These gaps in WASH and IPC resulted in high rates of hospital-associated infections and longer stays in hospital, loss of productivity, increased health costs, patient and families suffering and even death.",
          "When a devastating Ebola outbreak hit west Africa in 2014-15, Ghana created a new national policy and set up a training programme to build the skills and capacity of more than 34 000 frontline health workers in 170 health facilities.",
          "In 2016, Health Information Officer, Isaac Eyram Tegbey was working at Weija-Gbawe Municipal Hospital in Ghana. As with many health facilities in Ghana at the time, IPC at the hospital was not considered a priority. Health workers had a lack of awareness of the importance of IPC practices, and levels of infections were high. At the time, 19% of babies born at the hospital had sepsis and jaundice.",
          "In his role as health information officer, Isaac had limited knowledge of IPC himself and was never involved in clinical decisions. Then he completed training to become a Regional IPC Champion and facilitator. The training was organized by the Institutional Care Division of Ghana Health Services, supported by USAID Systems for Health.",
          "Isaac’s enthusiasm and interest in IPC contributed to a transformation of IPC practices at his hospital. He helped to completely turn around the quality of IPC in his facility with initiatives like wooden mobile hand washing systems to save money by preventing rust; in-house production of alcohol hand rub; ensuring the supply of wall mountable soap, sanitizer and tissue dispensers; and the introduction of a quality control system that assures the quality of all IPC supplies entering the facility.",
          "“Today I am consulted to make inputs to very critical clinical decisions in my facility,” said Isaac. “IPC is now part of the orientation programme for new staff. Healthy competition has emerged among health care facilities, with results being displayed for all communities to see.”",
          "Isaac is currently the coordinator for IPC for the Greater Accra Region and provides support, mentoring and coaching to facility IPC focal points. His efforts have led to his hospital winning top spot in its regional peer review exercise for three years in a row. But more importantly, it has greatly improved outcomes for patients.",
          "Around the country a greater focus on IPC practices in health facilities has resulted in many improvements in the health of Ghana’s people. While work is still needed, 83% of health care facilities in Ghana have improved sanitation. Newborn sepsis and jaundice has been reduced to zero cases in 2018. There has also been a reduction in neonatal infections in some facilities and improved birth rates . But for these improvements to be sustainable, governments, health actors and IPC and WASH leaders must commit to prioritizing IPC and WASH in health infrastructure and overall quality in service delivery.",
          "WHO and partners are helping drive progress and sustainability through information, standards, policies and implementation strategies. Clean, quality care is a right for all patients and results in the protection and satisfaction of health care workers. With his unwavering enthusiasm and drive for quality, Isaac is an excellent example of a motivated, trained and highly-skilled health workers making a difference in his field. Along with many other health workers, his focus on IPC will continue to save lives."

          "Alinafe Tsitsi, a mother of two, arrived at the Mitundu Community Hospital, Malawi early Tuesday morning. Cradling her youngest child close to her chest, she joined a forming line. Like many other mothers gathered at the hospital, Tsitsi had learned from\r\n        a community healthcare worker that the world’s first malaria vaccine would be introduced today.",
          "Mothers wait for the malaria vaccine in Malawi . Photo: WHO/M.Niewenhof",
          "Having experienced the high personal toll taken by malaria, she wanted to make sure her youngest child is protected.",
          "“My husband was diagnosed with malaria, but there was no medication available at the hospital,” Tsitsi said. “I was scared for his life. He is the breadwinner of the family. We had to borrow money to get treatment at a private clinic.\r\n    When I found out about the malaria vaccine, I wanted my child to have it.”",
          "Malaria remains a major killer worldwide and particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa where more than 250 000 children under five-years-old die every year. They are the most vulnerable group that accounts for over 60% of all malaria deaths worldwide.",
          "Dr Mary Hamel, Lead for Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme at WHO said that there has been a lot of progress made in controlling malaria in the past 15 years.",
          "“There has been a steady decline in malaria cases and deaths, mostly from insecticide treated bednets, indoor residual spraying and highly effective treatment when children do get sick,” Dr Hamel said. “But we have come to a point where\r\n    progress has stalled, and we know this is a time when we desperately need a new tool. We hope that the new malaria vaccine will be that tool.”",
          "RTS,S is the first and, to date, the only vaccine to show partial protection against malaria in young children. It acts against P. falciparum, the most deadly malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa. Among children who received 4 doses\r\n    in large-scale clinical trials, the vaccine prevented approximately 4 in 10 cases of malaria and 3 in 10 cases of severe malaria over a four-year period.",
          "“This vaccine has a somewhat unusual schedule,” Dr Hamel said. It’s given at 5, 6 and 7 months of age and then at around 2 years of age. A key question is whether the parents will bring their children for these visits.",
          "Communities are engaged on the malaria vaccine pilot. Photo: WHO/M.Niewenhof",
          "Malawi is the first country to pilot the vaccine in their routine immunization programme across 11 districts in the country.",
          "It is one of the countries worst affected by malaria, with over 4 million cases and 7000 deaths in 2017. \r\n    Local doctors and nurses hope that the vaccine, along with other malaria prevention measures, will reduce the number of life-threatening infections due to the disease.",
          "“People have received the introduction of the vaccine very well,” Haneefa Likaka, Senior Nursing Officer at Mitundu Community Hospital said. “A lot of mothers with 5-months-old babies turned up, which gives us a clue that mothers also\r\n    want to end malaria.”",
          "Dr Michael Kayange, Deputy Director of Malaria, Ministry of Health of Malawi said that work with the communities will continue to support malaria prevention, with continued promotion of bed nets to protect families against infection.",
          "“We have communication teams on the ground to make sure that women get the correct messages,” Dr Kayange said. “They should not think that when their children get the malaria vaccine, they are fully protected. They can still pick up\r\n    malaria if other preventive measures are not being used.”",
          "Children up to 2 years in Malawi are receiving the malaria vaccine. Photo: WHO/M. Reinfelde",
          "As for Tsitsi, she is fully committed to comply with the full malaria vaccination schedule and to make sure other women at her community are informed.",
          "“When I will go home, I will talk to friends and to other women in the community about the malaria vaccine,” she said. “I will tell them to come vaccinate their children.”",
          "The next step in the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme is to start piloting the vaccine in Kenya and Ghana, the two remaining countries selected for malaria vaccine introduction.",
          "“The pilots will take four years to complete,” Dr Hamel said. “If there is a policy for wider use of the vaccine, which could come earlier, we will learn a lot to help other countries implement successful programmes in the future.”",
          "Led by the Ministries in Health in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, the RTS,S pilot programme is being funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and Unitaid. WHO, PATH and GSK are providing additional contributions, with GSK donating up to 10 million doses of the vaccine."

          "On 25–27 March, representatives of Member States, WHO, partner organizations, civil society and academia began a consultative process to develop a regional strategy and action plan to promote the health of migrants, refugees and displaced populations in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.",
          "The proposed action plan for 2019–2023 aims to regionalize global commitments to improve migrant and refugee health made in the \"Global Compact for Refugees\", \"Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration\" and the \"WHO Global Action Plan to Promote the Health of Refugees and Migrants\". The 3-day interactive meeting provided a platform for participants to discuss global, regional and national issues, as well as to share evidence and good practices from countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, other WHO regions, in particular WHO's European and African regions.",
          "The Eastern Mediterranean Region has witnessed an unprecedented magnitude and scale of crises over the last few decades. It now hosts the highest number of refugees worldwide. Currently, 66% of refugees, and 33% of asylum seekers reside in this Region, and currently one out of 10 people are displaced.",
          "In addition to humanitarian emergencies, the Region is characterized by significant international and intra-regional migration, with the vast majority migrant workers. The Arab region itself hosts roughly 14% of the global migrant population and north Africa is home to 2.2 million migrants.",
          "Thus, many countries in the Region face considerable challenges in re-orienting national health and development plans toward the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal targets, inclusive of refugees and migrants.",
          "The WHO Regional Office provides support to Member States to strengthen governance, leadership and ownership in the area of health of migrants, and refugees and to develop relevant technical materials, strategic research, development of assessment tools, model of care and applies the principle of delivering as one.",
          "WHO continues to provide technical support to countriesto assess the public health capacity to prepared and respond to large influx of migrants, refugees and other vulnerable people on the move; to streamline human mobility within population-based health strategies, health information system, early warning system; to strengthen the capacity of Member States to identify health needs and health profile of migrants, refugees, displaced and other vulnerable mobile populations and host population alike.",
          "Participants reviewed the proposed regional strategy and action plan and it will be further reviewed before submission to the Regional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean of 2019 for proposed endorsement by Member States.",
          "Dalia Samhouri, Manager, Country Health Preparedness and International Health Regulations ProgrammeDr Dalia Samhouri, said that “countries in our region have shown excellent approaches and good practices that we can build upon. Nevertheless; we need to increase our endeavours as the challenges have not been fully addressed. The workshop provided us a notable platform to discuss our regional efforts and how we will join our forces. The recommendations, solutions and feedback of the participants were critical to ensure the most effective strategies and actions on the way to ‘Health for all by all’ goal for our region.”"

Kannah Knowledge gained following the 2014–16 West Africa Ebola outbreak identified a number of challenges survivors face, including reduced or blurred vision stemming from inflammation of their eyes. About 20% of survivors from that outbreak had some form of eye problem. An aerial view of the city of Beni in North Kivu province World Bank/V. Tremeau",
          "By identifying and treating these problems early, serious consequences, including blindness, can be averted. With the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the World Health Organization recently organized an eye clinic to check on the eye health of survivors of the current Ebola outbreak. Dr Jessica Shantha (left) and Dr Steven Yeh (right), professors from Emory University, check the eyes of an Ebola survivor for any potential complications WHO/J. D. Kannah",
          "The clinic was held in Beni, DRC, one of the affected areas, from 25 March to 1 April. In addition, an eye clinic in Butembo, another affected area, was equipped so that they can provide this specialized care to survivors there. This is the first time in an Ebola outbreak that follow-up for eye care has happened so soon after survivors have been released from care. Ms Kanyare brings her baby Muhindo to the clinic WHO/J. D. Kannah",
          "Several survivors also helped with the planning and administration of the clinic. Partners in this project include Emory University, which deployed two ophthalmologists, and University of North Carolina which deployed one ophthalmologist to the project via the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, which is hosted by WHO. Centrine takes an eye test to check for any complications following her survival from Ebola WHO/J. D. Kannah",
          "Over 250 survivors were seen. The team noted that complications such as uveitis were observed at lower rates compared to cases from the 2014–16 West Africa Ebola outbreak. So far only one survivor had eye complications that may be linked to Ebola. Télesphore Mumbere, Professor of Ophthalmology at the University Clinic Butembo, checks the eyes of an Ebola survivor WHO/J. D. Kannah",
          "As part of the programme, international specialists trained 10 Congolese ophthalmologists on how to identify and treat Ebola-related eye issues. Feedback from participating national healthcare providers and enrolled survivors was overwhelmingly positive. Christian has his eyes checked by Dr Steven Yeh WHO/J. D. Kannah",
          "Next steps will be to continue to follow up with survivors, at the clinics held each month, where they are provided medical, biological and psychological care . There are currently over 300 survivors registered in the follow-up programme."

          "WHO/M. Nieuwenhof",
          "Amelia Mateos, a preventive medicine technician, is leading the campaign at this vaccination station – one of 73 vaccination points in Dondo district. As each child comes forward, she takes a small glass vial from the tray, inspects it and shakes it vigorously before removing the cap. She gently tilts the child’s head back and, with one hand on their chin, encourages them to open their mouth wide. She shakes the vial of 1.5ml liquid vaccine into the child’s mouth and, with a gentle pat on their head, sends them off into the bright daylight outside the classroom.",
          "WHO/M. Nieuwenhof",
          "WHO/M. Nieuwenhof",
          "“Don’t spit it out,” she says to one small boy who is scrunching up his face in disgust. It may not taste very nice but this vaccine will protect these children from something much worse - the horrible and sometimes deadly diarrhoeal disease cholera.",
          "José, a volunteer, is marking a cross on a paper sheet to keep track of the number of vaccines given. More than 1200 volunteers are supporting the Ministry of Health and partners for this rapid campaign. Each vaccination team is led by a health worker, and three others to support with preparing the vaccine vials, tallying the vaccines given and marking the fingernails of those already vaccinated.",

          "WHO/M. Nieuwenhof",
          "“We are doing this campaign because cholera is a major public health threat,” says Amelia. “Since we started at 7am, we have already vaccinated 1300 children at this school.”",
          "Since Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique on 14 March, hundreds of thousands of people have been living in temporary settlements without access to safe water and sanitation. The Ministry of Health declared a cholera outbreak on 27 March and, as of 5 April, had reported more than 2430 cases and 3 deaths.",
          "On 2 April, almost 900 000 doses of oral cholera vaccine arrived in Beira. They were donated from the global cholera vaccine stockpile which is funded by Gavi. The campaign, also funded by Gavi, is being run by the Mozambique Ministry of Health with support from WHO, UNICEF, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Save the Children.",

The number of volunteers is impressive and, wherever they go, there has been very strong uptake of the vaccine. Everyone is very keen to make this a success to stop cholera in its tracks.”",
          "WHO/S. Cumberland",
          "The vaccines are being given to populations identified by the Government at highest risk – those without access to safe water and sanitation - in Beira, Dondo, Nhamatanda and Buzi. “Controlling cholera in these areas will reduce the risk to the rest of the population because fewer people will be taking it back and forth into the wider community,” says WHO cholera vaccination expert Kate Alberti.",
          "About a week after receiving the vaccine, the vaccinated person develops protection against cholera. A single dose will protect for about 6 months.",
          "Maria Judith is a medical doctor who works in maternal and child health at Dondo Health Centre. She is in charge of the vaccination station here, one of 15 fixed points in Dondo. In addition to these fixed stations, there are almost 60 mobile vaccination units that will move around the district, and there are plans to go door-to-door at the end of the campaign to ensure full coverage. In total, the local health authorities have mobilized more than 340 teams for this campaign.",

          "“Cholera is a disease that is spread by lack of sanitation,” says Erica, who is a student in 8 th grade at Macharote Secondary School in Dondo. Erica is one of thousands of high school students who were vaccinated today. She shows the black mark on her fingernail to indicate that she has received the vaccine.",

          "Agbo is a community health worker involved in TIPTOP 1 , an innovative pilot project aimed at protecting African mothers and newborns from malaria. In collaboration with\r\n    ministries of health, TIPTOP volunteers like Agbo are working to expand community-based access to “intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy” (IPTp) in 4 countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the region that carries the heaviest burden\r\n    of the disease.",
          "More than 50 million women in sub-Saharan Africa become pregnant each year and are at risk of exposure to Plasmodium falciparum , the deadliest malaria parasite globally. Left untreated, malaria in pregnancy can lead to maternal death, anemia\r\n    and low birth weight – a major cause of infant mortality. IPTp with the quality-assured medicine sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) can prevent the development of these and other adverse consequences.",
          "Since 2012, WHO has recommended the administration of 3 or more doses of IPTp-SP for pregnant women living in all areas of moderate-to-high malaria transmission in Africa. The medicine should be given during routine antenatal care (ANC) visits starting\r\n    as early as possible in the second trimester, under the watch of a trained health care provider."

However, access to the preventive therapy throughout pregnancy remains low. According to the World malaria report 2018 ,\r\n only 22% of eligible pregnant women received the recommended 3 or more doses of IPTp-SP in 33 African countries.",
          "Barriers to access include the long distances that many pregnant women must travel to reach antenatal clinics, and related transportation costs. Those who reach health facilities may have difficulty accessing IPTp-SP due to stock-outs of the preventive\r\n    medicine or insufficient information provided by health workers.",
          "Several projects, including TIPTOP, aim to overcome these challenges. TIPTOP was launched in 2017 by Jhpiego, a non-profit organization affiliated with The Johns Hopkins University, in partnership with the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.

          "Agbo has received specific training for this role. Eligible community health workers must come from the community and have a basic level of education.",
          "As she makes her rounds in her community, Agbo is equipped with quality-assured SP, which is provided to her at regular intervals by an ANC clinic. Through monthly house calls, she is able to educate expectant mothers about the preventive malaria therapy\r\n    and the importance of receiving comprehensive antenatal care at the nearest ANC facility; to recognize signs and symptoms of malaria; to determine when and how to administer IPTp with SP; and to encourage the use of insecticide treated bed-nets."

It is 1 of 4 countries that the TIPTOP project is supporting,\r\n    along with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Mozambique.",
          "“Given Nigeria’s high malaria burden, the impact of malaria on pregnant women, very low antenatal care utilization rates generally, and the low uptake of IPTp in the country, Nigeria was an important country to implement the project in,”\r\n    says Elaine Roman, TIPTOP Project Director at Jhpiego.",
          "Over the 5-year duration of the project, TIPTOP will be rolled out in 3 Nigerian states – Ebonyi, in a first phase, followed by Niger and Ogun. The Ohaukwu area of Ebonyi, where Agbo works, reports the highest levels of malaria cases between April\r\n    and October.",
          "According to Dr Lynda Ozor, WHO National Programme Officer for Nigeria, fluctuations in transmission rates are in part linked to the rain cycle. “Peak transmission coincides with the rainy seasons, which sees mosquito breeding sites develop in and\r\n    around where people live,” she explains “There is a very high prevalence of malaria in the population. So the mosquito just bites an infected person and the cycle keeps going.”"

Agbo’s\r\n    regular presence also serves to strengthen ties between the new community-based services offered through TIPTOP and antenatal care services.",
          "Through the TIPTOP project, pregnant women gain immediate access to the recommended preventive treatment in the community and are encouraged to complete regular check-ups at full-service health facilities. These referrals to ANC facilities are critical:\r\n    an increase in the number of contacts between health care providers and pregnant women creates opportunities to expand coverage of both IPTp and antenatal care.",
          "Since 2016, WHO has recommended a minimum of 8 contacts between pregnant women and\r\nthe health system during pregnancy, versus the previously recommended 4 antenatal care visits. Each contact should provide an opportunity for high-quality care, including preventive and curative medical care, support, and the provision of timely and relevant\r\ninformation.",

A key aim of the TIPTOP project is to generate evidence from\r\n    sub-Saharan Africa on the delivery of IPTp at the community level. This evidence will be assessed in due course, along with evidence generated from other similar projects, which may guide future WHO policy recommendations to prevent malaria in pregnancy.",

Partners have developed a training package for community health workers and antenatal care\r\n    providers that complements existing national training materials. Together with ministries of health, TIPTOP partners are also working to ensure that project sites are stocked with the quality-assured preventive medicine.",

          "It has been eight months since an outbreak of Ebola was declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s North Kivu province. Since then, this outbreak has become the country’s most severe. Over 900 people have contracted the virus, and close to 600 have lost their lives.",
          "In the midst of conflict, and in some of the most challenging conditions, Ebola responders are working round the clock to ensure people can get the information, the care and the treatment they need.",
          "Since the start of the outbreak, WHO has deployed nearly 700 staff to DRC",
          "These frontline heroes include medics, vaccinators, epidemiologists, logisticians, lab technicians, hygienists, communicators and others, all of whom are playing a crucial role in a complex and coordinated response.",
          "Many of the responders have been deployed from other African countries including Guinea, who sent  experienced vaccinators to help train local health workers on using this investigational vaccine.",
          "WHO and partners are providing patient care in Ebola treatment centres across the area",
          "In Butembo, there was an attack on the treatment center at 6am on the day I was planning to visit. Armed men shot at the centre. They killed a policeman, they wounded three workers, they left bullet holes in the windows. But they did not dampen the spirits of the health workers who work there. When I arrived at the centre five hours later, it was already reopened.",
          "WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus",
          "Timely treatment – at the earliest sign of symptoms - is key to improving a person’s chances of survival, once they have been infected with the Ebola virus.",
          "Ebola treatment centres provide over 350 beds for Ebola patients. WHO has deployed medics and more than 300 metric tonnes of medical supplies to support patient care.",
          "Over 88 000 people in the country have been vaccinated against Ebola",
          "In 2015, a trial took place in Guinea and found the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine to be highly effective against the virus. Since then, it has been approved for ‘compassionate use’ in the DRC outbreak, and is being made available to those who may have been exposed to Ebola.",
          "Vaccination is a key tool in the Ebola response.  As part of these efforts, over 28 000 health workers in DRC have received the vaccine. Health and frontline workers are among those most vulnerable to infection with the virus.",
          "Working with local groups, communities across DRC have been reached with information on Ebola",
          "Teams on the ground are engaging communities daily. Outreach teams, made up of local staff and volunteers, have met with thousands of families in outbreak-affected areas, to raise awareness on Ebola prevention, symptoms, and how to get help if a case occurs.",
          "This has also built support for the response efforts, even in communities where security concerns run high. The vast majority of people who are eligible have chosen to receive the vaccine. Families are also working with authorities to perform safe and dignified burials, where loved ones have – tragically - lost their lives to the virus.",
          "Over 400 people have been treated with new investigational Ebola drugs",
          "In the context of the current outbreak, patients are being offered new investigational therapeutics under a clinical trial being coordinated by WHO.  This trial – a first ever - is an important step towards finding an effective treatment for Ebola. The patients who choose to join the study are providing information that will help us know the impact of these therapeutics on recovery.",
          "Over 43 000 screenings have been done at national and international airports",
          "Alongside the response in DRC itself, hundreds of health workers, border officers and other responders in neighbouring countries have been trained and prepared to respond to a potential case, should it occur. In Uganda, over 4000 health workers have been vaccinated as a precautionary measure, as well as over 900 health workers in South Sudan. Despite progress achieved there remain challenges",
          "Funding for the response is still insufficient to meet the magnitude of the needs, and the complexity of the situation. Katwa and Butembo – where the majority of cases are now occurring - remain major areas of concern. Recent attacks on treatment centres by armed groups put health workers and patients at risk. Such attacks are deplorable for their immediate impact on lives and for the risk of further spreading the disease.",
          "WHO has requested and received further support from UN and local police forces to protect the treatment centres and patients. We are also working to engage communities to strengthen ownership of the response, and will continue delivering critical work – across surveillance, disease control, communication and the many other areas - to end the outbreak. WHO is committed to improving the health of the people of DRC now and in years to come."

          "On International Women’s Day, we celebrate all the women who have had a pioneering role in advancing science and health. One of the best known was Florence Nightingale, a 19 th- century statistician and founder of modern nursing, who understood the benefits of hygiene and sanitation in preventing disease.",
          "Fe del Mundo a paediatrician from the Philippines, who went on to do pioneering work on infectious diseases including dengue, was the first female student at Harvard Medical School.",
          "Anandi Gopal Joshi was one of the first Indian female doctors, appointed physician-in-charge at a hospital in central India, before she died of tuberculosis aged just 22.",
          "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, born shortly after Florence Nightingale, taught herself French so that she could obtain a medical degree at the University of Sorbonne in Paris. She became Britain’s first female doctor.",
          "In the 20 th century, Anne Szarewski discovered the cause of cervical cancer, leading to the first-ever HPV vaccine and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi’s work on HIV was fundamental to the identification of the virus as the cause of AIDS.",
          "In 2019, however, women are still only a third of researchers worldwide , on average. Some regions such as Central Asia as well as Latin America and the Caribbean have a nearly equal gender balance, but in Europe and North America, the proportion of women remains around 30-35%.",
          "Women also struggle to rise up the ranks of both health and science. Women make up just 12% of the membership of national science academies around the world. Female health workers comprise 70% of the health workforce worldwide, yet women occupy only 25% of leadership positions in health.",
          "And the pay differential is high: the gender pay gap in health and social sectors is around 26% in high-income countries and 29% in upper-middle income countries.",
          "Gender discrimination, implicit bias, sexual harassment, and assault have been found to be systemic barriers to women’s advancement in global health careers. These are compounded by a lack of policies to accommodate having children (including flexible working arrangements and increased paternity leave).",
          "There are positive signs that change is coming. In WHO for example, women hold 60% of senior leadership positions. WHO also has an active gender equity hub to ensure that a gender lens is applied on health workforce policies worldwide. Things are changing in academia as well: last year, nearly 40% of new members into the National Academy of Medicine were women.",
          "Evidence is emerging already that implementing flexible working arrangements, providing mentorship programmes, and instituting formal polices on gender discrimination and harassment, and gender-specific leadership training can break down the barriers for women to lead in global health.",
          "However, it is important to transform the very systems that women work in .This may require re-examining traditional career trajectories and methods of promotion. Too often, women are encouraged to mould to a system that was designed for men. However, new waves of women leaders are succeeding in ways that reflect tolerance, cooperation and resolve. These women may lead in different ways, sharing power and information while enhancing other people’s self-worth.",
          "The argument for increasing the representation of women leaders in science and health is often economic, on the basis that diverse perspectives in leadership can benefit business. But a business case cannot be the only reason to advance women in science.",
          "On 8 March 2019, it’s a moment to recall that principles of human rights and social equity require that women play just as significant roles in science and health as men."

To ensure everyone, including all migrant workers, are made aware of the risks and prevention measures for Leishmaniasis and other neglected tropical diseases, outreach must include the labour, education, communities and other sectors."

The second one was closer. The third bomb blew the gates of the hospital, where Hasan was leading a workshop for 80 community volunteers working on cholera vaccination campaign.",

It was very difficult to see it all, many of those killed by the gate were the injured brought from the fish market that were waiting to be hospitalized,” recalls Hasan, a communications officer at WHO Yemen. “There was also total chaos inside; the medical staff couldn’t cope with the number of injured,” he says.",
          "The impact of the bomb went beyond the immediate wounded and killed – it effectively disrupted the functionality of the hospital for days as health care staff and patients were too afraid to go to the hospital. It had devastating effects for people – the hospital, one of the biggest in the country, normally took in 1500 patients, who now couldn’t get care. “It had turned into a ghost hospital. I could barely find a doctor there,” says Hasan as he visited the hospital in the days after the attack. “It's just a coincidence and luck that I survived. I was just in the same place that was hit a few minutes before the attack,” he says.",

The electronic surveillance system will enable WHO and partners on the ground to report on attacks on health care in a consistent and systematic manner, to allow WHO to capture evidence on attacks in different countries, activate measures to further document their impact, and advocate at all levels for preventive and protective actions. Currently, seven countries report into the Surveillance System for Attacks on Healthcare: Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Mali, and the occupied Palestinian territories.",

After about three months of regular treatment the number of seizures she was experiencing dropped by more than a half and her general condition improved.",

          "After being diagnosed with cancer, patients in Gaza may often have to wait for months before being able to receive treatment. Getting a permit to access the health care needed outside can be a stressful and unpredictable process, and many apply multiple times before being able to exit. Even then, some patients are never able to secure the permits they need to access care. The ability of Gaza’s hospitals to provide adequate diagnosis and treatment to cancer patients is severely limited due to chronic shortages of medicines and lack of medical equipment. Nuclear medicine scanning needed for staging cancers, radiotherapy equipment and some specialized surgeries are unavailable. More than half of essential chemotherapy drugs were at less than a month’s supply throughout 2018. Many patients need health care elsewhere in the occupied Palestinian territory or abroad. But to leave the Gaza Strip for treatment, they must obtain a permit from Israeli authorities. This process can take up to several months, and even then some patients may be unsuccessful in securing access to travel for health care. In 2018, 39% of patient applications for permits to exit Gaza for health care were unsuccessful. Sixty-four-year-old Samira was diagnosed with uterine cancer in 2016. She underwent surgery but then required follow-up treatment unavailable in Gaza. Doctors referred Samira for radiotherapy to East Jerusalem. It took her more than 6 months and 5 permit applications to finally exit Gaza in June 2018. “All this time I was suffering from abnormal bleeding. It was a matter of life and death. Why was I denied a permit?’’ she says. Proper cancer diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to improve the prognosis of patients and their chance of survival. The 5-year survival rate for breast cancer can exceed 80% if early detection and essential treatment services are available and accessible. In Gaza, however, it is significantly lower – only 65% of women with breast cancer survive 5 years after diagnosis. Khadijah, a 32-year-old mother of 4, noticed something unusual with her breast in December 2017. Soon doctors confirmed she had breast cancer. In January 2018, Khadijah applied for a permit to go to Augusta Victoria Hospital in East Jerusalem for a specialized investigation – to see whether the cancer had spread and if so, how far. Her permit was denied. She started receiving chemotherapy in Gaza, but for optimal treatment surgery was needed. In July, Khadijah reapplied for a permit, and again was denied. She decided to change her treatment destination to Egypt. Khadijah’s second attempt to leave Gaza to Egypt was finally successful. She had surgery in August 2018, 7 months after diagnosis. Every cancer patient has the right to health. This means being able to access quality and acceptable health care and to enjoy the conditions of life that support staying healthy. Restrictions to accessing essential health services are one of the major barriers to the right to health for Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Restrictions affect cancer patients at a vulnerable point in their lives, when they need specialist care and services for diagnosis and treatment. The World Health Organization calls for the protection and fulfilment of the right to health for all Palestinians."

Over the years, Aleppo became the epicentre of intense fighting. Although Ahmed survived many security incidents in and around the hospital, he does not consider himself to be out of danger. “The situation in Aleppo is calm now, but the war continues. The risk is still there”, he explains. He remembers the last attack. The hospital was full of patients, and there were several operations scheduled for that day. The shelling started near the hospital, and then the operating theatre was hit. “We had a patient on the operating table with an open stomach wound; we couldn’t leave him. But I remember the fear”, he says.",

He sees the chaos around him, but says his life is no different to that of other Syrians. “Maybe it is a bit more dangerous because I am a health worker, and this group is often targeted through shelling, kidnappings or assaults,” he says.",

And I want us to be able to provide better health care services, similar to those in developed countries… For now, being here with my family and being able to help patients, knowing that I am making a difference, is something that has helped me to survive.\"",

One night his mother gave him his medicine as usual and put him to bed. When his father went to wake him in the morning, Buddy was dead. Medics told Buddy’s parents that their child had been dead for hours. Months later, an investigation by the coroner revealed that instead of his usual medicine, L-tryptophan, Buddy had toxic amounts of a powerful muscle relaxant drug called Baclofen in his system. Buddy had died from a medication mix-up.",
          "Upon analyzing the medicine remaining from Buddy’s prescription, the coroner found that the amount of medicine was precisely the amount required to produce the L-tryptophan mixture – but it was the wrong drug. Someone in the lab had mistakenly used Baclofen powder instead of L-tryptophan powder. The resulting liquid contained enough Baclofen to kill an adult, but it looked and apparently tasted the same as the L-tryptophan mixture. Once the mistake was made, it was impossible to tell the difference.",
          "Buddy’s parents have begun a campaign to require reporting of medication errors to a database in the province they live in, and they hope that other provinces will follow suit. While pharmacy errors are believed to be rare in their high-income country, the actual number and type are not known because only one province now has such a requirement. “I think that when there is transparency, training can happen, review of policy and procedures can happen, intervention can happen”, Buddy’s mother said. “Nothing can bring Buddy back to us. However, in his caring spirit we want the laws to protect all people,” she concluded.",

At the emergency department, tests showed high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, reduced kidney function, and high uric acid. After a short hospital stay, Mr Amin was sent home with prescriptions for insulin, a cholesterol medicine, and four types of blood pressure medicine. The high uric acid, which is sometimes but not always associated with gout, was not treated.",
          "Not long afterward, Mr. Amin went for a follow-up visit at his regular primary care centre. Because Mr Amin’s uric acid level had not gone down, the primary care practitioner gave him a prescription for allopurinol, a powerful drug that reduces uric acid. Mr Amin soon developed a severe skin rash, which rapidly became worse. His family took him back to the emergency department, where he was diagnosed with Stevens Johnson Syndrome. Stevens Johnson Syndrome is a dangerous condition in which the upper layers of the skin and mucous membranes peel off. It is a known and feared side effect of the drug allopurinol. Mr Amin died in the hospital a few days later. While allopurinol is the drug of choice for lowering uric acid in gout, the risk of Stevens Johnson Syndrome and other rare but serious drug reactions cannot be ignored. Clinical practice guidelines in Mr Amin's country advise against using allopurinol in patients like Mr Amin, who have no external signs of gout. Furthermore, patients taking high-risk drugs like allopurinol should be told what to do if they have a reaction. This did not happen in the case of Mr Amin, who believed he had chicken pox and did not know to stop taking the drug. *The names and photos used in this story are not real, but the story is based on true events."

          "Dora’s daughter took her to the general practitioner who said sympathetically that this was Parkinson’s disease and there was nothing to be done. In the course of the conversation, the doctor mentioned that the only Parkinson’s she had ever seen alleviated was drug-induced. Upon returning home, Dora’s daughter happened to glance at her mother’s long list of medications and had a moment of inspiration. She returned to the doctor and asked, \"Considering the number of drugs she is on, is there any possibility this might be drug-induced Parkinson’s?\". The doctor said the only way to find out was to take her mother off the medications. Unaware that it can be risky to remove patients abruptly from their medications, Dora’s daughter stopped all her mother’s medications without further consultation. Fortunately for Dora, no permanent harm was done. After a week of withdrawal symptoms, including hallucinations and disordered thinking, all Parkinson’s symptoms disappeared, never to return. Dora was able to resume her usual daily trip to town and return to an independent life. Taking a large number of drugs without regular medication reviews can have a devastating impact on quality of life and patient safety, especially in older people. Patients and families should make a practice of routinely going over the need for all medications with their health care providers and should be cautious about trying to stop medications without medical supervision. *The names and photos used in this story are not real, but the story is based on true events."
