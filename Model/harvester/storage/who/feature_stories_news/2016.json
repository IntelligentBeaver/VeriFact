          "Mosquitoes kill an estimated 700 000 people a year. If infected with viruses that cause diseases like chikungunya, dengue and Zika, mosquitos can transmit them to humans in one bite. Researchers have now pilot-deployed a new technique to control diseases transmitted by mosquitoes by making use of nature. It is one of the new tools WHO recommends for pilot deployment as a response to Zika virus.",
          "WHO/N. Alexander",
          "Rita Ramos lives in Jurujuba, a fishing community of about 1000 people, across Guanabara Bay from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She is an administrator for her community, and her husband works in a construction materials shop. Since June 2016, she has been taking part in a project to help control a killer in her community: mosquitoes.",
          "WHO/N. Alexander",
          "Researchers at Monash University in Australia (with the participation of Dr. Luciano Moreira from Brazil’s federal research centre, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, or, Fiocruz), have discovered that mosquitoes artificially infected with a bacterium called Wolbachia do not transmit dengue, chikungunya and Zika as easily. Wolbachia bacteria exist naturally in 60% of common insects.",
          "This innovative approach to control mosquito-transmitted diseases was brought to Brazil by Fiocruz in 2012. Initially a dengue control project, it began in a small community close to the international airport in 2014. In the current phase of the project, now in Jurujuba - Niterói, the researchers are breeding and releasing mosquitoes with Wolbachia bacteria. They aim to see how well these mosquitoes, by mating with wild mosquitoes, can pass the bacteria on to the next generation of mosquitoes, therefore creating populations of mosquitoes that cannot transmit deadly viruses.",
          "WHO/N. Alexander",
          "In early 2015, Rita met Jorge Pedrosa (center) through her community health worker. Jorge, who coordinates activities that engage communities in the dengue control project, explained the research project where this special type of mosquito is bred and released directly into the community. “At first, Jorge came to explain the same thing every week,” says Rita. “We did not understand the project. We also wanted to know why they had chosen our community.” She is one of 28 households in this part of Jurujuba which participate in the project. Rita and Jorge are joined by Gabriel Sylvestre Ribeiro (right), entomology coordinator for the project.",
          "WHO/N. Alexander",
          "Rita keeps this white bucket under her front stairs. It contains a small packet of mosquito eggs, a few pellets of fish food and water. Together, these form an ideal breeding atmosphere for the Wolbachia -infected mosquitoes. Gabriel and colleagues come to inspect and refresh the contents every two weeks. Rita says she has not noticed a higher number of mosquitoes in the community, and her point of view has changed. ”When I see them I don't kill them. I let them fly. I am not afraid of them… Now, to me, it is like a privilege to have the mosquitoes here.”",
          "WHO/N. Alexander",
          "Rita played an important role in reaching out to the community before the project was rolled out. First, researchers from Fiocruz, the research institute, talked to community health workers to answer their questions about the project, then asked them to help make contact with influential and respected community members. They held meetings and explained all aspects of the project. Jorge says, “we explained the history of the project, about diseases like dengue and Zika. We presented the science. We let them know this project would be going on in other neighborhoods, too, including affluent neighborhoods. We were very transparent. We did not promise anything.”",
          "WHO/N. Alexander",
          "Jorge and Gabriel visit Jurujuba every two weeks, as well as other pilot communities. These communities, along with others in Australia, Indonesia and Viet Nam, are gathering valuable information that will help researchers understand how well this method works to control disease. These countries are also part of the global programme that is aiming to eliminate dengue.",
          "WHO is encouraging research into this new method of mosquito control. In March 2016, the WHO Vector Control Advisory Group recommended the pilot deployment of Wolbachia -carrying mosquitoes to test the method’s effectiveness, to be followed by independent robust monitoring and evaluation. “ Wolbachia bacteria are not a silver bullet,” says Gabriel. “But it is really promising.” Results from Jurujuba and other Brazilian communities are expected to be folded into wider results.",
          "WHO/N. Alexander",
          "Fiocruz is one of several partners working to pilot-deploy Wolbachia -infected mosquitoes. Other partners include the University of Antiochia, Medellin in Colombia, and Professor Ivan Dario Velez.",

          "Several UN Member States, UN system colleagues and external partners joined the WHO office at the United Nations (UN), the Permanent Missions of France, Japan, and Thailand to the UN and the World Bank Group, at a luncheon on 12 December 2016, to commemorate Universal Health Coverage (UHC) day on the theme “Health for All: Act with Ambition”, at the United Nations in New York. The event was moderated by Dr. Nata Menabde, Executive Director WUN, who highlighted the important role of UHC in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and called for UHC day to be considered as an official UN day.",
          "Several speakers echoed this sentiment including H.E. Dessima Williams, Special Advisor to the 71st President of the General Assembly for the implementation of the SDGs, who stated that UHC is one of the best investments for ensuring achievement of the health SDG and the SDG Agenda as a whole.",
          "Dr. Mahmoud Mohieldin, Senior Vice President for the 2030 Development Agenda, UN Relations and Partnerships, the World Bank Group, shared his experience of working with UN Member States from both small and big economies and emphasized on the importance of domestic resource mobilization and the availability of quality data at the sub-national and national level. H.E. Mrs. Chulamanee Chartsuwan, Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative of the Kingdom of Thailand to the UN, highlighted the UHC efforts her country has undertaken and the positive results they have seen in decreasing child and maternal deaths. Mr. Michael Myers, Managing Director of The Rockefeller Foundation pledged financial resources for the new UHC 2030 Coalition, and called on partners to focus on intersections, be prepared to ask tough questions and to build country capacity for UHC. Mrs. Gina Lagomarsino, President and CEO of Results for Development, outlined the efforts of civil society and spoke about service delivery through primary health care. She stressed on the need for a people-centered integrated approach and reminded audiences the importance of measurement.",
          "A number of interventions took place from the floor, including the Mission of Japan who highlighted their strong leadership in and commitment to UHC and the upcoming UHC conference Japan will cohost together with WHO and the World Bank in 2017. The Mission of France, drew attention to the fact that they have advocated to keep 5% of the spending of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria for developing and strengthening health systems in a more horizontal way. Every Woman Every Child (EWEC) stressed that indicators will be key, especially with mechanisms in place such as the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health. Dr. Anthony Costello, WHO Director of Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health, emphasized on the need to address the health needs of adolescents and the importance of good quality care.",
          "The UNICEF Chief of Health, Dr. Stefan Peterson, spoke about the need to educate community health workers who are in the frontline of health crises. Dr. Elizabeth Carll, stressed on the importance of ensuring mental health is effectively incorporated in all healthcare settings while Dr. Padmini Murthy, noted the curriculum shift to primary health care in medical education as a cost effective measure."

          "Living in close proximity to animals and in poor hygienic circumstances can lead to the spread of diseases. The pig tapeworm Taenia solium , which can cause preventable epilepsy in humans, is an example. It is prevalent in Madagascar where WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health in controlling this parasite through a 'One-Health approach'. This approach recognizes that the health of people is connected to that of animals and that an intersectoral, collaborative approach is needed to tackle the spread of diseases.",
          "©WHO/A Fahrion. A man rides his cart of two cattle in open plains in Madagascar. In rural Madagascar, like in many other countries,people live close to domesticated animals which can lead to health challenges. When a disease infects both animals and humans, it is called a zoonosis. Many zoonoses can be prevented by improved personal hygiene, safe food preparation and access to improved water and sanitation facilities.",

          "©WHO/L Thomas. A pig and a hen roaming among dirt in backyard of a house in Madagascar.",
          "When pigs are raised in backyards, where they can roam freely, they may become infected by eating food contaminated with human faeces, which maintains the life cycle of Taenia solium - the pig tapeworm. This parasite is hosted by pigs and humans.",
          "©WHO/A Fahrion. Butchers cutting pork in an open market in Madagascar.",
          "Infection with T. solium (TS) tapeworm occurs when humans eat raw or undercooked, infected pork. People who have tapeworms in the intestine will shed tapeworm eggs. They can unknowingly infect themselves and other people with tapeworm eggs through dirty hands or contaminated food or water with devastating effects on human health. Tapeworm larvae (cysticerci) develop in the muscles, skin, eyes and the central nervous system. When cysts develop in the brain, the condition is known as neurocysticercosis.",
          "Neurocysticercosis is the cause of more than 30% of epilepsy cases in areas with endemic TS tapeworm. It can be averted by preventing people from getting infected with tapeworm eggs, but most of the time the tapeworm carriers remain undiagnosed and therefore unreported. Preliminary data from parasitological surveys indicate that TS is endemic in many districts in Madagascar.",
          "©WHO/A Fahrion. Staff from Madagascar's Ministry of Health and WHO celebrate their collaboration.",
          "It is essential that different sectors - including human, veterinary health and environment - work together to control and eliminate the parasite. WHO is supporting an intersectoral initiative led by the Ministry of Health of Madagascar to implement a pilot study to demonstrate how selected interventions against TS can reduce taeniasis prevalence to a level below 1%.",

          "The 3-year project is being implemented in Antanifotsy a rural district southeast of the capital, Antananarivo, where preliminary data indicated a high prevalence (above 6%) of TS. One of the main interventions is large-scale treatment of all eligible individuals (children under 5 are not treated) with praziquantel. For two consecutive years, in 2015 and in 2016 about 65 000 individuals were treated, representing more than 95% coverage of the targeted population.",
          "©WHO/A Fahrion. A folk-dance group in Madagascar, performing a song about the tapeworm parasite to raise awareness on the disease.",
          "An important part of the intervention is education, awareness-raising and social mobilization. The population is informed about risks of the disease and benefits of treatment by community health workers. Additional information is made available in leaflets, posters and on banners in public places. At the start of the current campaign in Madagascar in 2016, awareness was amplified by a folk-dance group who performed a special song about the parasite.",
          "©WHO/A Fahrion. WHO staff meet with medical staff on testing for TS.",
          "As baseline to evaluate the success of the intervention, stool specimens of people are tested for TS. Pigs from the pilot communities are also tested for cysticercosis antibodies in their blood.",
          "©WHO/A Fahrion. A group of children smile in Madagascar.",
          "Two rounds of large-scale treatment already show a decrease in the prevalence of TS. If this trend continues, final results at the end of the 3-year pilot study will demonstrate whether this strategy can reduce TS in humans and eventually halt its transmission. In combination with preventative measures in pigs (confinement, antiparasitic treatment, meat inspection) and the use of latrines, the chances of controlling the parasite will be higher."

          "WHO/D. Lourenco",
          "\"It is incredible that such a large and diverse group of partners have come together to protect people against yellow fever,\" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. \"I’m also proud of the Organization-wide support. Staff from across all three levels of WHO – country offices, the Regional Office for Africa and headquarters – have come together under one integrated incident management system. Each level has played an important role: starting from the country level where the outbreak is occurring, to the Regional Office for oversight, command and control and the global level coordination support.\"",
          "The outbreak, which was first detected in Angola in December 2015, had caused 962 confirmed cases of yellow fever across the two countries (884 in Angola 78 in DRC) by 16 November 2016, with more than 7300 suspected cases. The last confirmed case reported in Angola was on 23 June and DRC’s last case was on 12 July.",
          "More than 41 000 volunteers and 8000 vaccination teams were involved in the mass immunization campaigns. The vaccines used came from a global stockpile co-managed by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), UNICEF and WHO. In the first 6 months of 2016 alone, the partners delivered more than 19 million doses of the vaccine – three times the 6 million doses usually put aside for a possible outbreak. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance financed a significant proportion of the vaccines.",
          "\"This is the result of a gargantuan effort,\" said Dr Margaret Lamunu, Yellow Fever Incident Manager at WHO HQ. \"30 million people have been vaccinated across the 2 countries – can you imagine the sheer logistics of getting vaccines out to that many people? Many of these people live in dense urban areas or remote rural settings. But we worked tirelessly with the respective governments and our partners – notably Gavi, UNICEF, CDC and all the GOARN partners – and together, we pulled it off.\""

          "\"In an urban emergency situation like this one and to ensure greater coverage with the limited available global vaccine stocks, we knew that a fractional dose strategy should provide more people with the protection required to stop the outbreak. And fortunately the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo were willing to take advantage of this new approach to interrupt transmission in the sprawling capital city of Kinshasa where more than 10 million people were at risk ahead of the rainy season. Their support is one of the key reasons why the country has not seen an outbreak-related case since July.\""

We’re not finished yet, however,\" Dr Moeti continued. \"We need to keep a close eye on the situation in both countries, particularly with the coming rainy season – this is a peak time for yellow fever-carrying mosquitoes.

Key components of the strategy include preventive vaccination (both in routine immunization schedules and mass campaigns), an expanded global vaccine stockpile for outbreak response and support for greater preparedness in the most at-risk countries.",

NUH saw that the needs at TMH were extensive and agreed to form a partnership with TMH. The Ministry of Health and the County authorities in Liberia supported this partnership at the onset of the formal TPI agreement. Careful consideration was given to the architecture of the partnership, recognizing the distinct culture and context of the respective partners. Principles and definition of partnerships were carefully considered in recognition that success of the partnership would depend on the foundations developed in the early stages. This proved pivotal in the roll-out of the partnership.",
          "Moving forward from this initial partnership, a situational assessment and gap analysis were completed at TMH in October 2016. Following the gap analysis, an official “action planning” meeting took place in December 2016 where both partners agreed to improve infection prevention and control, with specific attention being given to hand hygiene and waste management. It was noted that by improving these two areas, the foundation could be created for overall quality improvement throughout the whole hospital.",
          "The partnership undertook two partnership exchange visits in Liberia and Japan respectively. The principles of the partnership were reinforced throughout while the improvement work proceeded. The bi-directionality of the partnership learning was emphasized. For example, the TMH team leader gave a talk about their experience in the Ebola response, which NUH stated they benefited greatly from because they learned about the realities of diagnosis and treating Ebola affected patients."

          "The conflict in eastern Ukraine has had a significant impact on the mental health of the population, with many experiencing forced displacement, disconnection from family, disruption of employment and education, and fear of injury or death. Such conditions place people at increased risk of developing mental health difficulties, while leaving those with pre-existing mental disorders in an increasingly vulnerable situation as mental health facilities are stretched beyond capacity, disrupted, destroyed or inaccessible.",
          "To address this urgent need and recognizing that much of the country’s institution-based care was straining to cope, the WHO and Ukrainian health authorities developed a pilot project model of mobile community mental health care. Four mobile mental health teams operating under the state health system were established in four regions, with the aim not only to improve access to evidence-based mental health services to conflict-affected communities but also to improve capacity within the system and test a model of community-based care which could be scaled up over time to form part of mental health reform in Ukraine.",
          "“ When we first started visiting Lena in her home in a small town outside of Slavyansk she was severely depressed and overwhelmed with the care of her disabled daughter. She had isolated herself from friends, and was scared to see a psychiatrist for fear of being put in hospital. Through regular visits we were able to engage her, provide medication and start identifying her goals. Over a few months her mood began to improve and she has recently started working for the first time in many years.” Said Olha Kobeleva, Slavyansk team psychiatrist",
          "Local ownership and adaptation of international guidelines, including the mhGAP Intervention Guide, to the local context has proved vital in bringing change in both practice and culture in all four sites. Perhaps for the first time, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and nurses are working together, providing treatment which is recovery-focused, and patient- and family-centred. This model of care has the added benefit of creating close links with the community, providing support and education to family doctors in the identification and management of common mental disorders, and is compatible with recommendations of the WHO global and European mental health action plans. From January to August 2016 consultations were provided to 2200 people who otherwise would not have been able to access services.",
          "This Ukrainian experience clearly shows that investing in mental health during emergencies can be an opportunity to bring about important change to mental health systems – that there is a better and more sustainable alternative to stand-alone, emergency mental health services."

          "WHO has rapidly expanded and strengthened disease detection and response in support of the Government of Nigeria’s response to the humanitarian crisis in north eastern Nigeria, where 3.7 million people are in need of health assistance.",
          "Within two weeks of scaling up its emergency response in late August 2016, WHO rolled out its Early Warning Alert Response System (EWARS) in 56 health facilities in Borno state. By mid-October, as access to some hard-to-reach areas improved, the number of disease detection sites tripled. Now 160 sites in Borno state are using the system, covering around 85% of internally displaced persons (IDPs) living in Borno state – about 1.3 million people in 13 Local Government Areas.",
          "The EWARS project is an initiative to strengthen disease early warning, alert and response in emergencies. ‘EWARS in a box’ contains all the equipment needed to set up a disease surveillance system, including mobile phones, laptops, solar-powered generators and chargers, all specifically designed to work in difficult and insecure operating environments like north eastern Nigeria. It includes an application that can be rapidly configured and deployed on mobile phones within 48 hours of an emergency being declared.",
          "The advantage of the mobile application is that data is collected and submitted in real time by health staff working in health facilities. EWARS also tracks disease alerts and publishes automated epidemiological bulletins each week to support data analysis and interpretation. This allows WHO and Ministry of Health epidemiologists to access the data and take action on alerts far more rapidly than was possible before.",
          "The EWARS application supports existing national disease surveillance systems, in addition to expanding surveillance to include other diseases with a public health burden in IDP camps and host communities, such as malaria, severe acute malnutrition, diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection. WHO works with Ministries of Health and health sector partners to train local health workers to use the system. EWARS complements Nigeria’s existing Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) System which has been weakened by the crisis, facilitating real time flow of information for timely response.",
          "“With EWARS, we can quickly adapt to the needs on the ground because it provides real-time reporting which is beneficial to both the government and partners. This system of electronic reporting is great because we are able to send surveillance information and instantly and receive alerts and take appropriate action,” said Dr Lawi Mshelia, Director of Public Health, Borno State Ministry of Health. “With EWARS strengthening our weekly Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response reporting we can rapidly be alerted to potential disease outbreaks. This is crucial to allowing us to initiate a timely response with our partners. Still to do that, we need more resources and partners on the ground.”"

          "EWARS enables evidence-based decision making for a more targeted response. Data collected by the system has shown that malaria continues to be the most common disease in much of Borno state. Using these results, WHO and partners have been able to more clearly target prevention and response measures, such as getting medicines and supplies where they are needed most, or helping to plan mosquito bed net distribution campaigns.",
          "“Now that we have EWARS in place, the system can be used by local health workers for the emergency response, and we can upgrade and adapt it as health needs change,” said Dr Ifeanyi Okudo, WHO Surveillance Officer.",
          "WHO’s EWARS initiative is committed to supporting disease surveillance, alert and response even in the most difficult operating environments. EWARS tries to catch disease outbreaks early on to help contain them in emergencies by providing technical support, training and field-based tools to Ministries of Health and other partners.",
          "In 2015, WHO initiated a pilot deployment of its “EWARS in a box”, which is a kit of durable, field-ready equipment needed to establish and manage surveillance or response activities in field settings. A single kit costs approximately US$ 15 000 and can support surveillance for 50 fixed or mobile clinics, or roughly 500 000 people. Deployed to a settlement in Mingkaman with about 80 000 IDPs, WHO trained health workers to use the system.",
          "Pilot tested in South Sudan in December 2015, WHO has also deployed EWARS to support emergency responses in Ethiopia, Fiji and Nigeria in 2016 with plans to eventually deploy the system in all future emergency settings."

          "Hanna comes from Mekelle, in theTigray region of Ethiopia. At one point in her life she suffered a traumatic experience that led to depression:",
          "I have always been happy and healthy in my life. Until something terrible happened to me: my only child died. After that dramatic episode, my life hasn’t been the same. I kept thinking about him, and couldn’t sleep at night. I felt so sad and would be so nervous and my heart would beat very fast. This made me so worried I thought something bad was going to happen to me as well.",
          "The case of Hanna is not unusual and many other Ethiopians have similar stories. In Ethiopia, it is estimated that 15% of people are affected by major mental illness or substance abuse disorders.",
          "Past challenges have been the lack of mental health specialists outside the capital, Addis Ababa, and the poor quality of services provided for mental, neurological and substance use disorders. In addition, people suffering from mental illness are often the most marginalized, and affected by stigma and discrimination. Strong government commitment for mental health care The Government of Ethiopia has shown strong commitment for improving mental health care and getting services to the people who need them, as evidenced not only by the development of a mental health strategy, but also by the allocation of new funds for the roll-out of a mental health strategy across the country. Since a pilot project in 2010-2013, the Government has been increasing the budget for mental health  for scaling up mental health services for training, supervision and procurement of psychotropic medications. “There has been a consistent political commitment by policy makers, because they  understood that Ethiopia was on an accelerated economic and social development path and the country was developing at 10% growth annually. Such a rapid economic growth requires a physically and mentally healthy population in order to maintain and sustain the achievement of this economic and social development” says Dr Tedla Wolde-Giorgis, Mental Health Advisor in the Office of the Minister of the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health. According to Dr Kesetebirhan Admasu, Minister of Health, the five principles that contributed to the successful scaling up of mental health services include: “country ownership, community ownership, going for a significant scaling for impact, and integration of mental health services into existing health systems.” Building partnerships The Federal Ministry of Health has also worked hard to build Partnerships. It has also been working closely with the World Health Organization, the European Union and Foundation d’Harcourt (a Geneva-based non-profit foundation which promotes international projects and partnerships in the fields of mental health, psychosocial support and social development) to successfully implement the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), a WHO programme which serves as a guide to countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries, in scaling up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders. The Ethiopian mental health programme  was built in line with WHO recommendations for integrating hospital-based and community-based services. “The broad vision has been to integrate mental health in the existing primary health-care system by leveraging the existing health delivery platforms. The strategy that we developed emphasizes the training of health staff on mental health issues using the mhGAP programme and making sure that they are provided with close supervision and  oversight at the different health centres. To this end, the mhGAP training materials and approach was very helpful to us” says Dr Tedla Wolde-Giorgis. Training based on mhGAP Following adaptation of the mhGAP materials to the Ethiopian context, training began. In 2010-2013, in the four pilot regions of Amhara, Oromia, Tigry and Southern Nations, Nationalities and People (SHHPR), more than 200 non-specialized health workers were trained, in 19 heath facilities. Further government investment following the pilot phase has enabled almost 300 more health workers to be trained, with 158 health-care facilities now providing care for mental health. Many people, who would otherwise have had no access to care, have been supported. In the case of Hanna, she was lucky enough to visit a primary health centre where the nurse who saw her had gone through an mhGAP Base Course training. “When I visited the clinic the nurse asked me many questions and she finally explained to me that all my symptoms were due to what they call depression. She explained that many mothers who lose a child experience it and listened to me. She told me that I do not need medications. With time, I have felt much better and my sleep has become regular again.”"

          "The value of psychological interventions is increasingly recognized. Although the mhGAP Programme has always recommended psychological interventions, WHO is now extending the Programme by giving more attention to and guidance for scalable psychological interventions. Indeed in 2015, WHO released the Thinking Healthy* manual, a simple cognitive-behavioural treatment manual for perinatal depression.",
          "The scope of WHO’s work on psychological interventions is now extended through this week’s release of the individual, adult, 5-session version of Problem Management Plus (PM+)*,  an intervention for common mental disorders among adults in communities affected by adversity. PM+ combines the empirically supported techniques of problem-solving counselling, behavioural activation, stress management and strengthening social support. The value of PM+ has recently been confirmed through randomized trials in Nairobi and Peshawar.",
          "I was in a really bad state before, had no interaction with people, hated noise, got irritated and angry easily. Even my own children were too much….now I can enjoy them and my life and help others",
          "Before the program I was not able to do house chores and take care of myself and my son. Now I do my hair, wash clothes, clean the house and look after myself and my son wel",
          "I was in a very bad state, was always hating everyone, including my own children, but now I am good with them and can make jokes",
          "Accounts from Kenya during PM+ evaluation",
          "WHO is developing and testing a range of other scalable psychological interventions - involving a range of modalities - including for parents of children with developmental disorders; carers of people with dementia; and young adolescents affected by adversity.  All interventions are designed and adapted to be scalable and subject to rigorous testing by WHO and partners in countries across different parts of world such as China, Ethiopia, India, Italy, Kenya, Lebanon, Nepal, Pakistan, South Korea and Uganda.  Testing will be followed by guidance on implementation.",
          "Once ready, these interventions will be uploaded to the WHO website, thereby greatly enhancing potential access to partners in low- and middle-income countries. Extending the mhGAP Programme with these interventions increases the Programme’s reach and should help facilitate a more effective and balanced bio-psychosocial approach.",
          "WHO’s work on PM+ has been funded by USAID OFDA, ELHRA’s Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC), Grand Challenges Canada, World Vision, and UNHCR."

          "Tunisia currently faces significant mental health system challenges. While youth suicide and mental illness are on the rise, there is a dearth of mental health services across the country. It is estimated that more than one third of consultations with general practitioners (GPs) working in the Greater Tunis Area are mental health-related. Yet, the majority of GPs are not trained to effectively detect, treat and manage mental illness. Most people seeking mental health care, therefore, turn to the only standing and already overcrowded mental hospital in the country, Razi Hospital in Tunis, or to limited psychiatric units across the regional hospitals.",
          "To address the high mental health treatment gap, the Tunisian Ministry of Health, in collaboration with the WHO Country Office for Tunisia, the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, the School of Public Health at the University of Montreal, Canada, and the Montreal WHO-PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Mental Health, launched the implementation of the mhGAP programme in the Greater Tunis Area.",
          "As a first activity, 45 general practitioners working in the Greater Tunis Area were trained in February-March 2016 on early recognition and management of mental disorders including depression, schizophrenia, problems related to alcohol and drug use, as well as self-harm/suicide. A second group of 47 GPs was trained in March-April 2016.",
          "\"...I also acknowledged a shift in the way they view mental health. After the training, my colleagues began detecting mental health problems in the people affected by mental health conditions that they have been following for years.” One trainer",
          "Since the trainings, participating GPs already feel more comfortable communicating with and treating people consulting for mental illness. Many participants like using the guide that accompanies the training in their daily practice because, they say, it is user-friendly and practical.",
          "These positive changes have also been aknowledged by trainers. One trainer shared: “During the training, I noticed that the GPs were very motivated to learn about mental health and enthusiastic about participating in the training. I also acknowledged a shift in the way they view mental health. After the training, my colleagues began detecting mental health problems in the people affected by mental health conditions that they have been following for years.”",
          "Evaluation of the impact of the training will be conducted using a randomized controlled trial design. It will target the change in the knowledge and attitudes of GPs about mental illness, and self-efficacy in detecting, treating and managing mental health problems at the community level.",
          "Implementing the mhGAP in the Greater Tunis Area is a first attempt to bridge the treatment gap in Tunisia by integrating accessible and evidence-based care for mental disorders into primary health care. This integration can serve as a model for the mhGAP’s implementation in other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and especially in French-speaking countries."

CBM – an international disability and development organization – works extensively with governments and local partners, using mhGAP as a tool in supporting countries to reform their mental health services. In addition to using its clear, evidence-based guidelines for medical and psychosocial care, local leaders and advocates are using mhGAP resources to support countries that have embarked on progressive reform of their mental health services.",

The programme strengthens local advocacy coalitions, engages with governments and builds leadership capacity through an annual African region short course. In several countries, significant progress has been made in policy and legislation, and in the commitment of governments to health system reform.",

          "1 / 9 WHO/B Mafio Health clinic sign raised Conflict in Nigeria for more than 6 years has led to the internal displacement of 2.2 million people. Most health facilities and infrastructure have been damaged during the crisis and some health workers have been killed or abducted, while many others have fled to areas of safety. As a result, an estimated 3.7 million people in north eastern Nigeria have limited or no access to any basic primary health services. WHO/N Kannangarage Shelters in Muna Garage camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) Muna Garage camp is located 10kms from the outskirts of Maiduguri area and is home to some 16 000 people, living in mainly makeshift shelters. Although there has been humanitarian assistance of shelter, water and sanitation, food and health services, the camp remains at high risk for disease outbreaks during the ongoing rainy season. Malaria, chest infections and watery diarrhoea are the 3 leading causes of sickness in this IDP camp and others in Borno State. The camp is one of the first arrival locations for those who manage to escape from the neighbouring inaccessible areas and it was here that polio was recently reported. WHO/A Zouiten A child in Muna Garage IDP camp in Borno state is screened for malnutrition A young child in Muna Garage camp for internally displaced people (IDP) in Borno State is screened for malnutrition. In some areas the rate of severe acute malnutrition is estimated to be as high as 14% which is many times higher than emergency thresholds. WHO/P Ajello Hard-to-reach team WHO supports outreach activities in areas that are difficult to access through ‘hard-to-reach teams’. These teams provide health services such as routine vaccination, deworming, detection and treatment of diseases, and screening for severe acute malnutrition. WHO/P Ajello Training to manage childhood illness WHO trains community resource people to prevent and treat illness in children through such actions as hand washing, breastfeeding and malnutrition screening. These trained workers will deliver health services to 14 satellite camps and host communities in the newly liberated areas in Borno State, often moving from house to house treating children with common ailments and giving referrals for those who require specialized care. Vaccinations In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and other partners, (UNICEF, CDC, Rotary International), WHO is working to ensure that all children in accessible parts of north-eastern Nigeria are vaccinated against polio, measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. In August 2016, the first outbreak of polio in Nigeria in 2 years was reported in Borno State. Intense vaccination activities are now underway, and reached more than 225 000 children in August alone. A mass measles vaccination campaign is also being planned. WHO/N Kannangarage Training for rapid health facility assessment in Borno State WHO trained and deployed 16 Local Government Area facilitators from the polio eradication programme to undertake a rapid health facility assessment in Borno State. Following the training, WHO and partners assessed 56 health facilities that offer services to 1.3 million internally displaced persons. Many facilities have insufficient medicines and supplies for the immense health needs. WHO/C Haskew Training on detecting disease Detecting and responding rapidly to disease outbreaks is a key part of the response. Mustapha Mohammed, Assistant Disease Surveillance Notification Officer for Monguno Local Government Area trains a colleague on the reporting of disease data via the WHO-supported EWARS system on a mobile phone. WHO/C Haskew Helicopter to Monguno Dr Ifeanyi Okudo, Public Health Officer with WHO Nigeria, prepares to board a United Nations Humanitarian Air Service helicopter for the short flight from Maiduguri to Monguno. The journey by road is very dangerous and requires a security escort."

        "content": [
          "Abish Romero recently celebrated: 5 years free of breast cancer, after receiving successful treatment in her home country of Mexico. But the 28-year-old, whose mother died from advanced (late stage) breast cancer several years ago, had to make some tough choices before her care started in 2011. Abish was working outside of Mexico as an au pair, when she was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer, and had to return home to receive the treatment needed. “I had no option but to return to Mexico, where free public health insurance (called Seguro Popular) ensures all women diagnosed with breast cancer can be treated with no out-of-pocket expense,” says Abish, who underwent extensive surgery and chemotherapy. While many nations cannot afford expensive cancer medicines, Mexico is an example of a middle-income country that has taken major structural steps to give sustainable access to treatment for people diagnosed with breast and other forms of cancer. It has done this by reforming and consolidating their procurement policies to achieve price reductions for essential medicines. The example of Mexico is one that WHO is striving to see emulated globally through implementation of the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines as part of a broader approach to strengthening national health systems. The example of Mexico is one that WHO is striving to see emulated globally through implementation of the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines as part of a broader approach to strengthening national health systems. WHO’s Dr Nicola Magrini explains that the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines is not just about drugs, like ensuring that no one is denied health care because they cannot afford to pay for it, guaranteeing access to medicines is key to moving towards universal health coverage and strengthening national health systems. For high-priced medicines, this means policies and practices to substantially reduce costs so they become affordable for the health system. Essential medicines for universal health coverage “The guiding principle for expanding the list of cancer medicines was to offer options to countries to be able to tackle the most curable forms of the disease, including childhood leukemia, testicular cancer and lymphoma as well as early breast cancer,” says Dr Magrini, secretary of the WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines. “We worked hard to prioritize those cancer medicines with the largest magnitude of benefit.” Mexico launched its Seguro Popular health system in 2003, beginning with treatment for paediatric cancer and expanding later to others, including breast cancer. It has been following the WHO Essential Medicines List during this time. “Today, we cover the most common cancers such as cervical, colorectal, lymphomas, prostate cancer, testicular cancer and ovarian cancer (germinal), and for children all types of cancer,” says Dr Abelardo Meneses, Director of Mexico’s National Cancer Institute. “With this programme, we have helped thousands of people receive cancer treatment, most with low incomes who, in other circumstances, would not have been able to afford the care.” In Abish's case, where there is a family history of breast cancer, early detection and recommended treatment practices can lead to high cure rates. “When I go to sleep, I think ‘why me, why am I alive, why don’t others have the opportunity I received?’,” says Ms Romero, who has just completed her Masters of Public Health, and has become a strong advocate for access to care for people living with cancer. “I believe everyone should have access to treatment and life goals, and I think health systems should help them as Mexico’s helped me.”"

At the health centre, which serves the largest township of 300 000 people in Malawi's financial capital, some 10 500 patients with HIV routinely\n    receive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Among them are 6 000 mothers and their children. The clinic is particularly full today, as Wednesday is \"mother and baby\" day.",

Dr Martha Makwero, an obstetrician and gynaecologist educated in South Africa, is the only doctor overseeing the health centre today.\n    The clinic effectively operates as a \"task shifting” based site, with many services provided by clinical officers, nurses and community health workers, but not full-time doctors. Most patients visit routinely to refill prescriptions for HIV\n    medicines, so visiting doctors such as Dr Makwero can focus on patients who have complicated issues or worries.",
          "Dr Martha Makwero, obstetrician and gynaecologist, is the only doctor overseeing the health\n    centre today.",
          "Martha Namanya is an ART clerk who has been trained to take patient records. She ensures all patient information is fully recorded in both hard copy and electronic systems, so patients can have their prescriptions filled without delay. Patients have health\n    passports with barcodes, so once their records have been completed in the system, a single scan is all it takes to get their medications.",
          "Martha Namanya is an ART clerk who has been trained to take patient records.",
          "On this particular day, a young mother named Love Saidi is collecting antiretrovirals for her husband who is at work. Love came to the clinic with her husband in January 2015, when she was 3 months pregnant, to start her antenatal care. She immediately\n    learnt that she was HIV positive and so was her husband. She was offered free HIV medicines under the WHO-recommended “Option B” scheme, which aims to ensure all HIV-positive mothers start early and lifelong HIV treatment.",
          "Love Saidi is collecting antiretrovirals for her husband and herself. By starting HIV treatment early, Love was able to ensure her baby, Patience, was born HIV-free.",
          "By starting HIV treatment early, Love was able to ensure her baby, Patience, was born HIV-free. Her husband was also put on treatment. \"It would have been a double blow if my baby was born with HIV,\" said Love. \"Although I was pained to discover it at\n    first, I feel fine now I’m on treatment. It is better to know and start treatment early, before getting sick.\"",
          "With high unemployment rates and seemingly endless social issues, the risk of HIV feels ever-present in this impoverished neighbourhood. Many women only discover their HIV infection after they become pregnant. Community health workers like Chifundo Mahamba\n    play a crucial role in helping these pregnant women and mothers get started and remain in HIV care.",
          "Community health workers like Chifundo Mahamba play a crucial role\nin helping these pregnant women and mothers get started and remain in HIV care.",
          "Chifundo has been working at the health centre for 7 years as a “mothers2mothers” patient expert. She helps women on antenatal visits take HIV tests. Those who are negative still receive visits from a mothers2mothers patient expert for repeat\n    HIV tests, and come again with their partners for HIV testing. Pregnant women who are HIV positive are offered ART, and receive home visits over the following weeks and months to ensure they are following the treatment correctly. Chifundo receives\n    a modest wage of 46 000 kwachas (approximately US$ 64) and has to visit families living as far as 10 km away.",
          "Dr Makwero says the health centre manages to catch most HIV-positive mothers when pregnant and get them started on treatment. In fact, most of their babies are born without HIV, thanks to the universal treatment programme for all pregnant women with HIV.\n    Life in the community can be difficult, given high unemployment rates and low levels of social care. Yet, the Ndirande Health Centre is making it possible to break the cycle of HIV infections, and with it the accompanying disease and despair. \"Low-cost\n    innovations are what it takes,\" says Dr Makwero. \"Task shifting, better records and good engagement by community health workers are doable. When we had [to use] the lower threshold CD4 count of 200, so many people were sick and bedridden. Now that\n    we start patients earlier on treatment, people are healthier and services can be run at a lower cost.\"",
          "We asked Dr Makwero her opinion on the impending \"treat-all\" policy, which means starting every HIV-positive person on treatment as soon as they are diagnosed. \"I'm very excited about ‘treat-all’,” she said. “Treating early is\n    cost-effective for the community, and of course much better for the family.\" Just 3 weeks after our conversation, Malawi’s Ministry of Health announced an official policy to offer \"treat-all\" for all people living with HIV."

Other elements include guidance for healthcare providers to prescribe medications depending on blood pressure levels, based on the best available clinical evidence.",

          "\"It was incredibly rewarding to see how much hypertension control rates improved over the course of the project,\" Dr Connell says. \"It was also encouraging to see the cultural and behavioural change in the clinics among health workers who had to deliver a more focused form of care. There was sometimes resistance. But once the project started generating results, health workers embraced our new approach to CVD care.\"",
          "CVD, primarily heart attacks and strokes, kill 17.5 million people worldwide each year, one-third before the age of 70 years.",
          "Key factors increasing people’s risk of heart disease are tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol. WHO recommends that hypertension management include efforts to help people reduce their exposure to these risk factors, along with improving the access to medical treatment and essential drugs.

          "How did you first get involved in the fight against malaria?",
          "Malaria has always interested me – both the parasite itself and how the disease affects health systems and populations. My PhD work was actually originally on sleeping sickness, but in 1979 I started to work in the field and with communities in Africa. I realized what a huge problem malaria was for the people living there and I have been researching it ever since. I’m not just a scientist; I also assist running health programmes in resource-constrained environments. Earlier in my career I was focused on immunology and cell biology, but working in Cameroon, Liberia, and Tanzania really opened me up to the fields of epidemiology and public health.",
          "I grew up on a farm, which was a very good learning experience and also made me very pragmatic. My research reflects this and is very diverse. I’m always moving between the field and the lab, the bush and the bench; it’s really the joy of my work. I think it’s good for people to get their boots dirty.",
          "What research is most important to you?",
          "Some of my research focuses on effectiveness studies – how you can bring efficacious tools most effectively to a community. Efficacy shows us whether or not a particular tool will work, but effectiveness shows us whether or not it can be applied. We have a good set of tools to fight malaria, but we need to improve our ability to combine and apply these tools in the best possible mix so that they will work well in a given context. It’s like mixing a cocktail, isn’t it? You must mix the cocktail just right, and a cocktail that works well in one bar might not work very well in another. (Laughs)",

Though we ultimately concluded that the specific vaccine in its current formulation was not of public health use, the trials conducted created an important foundation for future vaccine development, with our findings inspiring and informing the conduct of subsequent trials as well as the review of respective WHO guidelines.",
          "It is important as a global community for us to remember that while we focus on the result of a clinical trial, the lessons learned from the full spectrum of the clinical development process are also incredibly significant and contribute to a body of science with implications far beyond the trial itself.",
          "What are some of the challenges facing the malaria community in the next five years?",
          "I think we need our strategies to better focus on what needs to be done in countries, because that’s where the action happens. For example, we have the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria and we have the Action and Investment to defeat Malaria framework. Both are very good global documents, but I’d like to see us address more specifically how these documents can serve as a sort of guidance and umbrella for individual national operational plans.",
          "The ability of the Global Malaria Programme to provide support to countries is very valuable. I’d like to see the Programme be able to expand its capacity to really work with people at the country level and create more opportunities for mutual learning for lasting change. It’s a simple principle: learning together is how we make a difference.",
          "What do you think are some of the most important areas of research to focus on going forward?",
          "Going forward, we will need to focus on creating new building blocks for combination therapy treatments, developing a single-dose malaria treatment, continuing to strengthen health systems and fight drug and insecticide resistance, conducting pilot implementation of the RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate, and maintaining strong public private product development partnerships for continuing research and development.",
          "Continued political and financial support for a robust malaria research agenda is very important. Over the last twenty years, we’ve made good progress with insecticide-treated nets, diagnosis, and treatment. After all this progress, the hardest bits are yet to come. But these will also be the best bits, because it means we will be working towards elimination."

I’m actually already retired, but the University asked me to keep my research lab going and I still have medical and graduate students working in the lab. I will certainly continue to work in the malaria field, but I’d really love to see some of the scientists I have mentored come in and take over the lab. I want to spend more time with my grand children."

          "How did you first get involved in the malaria fight?",
          "Malaria has always been a part of my life. I grew up in the Northern region in Ghana and every March the rainy season would come, creating pools of standing water that were perfect breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that spread malaria. People would\r\n    get hundreds of mosquito bites every year and the malaria burden was terrible. My father used to give us quinine every Sunday to try to prevent us from getting sick, but each of us still had many bouts of the disease.",
          "When I first started out as a young physician in the early 80s, the problem remained very serious. At that time, more than half of the people I saw at the clinic had malaria, and many died before I could treat them. It was at that time I began to get\r\n    involved in clinical trials research. I worked with other scientists to investigate simple tools and preventative measures that would help reduce the burden of malaria.",
          "Can you talk a little about how you’ve seen the malaria community evolve over the last 20 years?",
          "The late 90s was a very interesting time to be in the malaria space. Other health issues were receiving a lot of attention, but few people were focusing on malaria. And many people living in endemic countries thought that malaria was just a way of life:\r\n    getting infected was inevitable, and then you would either survive or not. But malaria is of course preventable and treatable, and we had a chance to start to change that mindset. We now know that time was the beginning of a huge groundswell of support\r\n    for the malaria fight that has continued until today.",
          "Getting to where we are now was a huge challenge, and I did not anticipate the level of progress we’ve seen. It’s been incredible to see malaria mortality steadily decrease and people live healthier, happier lives.",
          "What are some of the key areas the global malaria community should focus on over the next five years?",
          "It's been incredible to see malaria mortality steadily decrease and people live healthier, happier lives. - Dr Fred Binka",
          "We must continue to develop new tools that will allow us to fight the disease more effectively. First, we have good treatment, but some people will stop taking the drugs once they start feeling better even though they have not finished the full course\r\n    of treatment. This can cause the disease to come back and it can contribute to the malaria parasite’s growing resistance to our best drugs. So the development of a one dose treatment for malaria will really revolutionize the field.",
          "Second, we need to develop a better strategy to address the decreasing effectiveness of insecticides. Third, strong surveillance and measurement are critical. And fourth, we need more sensitive diagnostic tools, especially in areas where there tend to\r\n    be more people that are asymptomatic carriers of the disease. Focusing on asymptomatic carriers will be increasingly important in areas of low malaria transmission. If we have these tools and our health systems are strong, we can continue to make\r\n    a huge dent in malaria transmission and begin to eliminate it in target areas.",
          "What is one of the biggest challenges the malaria community faces in the near future?",
          "I want to emphasize the fact that the progress we are making could actually be our downfall. What do I mean by that? Countries have done a great job decreasing malaria cases and deaths, but we’re not out of the woods yet. Until malaria transmission\r\n    has stopped, there is always the risk of resurgence and losing all of the progress we have made.",
          "So we must not let these accomplishments trick us into thinking that we can let up our efforts before the job has been finished. The costs of fighting malaria will actually go up until the disease has been eliminated. This can be a very difficult point\r\n    to make, but it is critically important: Funding and new research to fight malaria must remain a key priority until transmission of the disease has completely stopped. This must be our goal."

In some areas, deliveries can only be made by boat and small plane.",

Preventable and curable diseases, such as malaria and acute watery diarrhoea, are major causes of death among the growing number of internally displaced persons in the country. Many people do not have access to adequate shelter, which may increase rates of malaria and upper respiratory infections, while the ongoing rainy season is increasing the risk of water-borne diseases, such as cholera.",
          "WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in South Sudan to respond to people’s critical health needs as the conflict persists, and related political and security discussions continue. With more than 1.6 million people displaced internally, together with a decreased availability of health workers and aid workers, the work on the ground is becoming ever more challenging.",

Before July, WHO led 67 partner organizations in the country, as the head of the Global Health Cluster. By mid-August, about one-third of these partners remain and, of those, many have retained only a skeleton staff. WHO has had to significantly reduce its number of international staff.",

This brings the total number of EWARS sites to 71 in South Sudan, which provides the capability of monitoring 300 000 people for disease outbreaks.",

EWARS tries to catch disease outbreaks early on to help contain them in emergencies by providing technical support, training and field-based tools to Ministries of Health and other partners.",

A single kit costs approximately US$ 15 000 and can support surveillance for 50 fixed or mobile clinics, or roughly 500 000 people. Deployed to a settlement in Mingkaman with about 80 000 IDPs, WHO trained health workers to use the system.",
          "Thus far in 2016, 45 disease alerts have been detected by the system. Immediate feedback is provided to WHO and Ministry of Health staff, and helps to ensure that alerts can be promptly verified and investigated.",
          "“Before EWARS, the process of data collection was very slow and time consuming,” says Dr Joseph Wamala, WHO epidemiologist in Juba. “WHO colleagues and our partners worked manually with data that was collected in Word documents, which led to slower analysis and response planning. EWARS allows data to be collected and reported using mobile phones in health clinics. It is adapted specifically for use in emergency settings and has the flexibility to gather different kinds of data as a situation evolves.”",
          "For example, South Sudan’s Ministry of Health officially confirmed a cholera outbreak on 21 July 2016. As of 15 August, a total of 1160 cholera cases including 23 deaths have been reported nationwide. The majority of these have been recorded in Juba County, where an average of 35 new admissions are being recorded daily.",
          "WHO and the Ministry of Health added a component to EWARS to help track cholera cases, which has led to a more targeted response to cholera outbreaks. This includes plans to preposition oral cholera vaccines in community centres where cholera outbreaks are expected to rise, based on data collected by EWARS."

Given this emergency situation, manufacturers worked with us to speed up production and deliver the syringes on time in the country\".",
          "The 17.3 million vaccine syringes – equivalent to 700 cubic metres or 17 40-foot shipping containers – were air freighted to Democratic Republic of the Congo. After the vaccines and syringes arrived in the country, the freight had to be cleared through customs, a procedure that normally takes weeks. WHO worked closely with the Government of Democratic Republic of the Congo to fast-track this process."

More than 85% of mothers surveyed said they had seen the campaign’s breastfeeding messages. As a result, exclusive breastfeeding rates increased to 62%, in Alive & Thrive intensive areas.",

Most of them got solid basic knowledge from the ads and tried to practice the recommendations,” says Thi Thuy. “Those who came to the clinic for vaccination during the fourth month of pregnancy would come back again and again for further counselling sessions on breastfeeding and complementary feeding.”",

The government has increased paid maternity leave from 4 to 6 months and many employers set up lactation rooms.",

          "Nombuyiselo, who had taken on the parenting role for the young South African child several years ago, adds: “This boy continued with his habits as he grew older, taking other children’s toy cars and cellphones. I’d come home and find parents standing outside my house looking for their children’s toys. This troubled me a lot. He always denied things. So I used to beat him. I used to beat him a lot for lying.”",
          "But supported by the WHO- and UNICEF-backed Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH) programme, the pair now enjoy a positive relationship, one which ensures the young child’s development is healthy and prevents him from embarking on risky routes that could endanger his health and wellbeing."

          "Over the past 4 years, the programme has spread to more than 20 countries due to increasing demand. It is one example of the measures being promoted by the new “INSPIRE” package of 7 interlinked strategies from WHO, UNICEF and other global partners aimed at reducing violence against children.",
          "Violence against children is associated with a range of negative impacts, including on the physical and mental wellbeing of the children themselves, particularly later in life. WHO and a variety of other organizations have been working to address causes of childhood violence, including in parenting situations. The INSPIRE initiative aims to take such action further.",
          "Dr Catherine Ward, a child psychology expert and a founder of PLH, says the organization’s work is solutions-based, with a strong focus on showing parents that there are a range of options for parenting that lead to positive results for the care-giver and the child.",
          "“We are seeing parents using harsh parenting often because they don’t know alternatives,” says Dr Ward. “They want to do the right thing. But parents who use harsh discipline can affect children’s mental health badly, often leading to depression and problems around the child’s conduct, including risky behaviour ranging from substance abuse and unsafe sex to injuries associated with riding motorcycles without helmets.”",
          "Recent research indicates that up to 1 billion children have experienced physical, sexual or psychological violence in the past year. Over the course of their childhood, 1 in 4 children suffer from physical abuse. Almost 1 in 5 girls, and 1 in 13 boys, suffer sexual abuse. Homicide is among the top 5 causes of death in adolescents.",
          "But research has found children who are warmly and consistently parented are less likely to develop depression, get addicted to drugs and alcohol, and engage in risky sex. They are also less likely to get involved in crime and violence.",
          "Now working in settings from South Sudan and El Salvador to the Philippines and Italy, PLH has seen common traits emerge, either in the universality of the forms of harsh and often violent discipline they have seen practised, to the willingness of parents to seek support from parenting programmes."

          "“If you make such services possible, people will attend,” adds Lucie Cluver, a co-founder of PLH and professor of child and family social work teaching at the universities of Cape Town and Oxford. “Parents everywhere want to do the best for their children, and are very willing to receive support on issues like preventing corporal punishment and harsh discipline. This is very positive.”",
          "Dr Alexander Butchart, WHO’s Prevention of Violence Coordinator, says PLH fills a major gap in programming for low-resource contexts, as it is designed to be as low-cost as possible without sacrificing the essential ingredients for its effectiveness.",
          "“Examples like the PLH model are so important to WHO because they connect the prevention of child maltreatment with the new emphasis in global heath on ensuring sound early childhood development, so that children both survive and thrive,” Dr Butchart says."

          "1 / 12 WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Yellow fever crosses borders Democratic Republic of the Congo shares its long, southern border with Angola, stretching for more than 2500 kilometres. The 2 countries have been inextricably linked for centuries and a steady flow of people cross daily from both sides to visit family or trade. Many young Congolese travel to Angola to search for work or diamonds. But the highly porous nature of the border is making it easier for the yellow fever outbreak in Angola to spread to Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Vaccination of 3 million people along the border People infected with yellow fever have carried the disease from Angola into the Democratic Republic of the Congo border province of Kwango. Confirmation of local transmission in the poor, largely rural community has sparked fears of further spread. Vaccination is essential to controlling the outbreak. In addition to vaccinating targeted areas of densely populated Kinshasa, WHO is working with government and partners to organize a mass vaccination campaign of approximately 3 million people along the border between Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Challenges in access One of the major challenges facing vaccination campaigns in Democratic Republic of the Congo is access. Getting to the southern parts of the country that border Angola involves travelling hundreds of kilometres across difficult terrain. Roads between the numerous villages scattered across the area are often nothing more than forest tracks through dense vegetation. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Accelerating response efforts A joint mission from Democratic Republic of the Congo's Ministry of Health, WHO and Médecins Sans Frontières meets with local health authorities in Kenge, the capital of Kwango province, to assess needs for the planned yellow fever vaccination campaign. Later, the response team travelled to the border areas to assess challenges and to evaluate how best to accelerate the response to the outbreak and prepare for mass vaccination. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Testing blood samples to treat patients and prevent further spread As well as getting the vaccines to the border areas, WHO is also assessing how to get blood samples out, so they can be tested. The faster blood samples are tested the quicker people with yellow fever can be treated and those nearby can be vaccinated if the sample is positive. In Kwango province there are no facilities to test for yellow fever and getting samples to the lab in Kinshasa can take up to a week. These men are transporting blood samples for yellow fever testing in a cool box on the back of a motorbike. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Faster transport for quicker blood results WHO is working with the Ministry of Health and UN partners to explore options for reliable and regular transport of vaccines, blood samples and personnel in and out of the border zones. Here, a WHO logistician assesses the option of reopening this landing strip near Kahemba in Kwango province to allow small planes from Kinshasa to land 2-3 times a week. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Keeping vaccines cold and usable Solange Kayindji, storekeeper for the Kahemba branch of the WHO Expanded Programme on Immunization, rearranges the contents of the centre’s only refrigerator to create space for yellow fever vaccines delivered by the joint mission. This vaccination centre serves more than 800 000 people across 28 community health centres. A new, large cold room has been built for the centre, but there are no funds available to purchase the fuel needed to run it. “It means we can only receive vaccines in small batches,” said Solange. Once opened, yellow fever vaccine vials should be stored between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Uncovering the spread of yellow fever Investigating the recent travel history of yellow fever patients helps the response team understand if cases are imported or are spreading locally. Like many young men from this region, 18-year-old Obed Shakhayi went to Angola to search for diamonds. After falling ill with suspected yellow fever, he returned to Democratic Republic of the Congo for treatment and is now recovering in hospital in Kahemba. There is no specific treatment for yellow fever, but adequate supportive care improves outcomes for seriously ill patients. Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics. WHO/E. Peron Vaccination awareness Ensuring that people know about yellow fever and understand the importance of vaccination is important when preparing for a successful campaign. Churches and schools in towns like Kahemba play an important role in educating the community about the disease. But the joint response team found that resources needed for social mobilization, such as funding for megaphones and batteries, posters, flyers and phone credit, were severely lacking. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Getting the word out Local radio is one of the most important ways to disseminate public health messages to the people in Democratic Republic of the Congo’s border provinces, the majority of whom live in villages that are widely scattered across a vast area and have no electricity or phone network coverage. Getting the local radio station in Kahemba back up and running is a priority action to prepare for the mass vaccination campaign. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Recognizing yellow fever symptoms at the border Ensuring that health care workers at the border recognize the symptoms of yellow fever and know what actions to take is key to treating patients, tracking the outbreak and targeting the response. At Shamaziamo, the principal border crossing between Angola and Kwango province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nurse Nicole Tshibulenu responds to a WHO epidemiologist’s queries on recent cases of fever. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Protection against mosquitoes Entomologist, Sylvie Fasine, explains the behaviours of the Aedes mosquito, the species that spreads yellow fever, to Angolan and Congolese border guards. She urges them to protect themselves by covering up during peak biting hours, dawn and dusk, and to clear surroundings of potential mosquito breeding sites. Engaging all sectors in combatting the yellow fever outbreak can help bring the outbreak to an end more quickly."

          "They were some of the challenges facing Lithuania 20 years ago, particularly in the country’s eastern region, where mortality from heart disease and stroke was highest, especially among middle-aged men and women outside major cities.",
          "Health officials concluded that many of the problems patients experienced in getting the care they needed stemmed from the way services were organized and provided. Specialist cardiology centres were overstaffed while regional hospitals were understaffed, particularly in rural areas. As a result, patients typically sought out specialists, even for routine matters, cutting primary care providers out of their traditional roles as first contact providers and treatment coordinators. A failure to collaborate left family doctors, workers in regional hospitals and those in tertiary-care centres working in separate silos, unaware of what their colleagues had done."

Their goal: to break down the hospital-centric delivery of care and the inequality of service between urban and rural areas.",
          "“We tried to bring them together and to convince them that organizing services in this way was easier and would avoid more serious problems,” said Prof Aleksandras Laucevicius, leader of the initiative working group from Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Klinikos. “That took time.”",
          "Boosting the role of primary care and emphasising the coordination of services proved to be key in reducing the need for hospital outpatient consultations and admissions. A stronger referral system improved the flow of patients among primary care settings, regional hospitals and central and tertiary facilities and training helped to shift the provision of cardiovascular health services to regional hospitals and local clinics.",
          "Patients were taught to manage their disease and given access to their health records, giving them improved awareness of their health and greater confidence that their health providers would be available when they needed them.",
          "The results? The availability of providers increased by 45%, with the biggest increase at secondary-level health care facilities outside the capital city of Vilnius; and the provision of outpatient services across secondary-level hospitals outside Vilnius increased by 26%. Best of all, mortality from heart attack and stroke has dropped, and the prevention and management of risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes has been stepped up, including availability of medication."

          "Lithuania’s example shows how an integrated, people-centred way of delivering health services pays big dividends to patients, as well as the efficiency of the health system. WHO’s framework on integrated people-centred health services, adopted by WHO’s 194 member states at the World Health Assembly in May 2016, sets out five strategies that countries can pursue to ensure that all people have equal access to quality health services where and when they need them.",

          "WHO is helping other countries and regions learn from Lithuania’s example. A new website on integrated people-centred care provides a database of resources and real-life examples of people-centred health service reform.",

          "In 2013, Kenya’s Ministry of Health was faced with a debate over the alarming rate of women dying in childbirth: was the cause deep-rooted cultural values, or could lives be saved with policy interventions?",
          "To find the answer, the ministry turned to its health information system. The data clearly showed that more than a third of women were giving birth at home and that many of them weren’t accessing health facilities because of distance and financial costs.\r\n        “We saw that there was a problem with access,” says Dr Nicholas Muraguri, the health ministry’s principal secretary, who is responsible for all health services in Kenya. “So we decided to remove the financial barrier.”",
          "On June 1, 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta declared maternity services free in all public health facilities in Kenya. The impact is being analysed.",
          "Dr. Muraguri cites this example to demonstrate the power of good data to inform policy decisions. Kenya has made significant investments in strengthening data collection tools such as household surveys, health management information systems and civil registration and vital statistics.",
          "Still, gaps in the country’s health information system remain, notably in producing high-quality data and in effectively using and analyzing data to tackle priorities such as infectious diseases and rising rates of diabetes, cancer and heart disease. In addition, data systems developed by global health development partners that focus on single diseases sometimes operate in isolation instead of talking to each other and linking up with government-led efforts."

          "“One of the reasons we are taking this approach is because we are focusing our efforts toward meeting the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Dr Isabella Maina, head of the Health Sector Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) unit in Kenya’s health ministry. “We need a strong health information system and M&E program to track and guide our progress toward meeting those goals.”",

But how do they know the data on which they base those decisions are reliable?",

But many countries lack the resources and infrastructure to gather good quality data, and data are often missing for certain populations and time periods. Countries sometimes count in different ways, making comparisons problematic. To fill those gaps, WHO and other researchers calculate estimates of health data based on complex methods, sometimes using indicators such as gross domestic product and education that are known to be drivers of health outcomes, as well as comparable data from other countries in the same region or with similar characteristics.",

The Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting, or GATHER, is a checklist of 18 best practices that sets the standard for disclosing how health estimates are developed. The GATHER checklist was developed by WHO and researchers from around the world including the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in Seattle, and was published today in the Lancet and PLOS Medicine.",
          "“When the health and well-being of millions of people is at stake you need to be sure you have the best possible information to make the best possible decisions,” said Dr Ties Boerma, Director of WHO’s Department of Information, Evidence and Research. “GATHER is a crucial step towards making sure health estimates can stand up to scrutiny.”",
          "GATHER includes requirements for disclosing which data are used to calculate estimates, and for making them available to others. It also includes a requirement to disclose how the computer code used to crunch the numbers can be accessed, making it possible for others to reproduce estimates, making them more robust.",
          "Both WHO and IHME have agreed to comply with GATHER when they publish new global health estimates. Journals including the Lancet, PLOS Medicine, the International Journal of Epidemiology and the Bulletin of the World Health Organization plan to ask authors to comply with GATHER, and it is expected that other journals to follow suit. Several estimates compiled by WHO already follow GATHER principles, including child mortality, childhood causes of death and maternal mortality."

The ‘Renewed Partnership to Strengthen Pharmaceutical Systems’, as the initiative is called, wraps up in September this year with numerous achievements and the hope that international support will continue to bolster Africa’s efforts to improve its health systems.",
          "Donatien Bigirimana, who works as Medicines Adviser in the WHO Burundi office, says that the first thing patients ask when they front up to a health facility is: do you have medicines? “Medicines are the foundation of a health system,” he explains. “Without them, patients will not seek medical attention and health facilities lose credibility.”",
          "Strong healthcare cannot exist without strong and well managed pharmaceutical systems.",
          "says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa",
          "But access to quality essential medicines is not a given in many sub-Saharan African countries and several other regions in the world. Largely due to resource constraints and lack of skilled personnel, low-income countries experience poor availability of essential medicines in health facilities, substandard quality treatments, frequent stock-outs and sub-optimal prescription and use of medicines. In addition, many patients in developing countries are not covered by health insurance and when sick are forced to pay for medicines out-of-pocket, often facing financial hardship as a result.",
          "To address these challenges, the European Union in partnership with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and WHO has, for the last four years, worked with the governments of 15 African countries* to improve their pharmaceutical systems so that their populations can access the treatment they need. The partnership, in collaboration with ministries of health, has placed greatest emphasis on training and strengthening health workers’ capacity and awareness, guidance on sound pharmaceutical policies and good governance practices, and skills to monitor the quality of medicines and detect suspicious products that could be sub-standard or counterfeit and potentially dangerous.",
          "“Money alone is not enough, particularly when it is directed at buying specific health commodities,” says Pauline Duya, a pharmacist in the Kenyan Ministry of Health who has collaborated on the project. “We need technical assistance on policies and best practices and enhanced capabilities to improve the system. That is where WHO is playing a critical role.”",

From countries we need to see greater commitment, higher investment and better governance. Strong healthcare cannot exist without strong and well managed pharmaceutical systems.”",

          "1 / 9 Hospital Geral de Luanda Hospital Geral de Luanda in the capital city of Angola, Luanda has reported the majority of cases in the current yellow fever outbreak in Angola. The Hospital Geral de Luanda is 1 of 3 reference centres for yellow fever patients in the Luanda province. WHO/Dalia Lourenço Laboratory results showing cases of yellow fever Ana Eunice Fernandes shows the rapid test results taken for suspected yellow fever patients to the Coordinator of the yellow fever unit, Ernesto Araújo, at the Hospital Geral de Luanda. Differential diagnostic tests are used to rule out diseases such as malaria and chikungunya. WHO/Dalia Lourenço Treating yellow fever cases Female patients, who are suspected to have yellow fever, are treated in this room at the Hospital Geral de Luanda. WHO/Dalia Lourenço Treating the sick A 16-year-old patient, is treated in the yellow fever unit at Hospital Geral de Luanda. WHO/Dalia Lourenço Yellow fever patients receive supportive care There is no specific treatment for yellow fever, only supportive care to treat the symptoms, such as fever, bleeding and other complications. Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics. Adequate supportive care improves outcomes for seriously ill patients. This care is only available at identified referral hospitals. WHO/Dalia Lourenço Yellow fever patient ward Treatment is provided in a hospital ward designated for suspected yellow fever cases at the Hospital Kapalanga in Municipio de Viana in Luanda province, Angola. WHO/D. Lourenco Treatment for all ages Patients of all ages receive care for yellow fever cases at the Hospital Kapalanga in Municipio de Viana in Luanda province, Angola. Malaria and dengue have already been ruled out as diagnoses. WHO/Dalia Lourenço Beyond treatment, fighting the outbreak WHO teams and other partners are supporting the Ministry of Health's response to yellow fever in the following areas: vaccination, vector control, epidemiological surveillance, laboratory capacity and social mobilization activities. EPA Yellow Fever Vaccine – Prevention is better than a cure Yellow fever is prevented by a safe, affordable and effective vaccine. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease and a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. The vaccine provides effective immunity within 30 days for 99% of persons vaccinated."

          "1 / 8 Kisenso, the latest health zone affected by yellow fever Kisenso health zone is a lush, rural district that sits on a hill above Kinshasa. It is home to 400 000 people, most of whom live in acute poverty. Environmental determinants of health Mosquito-borne diseases thrive in the rich green vegetation. The situation is made worse due to a lack of infrastructure, such as running water and accessible roads. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Yellow fever outbreak affects young and old The Lubaki family has been severely affected by the yellow fever outbreak. 13-year-old Moïse, their eldest son died in early June and 2-year-old Kelly is seriously ill in hospital where Mrs Lubaki is by his bedside. 9-year-old Morgan (pictured far left) was also sick but has recovered. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Daily disease surveillance essential to stop the outbreak Dr Valentin Ndaye Shimiye is Chief Medical Officer of Kisenso Health Zone. Each health zone centre has been provided with a mobile phone to send daily notification of new suspect cases in their area. Here Dr Shimiye visits the marketplace to monitor surveillance efforts. Daily monitoring is vital to track the spread of the disease and ensure an effective response. WHO/A. Clements-Hunt Supporting surveillance efforts WHO, with the support of partners, is supporting surveillance efforts by sending teams into the local health zones to actively search out new suspect cases of yellow fever.

It was one of the deadliest diseases known to humans, and to date (2016) the only human disease to have been eradicated by vaccination. The smallpox vaccine, introduced by Edward Jenner in 1796, was the first successful vaccine to be developed. He observed that milkmaids who previously had caught cowpox did not catch smallpox and showed that inoculated vaccinia protected against inoculated variola virus.",
          "The global eradication effort initially used a strategy of mass vaccination campaigns to achieve 80% vaccine coverage in each country, and thereafter by case-finding, followed by ring vaccination of all known and possible contacts to seal off the outbreak from the rest of the population.",
          "In 1961 the bifurcated needle was developed as a more efficient and cost effective alternative, and was the primary instrument used during the eradication campaign from 1966 to 1977. The bifurcated needle vaccination required only one-fourth the amount of vaccine needed with previous methods and was simpler to perform."

Second generation smallpox vaccines use the same smallpox vaccine strains employed for manufacture of first generation vaccines or clonal virus variants plaque purified from traditional vaccine stocks, whereas third generation smallpox vaccines represent more attenuated vaccine strains specifically developed as safer vaccines at the end of the eradication phase by further passage in cell culture or animals. Second and third generation vaccines are produced using modern cell culture techniques and current standards of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).",
          "The need for WHO to maintain an emergency reserve of smallpox vaccine following eradication was recognized in 1980 when WHO was given a set of formal responsibilities for maintaining capacity and expertise to respond to a re-emergence of smallpox in the post-eradication era as both a component of a preparedness strategy and a possible deterrent to intentional release. The Smallpox Vaccine Emergency Stockpile (SVES) was originally created by consolidating WHO Member State donations given in support of the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Programme.",
          "In 2002, World Health Assembly (WHA) Resolution 55.16 urged Member States to share expertise, supplies and resources to rapidly contain a public health emergency or mitigate its effects. The resolution further requested the WHO Director General to examine the possible development of collaborative mechanisms to prepare and stockpile resources for a potential PHEIC.

          "At the beginning of 2014, the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) in Mexico started working on the hand hygiene campaign for the first time, to support a reduction in health care-associated infections.",
          "“We are now running a hand hygiene (HH) implementation pilot project in four hospitals to compare the cost of antibiotics with the total cost of implementing hand hygiene at the point of care. Beside the costs for handrub provided at the bedside, monitoring consumption on a daily basis, HH compliance monitoring, service and training are also included, a multimodal strategy recommended by WHO”.",
          "The biggest challenge in establishing the hand hygiene campaign is changing people’s mindsets towards a patient safety culture. As part of the project, campaign activities are planned to get people more engaged; increasing use of alcohol handrub solutions instead of soap and water, holding a contest for health care workers each year where they award the best content (poster, video, songs, etc) related to good practice on hand hygiene in their hospitals. Thanks to the effort of hospital leaders, infection prevention teams, doctors, nurses and also administrative workers involved in the campaign and project, it has been possible to observe that most Mexican health care workers are now aware of the importance of performing hand hygiene. Compliance on the practice of hand hygiene related to the “5 Moments” and practicing it in the right way, is increasing every day. “The hand hygiene message for 2016? To keep engaging more and more people because ‘Clean hands save lives!”"

          "Dao Duy Tuoc, age 85, grew up in the village of Co Bi on the eastern outskirts of Hanoi, where he has lived his entire life. In the past, he and his neighbours were farmers and their village had more fields than homes. Now, everything has changed—“One thousand times over,” he likes to say.",
          "With most of the farms paved over, his neighbours now have careers in trading and in many other fields, including healthcare. Whenever he feels sick, he visits the Co Bi Commune Health Centre, a local facility less than a kilometre away from his house.",
          "“They provide me with two types of medicine,” he notes, “one to treat hypertension and the second one to keep my heart running. The medicines keep me healthy, and my health is very good compared to other people my age.”",
          "WHO’s brand is not visible to Tuoc, but he reaps the benefits of WHO’s efforts in Vietnam. “More people here can afford to buy medicines because the prices for essential medicines are affordable,” he points out.",
          "“When I was a child, we did not have this facility. It was built in 1980,” he adds. “After the national reunification, we have seen a lot of positive changes in our healthcare system. The quality of care and the availability of medicines have improved dramatically, and doctors and nurses have been trained with new skills and abilities.”",
          "“We are like family members,” he continues, “because most of the staff working at the facility are local residents. They were born here and grew up here, so we all know each other. And any time I come here—or my children and grandchildren come here—we always receive very proper and thoughtful care.”",
          "“I tell my grandchildren about my childhood, so they can understand the traditions we hand down from generation to generation,” he notes. “But I don’t think they understand how hard it was when I was small. Very few friends of mine are still living.”",
          "“Our society has always favoured older people,” he concludes. “It is good to be here still.”"

          "The Vietnamese Government has an ambitious goal, to produce 90% of the essential medicines its people need by 2020. The effort is considered positive for the economy as well as necessary for the nation’s health—but it hinges on one key condition: the medicines produced domestically must be quality-assured, effective and safe as production increases.",
          "The Government’s plan aims to address the dual challenge of low access to and high prices of medicines revealed in a peer-reviewed study that was published in 2009. At the time, brand-name medicines cost almost 50 times more than the international reference prices, and even generic medicines were 11 times more expensive. Prices in the private sector were only slightly better. The medicines were found to be mostly imports, whose quality was assured through international regulatory processes – i.e. the WHO Prequalification Programme. To compete with these medicines, domestic production needed improved manufacturing practices and increased regulatory oversight.",
          "Working with the World Health Organization (WHO), Vietnam’s Health Ministry invested in two aspects of quality control: strengthening the capacities of quality control laboratories, which test pharmaceutical products before they reach the market; and drug safety facilities dealing with adverse drug events from medicines already on the market, as reported by consumers and health providers.",
          "The Ministry of Health’s investment in promoting quality can readily be seen from a tour of the National Institute of Drug Quality Control (NIDQ) in Hanoi. Technicians conduct tests for quality, safety, and dosage accuracy on conventional drugs, herbal and traditional medicines, even cosmetics. Every province in Vietnam has such a lab.",
          "Every year, NIDQ reviews approximately three percent of all medicines on the market, 40 000 samples randomly selected from everywhere in the country. The laboratories have been prequalified by WHO and more than half have also achieved ISO 17025 certification an international standard for the testing and calibration of laboratories in both the public and private sectors.",
          "NIDQ is currently working with WHO on a quality control investigation of antibiotics marketed in several border provinces a key element in the country’s efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance.",
          "“When we use substandard antimicrobials, they lack sufficient potency and do not kill the bacteria or microorganisms, creating drug resistance” said Tran Viet Hung, PhD, NIDQ’s Deputy Director. “The testing of these drugs is very important, especially in tropical countries like Vietnam where antimicrobial resistance is a problem of great concern.”",
          "NIDQ is also collaborating with WHO in surveying the quality of medications for neglected tropical diseases in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand. The agency’s proficiency has been recognized in the region; it is assisting the governments of Laos and Bangladesh to obtain ISO accreditation as well.",
          "The second part of Vietnam’s regulatory vigilance—the Vietnamese Drug Information & Adverse Drug Reactions Monitoring Centre has also expanded its capacity. The Centre now has two main offices, in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, which process feedback and complaints about pharmaceutical products after they reach the market.",
          "In a visit to the Hanoi office, which is based at the Hanoi University of Pharmacy, Nguyen Hoang Anh, PhD, the Centre’s deputy director, talks about working with WHO’s pharmacovigilance programme for assessing reports and complaints. He uses the case of Levelamy, a medicine used to treat cirrhosis and other liver conditions, as an example for how the process works now.",
          "The National Pharmacovigilance Centre in Vietnam became a full member of the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring in 1999. To date, the Centre has submitted a total of 10 431 individual case safety reports (ICSRS) to VigiBase, the WHO global database of adverse drug reaction reports (February 2016).",
          "“At the end of 2014, we received 21 reports from four hospitals that the drug was causing adverse side effects including fever, low blood pressure and difficulty breathing,” Prof. Nguyen explains. “We sent the reports to medical and pharmaceutical experts to conduct causality assessments, and at the same time we informed all hospitals in the country about the problem. In response, we heard that other hospitals had patients exhibiting similar reactions.”",
          "As more reports came in, Prof. Nguyen and his colleagues sent letters to other government agencies, alerting them to the investigation. Although the four hospitals were in different provinces, they traced the medicine to the same production batch.",
          "“The total length of time from when we first received reports until the DAV issued a decision in the case was three weeks,” he said. “This is a typical example of how we now contribute to drug safety and therefore improve patient safety. In the past, the process was not as quick as it is now. It took up to a year just to send information from this centre to DAV.”",
          "“It is fundamentally important to assure the overall quality and safety of these medicines at all times,” said Socorro Escalante, MD, WHO’s technical officer and medicines policy advisor in Vietnam, whose team has worked with both of sides of Vietnam’s drug regulation efforts. “Without this, the medicines cannot meet the public health needs of the population”"

          "Dr Doussou Touré arrives for work at Coléah Medical Centre. She washes her hands from a bucket set up in front of the building, proceeds to a screening area where her temperature is checked and recorded and only then enters the bustling facility that she supervises.",
          "“Ebola is under control now, but we try to keep up the infection prevention and control systems that were put in place during the outbreak,” Dr Touré says, pointing to several sturdy, brightly-coloured bins, each one designated for the disposal of varying waste matter.",
          "Dr Touré remembers when patients with Ebola symptoms first started arriving at the hospital. She describes the determination of her team to help the incoming, amid confusion, fear and risky practices.",
          "“We had no protective supplies at the beginning or knowledge of how to keep ourselves or our patients safe,” recalls the facility director. “There was nowhere to screen patients when they came or separate them if they met the case definition for Ebola. So everybody was together and exposed—patients, family, visitors, health workers.”",
          "Staff at the centre eventually set up a tent in the courtyard of the building to isolate suspect Ebola cases.",
          "“We tried to care for the patients in the tent and keep them there until they could be taken to an Ebola treatment unit, but it was very difficult,” Dr Touré says. “There were only 2 ambulances in the city then and it would take 6 hours for them to come, sometimes double. The patients got tired of waiting in the tent and would walk around. Sometimes they would leave the hospital and there was nothing we could do to stop them.”",
          "Coléah Medical Centre soon started receiving personal protective equipment, sanitation and hygiene supplies, as well as training on triage and other infection prevention and control (IPC) measures from WHO, Guinea’s Ministry of Health and partners. In March 2015, WHO began constructing a permanent triage room at the facility and by summer it was being used to separate, screen and care for suspected Ebola cases before they were transferred to an Ebola care centre. The tent was retired.",
          "The isolation and transit room near the entrance to Coleah Medical Centre is one of 12 that WHO built in the past year at under-resourced health facilities in Guinea with inadequate triage structures. Eight more are under construction, to be used for any highly infectious diseases, including Ebola.",
          "On this day, WHO IPC supervisors arrive at Coleah Medical Centre for a monitoring visit. The triage room is empty of patients requiring isolation. In another part of the facility, squirming children are being administered drops for polio, a campaign that was shelved during the Ebola outbreak. On the adjacent side, patients wait in the shade for consultations with nurses and doctors.",
          "WHO’s Aissatou Barry and Bienvenu Houndjo meet with Dr Touré and members of her staff to review IPC activities, provide guidance and ensure standards are being met. Today they discuss water and power supply issues at the facility and check stocks of gloves, gowns, soap, hand disinfectants and other cleaning materials and personal protective gear.",
          "WHO/M. Winkler",
          "In coordination with local health authorities, IPC focal points from WHO and partner agencies carry out similar monitoring visits at health centres in 5 communes in Conakry and 33 districts across the country. More than 2700 health workers have participated in WHO trainings on triage, waste management, stock and storage management and fundamental IPC procedures and 430 of them have received additional training from WHO to provide regular on-site IPC support and mentoring at medical facilities in their communities.",
          "“Making sure that routine IPC practices are carried out is the key to preventing transmission of Ebola or any other infectious disease from one patient to another and to keeping health workers safe and protected,” says Dr Gilbert Kayoko Tshifuaka, who oversees WHO’s IPC programmes in Guinea.",
          "At the Coleah Medical Centre, Dr Touré says her team is no longer afraid of Ebola and would be ready to respond to new cases.",
          "“We still have small outbreaks of Ebola in our country, but with proper triage now and so much training and support, we are confident that we can handle a re-emergence of Ebola or other infectious diseases,” she says. “We have to be prepared for cholera and meningitis too.”"

The lack of trained midwives in most rural health facilities and the long distances women have to travel to access care are hindering the country’s progress in reducing maternal and newborn mortality.",
          "Today, Liberia has less than 200 trained midwives for more than 4 million people. And most of those are working in urban areas - compounding the situation for rural women. Nationwide, there are only 2 specialists in obstetrics and gynaecology and 2 in paediatrics. This is partly a result of the 14-year civil war and the Ebola crisis, which left health facilities in disrepair and drove health workers out of the country.",
          "“To help save more women’s and babies’ lives, we need more trained midwives,” says Bentoe. “We need midwives who can ensure a safe pregnancy even before a woman is pregnant. People who can provide advice on family planning, nutrition, physical activity and preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV.”",

          "When Nguyen Dang Hien, MD Phd, graduated from Hanoi Medical University in 1989, his first job was with Vietnam’s Centre for Research and Production of Vaccines and Biology (POLYVAC). He staffed the production line, working on quality control for the polio vaccine.",
          "He looks back at the year 2000, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Vietnam polio-free, as a career highlight.",
          "“We are very proud of polio eradication,” Dr. Nguyen says in an interview at POLYVAC’s boardroom. “It proves the safety and efficacy of the vaccines we produce not just in the fight against polio, but in our work against other diseases as well.”",
          "Dr. Nguyen is now the director of POLYVAC, one of four state-owned vaccine production companies in Vietnam. POLYVAC has been prequalified by WHO and is at the vanguard of the country’s efforts to improve the quality and targeting of its products.",
          "A good example can be found in the company’s labs, where scientists are developing a measles-rubella vaccine. POLYVAC’s measles vaccine is effective, and has reduced the incidence of the disease by 400 percent. But a resurgence of rubella—a viral infection also known as German measles—has generated a new immunization need for Vietnam’s Health Ministry to address.",
          "In response, the Ministry of Health began purchasing and distributing a measles-rubella vaccine that it imports from a company in India. Plans are in place, however, to switch to a domestically produced solution.",
          "“Local vaccine production, Dr. Nguyen said, “is much less expensive than importing the products. The cost of producing one dose of the rotavirus vaccine, for example, is one third the price of importing a dose. For the polio vaccine, we produce approximately 10 million doses at a cost of about 20 billion Vietnamese Dong. But if we imported the vaccine from another country, we would need to spend 40 billion.”",
          "In 2013 POLYVAC began working on developing its own version of a measles-rubella vaccine. In a WHO-qualified laboratory that rigorously controls the quality of medicines, technicians strictly follow WHO guidelines for norms and standards in vaccines. In fact, the many reference manuals provided by WHO have their own room in the lab, and all workers can access the materials when needed.",
          "Vietnam’s Expanded Programme on Immunization includes 11 vaccines now, and all but one of them are produced domestically. The government provides the vaccines free of charge to all children under the age of six, with efforts primarily focused around a national day of immunization.",
          "“Vietnam faces many challenges as a rapidly developing middle income country,” says Socorro Escalante, MD, WHO’s technical officer and medicines policy advisor in Vietnam. “For local pharmaceutical production to be more effective, we need to shift the industry paradigm to ensure that the products they manufacture address priority illnesses and diseases in the country and to also ensure that they are available everywhere they are needed.”",
          "Dr. Nguyen notes that POLYVAC and the other Vietnamese vaccine manufacturers are working with WHO so that the products can be prequalified for procurement in neighbouring countries. Vietnam’s typhoid vaccine, produced at another facility, has already been cleared for procurement and its BCG vaccine, generally used to prevent tuberculosis, will soon be cleared as well.",
          "“Because the birthrate increases every day in our country—it’s now about 1.5 to 1.7 million new births annually—and because we are in a tropical climate with very humid weather, providing our own vaccines for the population is an important goal for the health sector,” he added. “Being self-sufficient is a very big achievement for Vietnam,” he concluded. “It shows a scientific development pathway for Vietnam when you compare us to other countries, especially other developing countries.”"

More than 1,000 people who may have had contact with the confirmed cases were identified, and following intensive community sensitization and outreach, the majority of the contacts were placed under medical observation for 21 days.

She came down with Ebola symptoms there, and died on 31 March, spreading the flare-up of Ebola to that country. Two of her three boys also became infected, but both survived. They are the 2-year-old boy and his 5-year old brother who were released from the care centre last week.",

But, in many parts of the world and within many countries, the presence of a health worker during childbirth is often a luxury. If a woman is poor, she is even more likely to deliver without support, putting herself and child at risk.",
          "In Indonesia, this is a familiar story for poor women. Twenty years ago, only 1 in 5 women in the poorest 20% of the population gave birth with support from a skilled attendant.",
          "Through recognizing the inequalities and targeting programmes towards the poorest populations, Indonesia has been able to improve the number of births attended by skilled personnel among the poorest population to 3 out of 5 births in the period 2007 to 2012. However, nearly all births among the richest 20% of the population were supported.",
          "“While we have worked hard to reduce the health inequalities in Indonesia, they still persist,” says Ms Rustini Floranita, WHO National Professional Officer and focal point for gender, equity and human rights in Indonesia. “We need to continue to find ways to uncover and target these gaps so that the most disadvantaged populations have the same health care as the richest populations.”"

HEAT is a software package that utilizes data from the WHO Health Equity Monitor and enables health professionals and researchers to explore the health inequalities in their countries. Additionally, users can compare the state of inequality in their country with other countries.",
          "Besides data on the proportion of births attended by skilled personnel, HEAT users can assess variations in coverage of immunization, antenatal care, contraception, and breastfeeding, to name a few of the indicators covered.",
          "In April, WHO hosted a workshop in Indonesia and trained 30 participants from the Ministry of Health, the National Statistical Office of Indonesia, academia, and other UN agencies, how to assess the country’s inequality data in HEAT. At the workshop, participants learned that Indonesia is increasing the women’s and children’s health intervention coverage fastest among the most disadvantaged populations, including the poorest, the least educated and rural residents in most of indicators.",
          "When comparing Indonesia with neighbouring countries, the gaps are more profound. In parts of South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions some countries are providing almost complete coverage for skilled birth attendance in all populations based on economic status, education and place of residence. And, in other countries the gaps are even higher than those in Indonesia.",
          "“The ‘built-in database edition’ of HEAT was received very well by the workshop participants,” says Floranita. “It facilitates analysis and reporting on health inequality and provides interactive and customised tables and graphs that can be downloaded and used. Once we’re able to import our own data, we’ll be able to monitor even more inequalities.”",
          "Utilizing the data in HEAT and other data from household surveys, health facility data, censuses, civil registration, and vital statistics, participants from the workshop plan to develop a national report on state of health inequality in Indonesia, which will help the country ensure no one is left behind in the future."

She also called for Member States to ensure the availability of treatment and to make controlled substances available for medical and scientific purposes. Stating that, “WHO estimates that 80% of the world’s population lives in countries with zero or very little access to controlled medicines for relieving moderate to severe pain.”",
          "Although the adopted document falls short of the public health approach, it calls for \"appropriate medication-assisted therapy programs, injecting equipment programs as well as antiretroviral therapy and other relevant interventions.\" Several countries signaled that investing in health care and providing addiction treatment, rather than using the prohibition and criminalization approach, is the best way forward.",

          "“The rise of antimicrobial resistance is a global crisis, recognized as one of the greatest threats to health today,” remarked Dr Chan in her statement. Dr Menabde of the WHO office at the UN served as moderator for the panel, which also included the Permanent Representatives of Mexico and Thailand, as well as a representative from the State Department of the United States of America. A number of Member States also delivered statements from the floor, including Brazil, Japan, South Africa, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. “Addressing AMR is critical to achieving Sustainable Development Goals across the board”, stated Dr Menabde in her introductory remarks, and “fighting it requires a collective and practical response”, which is why the evident intersectoral collaboration between WHO, OIE, and FAO is an important first step.",
          "Looking ahead, Member State consultations on the modalities for and possible outcomes of the high-level meeting on AMR in September is scheduled to begin in May 2016. On 7 April 2016, the President of the General Assembly, H.E. Mr Mogens Lykketoft, appointed the Permanent Representative of Mexico, Ambassador Juan Camacho, as facilitator to lead these discussions.

At present we believe it will take more than 1 to 2 years for this to happen. Once a product is licensed we should be prepared to move swiftly and with clear operating procedures and agreement between countries worldwide.",
          "That’s why WHO convened a Global Ebola Vaccine Implementation Team. This includes partner organizations’ technical experts and representatives from the 3 countries most affected by the West Africa outbreak: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. We also engaged with countries previously affected by an Ebola outbreak: Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan and Uganda.",

          "This means we vaccinate all people who have been in direct contact with this person and the people who have been in contact with those contacts. In an outbreak that appears to be spreading rapidly we do geographically focussed vaccination – meaning we immunize people living in the area surrounding a cluster of cases in an entire village or sub-district. This is similar to the type of immunization campaigns we do when there are cholera outbreaks.”"

Early in Sierra Leone’s outbreak, we believed that the virus remained in semen for no more than 3 months among male survivors of Ebola. Now it appears the virus can stay in the semen for as long as a year. This finding has an impact on how we will use the vaccine to protect the sexual partners of people who recovered from Ebola.",
          "The vaccines that have been tested tend to make some people feel quite sick for 1-2 days with fever, aches and fatigue. This could affect acceptability. We already have problems with vaccine hesitancy in our country.",
          "But something interesting happened during the outbreak. There was 1 local man who volunteered to participate in the trial of the vaccine. Afterwards, his wife was in contact with a person who was sick with Ebola. She did not want to take the vaccine – until he came forward publicly in favour of it. So now we believe that former trial participants can serve as champions for the new vaccine.”"

It will be useful to have information about longer-term protection, which will be needed to protect groups at risk, such as healthcare workers, before they are ever exposed to Ebola.",

          "Great progress has been made in defining the world drug problem as a\r\n    public health and in raising awareness of the issue of lack of access to\r\n    controlled medicines. Improving access is now an area of consensus following a\r\n    highly contentious drug policy debate and a yearlong preparatory process for the\r\n    UN General Assembly Special Session on Drugs (UNGASS) which took place from\r\n    April 19-21, 2016 in New York.",
          "Limited access to essential medicines for the treatment of pain,\r\n    palliative care, surgery, substance use disorder and mental and neurological\r\n    conditions, is one of the least recognized and most egregious tragedies in\r\n    global health. National and international drug control policies have\r\n    historically put the focus on restricting access to controlled substances.\r\n    Unduly restrictive national regulations leave the vast majority of the most\r\n    vulnerable and marginalized patients in agonizing pain and distress. Untreated\r\n    pain traumatises families, caregivers, and providers, who must often stand by\r\n    helplessly and witness what is in fact very treatable suffering. 75% of the\r\n    world’s population lack access to controlled substances for medical and\r\n    scientific use.",
          "The recommendations from the UNGASS and from a concurrently held,\r\n    high-level UN meeting on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) require Member\r\n    States to develop innovative inter-governmental processes and synergies to\r\n    achieve the 17 goals and their many targets. In order to improve access to\r\n    palliative care and controlled essential medicines, healthcare providers,\r\n    government officials, and representatives of UN agencies such as the World\r\n    Health Organization, must be involved in ongoing ‘multi-stakeholder dialogues’\r\n    that will be a feature of this process.",

          "The next drug policy milestone is the UNGASS 2019, when UN Member\r\n    States will report on their progress. The hard work now begins to operationalize\r\n    the recommendations made at UNGASS 2016. WHO will lead that process,\r\n    coordinating with other UN agencies to assist governments to develop the outcome\r\n    measures and associated processes. A number of WHO Member States have requested\r\n    that the public health aspects of the world drug problem be discussed in the\r\n    plenary session of the World Health Assembly. As a first step, the WHO\r\n    Secretariat will a report on the outcomes of the UNGASS to the 69th World Health\r\n    Assembly (A69/12) for guidance on further activities.",

          "Using radiation in medical imaging can save lives and prevent the need for more invasive procedures, but inappropriate use may lead to unnecessary and unintended radiation doses for patients.

          "In February 2015, the Pan African Congress of Radiology and Imaging launched AFROSAFE, a campaign to ensure all radiation-based medical procedures in Africa are necessary and performed safely. As part of the campaign, medical professionals are learning to conduct risk-benefit discussions about paediatric imaging with patients and families utilizing WHO’s new risk communications tool.",
          "“AFROSAFE is bringing the African medical community together in the struggle to ensure radiation safety,” says Dr Kawooya. “WHO’s new tool will help us create more awareness about the risks associated with radiation exposure, and help use develop communication skills needed to pass on the messages.”",
          "Through AFROSAFE Uganda, Dr Kawooya is teaching doctors and technicians in his country to enhance the safety and quality of radiology. In November 2015, he helped organize the first training session, which was attended by more than 100 Ugandan medical professionals and patient advocates.",

          "And so in 2014 the health ministry launched a playful but aggressive antimeasles campaign, using highly visible approaches like painting red spots on trams and coaches, public service announcements in movie theatres and ads in popular publications. The campaign targeted people of all ages, including parents, but it aimed especially at reaching unimmunized adults.",
          "In Austria practically all babies - more than 95% - are immunized against measles. Not so for adults. “Many adults over the age of 45 are not immune to measles because they were never vaccinated and never had the infection. This makes them vulnerable to catching the disease if they are exposed. The result is “hotspot” outbreaks,” explains Dr Maria Paulke-Korinek, Head of the Vaccines Department at the Austrian Federal Ministry of Health. “More than a third of our measles cases last year were in people over the age of 15.”"

          "“In Austria, we have a sort of lost generation where measles is concerned. Young Austrian adults tend to think of measles as a childhood illness that is a thing of the past and do not realize it is quite dangerous and potentially lethal. They generally believe they were probably vaccinated – but don’t check to see if this is true,” says Dr Heidemarie Holzmann, Associate Professor in the Department of Virology at the Medical University of Vienna. “Anyone, no matter what their age, can get vaccinated against measles free of charge in Austria, but not enough people take advantage.”",
          "Austria faces another challenge. “In many European countries, including Austria, we are encountering vaccine hesitancy – a prejudice against vaccination based on personal philosophy or groundless fears about side effects,” says Dr Mark Muscat, Technical Officer at the WHO European Regional Office. “Sadly, there are even quite a number of health workers who are anti-vaccine.”"

          "It has already been shown that elimination of measles – and rubella - is possible. The WHO Region of the Americas – which includes many low-resource countries – has met this goal. “Elimination of measles and rubella is currently one of the top priorities for the WHO European Regional Office,” Dr Muscat says.",

Dr Nata Menabde, Executive Director of the WHO Office at the United Nations (WUN), held a press briefing to introduce the first WHO Global report on diabetes and to outline the significance of this year’s World Health Day in helping achieve the global Sustainable Development Goal 3 target of reducing premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) by one-third by the year 2030. WUN also collaborated with the UN Medical Service to offer UN staff a free practical diabetes risk assessment with the option for follow-up consultations and screening tests throughout the day and during the week of 11–15 April. Additionally, UN catering services participated in the awareness raising campaign, by serving a diabetes friendly lunch menu and making available to UN delegates and staff the WHO placemat quiz on diabetes throughout the day in the UN cafeteria and cafes. The day culminated with an evening reception hosted by WUN for UN Member States, UN system colleagues and external partners, to showcase simple measures to prevent diabetes and NCDs as a whole. Guests were introduced to delicious healthy meals and fun indoor cycling as a means to encourage healthy eating and physical activity. Participants including Ambassadors Mr E. Courtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica to the UN, Mr Ib Petersen, Permanent Representative of Denmark to the UN, Ms Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg to the UN, and key partners, Mr José Luis Castro, Chair of the NCD Alliance Steering Group and Dr David Nabarro, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on the SDGs, via a video message, highlighted the burden of diabetes and pledged their political support to halt the rise of and improve support for people with diabetes. They also stressed on the need for concerted effort among all partners as well as cultural considerations when designing effective policies and tools to beat diabetes.

          "1 / 8 WHO/N. Tesfaye Ethiopia’s Health Minister, Dr Kesetebirhan Admasu, has said that wiping out the TB epidemic will be possible only with strong political commitment and the engagement of communities. When we look at Ethiopia’s success in tackling TB, it is precisely political commitment over the past decade, combined with an army of thousands of health extension workers and community volunteers, that are behind it. WHO/N. Tesfaye Ethiopia has made important strides in improving access to health services through its Health Extension Programme, which deploys more than 40,000 health extension workers nationwide. Among their duties is helping individuals with TB symptoms access diagnostic testing, and supporting TB patients during treatment. Birhane Tadesse (left) and Bezunesh Bekele (right) explain their day-to-day work as health extension workers at Dojo Kora health post in Wolisso, two hours outside Addis Ababa. WHO/N. Tesfaye Anuma and Gobinei earn about US$ 100 per month, but are hopeful that they will get a salary increase soon. Their starting salary eight years ago was approximately US$ 28. Anuma and Gobinei work in one of the 15,000 health posts across the country. Once they identify suspected TB cases in their community, they refer them to the nearest health centre for diagnosis and treatment. TB control is part of the package of 16 health interventions that are delivered by these young female health workers. WHO/N. Tesfaye In addition to deploying health extension workers in the communities, Ethiopia’s health ministry has also invested in organizing thousands of community volunteers across the country. These people work on the frontlines in the communities to identify villagers who may have TB. Along with the health extension workers, they make up what is known as the Health Development Army. Hirpessa Geleta (left) and Angasu Dhuguma (middle) are community volunteers in Wolisso. Beyera Guta (right), a farmer with five children, was diagnosed with TB by his cousin Hirpessa Geleta. WHO/N. Tesfaye Hirpessa Geleta, a 42-year old community volunteer, thought that his cousin, Beyera Guta (pictured), might have TB. Beyera had been taking antibiotics and some “special honey” for one month before being diagnosed with TB. He thought he just had a cold. Thanks to Hirpessa’s training, Beyera was referred to a health centre for diagnosis and then treated for TB during six months. He has now returned to working as a farmer and supporting his five children. WHO/N. Tesfaye Despite considerable achievements in tackling TB over the last decade, Ethiopia continues to have a high burden of TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). ALERT hospital in Addis Ababa is one of the 40 health centres in the country with the capacity to diagnose and treat MDR-TB. ALERT’s MDR-TB unit was renovated in 2001 with support from the Ethiopian government and the US Agency for International Development (TB CARE programme). The rapid Xpert MTB/RIF® test (pictured on right) is used to detect TB and drug-resistant TB. Ethiopia plans to expand the number of centres that diagnose MDR-TB nationwide. WHO/N. Tesfaye Bethlehem Mekonin, a 25-year old patient with multidrug-resistant TB, at ALERT hospital in Addis Ababa. Bethlehem, who has one-year old twins, was sick for six months before seeking treatment for MDR-TB at the hospital. Her husband, who was a long distance truck driver, had MDR-TB. He lost his job while he was on treatment and the couple separated as a result. Bethlehem now lives with her mother and children. But she is scared that her kids will not recognize her when she returns home from the hospital. She has been at the hospital for one month and is getting better. She looks forward to finding a job when she returns to her community. Ethiopia is scaling up community-based health insurance schemes so that people working in the informal sector, like Bethlehem’s husband, can access quality health care without financial hardship should they fall ill. WHO/N. Tesfaye Alemnesh Birhanu, a 27-year old patient with MDR-TB, at ALERT hospital. Alemnesh, who is not married and does not have children, contracted MDR-TB working as a bus attendant. She has been receiving treatment for three months at the hospital after having taken a sputum test at a local health centre on the outskirst of Addis Ababa. She was not aware of the difference between TB and MDR-TB before coming to ALERT. She has not been working for six months, but as a civil servant in Ethiopia she is eligible to receive a salary for a total of eight months."

          "“Such outbreaks usually occur in tropical rainforests,” explains Dr Sergio Yactayo, yellow fever focal point at WHO. “With the majority of cases reported in the capital city Luanda, the situation is more dangerous and difficult to contain because the disease can spread easily from one person to another. We are already seeing cases spread to a number of provinces outside Luanda.”",
          "Yellow fever virus is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, the most common species being Aedes aegypti – the same mosquito that spreads the Zika virus. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. A small percentage of infected people experience a second more severe phase of illness which includes high fever, jaundice and internal bleeding. At least half of severely affected patients who don’t receive treatment die within 10 to 14 days.",

          "Whilst concerted efforts are being made to stop the outbreak, there is a global vaccine shortage, with the emergency stockpile completely depleted. An additional 1.4 million doses are needed to vaccinate the population at risk in Luanda province alone.",
          "With the spread of the outbreak to other provinces in Angola and increasing numbers of imported cases reported by countries in Africa, WHO requests prioritizing vaccination of people at highest risk. WHO is in discussion with manufacturers and partners to divert shipments of vaccines for national routine immunization programmes until the emergency stockpile is replenished.",

Vaccination the key prevention measure More than 5 million people have been vaccinated against yellow fever in this campaign. Vaccination is the single most important measure for preventing yellow fever. The vaccine is safe and affordable and a single dose provides life-long immunity against the disease. Cold chain infrastructure required for vaccines The yellow fever vaccine must be stored below 32 degrees Celsius, meaning it requires a cold chain infrastructure for transport and storage. Travellers should be vaccinated Travellers to and from countries where yellow fever occurs should be vaccinated and should carry their certificate of vaccination when travelling – this may be inspected by border authorities on arrival. Here, a member of the vaccination team fills in a certificate for this woman and her children who have just been vaccinated. Global shortage of yellow fever vaccine Currently there is a global shortage of the yellow fever vaccine. WHO and partners had vaccinated 5.7 million people in Luanda against yellow fever using vaccines from the International Coordination Group emergency stockpile. This woman, who is a member of the vaccination campaign team, holds registration forms that keep track of the people who have been vaccinated in this campaign.” Yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitoes The yellow fever virus is transmitted by the bite of infected Aedes and Haemogogus mosquitoes. This garbage dump is a mosquito breeding site, and indicates the challenges of mosquito control in many urban environments. Fewer reports of new infections This vaccination campaign is already showing results within weeks, with fewer reports of new infections of yellow fever in Luanda. Vaccination coverage must reach at least 80% of the population to prevent outbreaks.",

          "Recent developments in Mexico allow many more patients like Patricia (42) to receive palliative care so that they can live their remaining time free from severe pain. However, around the world millions of patients live and die every year in extreme and preventable suffering due to lack of access to pain medicines. For those patients, this “constitutes cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”, according to the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other such conditions. The cause of this global pandemic of preventable pain is not the cost of medicines; oral morphine can be made for pennies per dose. Yet according to the International Narcotics Control Board, over 121 countries have ‘inadequate’ or ‘very inadequate’ opioid consumption to meet basic medical needs. This places an estimated 83% of the world’s population at considerable risk of pain, if they acquire common diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, HIV, chronic lung disease, and diabetes. States have a dual obligation to ensure that opioid medicines are available for medical use and also to protect populations against abuse of and dependence on them. Many countries place disproportionate emphasis on the latter, at the expense of the former. As a result of such unbalanced policies, many patients cannot access essential medicines like oral morphine and other effective analgesics. They may be inappropriately classified as ineligible, may need an appointment with a specialist, and even once they have a prescription, may be allowed to receive only a few days’ worth of morphine, which they must request in person. Other issues include a lack of training of health care providers about pain medicines, concern of patients in using them, and fear of recrimination on the part of doctors to prescribe them due to excessively strict laws. But patients do not have to live and die in pain. Patricia was admitted to hospital in November 2013 with advanced cervical cancer. In March 2016 she was transferred to palliative care services in the hospital and receives morphine to help control her pain. Although she worries about the care of her elderly parents, she is now free from pain for the first time. Just two years ago in Mexico, she would not have received such treatment as regulations were so burdensome that most doctors simply did not prescribe these medications and very few pharmacies had them in stock. But Mexico has recently made huge leaps forward. “Access to opioids has always been difficult in Mexico” , says Dr Silvia Allende, a palliative care physician in Mexico. “Morphine and other strong opioid prescriptions were limited to anesthesiologists and pain specialists who were willing to fulfill the complex requirements of the Regulatory Authority. The new regulations have resulted in an increased number of physicians who can prescribe strong opioids, a larger number of pharmacies with morphine available, and improvement in the access to opioids of patients with pain.” On the other side of the world, in India, there has been recent success in simplifying national and state regulations on controlled medicines, passed by the Parliament of India in 2013-2014. However, as with many countries, if pain relief and palliative care are to become accessible to all of India’s 1.25 billion people, individual states will need to implement these simplified regulations and - importantly - professional organisations will need to incorporate palliative care training in undergraduate medical and nursing curricula. While the preventable pain pandemic continues, WHO is providing assistance on an international level. “WHO placed morphine on its first Essential Medicines List in 1977 and considers it the gold standard in pain management and relief,” says Gilles Forte, Coordinator for Policy Access and Use at WHO. “Every country should include morphine in its national list of essential medicines and ensure its uninterrupted supply in health facilities.” Other WHO activities will help increase access to pain medications. Guidance has been issued on ensuring balance in national policies on controlled medications; clinical management guidelines for cancer pain are being updated. Furthermore, WHO works with countries to assess the requirements for increasing access to opioid analgesics. Among others, these activities will assist the development of services that can help end the preventable pain pandemic."

          "Dr Chan is visiting a hospital and clinical research centre in Recife, the capital of Pernambuco state where a significant number of pregnant women who contracted the Zika virus during pregnancy have delivered babies with microcephaly. The Professor Fernando Figueira Integral Medicine Institute (IMIP) is the National Referral Center for Mother and Child Care Programs and its outreach programmes support the health care needs of vulnerable populations in the favelas situated on the outskirts of the city.",

          "Last year, as Zika was spreading through northeastern Brazil, thousands of children with suspected microcephaly were born in the region. Though many causes of microcephaly exist, suspicion has focused on Zika because the incidence of such cases has increased in areas where the virus has taken hold. In addition, several countries, including Brazil, have increased reports of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a neurological disorder that can result in paralysis.",
          "Dr Carissa Etienne, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is also taking part in the visit, which will contribute to an ongoing assessment of the Zika virus situation and response. WHO’s Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO/PAHO) has been working closely with affected countries since May 2015, when reports of Zika virus first emerged from this part of Brazil."

As part of the inter-agency response to the flare-up, dozens of people who were in contact with two individuals who had tested positive for Ebola were isolated and placed under medical observation. With the monitoring period now over, they are breathing a sigh of relief as their lives get back to normal.",
          "Ya Marie Kanu and her daughter Abibatu Conteh, Tonkolili District, Sierra Leone WHO/S. Gborie",
          "After confirmation that a young woman in Tonkolili District died from Ebola on 12 January, Sierra Leonean health authorities, WHO and other partners rapidly identified dozens of people who had been in contact with her when she was ill and placed them under medical monitoring for 21 days, the incubation period of the virus. Just over a week later, the young woman’s aunt was confirmed positive for Ebola virus disease and immediately began treatment. Her contacts were also identified, isolated and closely observed for 21 days.",
          "For the contacts of the two women, all of whom have since been discharged from medical monitoring, those three weeks of isolation were an uneasy period of fear and uncertainty.",
          "“I had sleepless nights and worried a lot about my health and the situation for my whole family,” said Ya Marie Kanu from Magburaka Town in Tonkolili District, who was considered a high risk contact because she helped prepare the body of the index case for burial. “Now that I have been discharged, my heart feels really at rest”.",
          "Her daughter, Abibatu Conteh, said the 21 days her mother was in a voluntary quarantine facility felt like it would never end.",
          "“We thought we would not be reunited with our mother again,” said Abibatu. “We have witnessed a lot of horrors and seen how families have been devastated by the disease, so my whole family was fearful that our mother might have contracted the disease and would soon fall ill.”",
          "But Ya Marie did not fall ill. She was among over 100 contacts visited and monitored three times a day by a team of district health and emergency specialists and WHO staff. And she was one of 214 contacts, and contacts of contacts, who received a dose of the experimental Ebola vaccine as a means of containing the flare-up.",

          "On the day the contacts were discharged from isolation facilities and home quarantine, residents in and around Magburaka Town came out to celebrate and dance. Those released from quarantine, including Amadu Jalloh, the father of the young woman who died on 12 January, also received a discharge package of food and household items supplied by UNICEF, World Food Programme and Plan international.",
          "And there was another reason for celebration and relief. On 4 February, the aunt of the woman who had died was released from an Ebola treatment centre in Freetown after testing negative for Ebola virus disease twice. Her recovery triggered the start of a new 42-day countdown in Sierra Leone. On 17 March, if there are no new cases of Ebola, this latest flare-up of the virus will be declared over.",
          "“The response to this latest flare-up underscores the importance of quickly identifying contacts of a person infected with or who died from Ebola and separating them from the community in order to prevent further transmission,” says Dr Anders Nordstrom, WHO country representative in Sierra Leone. “It illustrates the capacity now in place in Sierra Leone to manage such emergencies should Ebola resurface in the future.”"

          "WHO/S. Gborie",
          "When Ebola first started spreading in West Africa, the early-warning systems that should have sounded the alarm bell failed to detect the outbreak until it was too late. That allowed the virus to spread rapidly, unhindered by fragile health systems that collapsed under its onslaught.",
          "In Sierra Leone, that early-warning system, called Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR), had existed since 2003, but was essentially dormant when Ebola hit. WHO worked with the government to revive it, adapt it for Ebola, and trained health workers across the country to use it. The effectiveness of that system in identifying and responding to cases sooner was a crucial step in helping to blunt the outbreak.",

The system works by training community health workers in all 14 districts to identify and report early symptoms of the 26 diseases, or rumours of outbreaks. Those reports are fed to the nearest public health unit, which dispatches a team to investigate.",
          "It’s already paying dividends. On 11 January 2016, the system flagged a sudden increase of watery diarhoea and vomiting in Kania, a remote village in Kambia district near the border with Guinea. Within 8 hours, a team of investigators from WHO, the Ministry of Health and the United Nations Children’s Fund was on site, making sure infection prevention measures were in place to help prevent further cases.",

Further investigation including water testing to establish the cause of the sickness and rule out cholera are underway.",
          "The IDSR training was critical to ensure prompt reporting. \"It is good that we now have the IDSR system in place to serve as a major trigger for prevention and response,\" said Dr Foday Sesay, Kambia’s District Medical Officer. \"The ongoing investigation of the suspected cases, planning and preparedness that are happening were triggered because our health workers at the facility level were able to detect an unusual event, which if they had missed could have derailed our health gains,\" Dr Sesay said.",

          "More than 70% of clinics and hospitals are now reporting on time on all 26 diseases. The system is now being used to track maternal mortality, for which Sierra Leone has the world’s highest rate and where under-reporting has historically been the norm. Almost 3000 women die during childbirth every year, or about 50 a week. About 4 deaths a week are currently being reported through the IDSR system. While there is work to do to close that gap, it’s a vast improvement on the system that existed before Ebola, and which only concentrated on communicable diseases.

          "The rise in the spread of Zika virus has been accompanied by a rise in cases of microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, Zika was later identified in humans in 1952. The first large outbreak of disease caused by Zika infection was reported from the Island of Yap in 2007. There are currently several countries experiencing Zika virus outbreaks. Zika: The origin and spread of a mosquito-borne virus The following article summarizes the spread of Zika infection from the earliest discovery in 1947 to 7 February 2016. 1947: Scientists conducting routine surveillance for yellow fever in the Zika forest of Uganda isolate the Zika virus in samples taken from a captive, sentinel rhesus monkey. 1948: The virus is recovered from the mosquito Aedes africanus, caught on a tree platform in the Zika forest. 1952: The first human cases are detected in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania in a study demonstrating the presence of neutralizing antibodies to Zika virus in sera. 1969–1983: The known geographical distribution of Zika expands to equatorial Asia, including India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan, where the virus is detected in mosquitos. As in Africa, sporadic human cases occur but no outbreaks are detected and the disease in humans continues to be regarded as rare, with mild symptoms. 2007: Zika spreads from Africa and Asia to cause the first large outbreak in humans on the Pacific island of Yap, in the Federated States of Micronesia. Prior to this event, no outbreaks and only 14 cases of human Zika virus disease had been documented worldwide. 2013–2014: The virus causes outbreaks in four other groups of Pacific islands: French Polynesia, Easter Island, the Cook Islands, and New Caledonia.26,27 The outbreak in French Polynesia, generating thousands of suspected infections, is intensively investigated. The results of retrospective investigations are reported to WHO on 24 November 2015 and 27 January 2016. 2 March 2015: Brazil notifies WHO of reports of an illness characterized by skin rash in northeastern states. From February 2015 to 29 April 2015, nearly 7000 cases of illness with skin rash are reported in these states. All cases are mild, with no reported deaths. Zika was not suspected at this stage, and no tests for Zika were carried out. 1 February 2016: WHO declares that the recent association of Zika infection with clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. ----------------------------------------------- The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the World Health Organization concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

          "But the 28-year-old, whose mother died from advanced (late stage) breast cancer several years ago, had to make some tough choices before her care started in 2011.",
          "Abish was working outside of Mexico as an au pair, when she was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer, and had to return home to receive the treatment needed.",
          "“I had no option but to return to Mexico, where free public health insurance (called Seguro Popular) ensures all women diagnosed with breast cancer can be treated with no out-of-pocket expense,” says Abish, who underwent extensive surgery and chemotherapy.",
          "While many nations cannot afford expensive cancer medicines, Mexico is an example of a middle-income country that has taken major structural steps to give sustainable access to treatment for people diagnosed with breast and other forms of cancer. It has done this by reforming and consolidating their procurement policies to achieve price reductions for essential medicines.",
          "The example of Mexico is one that WHO is striving to see emulated globally through implementation of the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines as part of a broader approach to strengthening national health systems.",
          "WHO’s Dr Nicola Magrini explains that the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines is not just about drugs, like ensuring that no one is denied health care because they cannot afford to pay for it, guaranteeing access to medicines is key to moving towards universal health coverage and strengthening national health systems. For high-priced medicines, this means policies and practices to substantially reduce costs so they become affordable for the health system."

          "Mexico launched its Seguro Popular health system in 2003, beginning with treatment for paediatric cancer and expanding later to others, including breast cancer. It has been following the WHO Essential Medicines List during this time. “Today, we cover the most common cancers such as cervical, colorectal, lymphomas, prostate cancer, testicular cancer and ovarian cancer (germinal), and for children all types of cancer,” says Dr Abelardo Meneses, Director of Mexico’s National Cancer Institute. “With this programme, we have helped thousands of people receive cancer treatment, most with low incomes who, in other circumstances, would not have been able to afford the care.”",
          "In Abish's case, where there is a family history of breast cancer, early detection and recommended treatment practices can lead to high cure rates.",
          "“When I go to sleep, I think ‘why me, why am I alive, why don’t others have the opportunity I received?’,” says Ms Romero, who has just completed her Masters of Public Health, and has become a strong advocate for access to care for people living with cancer. “I believe everyone should have access to treatment and life goals, and I think health systems should help them as Mexico’s helped me.”"

          "Surgical site infections (SSI) are the most frequent type of infection acquired during health care delivery in developing countries. Infections are also the most frequent complication following surgery to occur across Africa. Preventing SSIs is very complex, since the problem results from a number of factors affecting the patient’s entire surgical journey, including after hospital discharge. However, as with other HAIs, SSIs are largely avoidable. To make progress in reducing SSIs, surgical and infection prevention and\r\n control teams in five hospitals in Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe \r\nimplemented the Surgical Unit-based Safety Programme (SUSP) from July \r\n2013 to December 2015. Supported by WHO and the Johns Hopkins Armstrong \r\nInstitute for Patient Safety and Quality (Baltimore, USA), these teams \r\nimplemented a multimodal intervention consisting of implementing or \r\nstrengthening multiple SSI prevention measures combined with an adaptive\r\n approach (the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program) aimed at \r\nfacilitating the adoption of these measures and the promotion of a wider\r\n patient safety culture. The prevention measures identified by local \r\nteams according to risk assessment were: preoperative patient bathing; avoiding hair removal or performing this with clippers as opposed to shaving; appropriate surgical hand preparation; appropriate patient skin preparation; optimal antibiotic prophylaxis; and improving discipline in the operating room. Implementation of this strategy, including SSI surveillance, proved to be feasible in these settings with limited resources, apart from one hospital where the programme was discontinued for specific reasons. Most importantly, the strategy was very successful at improving preventive measures and reducing the risk of SSI. The SUSP results are available in this Lancet Infectious Diseases article. The success of SUSP in improving clinical practice and outcomes is mainly attributable to the strong ownership of the programme by local teams, with high motivation of staff in these institutions involved, keen to improve their practices, and the influential role of project leaders across the facility. The article is dedicated to the memory of Dr Peter Ongom (SUSP lead at Mulago Hospital, Uganda, until July 2014) who passed away during the study. SUSP was funded by the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the WHO Service Delivery and Safety Department.

But medicines became very expensive in Syria – sometimes double or triple the regular price. It became impossible for me to control my diabetes. We now come to clinics like this one for treatment,” he says.",

Refugees living in communities pay the same price as non-medically insured Jordanians. Although rates are subsidized for vulnerable individuals, the costs are high for refugees such as Hammad.",

In 2012, Ghana launched its Fight Against Epilepsy Initiative, part of the WHO Programme on Reducing the Epilepsy Treatment Gap. The treatment gap was about 58% in the regions of Ghana where the pilot project was implemented. Less than four years later the treatment gap in these areas has already reduced by nearly half.",
          "On 15 –16 September 2015, Ghana’s Minister of Health, the Honorable Alex Segbefia, opened a multi-country workshop attended by more than 150 stakeholders from 17 countries by praising the Initiative’s project team. He spoke of his vision for expanding the Initiative across Ghana and beyond its borders: \"Ghana is ready to own this project and scale it up to all 10 regions of the country to improve access to quality care and services for people with epilepsy, and raise epilepsy as a priority on the national health agenda… We believe that the learning that has taken place will be replicated and scaled up in all the regions of Africa and elsewhere.”",
          "“Proper medication, proper medical attention, and a supportive environment can make a person with epilepsy live a better and more fulfilling life. ... It is my wish and prayer that together we will educate everybody on epilepsy” A person living with epilepsy in Ghana",
          "The policy-makers, experts, people living with epilepsy, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other key stakeholders who convened in Accra, discussed the project’s achievements. Participants viewed the WHO film, Ghana: treating and defeating epilepsy, which gave further insight into the development of successful non-specialist community-based epilepsy health-care packages. The workshop provided an important platform for deliberations on how continuing challenges in epilepsy care can be overcome in the African Region.",
          "These included the prioritization of epilepsy in health budgets, improving access to diagnosis and treatment at the community level, making anti-epileptic medications available and accessible, and reducing stigma and discrimination. In accordance with the Sixty-eight World Health Assembly‘s 20 recommendations, workshop participants successfully formulated approaches for scaling up Ghana’s project nationally, as well as a framework for advancing epilepsy care across the WHO African Region.",
          "In addition to engaging in policy dialogue, participants listened to the perspectives of people living with epilepsy, NGOs and other community members, with the aim of understanding the needs of people living in communities and how these needs can be addressed. “Proper medication, proper medical attention, and a supportive environment can make a person with epilepsy live a better and more fulfilling life. ... It is my wish and prayer that together we will educate everybody on epilepsy” concluded Francesca Aba Larbie, a person living with epilepsy in Ghana",
