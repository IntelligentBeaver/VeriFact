        "Every year, millions of people are affected by emergencies such as armed conflicts and natural disasters. These crises disrupt families, livelihoods and essential services, and significantly impact mental health. Nearly all those affected experience psychological distress. A minority go on to develop mental health conditions such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "Emergencies can worsen mental health conditions and social issues such as poverty and discrimination. They can also contribute to new problems, such as family separation and harmful substance use.",
        "International guidelines recommend various activities for providing mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) during emergencies, ranging from community self-help and communications to psychological first aid and clinical mental health care. Preparedness and integration with disaster risk reduction are essential to mitigate impacts. Countries can also use emergencies as opportunities to invest in mental health, leveraging the increased aid and attention they receive to develop better care systems for the long term."
