        "More than 30 different bacteria, viruses and parasites are known to be transmitted through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex. Some STIs can also be transmitted from mother-to-child during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding, and unsafe blood transfusion. Eight pathogens are linked to the greatest incidence of STIs. Of these, 4 are currently curable: syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. The other 4 are viral infections: hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus (HSV), HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV).",
        "In addition, emerging outbreaks of new infections that can be acquired by sexual contact such as mpox, Shigella sonnei , Neisseria meningitidis , Ebola and Zika, as well as re-emergence of neglected STIs such as lymphogranuloma venereum. These herald increasing challenges in the provision of adequate services for STIs prevention and control."

In 2020, WHO estimated 374 million new infections with 1 of 4 STIs: chlamydia (129 million), gonorrhoea (82 million), syphilis (7.1 million) and trichomoniasis (156 million). More than 520 million people were estimated to be living with genital herpes in 2020, and an estimated 300 million women have an HPV infection, the primary cause of cervical cancer and anal cancer among men who have sex with men. In addition, updated WHO estimates that 254 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B in 2022.",

        "When used correctly and consistently, condoms offer one of the most effective methods of protection against STIs, including HIV. Although highly effective, condoms do not offer protection for STIs that cause extra-genital ulcers (i.e., syphilis or genital herpes). When possible, condoms should be used in all vaginal, oral and anal sex.",
        "Safe and highly effective vaccines are available for 2 viral STIs: hepatitis B and HPV. These vaccines have represented major advances in STI prevention. To eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem globally, high coverage targets for HPV vaccination, screening and treatment of precancerous lesions, and management of cancer must be reached by 2030 and maintained at this high level for decades.",
        "The development of vaccines against STIs are a major priority to control STIs worldwide. Currently there is mounting evidence suggesting that the vaccine to prevent meningitis (MenB) provides some cross-protection against gonorrhoea. WHO is closely monitoring the results of ongoing studies to gather evidence. Vaccine candidates against herpes simplex virus, chlamydia and gonorrhoea are in early clinical development, while those against syphilis and trichomoniasis are still in the pre-clinical phase.",
        "WHO is currently working on recommendations for the use of doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (also known as Doxy-PEP) for selected bacterial STIs for some populations at higher risk of infection. Other biomedical interventions to prevent some STIs include adult voluntary medical male circumcision, microbicides, and partner treatment.",
        "Diagnosis of STIs",
        "STIs are often asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they can be non-specific.",
        "Accurate diagnostic tests for STIs (using molecular technology) are widely used in high-income countries. These are especially useful for the diagnosis of asymptomatic infections. However, they are largely unavailable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for chlamydia and gonorrhoea. Even in countries where testing is available, it is often expensive and not widely accessible. In addition, the time it takes for results to be received is often long. As a result, follow-up can be impeded and care or treatment can be incomplete.",
        "On the other hand, inexpensive, rapid tests are available for syphilis, hepatitis B and HIV. The rapid syphilis test and rapid dual HIV/syphilis tests are used in many resource-limited settings.",
        "Several other rapid tests are under development and have the potential to improve STI diagnosis and treatment, especially in resource-limited settings.",

      "content": [
        "LMICs rely on identifying consistent, easily recognizable signs and symptoms to guide treatment, without the use of laboratory tests. This approach – syndromic management – often relies on clinical algorithms and allows health workers to diagnose\r\n    a specific infection based on observed syndromes (e.g., vaginal/urethral discharge, anogenital ulcers, etc). Syndromic management is simple, assures rapid, same-day treatment, and avoids expensive or unavailable diagnostic tests for patients with symptoms. However, this approach results in overtreatment and missed treatment as\r\n    the majority of STIs are asymptomatic. Thus, WHO recommends countries to enhance syndromic management by gradually incorporating laboratory testing to support diagnosis. In settings where quality assured molecular assays are available, it is recommended to treat STIs such as gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Candida albicans , bacterial vaginosis and human papillomavirus (anogenital warts) , based on laboratory tests and with the most updated treatment evidence-based regimens. Moreover, STI screening strategies are essential for those at higher risk of infection, such sex workers, men who have sex with men, adolescents in some high-burden settings and pregnant women.",
