      "heading": "Mode of action",
      "content": "Emergency contraceptive pills prevent pregnancy by preventing or delaying ovulation and they do not induce an abortion. The copper-bearing IUD prevents fertilization by causing a chemical change in sperm and egg before they meet. Emergency contraception cannot interrupt an established pregnancy or harm a developing embryo."

If a copper IUD is used for emergency contraception, no additional contraceptive protection is needed. Following administration of ECPs with levonorgestrel (LNG) or combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs), women or girls may resume their contraceptive method, or start any contraceptive method immediately, including a copper-bearing IUD. Following use of ECPs with ulipristal acetate (UPA), women or girls may resume or start any progestogen containing method (either combined hormonal contraception or progestogen only contraceptives) on the 6th day after taking UPA. They can have an LNG-IUD inserted immediately if it can be determined they are not pregnant. They can have the copper IUD inserted immediately."

Studies have shown that ECPs with LNG had a pregnancy rate of 1.2% to 2.1% (1) (2) . Ideally, ECPs with UPA, ECPs with LNG or COCs should be taken as early as possible after unprotected intercourse, within 120 hours. ECPs with UPA are more effective between 72–120 hours after unprotected intercourse than other ECPs."

      "heading": "Safety",
      "content": "Side effects from the use of ECPs are similar to those of oral contraceptive pills, such as nausea and vomiting, slight irregular vaginal bleeding, and fatigue. Side effects are not common, they are mild, and will normally resolve without further medications. If vomiting occurs within 2 hours of taking a dose, the dose should be repeated. ECPs with LNG or with UPA are preferable to COCs because they cause less nausea and vomiting. Routine use of anti-emetics before taking ECPs is not recommended. Drugs used for emergency contraception do not harm future fertility. There is no delay in the return to fertility after taking ECPs."

Some women, however, use ECPs repeatedly for any of the reasons stated above, or as their main method of contraception. In such situations, further counselling needs to be given on what other and more regular contraceptive options may be more appropriate and more effective. Frequent and repeated ECP use may be harmful for women with conditions classified as medical eligibility criteria (MEC) category 2, 3,or 4 for combined hormonal contraception or Progestin-only contraceptives (POC). Frequent use of emergency contraception can result in increased side-effects, such as menstrual irregularities, although their repeated use poses no known health risks. Emergency contraceptive pills were found to be less effective in obese women (whose body mass index is more than 30 kg/m2), but there are no safety concerns. Obese women should not be denied access to emergency contraception when they need it. Counselling for use of emergency contraceptive pills should include options for using regular contraception and advice on how to use methods correctly in case of perceived method failure."

Once inserted, women can continue to use the IUD as an ongoing method of contraception, or may choose to change to another contraceptive method."

      "content": "A copper-bearing IUD is a safe form of emergency contraception. It is estimated that there may be less than 2 cases of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) per 1000 users (3) . (FP Global Handbook). The risks of expulsion or perforation are low."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Medical eligibility criteria",
      "content": "Eligibility criteria for general use of a copper IUD also apply for use of a copper IUD for emergency purposes. Women with a condition classified as MEC category 3 or 4 (for example, with current PID, puerperal sepsis, unexplained vaginal bleeding, cervical cancer, or severe thrombocytopenia) for the copper IUD should not use a copper IUD for emergency purposes. In addition, a copper-bearing IUD should not be inserted for emergency contraception following sexual assault as the woman may be at high risk of a sexually transmitted infection such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. A copper-bearing IUD should not be used as emergency contraception when a woman is already pregnant. The WHO Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use states that IUD insertion may further increase the risk of PID among women at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), although limited evidence suggests that this risk if low. Current algorithms for determining increased risk of STIs have poor predictive value. Risk of STIs varies by individual behaviour and local STI prevalence. Therefore, while many women at increased risk of STIs can generally have an IUD inserted, some women at a very high likelihood of STIs should generally not have an IUD inserted until appropriate testing and treatment occur.",

Moreover, emergency contraception should be integrated into health care services for populations most at risk of exposure to unprotected sex, including post-sexual assault care and services for women and girls living in emergency and humanitarian settings.
