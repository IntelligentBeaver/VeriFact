      "content": "Health-care activities protect and restore health and save lives. But what about the waste and by-products they generate? Of the total amount of waste generated by health-care activities, about 85% is general, non-hazardous waste comparable to domestic waste. The remaining 15% is considered hazardous material that may be infectious, chemical or radioactive. Measures to ensure the safe and environmentally sound management of health care wastes can prevent adverse health and environmental impacts from such waste including the unintended release of chemical or biological hazards."

      "heading": "Types of waste",
      "content": "Waste and by-products cover a diverse range of materials, including: The major sources of health-care waste are: High-income countries generate on average up to 0.5 kg of hazardous waste per hospital bed per day, while low-income countries generate on average 0.2 kg. However, health-care waste is often not separated into hazardous or non-hazardous wastes in low-income countries making the real quantity of hazardous waste much higher.",

      "heading": "Sharps-related",
      "content": "Worldwide, an estimated 16 billion injections are administered every year. Not all needles and syringes are disposed of safely, creating a risk of injury and infection and opportunities for reuse. Injections with contaminated needles and syringes in low- and middle-income countries have reduced substantially in recent years, partly due to efforts to reduce reuse of injection devices. Despite this progress, in 2010, unsafe injections were still responsible for as many as 33 800 new HIV infections, 1.7 million hepatitis B infections and 315 000 hepatitis C infections (1) . A person who experiences one needle stick injury from a needle used on an infected source patient has risks of 30%, 1.8%, and 0.3% respectively of becoming infected with HBV, HCV and HIV. Additional hazards occur from scavenging at waste disposal sites and during the handling and manual sorting of hazardous waste from health-care facilities. These practices are common in many regions of the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The waste handlers are at immediate risk of needle-stick injuries and exposure to toxic or infectious materials. According to WHO/UNICEF , in 2021, only 61% of hospitals had basic health-care waste services. The situation is far worse in fragile contexts, where based on 2023 data, only 25% of health facilities had basic health care waste management services (2) ."

        "The disposal of untreated health care wastes in landfills can lead to the contamination of drinking, surface, and ground waters if those landfills are not properly constructed.",
        "Minimization of health care waste should be a priority. This will significantly reduce the amount of waste that needs to be handled and treated. Waste minimization actions include green procurement and selecting products where shipping is minimized and with less and ecological packaging, switching to re-usables when safe and viable, only ordering/receiving pharmaceuticals based on documented need, and recycling common items including plastic, paper and cardboard.",
        "The treatment of health care wastes with chemical disinfectants can result in the release of chemical substances into the environment if those substances are not handled, stored and disposed in an environmentally sound manner.",
        "Incineration of waste is widely practised, but inadequate incineration or the incineration of unsuitable materials results in the release of pollutants into the air and in the generation of ash residue. Incinerated materials containing or treated with chlorine can generate dioxins and furans, which are human carcinogens and have been associated with a range of adverse health effects. Incineration of heavy metals or materials with high metal content (in particular lead, mercury and cadmium) can lead to the spread of toxic metals in the environment.",
        "Only modern incinerators operating at 850–1100 °C and fitted with special gas-cleaning equipment are able to comply with the international emission standards for dioxins and furans.",
        "Alternatives to incineration such as autoclaving, microwaving, steam treatment integrated with internal mixing, which minimize the formation and release of chemicals or hazardous emissions should be given consideration in settings where there are sufficient resources to operate and maintain such systems and dispose of the treated waste."

      "content": "Several reasons exist for inadequate health care waste services. These include limited legal frameworks (e.g. policies, regulation, guidelines), lack of awareness about the health hazards related to health-care waste, inadequate training in proper waste management, absence of waste management and disposal systems, insufficient financial and human resources and the low priority. Many countries either do not have appropriate regulations, or do not monitor and enforce them."

      "content": "WHO developed the first global and comprehensive guidance document, Safe management of wastes from health-care activities , now in its second edition and more recently a short guide that summarizes the key elements as well as guidance on selecting technologies The guide addresses the regulatory framework, planning, waste minimization and recycling, handling, storage and transportation, treatment and disposal options, and training. The document is aimed at health-care facility managers, policy makers, public health professionals and waste experts. In addition, as part of monitoring Sustainable Development Goal 6 on safely managed water and sanitation, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme regularly publishes data and reports on safe management of health care waste in health care facilities. Finally, WHO, UNICEF and partners are working to strengthen safe and sustainable health care waste practices through wider efforts focused on WASH, waste and electricity in health care facilities. This work is closely linked to the work on climate resilient and environmentally sustainable health systems for which health care waste is a critical element. In particular WHO guidance on climate resilient and environmentally sustainable health care facilities provides technical recommendations on how to improve the environmentally sustainability of waste management systems while safeguarding human health.
