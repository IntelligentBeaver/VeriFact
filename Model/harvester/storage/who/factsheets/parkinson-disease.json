        "The cause of PD is unknown but people with a family history of the disease have a higher risk. Exposure to air pollution, pesticides and solvents may increase risk."

        "While PD is the most common movement disorder, other movement disorders exist such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, chorea, ataxia and dystonia. Some movement disorders have similar symptoms to PD such as tremor, slow movement and rigidity. All movement disorders share the same challenges as PD regarding diagnostic and treatment gaps and access to medication, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC)."

Assessment and management of PD by trained non-specialized healthcare workers in primary care is particularly important in areas where specialist neurological services are unavailable, such as in some LMIC.",
        "The prevalence of PD has doubled in the past 25 years. Global estimates in 2019 showed over 8.5 million individuals with PD. Current estimates suggest that, in 2019, PD resulted in 5.8 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs), an increase of 81% since 2000, and caused 329 000 deaths, an increase of over 100% since 2000."

Physical, emotional and financial pressures can cause great stress to families and carers, and support is required from the health, social, financial and legal systems. Useful support resources from other conditions can be drawn upon, such as WHO’s iSupport programme for dementia ."

A common barrier is created by healthcare providers’ inadequate knowledge and understanding of PD and myths that PD is a contagious illness or a normal part of aging."

This includes raising policy prioritization and strengthening governance, providing effective, timely and responsive diagnosis, treatment and care, implementing strategies for promotion and prevention, fostering research and innovation and strengthening information systems.",
