        "Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia contribute significantly to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.",
        "Hypertensive disorders are responsible for around 16% of maternal deaths globally, in 2023 this was the equivalent to around 42 000 deaths (2, 3) .",
        "In women with pre-eclampsia magnesium sulfate injections can be given to reduce the risk of eclampsia by more than half. Despite the availability of magnesium sulfate, its use is still limited in many low-resource settings."

      "heading": "Overview",
      "content": "Pre-eclampsia is a high blood pressure disorder that typically develops after 20 weeks into pregnancy. It can present serious risks to both mother and baby. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent progression to eclampsia, which involves seizures. Both conditions can be life-threatening."

      "heading": "Diagnosis",
      "content": "Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed based on the onset of hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg) proteinuria (protein in the urine) (≥0.3 g/24 hours) after 20 weeks of gestation. Severe pre-eclampsia may include symptoms such as severe headaches, visual disturbances and upper abdominal pain."

      "content": "Several factors can increase the risk of developing pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. Understanding these risk factors is essential for proactive monitoring and management. Having a risk factor doesn't always mean pre-eclampsia will occur, but closer medical supervision beyond routine screening is recommended. Several factors can increase the risk of developing pre-eclampsia, including:",
