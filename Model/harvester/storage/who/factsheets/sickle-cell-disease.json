            "Sickle-cell disease is a serious inherited blood disorder caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, leading to abnormal, sickle-shaped red blood cells that block blood flow and cause severe health complications.",
            "In 2021, an estimated 7.74 million people were living with sickle-cell disease globally, with 515 000 new births, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for nearly 80% of global cases.",
            "Sickle-cell disease causes substantial under-5 mortality: 81 100 deaths in 2021, making it the 12th leading cause of death in this age group when considering the total mortality burden.",
            "Traditional mortality recording underestimates sickle-cell disease impact – actual deaths are 11 times higher than cause-specific statistics suggest (376 000 vs 34 400 deaths in 2021).",
            "Common complications include acute pain crises, anaemia, stroke, infections, kidney failure, and pregnancy-related risks.",
            "Effective interventions exist, including disease modifying agents such as hydroxyurea and vaccinations to prevent infection.",
            "Urgent action is needed to integrate sickle-cell disease care into primary health systems and ensure access to essential medicines."

      "content": [
        "Sickle-cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects haemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen. The disease causes red blood cells to become rigid and sickle-shaped, leading to blockages in blood flow and subsequent pain and organ damage. SCD is most common in individuals of African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian descent. The disease manifests in various forms, with sickle-cell anaemia being the most severe. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing the disease and preventing complications. Treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms and preventing crises, with advanced therapies like gene therapy offering hope for a cure."

    {
      "heading": "Causes and risk factors",
      "content": [
        "SCD is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which provides instructions for making haemoglobin. This mutation leads to the production of abnormal haemoglobin known as haemoglobin S. When a person inherits two copies of the haemoglobin S gene (one from each parent), they develop SCD. Individuals with one normal haemoglobin gene and one haemoglobin S gene have sickle-cell trait (SCT) and usually do not exhibit symptoms but can pass the gene to their offspring."
