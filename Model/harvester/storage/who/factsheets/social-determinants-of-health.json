        "The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age, and the wider forces that shape the conditions of daily life. Most of our health is determined by these non-medical root causes of ill health, which include quality education, access to nutritious food, and decent housing and working conditions.",
        "Wider forces include economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies and political systems. Social determinants of health matter because addressing them not only helps prevents illness but also promotes healthy lives and equity.",
        "Health follows a social gradient whereby the more deprived the area in which people live, the lower their income, the fewer their years of education, the worse their health and the fewer healthy years they can expect to live.",
        "Governance processes need to ensure that policies and systems are developed and implemented to ensure everyone can realize the conditions needed for a healthy and decent life."

            "Income inequality within countries has almost doubled over the past two decades, and is now even greater than the significant inequality observed between countries (3) , acting as a major driver of health inequity (4) . In 201 countries, the top 10% of individuals earn on average 15 times more that the bottom 50% (3) .",
            "Weak taxation systems result in inadequate resources for universal public services, depriving 3.8 billion people worldwide of social protection coverage, such as child and paid sick leave benefits, which improve health (5) .",
            "Structural discrimination, such as intersecting racism and gender inequality, results in 2.4 billion women of working age lacking equal economic opportunities (6) , impacting the health of them and their families.",
            "The debt burden of the world’s poorest countries pulls them further away from being able to fund essential investments in social determinants of health equity. The total value of interest payments made by the world’s 75 poorest countries has quadrupled over the past decade (7) .",
            "Climate change has direct health impacts and damages the social determinants of health and livelihoods unequally. People with the lowest incomes more often depend on resources provided by nature. In low income countries, girls and women often have responsibility for water and fuel collection, and are required to travel further to obtain resources (8) .",
            "Forced displacement driven by conflict, climate change and food insecurity affect the poorest and most marginalized. Between 2008 and 2024, the number of forcibly displaced people has tripled to 122 million (9) . In host countries, migrants often face service inequalities, discrimination and the loss of family support systems which negatively impact on physical and mental health."
