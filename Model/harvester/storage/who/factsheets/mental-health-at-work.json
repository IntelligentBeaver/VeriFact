These workers often operate in unsafe working environments, work long hours, have little or no access to social or financial\r\n    protections and face discrimination, all of which can undermine mental health.",
        "Although psychosocial risks can be found in all sectors, some workers are more likely to be exposed to them than others, because of what they do or where and how they work. Health, humanitarian or emergency workers often have jobs that carry an elevated\r\n    risk of exposure to adverse events, which can negatively impact mental health.",
        "Economic recessions or humanitarian and public health emergencies elicit risks such as job loss, financial instability, reduced employment opportunities or increased unemployment.",
        "Work can be a setting which amplifies wider issues that negatively affect mental health, including discrimination and inequality based on factors such as, race, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, social origin, migrant status, religion\r\n    or age.",
        "People with severe mental health conditions are more likely to be excluded from employment, and when in employment, they are more likely to experience inequality at work. Being out of work also poses a risk to mental health. Unemployment, job and financial\r\n    insecurity, and recent job loss are risk factors for suicide attempts."
