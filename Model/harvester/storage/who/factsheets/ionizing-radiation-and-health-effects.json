        "Ionizing radiation is a type of energy released by atoms in the form of electromagnetic waves or particles.",
        "People are exposed to natural sources of ionizing radiation, such as in soil, water, and vegetation, as well as in human-made sources, such as x-rays in medical devices.",
        "Ionizing radiation has many beneficial applications, including uses in medicine, industry, agriculture and research.",
        "As the use of ionizing radiation increases, so does the potential for health hazards if not properly used or contained.",
        "Acute health effects such as skin burns or acute radiation syndrome can occur when doses of radiation exceed very high levels.",
        "Low doses of ionizing radiation can increase the risk of longer term effects such as cancer."

      "heading": "What is ionizing radiation?",
      "content": "Ionizing radiation is a type of energy released by atoms that travels in the form of electromagnetic waves (gamma or X-rays) or particles (neutrons, beta or alpha). The spontaneous disintegration of atoms is called radioactivity, and the excess energy emitted is a form of ionizing radiation. Unstable elements which disintegrate and emit ionizing radiation are called radionuclides."

      "heading": "Health effects of ionizing radiation",
      "content": "Radiation damage to tissue and/or organs depends on the dose of radiation received, or the absorbed dose which is expressed in a unit called the gray (Gy). The potential damage from an absorbed dose depends on the type of radiation and the sensitivity of the different tissues and organs."
