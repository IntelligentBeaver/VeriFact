MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using other drugs, which tend to be more expensive and with more side effects. People exposed to MDR-TB may receive TB preventive treatment with levofloxacin.",

        "In 2022, new WHO guidelines prioritized a short 6-month all-oral regimen known as BPaLM/BPaL as a treatment of choice for eligible patients. Globally in 2024, approximately 34 000 people with MDR/RR-TB were reported to have started treatment on the 6-month shorter regimens (known as BPaLM and BDLLfxC), a substantial increase from 5653 in 2023 and 1744 in 2022. The shorter duration, lower pill burden and high efficacy of this novel regimen can help ease the burden on health systems and save precious resources to further expand the diagnostic and treatment coverage for all individuals in need. WHO recommends expanded access to all-oral regimens."

The percentage of people who fell ill with TB and had a documented HIV test result was 82% in 2024. This was a slight increase from 81% in 2023. The WHO African Region has the highest burden of HIV-associated TB. Globally in 2024, only 61% of the estimated number of people  living with HIV who developed TB received antiretroviral therapy (ART).",

These activities include  bidirectional screening, prevention and treatment of infection and disease. Scale-up of TB treatment and ART since 2005 is estimated to have averted 9.8 million deaths."

In 2024, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in the WHO South-East Asia Region (34%), followed by the Western Pacific Region (27%) and the African Region (25%). Around 87% of new TB cases occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries, with two-thirds of the global total in India (25%), Indonesia (10%), the Philippines (6.8%), China (6.5%), Pakistan (6.3%), Nigeria (4.8%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (3.9%) and Bangladesh (3.6%). The top five countries accounted for 55% of the global total.",

This is far from the target of the WHO End TB Strategy of zero. Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, undernutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco have a higher risk of falling ill. Globally in 2024, there were an estimated 0.97 million new TB cases that were attributable to undernutrition, 0.93 million to diabetes, 0.74 million to alcohol use disorders, 0.70 million to smoking and 0.57 million to HIV infection."

Financing for TB research and innovation, at US$ 1.2 billion in 2023, also continues to fall far short of the global target of US$ 5 billion per year. Progress to date  has been constrained by the overall level of investment."
