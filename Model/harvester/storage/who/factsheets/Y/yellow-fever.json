      "heading": "Overview",
      "content": "Yellow fever is an epidemic-prone, vaccine-preventable disease caused by a virus transmitted by infected Aedes s.p. , Haemagogus s.p. and Sabethes s.p. mosquitoes. These mosquitoes breed in domestic, forest (sylvatic), and semi-domestic environments. Due to its high-impact and potential for international spread, yellow fever poses a significant threat to global health security."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Symptoms",
      "content": "The initial symptoms of yellow fever are fever, headache, general body aches, nausea, vomiting and weakness. These symptoms typically disappear within 3–4 days. About 15% of people infected with yellow fever will have severe infection. Symptoms are the recurrence of high fever, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), vomiting, bleeding (of the mouth, nose, eyes and stomach), organ failure and shock. About 50% of patients in this phase die within 7–10 days. The incubation period for yellow fever is 3–6 days."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Treatment",
      "content": "There is no specific anti-viral treatment. Clinical care remains mostly supportive, with the 2025 clinical management guidelines providing a protocolized approach. The two anti-virals that can be given , sofosbuvir and monoclonal antibody TY014, are recommended exclusively in research settings(3). Supportive care includes rest and hydration; management of liver and kidney failure, and fever; and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections. Patients may be managed at home, hospitalized, or referred for emergency care depending on severity. Jaundice is an indication of severe disease, justifying hospitalization, often in an intensive care unit."

    {
      "heading": "Diagnosis",
      "content": "Diagnosis is challenging, especially early on when clinical manifestations are nonspecific. Severe cases may resemble malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis, other haemorrhagic fevers such as dengue, and poisoning. Diagnosis is carried out as follows:",
      "bullets": [
        "in the early stage: by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing of blood; and",
        "in the later stage: by antibody detection via ELISA or plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) testing of blood."

      "heading": "Vaccination",
      "content": "Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure. A single dose provides lifelong immunity and no booster is needed. Immunity develops in for 80–100% of people within 10 days, and in over 99% within 30 days. Side-effects are rare. Vaccination is not recommended for: Above 60 years, careful consideration should be given to the vaccination risk-benefit ratio (4).

    {
      "heading": "Epidemic preparedness, surveillance and response",
      "content": "Rapid detection and laboratory confirmation, as well as emergency vaccination, are critical to control outbreaks. In outbreaks, WHO estimates that actual cases may be 10 to 250 times higher than reported. High-risk countries should maintain at least one national laboratory for yellow fever testing. Any confirmed case must be investigated and followed by emergency and long-term immunization measures. During outbreaks, there is a risk of yellow fever exportation to countries with lower transmission risk. Strengthening risk awareness, early detection, and response is essential to prevent local transmission."

      "content": "The Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy is a comprehensive and long-term strategy built on lessons learned from urban outbreaks in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  It aims to end yellow fever epidemics by the end of 2026. The EYE strategy is steered by Gavi, UNICEF and WHO, with WHO hosting the global Secretariat of the partnership. It was developed by a coalition of partners to face yellow fever’s changing epidemiology, resurgence of mosquitoes, and the increased risk of urban outbreaks and international spread. It consists of three strategic objectives: References",
