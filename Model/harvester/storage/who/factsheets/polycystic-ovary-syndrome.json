        "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that affects women during their reproductive years and beyond, into later stages of life.",
        "PCOS occurs when inappropriate hormonal signaling leads to higher than normal androgen levels and other hormonal imbalances. As a result, women with PCOS may experience irregular or infrequent menstrual periods, pain – including pain with heavy menstrual bleeding, abnormal ovulation, changes in hair (either excessive facial or body hair or female-pattern baldness), oilier skin, acne and/or cysts in the ovaries.",
        "PCOS is a leading cause of irregular menstrual periods and one of the most common causes of infertility. Irregular or infrequent menstrual periods among women with PCOS may also raise their risk for endometrial hyperplasia and/or endometrial cancer. PCOS can start as early as during adolescence but is most commonly detected or diagnosed when women struggle to become pregnant.",
        "Further, PCOS is a chronic metabolic condition associated with heightened long-term risk for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. There is currently no cure for PCOS, but lifestyle changes, medications and fertility treatments can reduce symptoms, increase fertility rates and protect longer-term health.",
        "The cause of PCOS is unknown, but women with a family history of PCOS or type 2 diabetes are at higher risk."

        "The prevalence of PCOS may be higher among women in some racial or ethnic groups than others, and some women have higher genetic propensity for metabolic complications. However, structural racism and other social determinants of health shape the extent to which different groups of women with PCOS seek and receive quality health services."

Symptoms such as infertility, obesity and unwanted hair growth are subject to social stigma in many settings. This can affect social and family relationships, work, a sense of belonging in one’s community, mental health and other aspects of well-being."

        "This means that some women with PCOS do not have polycystic ovaries, and ovarian cysts are not required for PCOS diagnosis. Blood tests can be used to identify higher than normal levels of androgen steroids in women who do not have visible excess hair or acne or to check whether ovulation is occurring normally in women who might have PCOS but who have regular menstrual cycles. When making a PCOS diagnosis, health workers consider genetic risk factors since women with a family history of PCOS or type 2 diabetes are at higher risk of PCOS. Health workers also take life stage into account because irregular periods can be normal at either the beginning (menarche) or end (perimenopause) of the reproductive years.",
        "Women who are newly diagnosed with PCOS are recommended to have additional blood testing to evaluate for underlying insulin resistance and to assess their overall cardiovascular risk."

Seeking health care early to manage symptoms of PCOS can help women protect their health and well-being during and beyond their reproductive years.",
        "Healthy lifestyle behaviors, including healthy eating and physical activity, are important for all women with PCOS, even if they do not lead to weight loss.",
        "Combined oral contraceptive pills can help regulate the menstrual cycle and may reduce acne or excess facial and body hair. Androgen receptor blockers may also be used to treat excess hair or acne. Treatment choices should be based on shared decision-making, taking every individual’s unique values and preferences into account.",
        "Treatments for infertility due to PCOS include lifestyle changes, medicines or surgery to stimulate ovulation. In-vitro fertilization (IVF) and other assistive reproductive technologies may also be used. Women with PCOS can be supported to become pregnant but generally have higher risk of pregnancy complications that warrants additional monitoring."

WHO works with Member States and partners to address PCOS as part of its broad efforts to improve women’s health and well-being globally. WHO works with governmental and nongovernmental partners to enhance public awareness related to PCOS, and to generate guidance for health-care providers on how it can be recognized and treated.",
        "WHO supports the generation of statistics on how common infertility and its causes (such as PCOS) are. WHO also helps Member States to pay more attention to infertility and its causes within national health policies, services and financing to ensure that everyone who needs health care related to infertility is able to obtain it without financial hardship.",
