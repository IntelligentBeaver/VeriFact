      "heading": "Overview",
      "content": "Ringworm, also known as tinea, is a common fungal infection of the skin. It can affect both humans and animals. The infection is caused by fungi, known as dermatophytes, that thrive on the skin, hair, and nails. Symptoms of ringworm include itching, redness, and a characteristic ring-shaped rash. While not life threatening, ringworm can be uncomfortable. embarrassing and easily spread. It is typically treated with antifungal medications applied directly to the skin, but oral medications may be necessary for severe or widespread infections. There is a spreading outbreak of extensive and drug-resistant ringworm in many countries"

      "heading": "Scope of the problem",
      "content": "Tinea is one of the commonest dermatological conditions, accounting for a substantial proportion of skin disease in developing countries. Globally, fungal skin infections are estimated to affect more than 650 million people at any time and of these, ringworm accounts for over half the cases (1) . Ringworm is found in every country but some forms are common in resource-poor tropical settings. Prevalence of scalp infection among children in these areas may reach more than 25 % of school children under 10 (2) . Cases are sporadic in some high-income countries but may lead to outbreaks in schools. Tinea pedis infections are often endemic in heavy industries and can result in loss of work and complications due to secondary infection. There is a growing worldwide problem of ringworm or tinea extensively affecting the body, tinea corporis. First reported in India, it has spread widely in communities in South-East Asia and is now increasingly reported in the Middle East, Europe, Africa and the Americas. Many of these cases are resistant to the common antifungal medications, posing an increasing public health problem."

        "Tinea capitis (scalp ringworm) affects the scalp and can cause itching, redness and hair loss. It is mainly seen in children.",
        "Tinea corporis (body ringworm) appears on the skin as a ring-shaped rash with raised borders. It can be itchy and may spread to other parts of the body. It may also be very widespread covering large areas of the body.",
        "Tinea cruris (groin ringworm or jock itch) affects the groin and upper thighs. It is more common in adolescent and adult males and is often associated with activities leading to sweating and tight clothing.",
        "Tinea pedis (foot ringworm or athlete's foot) occurs on the feet, particularly between the toes. Symptoms include itching, burning and scaling of the skin. It can spread in workplace or public changing rooms and can be an occupational problem in some industries, e.g. mining, petroleum.",
        "Tinea unguium (nail ringworm or onychomycosis) affects the nails, causing them to become thick, discoloured and brittle. It can impair mobility in the elderly."

        "Close contact with an infected person or animal increases the risk of transmission.",
        "People with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to tinea infections which may have an atypical appearance.",
        "Athletes, especially those involved in contact sports, as well as industrial workers, are at higher risk due to shared equipment, changing rooms and close contact.",
        "Fungi thrive in warm, moist environments, such as showers, locker rooms and swimming pools.",
