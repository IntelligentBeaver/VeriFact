Morning stiffness, decreased range of motion, and other physical limitations may require you to modify your work activities and environment. Decreased ability to work can lead to financial difficulties. For the homemaker, a specific task may take much longer to accomplish. You may need the help of your spouse, a relative, or a home health care provider. As your life changes, you may feel a loss of control and become anxious about the uncertainty of what lies ahead."
