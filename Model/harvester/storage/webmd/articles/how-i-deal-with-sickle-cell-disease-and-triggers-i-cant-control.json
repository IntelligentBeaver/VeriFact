        "At this stage in life, I know my body well enough to avoid having as many sickle cell crises as I used to. I have achieved this by becoming better at avoiding my triggers for a crisis. For example, I try not to expose myself to cold weather, exhaustion, and stress. Avoiding such common aspects of modern Western life is a whole job! What has been vital for me is recognizing that I can't always avoid triggers; accepting this and focusing on my recovery has now been the focus.",

        "Sadly, it is winter now, so I'm exposed to one of my primary triggers for a crisis: cold weather. When it's cold, your veins constrict, which makes it more difficult for blood cells to pass through and increases the likelihood of a crisis. Keeping warm and staying hydrated have been my main counters to cold weather. However, there aren't perfect weather conditions where a sickle cell crisis is impossible.",
        "In the U.K., we sometimes have sudden weather changes, making avoiding a crisis difficult. For example, in August 2018 (U.K. summertime), I was hospitalized because I wasn't wearing appropriate clothing for the change in weather. It was hot that day, so I wore shorts and left my jacket at home. Then, the temperature dropped in the evening, and it started to rain. As I began to shiver, I suddenly felt a feeling I knew all too well: the exposure to the change in temperature was triggering a crisis. This could have been avoided if I had planned properly and looked out for the weather all day. On the other hand, it's not always possible to prepare for all of life's eventualities, and this is a truth I had to accept."

For example, when I have work deadlines or commitments to stick to, it's not easy to say no and give the excuse that you are tired. I have learned to analyze a vital commitment and what can be missed or explored at another time. My word is my bond, but not when my health is at stake.

I was caught in a dilemma: to risk exposing myself to my triggers by going to a concert and then flying out the next day or selling my tickets. I was worried that pushing through the fatigue would set off my potential triggers. In the end, I sold my concert tickets. Selling my tickets felt like a step away from my usual can-do, push-through-anything attitude. A less sickle cell war-hardened version of me would have done both. However, this version of me has missed a lot during crises. In this scenario, I had to rationalize and choose what I would enjoy more, as both experiences would be unique. Ultimately, the holiday was the obvious choice and the right decision for my body. Through pre-planning and rest, I could have a crisis-free trip; additionally, the concert was streamed online!"

Letting go of things that can cause stress or doing the self-work to manage stress better have been positive methods of managing stress and my overall health."
