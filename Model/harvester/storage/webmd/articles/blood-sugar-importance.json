        "If you have diabetes, you know your goal is to keep too much blood sugar, or glucose, from building up in your bloodstream. If you don’t keep your blood glucose under control, your body can react with conditions that range from fuzzy thinking to heart problems, vision loss , and kidney disease . Knowing what your blood sugar level is at all times -- and keeping your doctor in the loop, too -- is vital to your well-being. Your health care provider might want you to test as often as four to 10 times a day, which is common for type 1 diabetes. A few times a day might be enough if you have type 2 diabetes. Either way, frequent monitoring per your treatment plan gives the best possible picture of your health."

If you have a reading like this when you haven’t eaten for the last 8 or more hours, or your fasting level, it could mean you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes or have a chance of getting type 2 diabetes. But you won’t usually have symptoms until your levels reach about 180-200 mg/dL. While you might have signs of diabetes, such as unintentional weight loss, needing to urinate often, thirst, or blurry vision, they might be mild or fly under the radar. You might need blood sugar numbers to flag you. Say your blood glucose levels drop below 70 mg/dL and you have symptoms. This is hypoglycemia, and it means you need to use the right tools, such as diet, exercise, or special meds, to bring your blood sugar up. When your blood sugar drops too low and you don’t do anything to balance it, you can have trouble thinking and functioning as well as possible."
