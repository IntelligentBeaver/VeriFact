        "Vyjuvek (beremagene geperpavec-svdt) is the first topical gene therapy approved to heal wounds in adults and children with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB). DEB is a rare genetic skin condition in which a faulty COL7A1 gene affects the skin’s integrity, making it extremely fragile and prone to painful blisters, open wounds, or scarring, even with minor friction or injury.",
        "A recent FDA label update now allows Vyjuvek to be used from birth. It can also be applied at home by you or a caregiver, offering more flexibility and making treatment more convenient and easier to manage. Dressings can now be changed at the next routine change instead of waiting for the next 24 hours.",
        "Vyjuvek is a gel-based treatment made from a modified virus that delivers working copies of the COL7A1 gene directly to the skin. When applied to wounds, it helps your body make a protein called COL7, which is needed to keep the layers of your skin connected. This can help your skin heal better and stay stronger. Vyjuvek can be used multiple times, unlike most gene therapies that are given only once. This matters for DEB, which causes recurring wounds.",
        "Previously, Vyjuvek was approved only for patients aged 6 months or older, had to be applied by health care professionals, and required waiting 24 hours before changing dressings."
