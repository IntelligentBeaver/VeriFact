        "The sciatic nerve is the longest and thickest nerve in your body. It's actually a bundle of five nerves that start in your lower back and run through your buttocks and down each leg. Inflammation of the sciatic nerve is called sciatica . It can cause a burning or shooting pain in your buttocks or a pain that goes all the way down your leg. You usually have the pain only on one side.",
        "Sciatica, also known as lumbar radiculopathy, may be caused by a bone spur on your spine or a herniated disk that presses on the nerve. Most people have some small abnormalities of the spine. That's why doctors don't rely on imaging tests to diagnose sciatica. Instead, they may give you instructions for self-care and suggest exercises for you. Most of the time, these measures work.",
        "How long does sciatica last?",
        "Because sciatica pain is often intense, you might think something is seriously wrong. But about 3 out of 4 people with sciatica usually improve in a few weeks. Moving more and sitting less usually help, and you can use over-the-counter medication for pain relief.",
        "Self-care and pain medication may not be the best options if your pain lasts more than 4 months. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy , in which a therapist guides you through passive and active exercises to ease pain and prevent future back problems. Those with long-lasting pain caused by a herniated disk may get better pain relief with back surgery .",
