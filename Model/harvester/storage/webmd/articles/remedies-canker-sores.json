        "Canker sores are painful ulcers on the soft tissues of the mouth. They can develop on the tongue or gums, but are most commonly found inside the lips. They are usually red with a white or yellow center and can cause considerable discomfort while eating, drinking, and talking. Additionally, these sores cannot be spread to other people, and it is possible to have more than one at a time.",
        "Anyone can develop a canker sore , but they are most common in teens and young adults. Experts don’t know why some people experience these sores more regularly than others, although some suspect that stress, hormones, allergies, and vitamin deficiencies may play a role.",
        "Canker sores typically improve and heal on their own within a week. However, severe sores can last for several weeks. The primary goal in treating canker sores is to manage the pain and prevent infection. Over-the-counter pain relievers and oral anesthetic gels can help with the discomfort. Additionally, rinsing your mouth with saltwater or mouthwash can help speed the natural healing process."
