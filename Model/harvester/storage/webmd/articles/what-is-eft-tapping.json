        "Humans are always looking for more ways to ease stress and anxiety. Medications work well for many people, but they have drawbacks, including cost and side effects . If you're looking for an alternative solution to drug treatment or traditional talk therapy, you may benefit from Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) tapping. People who use it say that this simple technique helps them calm down quickly.",
        "In the 1970s and 1980s, several doctors began stimulating acupressure points to help people manage stress, fear, and phobias. Roger Callahan, PhD, patented one of these methods, which he called Thought Field Therapy. Later, Gary Craig simplified the process and introduced it to the public as EFT in the 1990s.",
