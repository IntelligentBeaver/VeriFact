        "Oct. 17, 2024 – People who use a standing desk for health benefits may need to re-evaluate their time spent with it.",
        "New research suggests that using a standing desk doesn’t reduce the chance of problems like heart disease or strokes, and may even boost the risk of circulatory problems, such as varicose veins or deep vein thrombosis. Ultimately, time spent stationary and not moving was linked to increased health problems.",
        "The findings were published Wednesday in the International Journal of Epidemiology . For the study, researchers didn’t specifically evaluate people who used standing desks. Instead, they analyzed data from 83,013 adults who used a wearable device that could detect their daily time spent sitting and standing for a week. The average age of the people in the study was 61 years old, and about 55% were women.",
        "The researchers then looked at the people’s health data for the next seven years and linked time spent sitting, standing, or both to how likely someone was to have heart disease, a stroke , heart failure, or circulatory problems like a potentially deadly blood clot in the leg or enlarged and twisted veins that can be uncomfortable."

But the next finding from the researchers suggests that just getting out of a chair and standing more may not be the solution. Time spent standing was linked to neither poor nor improved heart and blood vessel health, but it was linked to increased circulatory problems."
