        "COPD is a common long-term (chronic) lung disease that happens when the airways or the tiny air sacs in the lungs (called alveoli) are damaged. In some cases, both the airways and alveoli are affected. This damage makes it hard to get enough air and for oxygen to move from the alveoli into the bloodstream.",

Some people may also have wheezing. The severity of these symptoms can change day-to-day.  COPD is a progressive disease, which means that symptoms get worse over time."

This measure helps to show how easily air is able to move through a person's lungs. The researchers measured this before participants took Ohtuvayre and several times over the following 12 hours. They checked this measure at the beginning of the study and again after 12 weeks. This helped researchers compare how much Ohtuvayre improved lung function over time compared to the placebo.",
