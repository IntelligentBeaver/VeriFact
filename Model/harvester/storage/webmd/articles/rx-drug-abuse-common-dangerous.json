Athletes hope that the increased numbers of red blood cells will deliver more oxygen to muscles and improve endurance. Erythropoietin abuse can alter the body's regulation of red blood cell production. Once the drug is stopped, the number of red blood cells may drop suddenly.",

But growth hormone also comes in drug form to help children grow if their own bodies don't make enough of the hormone. Sometimes athletes abuse growth hormone in an attempt to build muscle and strength while reducing body fat. But long-term abuse carries risks, such as increases in blood fat levels, diabetes, and heart enlargement that may end in heart failure.",
