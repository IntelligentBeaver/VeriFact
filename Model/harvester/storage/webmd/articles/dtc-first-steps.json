You might wonder what your treatment will look like and worry about what your future might hold. Thyroid cancer isn't as common as breast, colon, or lung cancers. But it is very treatable most of the time. When you know what to expect, the diagnosis may feel less scary. Educating yourself about thyroid cancer and its treatment will also help you take control and be an active partner in your care."

        "Thyroid cancer starts in the butterfly-shaped gland in your neck. Your thyroid gland makes hormones that control how your body uses energy, digests food, and does many other functions. About 90% of thyroid cancers are the differentiated type. These cancers grow in follicular cells that make and release thyroid hormones. Differentiated means the cancer cells look and act almost the same as healthy thyroid cells. This type of thyroid cancer grows slowly. That makes it less likely to spread to other parts of your body than other thyroid cancers."
