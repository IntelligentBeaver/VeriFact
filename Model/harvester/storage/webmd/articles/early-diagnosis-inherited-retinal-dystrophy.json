        "Our dome-shaped cornea , the front layer of the eye, allows light to pass through and bends it to help us focus. Some light enters though the small opening of the pupil. How much light the pupil can let in is controlled by the iris, the colored part of the eye. That light then travels through the lens of the eye, which works together with the cornea to focus light on the retina . The retina, located at the back of our eye, is light sensitive. It contains special cells called photoreceptors that turn light into electrical signals that go to your brain and changes those signals into the images you see. Sometimes things can go wrong with one of the parts of our eyes. A rare group of disorders affecting the retina are called inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs.) These groups of diseases are hereditary, meaning they are passed down through families. The cause is mutations, or malfunctions, in at least one gene that is not working properly. There are around 300 known to play a role in these diseases. Some IRDs may progress slowly, while another may change vision much more quickly. Some may lead to vision loss ."

        "“It’s important to understand these diseases are rare, relatively speaking. But for the people who have an IRD, it can be life-changing,” says Shree Kurup, MD, FACP, a retinal specialist at  University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. “But what’s important to know is that early diagnosis of any one of these diseases can absolutely improve lives. We may not be able to cure every IRD, but we are making significant progress in learning more about the several hundred genes that can cause them.” There are more than 260 genes that can cause IRDs. But getting a diagnosis is more involved than a routine eye exam . “There can be a lot of reasons for blurry vision , and an IRD is not going to be the first thought of any eye doctor ,” says Matthew MacCumber, MD, PhD, a retinal specialist at Rush University Medical Center. There is a great amount of variety among all IRDs, so it can be tough to make an accurate diagnosis. “Sometimes patients may be misdiagnosed for years and when they finally get a firm, accurate diagnosis it’s almost a relief because they can finally put a name to their problem,” MacCumber says."
