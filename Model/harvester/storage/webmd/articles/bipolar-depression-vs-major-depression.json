        "Both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder can benefit from some form of psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This can help reduce your negative thoughts and behaviors and replace them with healthy, positive ones. Lowering stress and taking good care of yourself with a healthy diet, sleep, and exercise can help with management of both disorders, too. However, the types of medications that are most effective are different. The most common medications doctors prescribe for major depressive disorder are antidepressants , including: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Atypical antidepressants that don’t fit into the other categories, such as bupropion and trazodone Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Tricyclic antidepressants (less common) Starting an antidepressant may trigger a manic episode if you have bipolar disorder. Although doctors may prescribe them in some cases, they typically only do this in combination with a mood stabilizer. Common medications for bipolar disorder include: Mood stabilizers . These can help control mania. Examples include: Carbamazepine (Equetro, Tegretol) Divalproex sodium (Depakote) Lamotrigine (Lamictal) Lithium Valproic acid (Depakene)"
