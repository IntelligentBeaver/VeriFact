        "If you've had a stroke, preventing a second stroke is a top priority. \"The risk of a stroke is tenfold higher in someone who has had a stroke in the past,\" says Larry B. Goldstein, MD, professor of medicine (neurology) and director of the Duke Stroke Center in Durham, N.C.",

Treatment is also aimed at other factors that put you at risk, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol . But it takes more than just your doctor's efforts. You also have an important role to play in preventing stroke . It's up to you to make lifestyle changes that can lower your risk.",
