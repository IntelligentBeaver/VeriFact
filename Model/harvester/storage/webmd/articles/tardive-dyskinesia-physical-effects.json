        "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) can make it feel like your body isn't your own. TD causes involuntary movements of your face, arms, legs, and neck that you can't control. TD can make you blink your eyes or stick out your tongue. You might flap your arms or sway from side to side. These movements might be so mild that you barely notice them or severe enough to affect your work and other daily activities. Uncontrollable movements can cause embarrassment and lead to other challenges in your life. Your doctor will monitor you for side effects if you take a medicine that causes TD. If you do develop these movements, adjusting your medication or adding another drug can help to reduce them."

        "One theory is that TD happens when the receptors become extra sensitive to the effects of dopamine. Then when the receptors are exposed to dopamine, this chemical has a more intense effect that makes movements jerky and uncontrollable. Some of the medicines that can cause TD are: Antipsychotic drugs that treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder Neuroleptic drugs that treat Parkinson's disease Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications Migraine medicines N ausea medications You're not likely to get TD if you only take one of these medicines for a short period of time. It usually takes months or years on the medication before TD symptoms start. But once symptoms do begin, they can continue even after you stop taking the medication and they may never go away. Not everyone who takes an antipsychotic or neuroleptic drug will get TD. Your risk of this side effect is higher if you: Are over age 50 Are female Are Black Have been taking the medication for a few years or take a high dose Take an older antipsychotic drug Have diabetes, HIV, a traumatic brain injury (TBI), or a substance use disorder"
