        "July 3, 2025 — A new treatment has received a quick federal nod for a common blood cancer, which could affect more than 36,000 people and result in around 12,000 deaths in the U.S. this year alone.",
        "The drug, known as linvoseltamab but sold under the name Lynozyfic, is for adults with multiple myeloma whose cancer has returned or isn't responding well to treatment, especially if they’ve already tried at least four other treatments. Lynozyfic is said to offer a flexible dosing plan tailored to each patient's needs.",
        "In multiple myeloma, plasma cells (a type of white blood cell that makes antibodies against diseases) multiply abnormally, leading to too much of a protein called immunoglobulin in bones and blood that crowds out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow. This damages the bones and eventually multiple organs as the disease worsens and spreads. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a protein found in high levels on multiple myeloma cells that promotes their survival and growth, making the cancer more aggressive and difficult to treat. Despite undergoing three to four therapies, many patients see their cancer return, highlighting the need for new treatments, especially those targeting BCMA."
