(He was born in 1985.) His mom made healthy meals and steered him toward fresh fruits and vegetables, but he wasn’t interested. “I just wish I’d listened a little bit sooner and maybe cut out some years of McDonald’s in my past,” he says. Click loved chicken nuggets as a kid, and they became his go-to as a teen, when he’d grab some after lacrosse games or late at night. Cheap, fast, and tasty, sure — but his triglycerides count hit like a scolding. Today, he eats better — and with kids of his own, he appreciates his mom’s message. “It's very fascinating to watch the science support what my mom’s been saying for many, many years,” he says.",
        "Why Mom was right: Fried foods like chicken nuggets are usually high in calories and low in beneficial nutrients like fiber. They can also contain toxic byproducts like acrylamide that form during frying. The journal Heart published a study that said people who ate the most fried foods were 37% more likely to have heart failure, 28% more likely to have major cardiovascular events, and 22% more likely to have coronary heart disease than people who ate the least fried food."

Vitamin A to helps your eyes. Those beets and Brussels sprouts can help you poop because they’ve got fiber. Back then, Londono would roll her eyes.
