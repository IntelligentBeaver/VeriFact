        "Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a behavior disorder in which a child displays a pattern of an angry or cranky mood, defiant or combative behavior, and vindictiveness toward people in authority. The child's behavior often disrupts their daily routine, including activities within the family and at school.",
        "Oppositional defiant disorder is more common in boys than in girls. (Photo credit: Moment/Getty Images)",
        "It's not unusual for children -- especially those in their \"terrible twos\" and early teens -- to defy authority every now and then. They may express their defiance by arguing, disobeying, or talking back to their parents, teachers, or other adults. When this behavior lasts longer than 6 months and is more extreme than what’s usual for the child's age, it may mean the child has ODD.",
        "Estimates suggest that 2% to 16% of children and teens have ODD. In younger children, this disorder is more common in boys. In teens it happens about equally in boys and in girls. It typically begins by age 8.",
        "Many children and teens with ODD also have other behavioral problems, like attention deficit disorder, learning disabilities, mood disorders (such as depression), and anxiety disorders. Some children with oppositional defiant disorder go on to have a more serious behavior disorder called conduct disorder. With conduct disorder, a child shows antisocial behavior such as bullying, stealing, and cruelty to animals and people."
