        "The room began to spin. I broke out in a cold sweat . I felt all the color drain from my face. After yelling upstairs to my husband to take over, I slid to the kitchen floor.",
        "Psychologists don’t know exactly why up to 15% of us experience the plunge in blood pressure that causes us to faint whenever we see blood. One theory is that the phenomenon -- officially termed “blood-injury phobia ” -- is an evolutionary mechanism.",
        "“The idea is that back in time, when someone was coming at someone else with a sharp stick or rock, a kind of genetic variation allowed certain people to faint in response,” explains Tyler C. Ralston, PsyD, a clinical psychologist in Honolulu, who treats people with blood-injury phobias . Warriors who fainted looked dead and were passed over during battle. The blood pressure drop also might have helped those who were wounded avoid bleeding to death. Survivors then passed on the “ fainting ” gene."

        "To learn applied tension you work with a therapist. When you start feeling light-headed, you tense the muscles in your arms, legs, and trunk for about 10 to 15 seconds to raise your blood pressure and prevent fainting. Once you have mastered applied tension, the therapist exposes you, step by step, to the situations that trigger your phobia.",
        "The first step might involve thinking about driving to the clinic where you have blood drawn. In later sessions you might watch videotapes of blood tests or simulate the experience.“I may come in wearing a lab coat and put the tourniquet on [the patient’s] arm,” says Martin Antony, PhD, psychology professor at Ryerson University in Toronto and author of Overcoming Medical Phobias: How to Conquer Fear of Blood, Needles, Doctors, and Dentists .
