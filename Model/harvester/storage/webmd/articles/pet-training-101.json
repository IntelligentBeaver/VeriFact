        "\"No cats on the counter!\"Sound familiar? We all order our pets to stop this or stay off that. Pets do need to learn household rules, just like any other family member, but it doesn't have to be all about \"No!\"",
        "\"The conventional view is that the purpose of any training is to stop the animal from doing things. But modern training is built on reinforcing what you want and replacing the behavior you don't like with something you do like,\" says Karen Pryor, author of Reaching the Animal Mind: Clicker Training and What It Teaches Us About All Animals. She is a pioneer of the clicker-training method, based on the work of psychologist and behaviorist B.F. Skinner. The method has been used to train hundreds of species, even guinea pigs and pet rabbits. You use a sound, such as a click, to show your pet when it has done what you wanted and to alert it that a reward, such as a bit of food, is on the way."
