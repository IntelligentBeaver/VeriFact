        "That voice. So polished, with its instantly recognizable South African lilt, issuing a combination of wit and wisdom that’s launched comedian Trevor Noah to stardom on Comedy Central’s The Daily Show .",

        "For this performer, talking isn’t just a big thing -- it’s everything. As a poor kid growing up in Soweto during the waning days of apartheid, Noah talked himself out of countless small scrapes , low-level street hustles, and even serious jail time. And then he talked his way into local DJ jobs, cable access TV, and, eventually, the U.S. entertainment industry.",
        "He credits his mother, Patricia -- for whom he named one of his nine popular comedy tours -- with instilling in him a deep reverence for education. Noah says its impact has made the difference between finding success and settling for scraping by.",
        "“My mother didn’t have much money for toys or even food,” he says. “But the one thing she always made sure we had enough of was some sort of sustenance for the mind. She always bought me books. She made sure education was the one thing I had access to, at all costs to the family.”"

If it heals with stiffness, or scarring , you can lose vibration, which can change your vocal quality or affect the ability of singers to hit high pitches.” He notes that surface polyps have a lower risk of getting scar tissue after surgery than deeper lesions, which must be dug out.",
