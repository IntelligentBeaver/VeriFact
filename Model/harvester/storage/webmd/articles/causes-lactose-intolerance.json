        "Primary lactose intolerance is the most common form. Our bodies typically stop making lactase by about age 5 (as early as age 2 for African-Americans). As lactase levels decrease, dairy products become harder to digest. People with primary lactose intolerance make a lot less lactase. That makes dairy products hard to digest by adulthood. It’s caused by genes and is common among people of an African, Asian, Hispanic, Mediterranean and southern European background. It’s less common if your heritage is from northern or western Europe.",
        "Secondary lactose intolerance happens because of an injury, illness or possibly a surgery. Any of these can affect your small intestine and cause you to make less lactase. Celiac disease and Crohn’s disease are two of the most common intestinal diseases linked to low lactase.",
        "Developmental lactose intolerance happens in babies who are born prematurely. It usually goes away on its own, lasting for only a short time after birth.",
        "Congenital lactose intolerance is very rare and happens when no lactase (or a very small amount of it) is produced by the small intestine from birth. It’s a genetic disorder, and both parents have to pass the gene on to their child."
