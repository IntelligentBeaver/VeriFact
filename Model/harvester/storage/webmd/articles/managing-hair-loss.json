        "Lupus can cause two forms of hair loss: scarring alopecia and non-scarring alopecia. In scarring alopecia, you’re likely to experience permanent hair loss because of Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE). This type of lupus only affects the skin and is typically reserved for areas of your skin that are exposed to light. This includes your head, neck, and back of your hands. When the coin-shaped (discoid) lesions occur on your scalp, they likely cause permanent hair loss.",
        "Non-scarring alopecia typically occurs if you have Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). This usually causes thinning hair, but it’s not permanent. Non-scarring alopecia causes your hair to be fragile and break easily, making your hair strands shorter than usual. You may notice your hair thinning around the front edges of your hairline. This type of hair loss happens when your body is experiencing increased lupus activity, meaning it’s saving your energy and calories for more important bodily functions. Once your SLE is under control with treatment, you’ll likely see more hair growth.",
