It’s often done after surgery to help prevent cancer from coming back. “Treatment for low-risk disease utilizes the drug methotrexate and sometimes dactinomycin,” Ledakis explains. “Treatment for high-risk and stage IV (metastatic) disease usually is multidrug chemo regimens. The five-year survival is quite high – in some studies over 80%.”",
