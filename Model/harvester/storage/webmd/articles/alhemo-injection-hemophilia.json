        "Alhemo (concizumab-mtci) is a medicine approved to help prevent bleeding in people aged 12 or older with hemophilia A or B who don’t have inhibitors to certain blood clotting proteins. Hemophilia is a rare condition that affects about 800,000 people around the world. It makes it hard for your blood to clot, which can lead to serious or frequent bleeding.",
        "Alhemo was already approved for people with inhibitors. This approval expands its use to more people living with hemophilia.",
        "Alhemo works by blocking a protein in your body called tissue factor pathway inhibitor, which normally slows down clotting. By blocking it, Alhemo helps your body make more thrombin, a substance that helps form clots and stop bleeding.",
        "This approval matters because many people with hemophilia still rely on intravenous (IV) infusions, which can be hard to manage. Alhemo is given as a once-daily shot under the skin. This kind of daily injection might be easier and more convenient for people to use regularly and could make their treatment routine simpler."
