        "People with high anxiety may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD ), a condition known for persistent, overwhelming worry about a wide variety of issues. People with GAD often find it hard to stop worrying and may switch quickly from one source of worry to another. Other anxiety disorders include Social Anxiety Disorder, in which the person has an intense fear of social interaction, and Panic Disorder, where the person experiences panic attacks and feelings of terror without cause.",
        "Anyone can have or develop an anxiety disorder. The cause of anxiety may be genetics, or it may develop after stressful life experiences. People with anxiety disorders worry about both rational and irrational events, but both cause equal amounts of stress. While experiencing some anxiety is a part of life, an anxiety disorder can make it difficult to actually live your life.",
