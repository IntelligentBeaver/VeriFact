It’s important that you inject this medication in a fatty part of your body, so I gave myself the shot in my stomach. It caused a little pain at first, but I think I was also very nervous because I had never done anything like this before.",

Some people take it to help prevent heart attacks and strokes."

It’s important that my test results are in the normal range. If they’re too high, I might have unnecessary bleeding. If they’re too low my blood could be more likely to clot."
