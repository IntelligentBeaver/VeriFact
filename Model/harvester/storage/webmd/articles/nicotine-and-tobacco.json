        "When your body absorbs nicotine, your brain releases a chemical called dopamine, often called a “feel-good” chemical. It’s this chemical that starts the cycle of nicotine addiction. You consume nicotine, you feel good, the feeling wears off after a few minutes, and you consume more nicotine.",

        "Nicotine is worse than caffeine. Although caffeine can be addictive in high amounts, its effect on your body is not as harmful as nicotine. While nicotine can cause heart disease, caffeine is generally safe for adults as long as you don’t drink too much of it."
