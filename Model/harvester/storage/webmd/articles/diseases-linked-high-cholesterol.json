        "Erectile dysfunction is when a person can’t achieve or maintain an erection during sex. Over the long term, high cholesterol seems to trigger a narrowing of the smaller blood vessels of the penis when they should be stretching to allow more blood for an erection. In addition, when you have too much LDL cholesterol, it can build up in arteries and then join with other substances to form plaque that hardens and narrows the blood vessels even more (atherosclerosis). The result can be less blood flow to both the heart and the penis, which can lead to erectile dysfunction."
