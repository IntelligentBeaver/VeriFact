        "The most common way to lower “bad” cholesterol is through medication called a statin, which works by lowering the amount of cholesterol your liver makes. That can help slow down the amount of cholesterol that builds up in your arteries, lowering your chance of a heart attack or stroke. When you’ve had a cardiac event, doctors recommend high-intensity statin therapy. This therapy can lower your LDL cholesterol by 50% or more. In some cases, your doctors might add another cholesterol-lowering medication and suggest you make lifestyle changes like a heart-healthy diet and exercise more often."
