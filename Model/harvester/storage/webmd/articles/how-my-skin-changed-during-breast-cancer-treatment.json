        "When I think of this subject, it takes me back to when I was 15 or 16 years old. I was just learning about skin care because my face needed some extra TLC because of all the pimples I had. At the time, I wanted to find a magical soap or cream to help them all go away because I was embarrassed by how they were taking over my face. Of course, I didn’t really think about the hormonal changes in my body attributing to what was happening with my skin.",
        "The very first thing I thought about when I was about to start chemotherapy and immunotherapy was the loss of my hair. All of my self-image thoughts were about my hair. Little did I know I would be wishing I could find that magic soap or cream to help me with my skin just like I did when I was younger. It wasn’t until a couple of weeks into treatment that I started noticing bumps on my skin. These bumps were pimple-like and were mostly on my cheeks and forehead. I also noticed I started to get painful bumps on my scalp and a lot of dryness. But it wasn’t just bumps on my face. No, my face was also covered in what I can only describe as pink and purplish tiny dots. These changes prompted me to address this with my oncologist.",
        "My oncologist prescribed a cream called tretinoin, along with instructions on how to use it. After the cream didn’t work, I was referred to a dermatologist. I also took to my social media platform and asked for suggestions on natural home remedies for acne. Although there were many great suggestions, I landed on aloe-based products that alleviated some of the side effects like itchiness and pain. I did develop some pigmentation also known as \"chemo freckles.\" Here are some of the things that helped my skin during this time:"
