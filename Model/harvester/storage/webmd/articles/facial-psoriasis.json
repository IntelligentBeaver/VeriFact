It’s FDA-approved for adults, and you can use it in other sensitive areas like skin folds and genitals. One study found that 4 in 10 people saw their psoriasis symptoms completely go away at least once during the study.  Common side effects can include red bumps, pain or swelling in your nose or throat, burning, or peeling.",

Common side effects can include diarrhea, headache, insomnia, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection.",
