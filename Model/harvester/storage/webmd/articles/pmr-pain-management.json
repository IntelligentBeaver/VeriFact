        "Pain can be a part of life with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). This inflammatory condition causes pain and stiffness, especially in the neck, shoulders, and hips. But it can make any part of your body ache. Corticosteroids are the main treatment for PMR. These anti-inflammatory medicines quickly bring down inflammation and relieve pain and stiffness. But sometimes steroids aren’t enough to manage PMR pain. And because steroids can cause side effects, you don’t want to stay on them for more than a few months. More than 40% of people with PMR say they’ve tried nondrug treatments like diet, exercise, and massage to manage their pain. Some of these treatments are more helpful than others."

The goal is to help you respond to stress and pain in a healthier way. In one study, a program of MBSR plus cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improved low back pain. When you're under stress, your body releases chemicals like cortisol that increase inflammation. Guided imagery helps you release that stress. To use guided imagery, you focus on a calming scene, like the beach. Harness all five senses to calm yourself down. Hear the crash of the waves, smell the salty air, and feel the sand between your toes. Research has found that guided imagery can ease arthritis pain.",

And if you take steroids, make sure the therapist is extra gentle. Steroids can thin your skin and make it more likely to tear. Try different pain management approaches until you find the ones that work for you. Check with your doctor first, to make sure the method you choose won't hurt you and that you're using it the right way."
