        "Oct. 11, 2024 – A company is recalling nearly 10 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products because of possible listeria contamination.",
        "The products were produced June 19 to Oct. 8 at the BrucePac production facility in Durant, Oklahoma, and shipped across the nation to restaurants and institutions, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a news release.",
        "Employees of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service discovered the problem after routine inspections of BrucePac products. Specifically, Brucepac chicken was found to be the source of the listeria contamination. In total, 9,986,245 pounds of products were affected.",
        "The recalled products bear establishment numbers 51205 or P-51205 inside or under the USDA mark of inspection.",
        "“There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider,” the USDA said.",
        "Listeria is usually a mild intestinal illness, but sometimes the bacteria spread beyond the gut and cause a severe condition called invasive listeriosis. People ages 65 and older, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Symptoms among pregnant people include a fever, muscle aches, and tiredness. Other people may have those symptoms, too, plus a headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or seizures."
