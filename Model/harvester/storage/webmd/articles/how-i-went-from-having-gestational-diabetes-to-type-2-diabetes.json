Gestational diabetes affects pregnant women who haven’t ever been diagnosed with diabetes. My doctor told me that my body didn’t make enough insulin to ensure I’d have a healthy baby. As a result, I would have to take insulin injections daily . I was devastated.",

After doing extensive research, I learned that I wasn’t alone and many women who never had diabetes were diagnosed with gestational diabetes. According to the CDC, every year, 2% to 10% of pregnancies in the U.S. are affected by gestational diabetes. I knew that if I wanted to meet my son, I would need to listen to my doctor by taking my insulin daily, eating a balanced meal, and exercising regularly so I could maintain adequate glucose levels during my pregnancy."

        "My next feat was eating healthy and exercising. Before becoming pregnant, I ate freely and didn’t worry about making good food choices or reading food labels. “I never even paid attention to food labels!” I learned so much through this journey that has stayed with me to this very day. The funny thing is my approach to exercise was walking to the car and parking to the closest space at the mall entrance. I had to make a plan and set aside some time to exercise. I started off with walking 15 minutes a day no matter what. I know what you are thinking, “15 minutes isn’t a lot!” However, you have to start somewhere! I gradually made it to 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and eventually 1 whole hour! I was so proud of myself because I was improving my health and preparing for my son. Change is never easy, but you have to start somewhere! When you have gestational diabetes, you also have to go to doctor’s appointments weekly because you’re considered a “high-risk pregnancy.” My doctor was so proud at my progress and how I was able to manage my gestational diabetes."

My name is Robin Dorsey and I’m a type 2 diabetic! I’m here to tell you that you’re not alone in this fight because more than 34.2 million Americans have diabetes!
