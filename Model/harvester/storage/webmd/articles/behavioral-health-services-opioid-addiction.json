        "Opioid use disorder (OUD) – sometimes called opioid addiction – is a disease of the brain. If you have OUD, you’ll keep using opioids even if they are causing you harm and you want to stop. The misuse and dependence on opioids leads to serious health problems. It also tends to come with trouble in relationships, work, school, and other aspects of your life.",
        "OUD is a chronic disease, but there are proven and effective treatments. As with treatments for other chronic conditions, the goal of treatment is to help with your symptoms and improve your overall health. Treatment also will help you participate in normal activities. You’ll learn how to manage your health into the future to stay healthy and avoid relapses.",
        "You can get OUD treatment in different settings, depending in part on how severe your OUD is. You’ll usually get it through inpatient or outpatient programs that are dedicated to treating substance use disorders. Your treatment for opioid addiction will likely include both counseling and medicines. Social support, such as recovery groups, will help too, both during and after treatment."
