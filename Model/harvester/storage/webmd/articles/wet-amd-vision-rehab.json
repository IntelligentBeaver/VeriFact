        "Wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is caused by blood vessels that grow under the retina . Over time, these vessels leak enough fluid or blood into the macula to create a blind spot. The macula is the part of the retina that lets you see clearly the things directly in front of you. Having wet AMD in one or both of your eyes can be challenging. You might not be able to read or see faces as clearly as you used to. It can also be harder to see signs when you’re driving. Although there is no cure for wet AMD, it can be treated. You can also learn to make the most of the vision you have. Vision rehabilitation (also called low vision rehabilitation) can help you get used to your eyesight changes."
