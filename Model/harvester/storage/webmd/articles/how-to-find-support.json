        "Asking for help when you've got a food allergy can feel like a mountain to climb. There's definitely a stigma around it, and that can make it tough to reach out. But let me tell you, reaching out is a sign of strength, not weakness. I’m here to help you break that stigma so you don’t suffer in silence.",
        "I was feeling really anxious not long ago about the symptoms of anaphylaxis. I'd been having these weird reactions and was convinced I was about to have a full-blown allergic reaction. So I turned to my Instagram community. Sharing my worries felt vulnerable, but the support I got was incredible. It made me realise how important it is to ask for help and not suffer in silence.",
        "Recognizing when you need support isn't easy, but it's a crucial step. Whether it's talking to a friend, a family member, or a health care professional, reaching out can make a world of difference. It's OK to not have all the answers. In fact, it's a sign of maturity to admit when you need help and it's something I have struggled with personally in the past."
