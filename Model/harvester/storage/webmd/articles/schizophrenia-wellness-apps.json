        "“People with schizophrenia often find it hard to remember to do things like take their medication, or struggle to eat right or get regular physical activity,” says John Torous, MD, a Harvard psychiatrist and director of the Digital Psychiatry Division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. As a result, their symptoms may get worse, and they end up in a vicious cycle that’s hard to break.",
        "One way people with schizophrenia can get support is through mobile wellness apps, says Colin Depp, PhD, a psychologist at the University of California, San Diego who specializes in digital interventions for patients with schizophrenia. Apps may help you stick to a medication schedule; keep tabs on your mood, sleep, and day-to-day functioning; and even manage symptoms such as hallucinations ."

        "The most effective method is for people with schizophrenia to use wellness or mental health apps between doctor visits to enhance their care, Torous says. “They can be a valuable way for both a patient and their provider to figure out what may trigger symptoms,” he explains.",
        "He recalls one person with schizophrenia whose depression and psychosis were getting worse. “When we had him use different apps to collect data, it became clear to us that when he did not get a good night of sleep, his symptoms worsened,” he says. “We helped him monitor his sleep, and as it improved, his symptoms got better. He had to see data week by week to realize the connection.”",
        "These apps are also valuable as a form of digital therapy, since they can help people with schizophrenia work on social skills and assist them in getting rid of negative thoughts. If someone hears voices (called auditory hallucinations ), a meditation app may help block them, Torous says. “There’s a belief among many medical professionals that people with schizophrenia have trouble with technology, but if you work with a patient to teach them some basic digital literacy skills, it goes a very long way.”"

        "The challenge is if you use multiple apps, he says, it can be hard to get a big-picture sense of your overall health information. “One app may track your medicine, and another your mood, and a third your exercise habits,” he explains. “It's very hard to put it all together and understand how you’re doing.”"
