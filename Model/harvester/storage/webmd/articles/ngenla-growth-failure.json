This triggers a series of signals inside the cells that tell the body to carry out growth-related processes and control how it uses and stores energy, which affects overall growth and metabolism. Ngenla also increases the levels of another hormone called insulin -like growth factor (IGF-1). Together, growth hormone and IGF-1 can cause changes in metabolism, support growth in height, and increase the speed of growth in children with growth hormone deficiency."
