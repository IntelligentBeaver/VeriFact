        "Many parents use pacifiers to help soothe their babies. The sucking reflex is natural and comforting to a baby. Pacifiers are especially helpful when you aren’t able to hold or comfort your baby, like when you’re in the car. Multiple studies have suggested that using a pacifier can reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ).",

The rubbery part of the pacifier seems to be able to attract dirt and dust out of thin air, and it needs to be properly cleaned before you can hand it back to your baby. There are a few options you can choose to clean your baby’s pacifier, including pacifier wipes."
