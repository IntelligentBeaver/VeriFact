        "While it may be hard to believe, Cynthia Nixon insists that dressing up in fabulous threads and hanging out with your BFFs can actually be a dangerous job.",
        "Nixon, whom we all recognize as Miranda Hobbes from Sex and the City -- the cable TV series and the movies -- is sitting by the window of a sushi restaurant in her Upper West Side neighborhood, where the server knows her well enough to bring tea before she requests it. She's wearing a long zip-up sweater over leggings, sensibly heeled clogs over striped socks, and dangly, delicate silver earrings. Her hair is a couple shades blonder than Miranda's, but still red enough to promote Sex and the City 2 . Nixon is just back from seven weeks of shooting the movie sequel in Morocco, and she's talking about the hazards of her work.",
        "For example, there's the TV episode from 2001 in which Miranda trains with her new love interest, \"Marathon Man,\" and Nixon (not a runner) is directed in the scene to sprint -- without a warm-up. \"I snapped something in the front of my hip,\" she says, \"and every now and then it comes back.\"",
        "The real peril, however, comes with standard SATC footwear. \"The heels! It's hard, and it's long hours,\" she says, remembering her workdays in Morocco. \"Wearing heels for 18 hours -- walking, running, on cobblestones, on sand -- and there's no breaking them in.\" But, she concedes, \"they are very well-made shoes.\""
