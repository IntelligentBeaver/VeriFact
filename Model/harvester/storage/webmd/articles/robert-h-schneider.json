        "Robert H. Schneider, MD, is director of the Center for Health and Aging\nStudies in Fairfield, IA, and a professor of physiology and Maharishi Ayurveda.\nHe has developed a program of clinical research on aging and the promotion of\nhealth, including the prevention of heart disease. Schneider is currently\nprincipal investigator on three major grants totaling $2.3 million, two of\nwhich are funded by the National Institutes of Health and are being used to\ninvestigate stress reduction in elderly African-Americans with hypertension and\nheart disease. The third grant is funded by the Retirement Research Foundation,\nfor the first large-scale controlled study of Maharishi Ayurveda programs and\nhealth promotion in the elderly. Schneider's hypertension study, published in\nthe American Heart Association's journal Hypertension, found that the\nTranscendental Meditation technique produced blood pressure reductions equal to\nthose commonly found with medication. The National Institutes of Health awarded\n$1.4 million for a follow-up study, now underway at the West Oakland Health\nCenter in California.",
