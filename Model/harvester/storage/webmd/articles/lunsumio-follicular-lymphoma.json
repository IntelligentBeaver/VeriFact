When Lunsumio attaches to CD20 and CD3, this activates the T cells, makes them multiply, and helps them release chemicals that destroy the lymphoma cells with CD20 on them."

        "Lunsumio was studied in people with relapsed or refractory FL who had already received at least two types of treatment for their lymphoma. People in this trial got the Lunsumio step up dosing as follows: 1 milligram for the first dose, a 2-milligram dose one week later, two more weekly doses of 60 milligrams, followed by 30 milligrams given every three weeks. There were 90 people in this study and 61% were men. The median age was 60 years old with a range of 29 to 90. Most people (77%) had stage III or IV cancer. Eighty-two percent of people were White, 9% were Asian, 4% were Black or African American, 1% were American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 3% were unknown. This study looked at objective response rate (ORR), which measured the amount of people who had a response to treatment. It also looked at duration of response (dOR), which measured the time between the start of a response and the time of cancer progression or death. The ORR for this study was 80%, which means that 80% of patients had either a partial or complete response to Lunsumio. The dOR for the patients that had a response was 22.8 months. This means that of the people that responded to Lunsumio, the average time that response lasted was almost 23 months. This showed that Lunsumio had a positive response in relapsed or refractory FL patients that had two or more prior treatments."
