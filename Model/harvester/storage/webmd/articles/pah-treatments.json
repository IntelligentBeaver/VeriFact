It happens when the blood vessels in your lungs narrow and scar so much that it’s hard for blood to move through them. This can trigger high blood pressure in the lungs. PAH can be hard to diagnose. That’s because the symptoms – like shortness of breath – are common to several other medical conditions. There’s no cure. But there are FDA-approved treatments. Here’s what you need to know."

Your risk of forming blood clots is higher if you have PAH. Blood thinners, like warfarin (Coumadin), are given to most people with PAH to cut down on clots and improve overall survival. But warfarin interacts with several foods and drugs. Your doctor can tell you what to avoid. Diuretic. Sometimes called water pills, diuretics can help your body get rid of extra salt and water. This happens to most people with PAH. Your doctor will usually recommend one pill a day. But if you have a severe form of PAH, they may up the dosage.",

        "This is an older medication sometimes prescribed to people with severe PAH. It’s designed to help your heart pump blood better. When you have moderate to severe PAH, it can make it hard to breathe properly and affect your day-to-day life. The low levels of oxygen can make the blood vessels constrict further, which can make your PAH worse. Getting a little extra oxygen can help you not only breathe better but also be able to get through daily tasks and routines. It can also boost your mood and sleep. While some may need extra oxygen every now and then, others may need it continuously. Oxygen therapy comes in three types: Compressed gas oxygen. This is in steel or aluminum cylinders that you can use at home or when you travel. Liquid oxygen Oxygen concentrators. This device removes nitrogen from the air to provide a concentrated form of oxygen to breathe. Before you try oxygen therapy, ask your doctor how much you need and how often you may need it. They can also guide you toward the type that works best for your lifestyle."
