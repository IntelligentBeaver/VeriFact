        "Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a group of rare tumors. They are usually benign (not cancer) and tend to occur in people between 25 to 50 years old. The tumors affect areas of the joints and may cause pain, swelling, and inflammation. There are two types of TGCTs.  Giant cell tumors of the tendon sheath (GCTTS) are small tumors that grow in a specific area of the joint, like in your hands or feet. Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) are widespread (or diffuse) tumors that affect the entire joint. Usually, one joint is involved like the knee or hip. Surgery is the most common treatment to remove the tumors and the inflamed joint tissue. Even after treatment, tumors may come back, especially if they are the diffuse type.",
        "Turalio (pexidartinib) is approved to treat certain adults with TGCT that is not likely to get better with surgery. It is typically taken twice a day by mouth."
