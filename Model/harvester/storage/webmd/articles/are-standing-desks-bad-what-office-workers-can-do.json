        "Oct. 30, 2024 – After years of scientists warning about the health harms of sitting, researchers in Australia recently reported that standing may not be so great, either – a potentially frustrating finding for the growing numbers of standing desk users worldwide.",
        "The study found that standing more doesn’t reduce the risk of problems like heart disease or stroke, and may even boost the risk of circulatory issues, such as varicose veins or deep vein thrombosis. “Standing desks may be bad for your health,” headlines read.",
        "“Sitting is still bad for you, but standing by itself isn't the magic pill,” said study author Matthew Ahmadi , PhD, deputy director of the Wearables Research Hub and a researcher from the Physical Activity, Lifestyle, and Population Health Research group at the University of Sydney, Australia. “It needs to be mixed in with other forms of activity that actually make you move, because if we want to lower our risk of cardiovascular disease, we have to do activities that actually engage the cardiovascular system.”"
