        "A pinworm infection is an intestinal illness that's very common in elementary school-aged children. Pinworms are small, thin, pin-shaped worms that sometimes live in the human colon and rectum. They're also called threadworms. They're about 1/4- to 1/2-inch long — about the size of a staple. The females do their work while you sleep: They leave the intestine through your anus and deposit their eggs on the surrounding skin .",
