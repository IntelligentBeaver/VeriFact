        "Saw palmetto, also called the American dwarf palm tree, is a palm plant that grows mostly along the coast of the southeastern United States and can be found as far west as California. It gets its name from its green leaves, which look like the teeth of a saw.",
        "The plant has white flowers that produce yellow berries that turn black when they’re ripe. The ripe fruit of saw palmetto can be used in several forms, including ground and dried fruit or whole berries. It’s available as a liquid extract, tablets, capsules, and as an infusion or a tea.",
