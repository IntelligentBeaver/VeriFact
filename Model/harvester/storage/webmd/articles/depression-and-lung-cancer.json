It’s normal to feel worried, anxious, and scared about what this new reality means for you and your future. In addition to taking care of what your body needs now, you’ll need to think about your mind, too. On top of the cancer, depression is a serious concern when you have lung cancer. Depression can make it harder for you to function and go through treatment. It can even influence your chances of surviving with lung cancer. Many people with lung cancer have depression, and in about half of them, depression will persist."
