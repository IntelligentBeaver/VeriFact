        "Tenosynovial giant cell tumors (TGCTs) are rare tumors that cover your joints. It is a noncancerous disease and also not life-threatening. These tumors can affect your bones and impact your tendon sheath (tissues that cover tendons). Tendons are rope-like structures that connect your muscles to your bones. TGCT can also damage your bursa – small, fluid-filled sacs that provide cushion and ease of movement between your tendons and joints. These sacs are located next to large joints like in your shoulders, elbows, knees, and hips.  TGCT can impact small joints like your toes or larger joints such as those in your knee. When any of these areas are affected, it can cause pain and swelling and limit your ability to move around. This condition used to be called PVNS or pigmented villonodular synovitis."

        "The symptoms of TGCT can mimic other things like a sprain or arthritis, so it is important to talk to your doctor. Tumors for TGCT fall into two types: localized or diffused. What’s the difference? Localized or nodular TGCT tends to grow tumors in the smaller joints like in your fingers and toes. Localized TGCT mainly has one tumor with well-defined edges. These are easier to remove with surgery. Diffuse TGCT tumors are often found in larger joints and are more than twice as likely to return even after surgery. The knee is the most common for diffused TGCT, but it can also show up in your hips or ankles. Diffuse TGCT has several tumors, which tend to be larger."

        "While surgery has been the main treatment for patients with TGCT for years, a new drug offers hope for other options. Research suggests TGCT forms from a transition of a certain chromosome. This produces a high level of a certain protein called colony stimulating factor-1 or CSF-1. These types of cells make up most of TGTC cells. Scientists believe if you could block CSF-1, you could treat TGCT. This research led to the recently FDA-approved drug called pexidartinib (Turalio). In clinical trials, 50% of cases showed positive results. For 18% of patients, the tumor disappeared completely. Side effects noted include possible liver damage, rash or itching."
