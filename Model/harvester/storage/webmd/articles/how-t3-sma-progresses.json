Without these signals, the muscles weaken and lose their ability to move. With Type 3 SMA (SMA3), also called Kugelberg-Welander disease or juvenile SMA, there’s a pattern of how weakness develops, but the amount of weakness is different for each person."

        "Type 3 is usually diagnosed when a child is between 18-36 months, although it can be diagnosed as late as the teen years. Symptoms include: Muscle weakness Trouble walking Frequent respiratory infections Muscle weakness itself progresses very slowly in this form of SMA. It tends to be symmetrical, meaning it affects both sides of the body. The muscles closest to the center of the body, like the shoulders, pelvis, and upper arms, are usually more affected than those further away, like the lower arms and legs and the hands and feet."

        "As your child grows, it may be harder for them to keep up with daily activities like climbing stairs. Their muscles shorten around their hips, knees, and ankles. This makes it difficult for them to move around. They may also fall more due to muscle weakness, and they may need help getting up from sitting. About half of kids with SMA3 will stop being able to walk independently by the age of 14. While most kids with SMA3 have bladder and bowel control, they’ll need help with activities of daily life, like going to the bathroom or getting dressed. They also seem weaker when they’re sick or around times of growth spurts, like puberty. Later in adulthood, they’re usually less able to get around. Many will eventually need a wheelchair. While they may have problems with breathing and swallowing, that’s usually not until much later in life. They may, however, get sicker from respiratory infections like colds or flu throughout their life due to weaker chest muscles."
