Conjunctivitis (pink eye) Although a virus commonly causes conjunctivitis in adults, the pneumococcus bacteria often causes pink eye in kids. Your child’s doctor will treat the pink eye with an antibiotic drop with fluoroquinolones or polymyxin B plus trimethoprim. You’ll put antibiotic drops in their eyes two to four times a day for 7-10 days. If your child’s eye infection isn’t going away, tell your doctor. They’ll probably give them an oral antibiotic, too. Sinus infections (sinusitis) Many sinus infections are from a virus and improve on their own in two to three weeks.

If your infection gets worse, you can get other complications or sepsis. Sepsis is an emergency, so get medical treatment right away. Pneumococcal bacteria infect different bones in adults and children. The bacteria infect the larger bones of the arm (humerus) and thigh (femur) in children. In adults, pneumococcus often infects the vertebrae, your spinal bones. Septic arthritis caused by pneumococcal bacteria is uncommon. But if you’ve had a joint replacement, you're at higher risk for IPD. To check, your doctor will take a small amount of joint fluid (needle aspiration). The lab can culture the sample from your infected joint to identify the bacteria and the antibiotic that works best to kill it.",

        "The best way to prevent pneumococcal disease is to get vaccinated. The vaccine can protect you from many pneumococcal strains (types) that are resistant to antibiotics, too. There are two main types of pneumococcal vaccines: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15, PCV20, PCV21) Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) The number after the vaccine name tells you how many types of pneumococcal bacteria the vaccine can protect against. For example, the PPSV23 vaccine can protect about 60 to 70 adults out of 100 from invasive pneumococcal disease caused by 23 types of pneumococcus. Talk to your doctor about vaccination Your doctor can review your medical history and help you choose the best pneumococcal vaccine. Consider asking your doctor: Which pneumococcal vaccine is right for me? Which pneumococcal vaccine do I need if I’ve already had one before? I’ve never had a pneumococcal vaccine, which one would you suggest? What are the potential side effects of the vaccine? How can I manage them? Should I get the vaccine at 50 years old or wait till I’m 65 years old? Can I get the pneumococcal vaccine with my flu and COVID shots? Does my child need the pneumococcal vaccine? Can my child get the pneumococcal vaccine along with their regular vaccines? Is it safe for my child to get the pneumococcal and flu vaccines at the same time? If so, is there a risk for a high fever? Treating pneumococcal disease early can help you recover faster and prevent complications. The best way to prevent infection is vaccination. Getting your pneumococcal vaccination on time can keep both you and your loved ones safe."
