My cycles were so bad from having fibroids that some days, I would wake up to get ready for work and I couldn’t even walk. It was like I had little aliens invading my body and there was nothing I could do about it. I had fibroids for many years."

I learned that the reason why I was in so much pain was that one of the fibroids had died inside of me and it was causing me major problems (there were two inside my uterus the size of cantaloupes). I had to decide to have them removed via surgery or continue to deal with the pain."
