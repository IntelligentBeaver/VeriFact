        "Like most kids, I was loud. I liked to bang. I mean play instruments. My poor parents had to hear “Three Blind Mice” on the piano a countless number of times. When I wasn’t indulging their eardrums with sweet repetitive music, I was belting out ’80s tunes. Clearly, I was next in line to take Janet Jackson’s or Madonna’s place. When I would take five, the show would go on and Saturday morning cartoons had a theme that must be sung out loud!",
        "As I got older, I joined activities focused on using your voice – both literally and figuratively. I joined a spirit team. I played team sports. I joined the debate team. I picked journalism because it wasn’t a “quiet” career. It can be solitary to write and much of it you do alone, but it’s about speaking up and shedding light on something that might benefit others.",

        "Station silence FM . I’ve always done well with some type of background noise. In college, I preferred the bustling student center over the library. When I lived alone, I always had something playing in the background to keep me company. I really didn’t think you could drive without playing something. Until one day, there was nothing in particular I wanted to listen to. I turned the radio off, didn’t download any podcasts or audiobooks, and just drove in … silence. It was glorious. I got to hear my own thoughts. I heard sounds I’d normally miss, and I just had time, space, and peace to clear my head.",
        "Early bird. In addition to loving sound, I’ve also been a night owl most of my life. Recently, I’ve grown to appreciate the benefit of rising early to get stuff done! I tend to have a more productive day when I don’t sleep in. It’s also sooooo quiet! I started getting to the stores early during the pandemic to avoid the crowds. It was so nice to drive down quiet streets and walk down quiet grocery store lanes. It was like a bath for my brain. It felt so good! Now, when I have a lot going on, I’ll try to get up early, pray, stretch, and take care of a few errands before officially starting my day.",
        "Party of one. I can do a lot of things alone – shop, travel, go to the movies. What I’ve always hated was eating alone. In my mind, dining should be social and full of laughs and conversation like it was in my home growing up. Well, a few things had me cool my jets on this one. First, I started to develop severe acid reflux. Doctors gave me a list of to-dos, including keeping my mouth shut when eating. Then, a few near-choking emergencies had me rethink my table talks. So slowly, but surely, I started trying to eat alone. Of course, doing this at home is easy (although I still prefer to wait for family). My test was to try it out in the world. I started with small cafes and just a cup of coffee. I graduated to lunch with a good book. Now I can go to a nice restaurant with an audiobook or a notepad (to capture dialogue, of course) without batting an eye. I’ve learned that it feels so refreshing to just keep quiet every now and then and truly savor a well-made meal.",
        "Work it out. I have shared in prior posts about my “sanity walks” – another pandemic saving grace. I would find the nearest park and just walk. Sometimes I’d listen to something on YouTube or an audiobook. But often, I would just listen to nothing in particular. I wouldn’t talk on the phone. I would just concentrate on breathing. At the end of 30-45 minutes or longer, my body got a workout, while my mind got a much-needed rest.",
        "Get good at not planning. I am a planner. I look forward to buying a new paper planner each calendar year. I love making lists. I schedule conference calls to plan family reunions. I’m that girl. It makes me feel safe. It can also make me feel stressed. So, I’ve become reacquainted with the religious tradition of the Sabbath, and I’ve worked hard to clear my calendar and freeze as many plans (and tasks) as possible on Sundays. It hasn’t been easy, but it has been worth it. I’ve noted a drastic decrease in the frequency and intensity of my migraines."
