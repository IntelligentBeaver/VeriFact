        "And now conflict over a Supreme Court vacancy is fanning the flames of political tension.  Amid all this unrest, the holidays are coming, which can be stressful enough in the best of years. How can we prepare ourselves to be tossed around and challenged like never before?",
        "1. Focus on What You Can Control",
        "When we watch the news, we get the message that everything important in the world is outside our control. Don’t believe it. It’s true that none of us as individuals can, on our own, determine the outcome of an election or stop a pandemic. But you do control the real essentials of your life: Where you place your attention. How you train your mind. The quality of presence you bring to each moment. Your willingness to stay in reality even when you want to run away. Remember that there’s a lot happening in your life that isn’t affected by the latest headlines -- and that peace of mind ultimately is a choice."

Try high intensity interval training . Dance with your kids. Invest in a high-quality stationary bike. Pent-up energy can morph into anxious agitation. By discharging it through exercise, you’ll be triggering the release of endorphins, which can have a powerfully positive effect on mood. Taking charge of our physical health can also help us feel mentally and emotionally strong. I recall many mornings during graduate school when I felt anxious and uncertain before a workout, and confident and optimistic after.  It’s amazing how many things seem better after we’ve broken a sweat."

Whatever you desire in your life is right here. Stay close. Come home to yourself.

Some of them may be right, some may be worse than what will actually happen, and there will certainly be surprises we aren’t anticipating. What we know is that right now, they’re all fantasies. None of them is real. So we don’t have to live in that imagined future. We can’t solve it in advance, anyway. We can influence our personal future, of course, but most of what we worry about is beyond our sphere of control. Start recognizing and naming the mind’s predictions as stories , that may or may not come true. We don’t have to live as if they’re already happening."
