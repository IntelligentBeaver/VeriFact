        "The challenge while eating less overall is to eat more nutrient-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans, fish, low-fat dairy products, and lean cuts of meat.",
        "As you age, your body needs the same amount of protein, vitamins , and minerals and, in some instances, even more nutrients .",
        "Take vitamin B-12, for example. After age 50, your body's ability to absorb the vitamin often fades because you don't have as much stomach acid, which is needed to break B-12 down from food sources.",
        "The same holds true for vitamin D . Aging skin is less able than younger skin to change sunlight to the vitamin. That, in turn, affects the body's ability to absorb calcium ."
