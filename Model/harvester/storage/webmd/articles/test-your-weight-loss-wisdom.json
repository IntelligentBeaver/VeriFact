Whatever the manufacturers call it, this is supposedly the amount of carbohydrate that's left after you subtract those carbohydrates said to have a negligible effect -- such as fiber, sugar alcohols, and glycerin. Until the government defines these terms and research supports the assumptions behind them, my opinion is that these are useless words that do little more than confuse consumers. Read labels, and choose foods that are low in sugars but rich in fibers for the healthiest carbohydrates.",
