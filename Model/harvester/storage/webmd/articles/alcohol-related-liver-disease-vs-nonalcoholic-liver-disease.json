        "Your liver is a hardworking organ and gland that performs more than 500 functions in your body. It fights infections. It cleans your blood of waste and harmful substances. And it transforms fats, proteins, and carbohydrates into energy and nutrients. Your liver is essential to maintaining your body’s overall wellness. But all that cleaning and processing also puts this vital organ at risk of developing various types of liver disease, including alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)."

Excess fat buildup in the liver can cause the liver become inflamed (swollen and irritated). Over time, this inflammation may lead to scarring that limits liver function.",
