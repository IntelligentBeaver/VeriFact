        "Sept. 20, 2024 – There’s an unexpected treatment for hot flashes and other menopause symptoms that’s getting more popular: clinical hypnosis .",
        "Hypnosis is a state of highly focused attention that works through disassociating, or putting aside your conscious awareness of things that would ordinarily be in your consciousness, said David Spiegel, MD, a psychiatrist with Stanford Medical School.",
        "“It increases your cognitive flexibility – a way to approach an old problem from a new point of view and just let go of your older ways of thinking about it,” he said.",
        "Usually around age 50, women have menopause , which is the end of their menstrual cycles. Estrogen levels drop, and hot flashes can happen 12 to 15 times per day, said Gary Elkins, PhD, a psychology and neuroscience professor at Baylor University.",
        "Both clinical hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy , a common form of talk therapy, have been shown to work as non-hormonal treatments for hot flashes, particularly for women who are unable to take hormones for health reasons, such as having a history with an estrogen-sensitive cancer (like breast cancer ), according to research published by the Menopause Society in 2023."

        "A new review presented at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the Menopause Society in Chicago last week analyzed 23 studies from 1996 to 2022 and compared how well clinical hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy worked as treatments for hot flashes and other menopause symptoms. Researchers found that clinical hypnosis is better at helping make hot flashes less frequent and less intense, even reducing symptoms by 60%. Findings on cognitive behavioral therapy, on the other hand, showed only slight hot flash reduction, though it helped reduce daily stress linked with hot flashes.",
        "Hypnosis can address the “perfect storm” of mental and physical issues that come with menopause symptoms, explained Spiegel, who created a popular self-hypnosis app called Reveri . “You're having a reduction in your levels of estrogen and progesterone , but it's also a reminder that you're going into a different stage of life where you're no longer fertile, you're getting older,” he said. “[With hypnosis], you can disassociate pain and your awareness of things that ordinarily would impede your consciousness and make you miserable.”"
