In the U.S., people generally mean cow's milk when they talk about \"milk.\"",

        "According to a study from 2021, drinking about 1 cup of nonfat milk per day can be part of a healthy diet and is probably good for you if you aren't allergic or lactose intolerant. Drinking nonfat milk every day could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, high blood pressure, colorectal cancer, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and osteoporosis. However, it may also be linked to a higher risk of prostate cancer , Parkinson's disease, acne, and iron-deficiency anemia in infants.",

        "If you've had trouble getting to sleep, a loved one may have suggested that you drink warm milk right before you go to bed. Experts think this may work because milk contains tryptophan, which your body uses to make two brain chemicals: serotonin and melatonin. Both do a few things, but one thing they do is help relax your body for sleep. Try warming some milk with a little honey for a nighttime drink that may help you get to sleep easily and stay asleep longer."

No dairy products naturally have vitamin D; only fortified ones do. And most dairy products only have a little vitamin K. It takes a balance of these nutrients plus other lifestyle factors, such as how much exercise you get, to make strong bones. Although dairy may increase bone density, research shows that dairy products and calcium supplements don't seem to prevent bone fractures in children, teens who are AFAB, or older adults.",
