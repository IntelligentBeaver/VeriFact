        "Sepsis is when your body has a severe response to an infection. During sepsis, your immune system, which normally defends you from germs, starts to attack your body's tissues. This triggers inflammation that can lead to organ damage. It's also common for blood clots to form that lower blood flow to your internal organs, so they don't get the nutrients and oxygen they need.",
        "In severe cases, sepsis causes a dangerous drop in blood pressure. Doctors call this \"septic shock.\" It can quickly lead to organ failure in areas like your lungs, kidneys, and liver . This can be deadly.",
