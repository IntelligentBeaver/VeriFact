        "Ghee is a variation of clarified butter that is popular in the culinary traditions of the Middle East and India.",
        "How is ghee made?",
        "It's made from cow milk butter, treated with low heat until the water evaporates, leaving milk solids behind. The solids are skimmed off or strained if needed. What remains is only clarified liquid fat known as ghee. Because it is treated with low heat, usually under 100 F, it retains more nutrients than standard clarified butter.",
        "How is ghee used?",
        "Some use ghee along with herbal medication as a part of ayurveda, a centuries-old alternative medicine practiced in India. Beyond its believed spiritual and medicinal properties, ghee has recently gained traction as a possibly more nutritious alternative to standard butter. But, while more scientific studies confirm its health benefits, more research is needed.",
        "Ghee vs. butter",
        "Ghee and clarified butter are similar, but there are differences in how you make them. The process starts the same, but with ghee, you cook the butter a bit longer, which turns the proteins golden brown and creates a toasted aroma."
