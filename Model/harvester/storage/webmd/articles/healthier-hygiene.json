        "In the 1981 film The Incredible Shrinking Woman, a toxic brew of ordinary household chemicals shrinks Lily Tomlin’s character to microscopic size. The movie became a smash hit, capitalizing on our fear of the unpronounceable substances all around us.",
        "Today, a growing group of environmental activists, scientists, and ordinary people is calling attention to the possible real-life risks of the products we swallow, spray, and smear on our bodies every day.",
        "“It’s not in question that many consumer products contain toxins -- they do,” says Alan Greene, MD, clinical professor of pediatrics at Stanford University and author of Raising Baby Green . “Most are felt to be in too tiny of a quantity to pose any real risk. But sometimes, very small exposures can have large impacts.”",
