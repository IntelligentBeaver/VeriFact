        "Reiki therapy is based on an Eastern belief that vital energy flows through your body. The idea is that a person who specializes in reiki treatment, referred to as a reiki master, uses gentle touch – or places their hands just above your body – to help guide this energy in a way that leads to balance and healing.",
        "While there’s no research to show that the energy field involved in reiki exists, you may find it relaxing.",
        "Reiki has been studied for conditions like pain, anxiety, and depression . It’s a complementary treatment, which means you use it along with proven traditional medical treatments. It doesn’t cure or get rid of any health conditions by itself.",
        "History of reiki",
        "The reiki healing system, founded by Mikao Usui in the early 1900s, said that people should practice certain standards or values that bring about peace and harmony – ideals that most cultures practice. It was brought to the Western part of the world by Hawayo Hiromi Takata and become popular in the U.S. quickly.",
        "The term comes from two Japanese words: “rei,” which means universal, and “ki,” which loosely translates to a flow of a lifeforce of energy that happens in all living things.",
        "Is reiki a religion?",
        "No, it's not a religion. Those who practice reiki treatment are free to follow their own beliefs and religious practices and make decisions based on these things.",
