During this treatment, your damaged bone marrow stem cells are replaced with healthy ones. Your stem cells may have been damaged or destroyed by the chemotherapy you had. While a stem cell transplant can help extend your time in remission, it's not for everyone. It's an intense procedure, so you’ll need to be in otherwise good physical health. If you have it done, you’ll need several months to heal. If your follicular lymphoma is resistant to treatment or comes back, your team may consider mosunetuzumab (Lunsumio), a combination CD20-antibody and CD3 T-cell treatment. Other treatments include epcoritamab - bysp (Epkinly ). Targeted therapy kinase inhibitors are also used for refractory lymphoma, such as the BTK inhibitor zanubrutinib (Brukinsa ) in combination with obinutuzumab (Gazyva ) or the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat (Tazverik)."
