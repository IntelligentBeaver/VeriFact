        "Your body functions using chemical messages that are directed throughout your system with specific targets. These chemical messages are carried by neurotransmitters, which act as a messenger directing messages from point A to point B. These messages are vital for your daily functions, including the movement of your limbs, the ability to feel sensations, and your response to information from internal body parts and your environment. In addition, the messages passed along by neurotransmitters help to keep your heart beating."

      ],
      "bullets": [
        "Acetylcholine: Acetylcholine (Ach) was the first neurotransmitter discovered. It is a small-molecule neurotransmitter that works with muscles to help them move. To do so, acetylcholine translates our impulse to move into actual action.",
        "Dopamine: Dopamine (DA) is a pleasure chemical that is released during pleasurable activities such as eating and sexual intercourse. In addition, it plays a significant role in motivation, working memory, decision-making, and other functions. Due to its diverse effects on human behavior, dopamine is one of the most heavily researched neurochemicals.",
        "Glutamate: Glutamate (GLU) is a neurotransmitter with many bad associations. For example, too much glutamate in the body can result in the death of neurons. This occurs during a stroke , brain injury, or diseases such as Lou Gehrig’s disease. However, glutamate has some good aspects, too, including aiding in memory formation.",
        "Serotonin: Serotonin (5HT) is also known as a calming chemical due to its role in mood regulation. When insufficient serotonin is present in the body, depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders can occur. Serotonin also affects sleep, appetite, memory, and even decision-making.",
        "Norepinephrine: While norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter, it is also a hormone. It regulates mood, stimulation, vigilance, stress, and memory and has been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder and Parkinson’s disease.",
        "Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid: Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is responsible for inhibiting neural signaling. In cases where it inhibits cells too much, seizures and other medical conditions can occur. GABA also plays a significant role in brain development and has been nicknamed the learning chemical."
