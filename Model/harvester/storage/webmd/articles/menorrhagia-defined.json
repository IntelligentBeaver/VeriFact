        "Menorrhagia is a term for very heavy bleeding during a period or a period that lasts longer than normal. These days, doctors are more likely to call it heavy menstrual bleeding. Typical symptoms include bleeding for more than 7 days, needing to change your pad or tampon every hour for many hours at a time, or passing large clots. If the bleeding during your period keeps you from doing normal activities, that’s not typical. Doctors can help treat your menorrhagia so you have a more manageable menstrual cycle. Here’s what you need to know."

It happens when you don’t have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to your tissues. Anemia can be life-threatening if you don’t treat it. Menorrhagia can also trigger severe cramping and pain."

        "Heavy bleeding is one of the most common problems people who have periods report to their doctors. Out of all the people who menstruate, about 27% to 54% deal with heavy bleeding. It affects more than 10 million Americans each year. This means that about 1 out of every 5 people with periods have it. Your risk of getting menorrhagia changes depending on your age and the medical conditions you have. Your body releases progesterone in response to your ovaries releasing an egg. Progesterone is a hormone that helps keep your periods regular. If you don’t release an egg, your progesterone levels don’t go up, and you may have heavy bleeding. You’re most likely to have cycles without an egg release in the year after your first period or in your teenage years."

        "Certain medical problems can lead to heavy bleeding during periods. Some are problems of the uterus, and others are other medical conditions. These include: Hormone imbalance. During a normal period, estrogen and progesterone work together to help build the lining of your uterus (endometrium). If the amount of either hormone is out of balance, your uterine lining gets too thick and causes heavy bleeding when it sheds. You may deal with a hormone imbalance if you are obese, have an insulin resistance , a thyroid problem, or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS ). Noncancerous growths in your uterus. Some conditions can make the cells in your uterus grow abnormally and cause growths. These include polyps, fibroids, and adenomyosis , a condition where tissue grows into the wall of your uterus and makes it thicken. Cancer. Uterine and cervical cancers can cause heavy menstrual bleeding. Conditions that raise your risk of cancer can also cause it, including endometrial hyperplasia, a condition that thickens your uterine lining."
