        "Prior to the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine , rotavirus infection was responsible for 200,000 emergency room visits, 55,000 hospitalizations, and 60 to 65 deaths each year in the U.S. Worldwide, it is the leading cause of severe diarrhea among young children, leading to 2 million hospitalizations and more than 500,000 deaths of children ages 5 and under annually. Older children and adults can also be infected with the virus, but the illness is generally milder.",
        "Rotavirus disease is highly contagious. The germ is present in the stool of an infected person and can remain viable for a long time on contaminated surfaces, including people's hands. Children catch it by touching something that's contaminated and then putting their hands in their mouths. The spread of rotavirus infection is a particular problem in hospitals and in daycare settings, where it can be easily spread from child to child. It's also easily spread by daycare workers, especially when they change diapers without washing their hands afterward.",
        "Symptoms of rotavirus infection, which may last up to eight days, include fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps , and frequent, watery diarrhea. If it's severe enough, the diarrhea can cause dehydration , and it's the dehydration that's responsible for the hospitalizations and deaths associated with this disease."
