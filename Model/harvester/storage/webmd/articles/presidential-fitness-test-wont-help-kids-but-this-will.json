        "\"I could not do a single pullup,\" Nadolsky wrote in his newsletter, which meant he had to settle for the consolation prize, a red patch. \"A few of my friends were able to do pullups and won the blue patch. I was not happy about it.\"",
        "He worked on pullups every day for the next year. It took him three weeks to complete his first one. A few weeks later, he could do two. And he kept going. The next time he took the test, he completed 26 pullups – which not only earned him the blue patch but also broke his brother's school record."
