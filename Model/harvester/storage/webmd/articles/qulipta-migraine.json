        "The approval of medicines called “CGRP antagonists” has led to big changes in how migraines are managed. These medicines work in a different way than older medicines to treat or prevent migraine. The first CGRP antagonists were only available as a shot, and they were only approved to prevent migraine. Qulipta (kew-LIP-tah) was approved in 2021 to prevent episodic migraine. In 2023, it was approved as the first CGRP antagonist to prevent all frequencies of migraine – including both episodic and chronic migraine. Episodic migraine is when you have up to 14 headache days per month. Chronic migraine is at least 15 headache days per month."

        "Migraine is a condition where you have intense headaches, usually with throbbing pain on one side. The headache can come back again and again and may last for up to 72 hours. You may also have what is called an aura, where you have changes in your vision or other symptoms, such as numbness or trouble speaking.",
        "The active ingredient in Qulipta is atogepant. You may also hear it called a “gepant.” It is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist. CGRP is a protein that causes blood vessels to widen and can lead to pain and inflammation during a migraine. CGRP may also have a role in causing migraine. CGRP antagonists, like Qulipta, prevent CGRP from binding to its receptors and having its effects. Blocking CGRP can help prevent future migraine attacks."
