While electrolysis can permanently remove hair, many teens find it uncomfortable as it irritates the skin. Laser therapy is another method of removing hair in small areas, such as the bikini area. This type of hair removal is expensive, and it may cause scarring. Both of these methods require multiple sessions to permanently end hair growth. It is more expensive than electrolysis and requires topical numbing cream. Both treatments can cause scarring if not performed properly."
