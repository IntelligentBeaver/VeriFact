        "A number of treatment choices can help you if you have advanced prostate cancer. Since this type of cancer needs male sex hormones – called androgens – to grow, hormone therapy can be a good way to slow it down. Also known as androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT, hormone therapy is designed to either stop your body from making the main androgen, testosterone, or to keep it from acting on prostate cancer cells. In advanced prostate cancer that hasn't spread beyond nearby tissues, hormone treatment can help make external beam radiation – another type of treatment for prostate cancer – work better at lowering the chances that the cancer will come back. You'll find that hormone therapy is normally paired with other treatments like this, because alone, it doesn’t cure prostate cancer. If used on its own, it will mainly control your cancer and delay or manage any symptoms of it. You can get hormone therapy intermittently – on for a period, time then off for some time – or constantly. If you're considering hormone therapy for advanced prostate cancer, you should know what to expect if you have this treatment."

LHRH agonists also come as small under-skin implants – often in your abdomen, or belly area – to release the medication to you slowly over time.

This can help manage initial flare-ups in testosterone levels that LHRH medication causes. You might also take these before you get shots or implants or after surgery that removes the testicles. Cells in other parts of your body, such as the adrenal glands, can also make androgens. So you may take other androgen-blocking drugs to keep those cells from making male hormones that cause prostate cancer cells to grow while your current hormone therapy is keeping the testicles from doing so. Taken as a pill, these medications – including abiraterone (Yonsa, Zytiga) and ketoconazole – are often called CYP17 inhibitors because they help stop other cells from pumping out testosterone by blocking the CYP17 enzyme. If your prostate cancer doesn't go away or it returns, you might get androgen-blocking medications plus corticosteroids like prednisone. This can help lower inflammation in the body."
