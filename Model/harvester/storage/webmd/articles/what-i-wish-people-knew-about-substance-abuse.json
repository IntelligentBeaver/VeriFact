All it took was a lady I knew who was dying from cancer, who was a recovering alcoholic say, \"If I have to listen to one of you who aren't actively dying talk about how you have a disease one more second, I'm getting up and leaving.”",

That being said, so have multiple other addicts/alcoholics who stood in that room that day -- and they didn't have cancer. Their lives were ended abruptly by drugs or alcohol. My point is, given an actual choice, I find it hard to believe it would've been the one any of them picked."
