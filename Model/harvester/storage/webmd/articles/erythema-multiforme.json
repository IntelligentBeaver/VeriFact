        "Erythema multiforme is a skin disorder that results from an allergic reaction to either a medication or an infection. Its hallmark sign is red, patchy, raised areas that are shaped like targets (a center sore surrounded by pale red rings). These usually appear on your arms, legs, hands, or feet. They often occur within 48 to 72 hours and get better within one to three weeks.",
        "Erythema multiforme can sometimes be confused with another skin disorder known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, as they appear similar. However, Stevens-Johnson syndrome is more severe.",
