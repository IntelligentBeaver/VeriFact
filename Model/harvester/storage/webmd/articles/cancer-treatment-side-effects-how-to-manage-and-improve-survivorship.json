        "Jul. 10, 2025 -- Cancer therapies can save lives, but they often come with tough side effects that aren’t always fully addressed. What side effects should you expect from cancer treatments – and how can you manage them? We sat down with Elizabeth J. Cathcart-Rake, MD , an oncologist at Mayo Clinic, to explore how these effects impact patients’ physical, emotional, and financial well-being – and why quality of life deserves just as much attention. From nausea and fatigue to neuropathy and sexual side effects, we explore the most common fears and how to talk with your doctor. You’ll learn how different therapies (chemo, hormonal, immunotherapy, targeted therapy) impact your body, plus practical, evidence-based tools to help you feel like yourself during treatment."

  "meta_description": "Cancer therapies can save lives, but they often come with tough side effects that aren’t always fully addressed. What side effects should you expect from cancer treatments – and how can you manage them? We sat down with Elizabeth J. Cathcart-Rake, MD, an oncologist at Mayo Clinic, to explore how these effects impact patients’ physical, emotional, and financial well-being – and why quality of life deserves just as much attention. From nausea and fatigue to neuropathy and sexual side effects, we explore the most common fears and how to talk with your doctor. You’ll learn how different therapies (chemo, hormonal, immunotherapy, targeted therapy) impact your body, plus practical, evidence-based tools to help you feel like yourself during treatment.",
