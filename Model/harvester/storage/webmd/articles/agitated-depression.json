        "It can also happen if you use drugs, withdraw from alcohol, or if you have certain medical conditions. It’s pretty common to feel unsettled if you have hormone problems or a psychological condition like schizophrenia , bipolar disorder, or dementia. Rarely, agitation may be caused by a brain tumor. That’s why it’s important to talk to your doctor if you get agitated, especially if you feel like it’s for no reason.",
