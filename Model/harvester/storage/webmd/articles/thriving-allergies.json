But, he says, as a youth growing up in Chattanooga, without the allergy medications and types of treatment available now, it was a struggle. Add to the mix of challenges two parents who each smoked three packs of Lucky Strikes per day and the chances for drawing an easy breath got slimmer and slimmer.",
        "But Coe, whose desire to be active couldn’t be quelled, has embraced modern medical perspectives on how to face down his allergies. He says he often wakes up sneezing . When he does, he immediately takes his over-the-counter allergy medication. He has an inhaler in case breathing becomes too difficult. For more than a decade, he received injections each month to combat allergens."

If you have a couple things in your back pocket, you know how to turn off the negative trigger. That makes a difference -- the mind and the spirit part of it.\" This approach has helped her overcome the punishment that allergies dole out and remain extremely active."
