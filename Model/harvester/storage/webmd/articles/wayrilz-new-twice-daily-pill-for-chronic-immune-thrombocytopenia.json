        "Wayrilz (rilzabrutinib) is a new oral medicine for adults with persistent (lasting 3-12 months) or chronic (lasting more than 12 months) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who haven't had success with a prior treatment. ITP is a disease where your immune system mistakenly attacks your platelets (cells that help your blood clot). A significant decrease in platelets can cause easy bruising, bleeding, tiredness, and may cause life-threatening bleeding in the brain.",
        "Wayrilz works by selectively blocking a protein in your immune system called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK sends signals to the immune system to destroy platelets. Wayrilz protects platelets by reducing the signals that mark them for destruction and preventing their breakdown by the immune system.",
        "Wayrilz is the first BTK blocker approved for ITP, offering a new way to manage the disease.",
        "Why Was It Approved?",
        "Wayrilz was approved after a study showed that it quickly and consistently raised platelet counts in adults with chronic or persistent ITP who had not responded well to another treatment."
