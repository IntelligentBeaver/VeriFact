        "I was 12 when I was diagnosed. Many of my close friends have only known me since I’ve had Crohn’s. They’ve seen me sick, so I’ve been lucky in that I didn’t have to do much in terms of telling them about it. Those friends have always been so helpful and supportive.",
        "Several years ago, I started to have complications -- three fistulas and an abscess. I did 6 weeks of antibiotics and had a drain, but it turned out surgery was what I needed, so I had a bowel resection in 2019.",
        "Alexa Federico",
        "Dating experiences I felt were going to be hard. I went through great insecurities about my body. I started to feel damaged, which was not fun. The bowel resection left me with a scar on my abdomen. So I really worried about intimacy: What would happen when a guy saw it? But then I realized I have to change my attitude. I just decided that the way to handle the scar, and any other worries about relationships and Crohn’s that I had, was with total honesty."

See how this person responds to you. If you have Crohn’s, there may be times when you go on a date and find yourself stuck in the bathroom for a long time. How does your date act in that situation?

        "That’s key -- never let Crohn’s make you feel like you have to settle. “Ask yourself, do you enjoy being with this person as you talk more in-depth?” Riehl says. “Your Crohn’s diagnosis is just one part of who you are as a person. You want to have fun with the person you’re with. You want to enjoy similar interests.”",
        "You also shouldn’t worry about limitations in relationships. “Many patients of mine with IBS express long-term concerns -- can they have a healthy child, for example. IBS patients can do this, and it’s important to talk about with your doctor and your partner.” Short-term work with a mental health professional can also be helpful when it comes to developing skills to discuss personal goals when you have Crohn’s.",
