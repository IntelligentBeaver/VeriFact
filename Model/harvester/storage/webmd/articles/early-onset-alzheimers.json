        "Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease is a form of the progressive, memory-robbing brain condition that appears in people before the age of 65. It most often shows up when you're in your 40s and 50s. But it isn’t unheard of for people to get it as young as their 30s.",
        "The diagnosis is usually shocking, and it means you need to plan now for big changes ahead so you'll be safe and get the care you need as time goes on.",
        "Because Alzheimer's takes away your memory and your ability to think clearly and, ultimately, to take care of yourself, you'll need a strong support system. Turn to family, friends, local chapters of the Alzheimer's Association, and other groups to get started making a plan for the rest of your life."
