They decided to set sail after Ryan, an athlete, was diagnosed with a genetic disorder called FSH muscular dystrophy, which weakens his muscles over time. Five years into their adventure, they join us from Tahiti to talk about the disease -- and about living life to the fullest, even in the face of illness and fear."
