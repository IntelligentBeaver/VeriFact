And as blood flow slows, your oxygen levels drop. Simple tasks – like walking up stairs or carrying groceries – can leave you gasping for air. But PAH is more than just high blood pressure in the lungs. It strains the heart and affects the whole body. Understanding how it works can help you spot symptoms early, manage complications, and work with your doctor on the best treatment plan."

PAH can also look like other lung and heart conditions, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD ). This makes it hard to know what’s going on. Symptoms start mild but worsen over time. Here’s what to expect: Early symptoms: Shortness of breath (especially with activity) Unusual tiredness Chest pain or tightness Swelling in your legs or ankles Moderate symptoms: Fast heartbeat Pain in the upper right side of your belly (from liver stress) Not feeling hungry Feeling dizzy or fainting Serious weakness or fatigue Advanced symptoms: Severe shortness of breath Coughing up blood Blue lips or nails Very fast heart rate and dizziness Loss of consciousness PAH can be a medical emergency. It’s important to have a plan in case your symptoms suddenly get worse. Keep a kit with the following: Backup pump and catheter supplies Medical alert bracelet or necklace Extra oxygen mask Thermometer to check for infections Blood pressure monitor Phone numbers for doctors, family, and close friends Make sure your family and friends know what to do if your condition takes a turn."

        "The right care plan can help you feel better and slow the disease. Most people take PAH-specific medications to improve blood flow, but other treatments may be needed based on your symptoms and overall health. Doctors often prescribe: Vasodilators to widen blood vessels and make it easier for the heart to pump Endothelin receptor antagonists to block proteins that tighten blood vessels Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators to boost blood flow Diuretics(water pills) to help flush out extra fluid and reduce swelling Blood thinners to lower the risk of clots An activin signaling inhibitor is a newer drug that blocks the protein that fuels cell growth in the muscles around your blood vessels and the cells that line the inner wall. When cell and tissue growth slow down, the walls of the blood vessels may thin and loosen up. This can help blood flow and lower blood pressure in the lung arteries. Your doctor may suggest oxygen therapy if your blood oxygen levels drop too low, especially at high altitudes or if you also have sleep apnea. For serious cases, you may need a special surgery called an atrial septostomy to lower pressure on the right side of your heart. In advanced PAH, a lung or heart-lung transplant may be the only option when other treatments no longer work."
