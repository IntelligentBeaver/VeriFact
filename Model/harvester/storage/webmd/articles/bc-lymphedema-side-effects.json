        "The buildup of lymph, a fluid your body makes, happens when lymph vessels or nodes that the fluid travels through are missing, damaged, or removed. There are two types of lymphedema : primary and secondary. Primary is rare. It happens when certain lymph vessels are missing or faulty at birth. Secondary lymphedema happens when a blockage or another problem changes the flow of lymph fluid through your body's network of lymph vessels and nodes. It can develop not only after breast cancer surgery, but can also come from an infection, scar tissue formation, trauma, deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in a vein), radiation , or other cancer treatments."
