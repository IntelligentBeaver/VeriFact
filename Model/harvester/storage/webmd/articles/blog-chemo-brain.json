Since my results were “blinded,” meaning the data was anonymous for the sake of objectivity, I will never know how I did.",

        "After my chemo ended, the effects continued for several months. Three weeks after my last chemo infusion, on my daughter’s 10 th birthday, she asked that I make “birthday marshmallows” for her class. (She had a crush on a boy who couldn’t eat gluten , so the usual classroom birthday cupcakes wouldn’t do.) I’m a cooking nerd -- so of course, I know how to make homemade marshmallows! It basically involves mixing egg whites , gelatin , and sugar and then whisking them in a standing mixer for about 15 minutes. I’d done it several times before. Well, after chemo, I couldn’t even follow a simple recipe. I messed up the marshmallows three times, going through so many eggs that I had to send my husband to the store to get more.",
