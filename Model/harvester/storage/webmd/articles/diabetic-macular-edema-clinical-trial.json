        "Every prescription medication you take went through a clinical trial before it got to your medicine cabinet. The FDA requires drugmakers to try new medications on large numbers of closely monitored people to prove they’re safe and effective before they can go on the market. While it might sound scary to be a part of medical research, in fact, clinical trials offer many benefits. They may give you access to treatments for your diabetic macular edema (DME) that your regular doctor can’t prescribe. For some people, these treatments may be better than what’s now on the market. Trial volunteers tend to get closer health monitoring than they would in regular care. And, when you’re in a clinical trial for DME, you’re helping advance scientific understanding of the condition and potentially improve treatment for future patients. Find out if a DME clinical trial might be right for you."
