        "Some people experience adverse reactions and health risks when eating foods containing gluten. The peptides—amino acids that form the building blocks of proteins—found in gluten are resistant to stomach acids, which can make it hard for some people to digest them. These peptides can cause various symptoms from mild indigestion to more serious health conditions.",
        "Gastrointestinal discomfort or allergy symptoms can develop as a result of eating gluten. Many people have developed celiac disease . Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system sees gluten as a toxic invader and attacks it, which can cause intestinal damage. People with celiac disease are at a risk of developing more serious disorders if they aren't able to absorb vitamins and minerals very well."
