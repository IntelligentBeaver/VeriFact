Popliteal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a type of deep vein thrombosis that affects one of the blood vessels behind your knees. Both DVT and PVT can sometimes be mistaken for a less-dangerous condition called a Baker’s cyst."

        "When you have DVT, you have a blood clot in a vein, a vessel that carries oxygen-low blood toward your heart after delivering the oxygen to your tissues. A clot is a thick clump that can keep blood from getting through smoothly. The medical term for a blood clot is “thrombosis,” and it can be dangerous when it happens in a blood vessel.",

You could get one if you had recent surgery or pregnancy if or don’t move for a long time, such as when you’re on bed rest. Black people have the highest rates of DVT, followed by white people, Latinx people, and Asian people. Men are at slightly higher risk than women."
