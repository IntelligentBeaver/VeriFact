        "When puberty starts can vary. Genetics, family history, environment, and race can all play a part. But central precocious puberty (CPP) is a very early start of puberty. How early? For girls, it's any time before 8 years old. For boys, it's before 9 years old. Experts believe that CPP happens because an abnormality in the brain causes it to signal the body to start puberty. When that happens, glands secrete different growth and sex hormones – estrogen for girls, testosterone for boys. The abnormality may be because of things like: Tumors Infection Brain injury Genetics Other unknown causes"

For girls, another important goal is to stop the first menstrual period. Medication is an effective treatment for most kids with CPP. Your team may prescribe a type of hormonal treatment to pause the maturation process. It's often a monthly shot. Sometimes, your doctor can implant medicine under the skin, which would be good for up to a year. That could save your child the pain and inconvenience of regular shots. In some cases, treatment actually may be able to reverse the start of early puberty. Your kid will stay on the medicine until the normal age of puberty.
