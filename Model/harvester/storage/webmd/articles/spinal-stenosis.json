        "Your spinal cord is a key part of your central nervous system that connects your brain to your body. It rests in the spinal canal, which is formed by the hollow spaces in the center of each vertebra, the interconnected bones that make up your spine. The narrowing can happen in the spinal canal, in the spaces between your vertebrae, or at points where nerves from your spine branch out to other parts of your body.",
