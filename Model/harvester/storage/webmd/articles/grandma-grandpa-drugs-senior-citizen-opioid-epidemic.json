        "When Joseph Puglisi’s beloved grandfather died, it naturally came as a blow. But the real shock was the cause of death. “I lost my grandfather to opioid abuse,” Puglisi says, “and didn’t even know it till he was on his deathbed.”",
        "Puglisi remembers his grandfather as a kind and fun-loving man whose life changed dramatically after he was diagnosed with arthritis . To relieve the pain, the patriarch and family protector turned to prescription drugs and eventually began self-medicating with fentanyl. The escalation didn’t stop there.",
        "“He was emaciated, but I thought it was the effect of the medications, not knowing that it was an addiction ,” Puglisi explains. “I knew he was an alcoholic and that he sometimes smoked marijuana , but I thought he was sticking to just those vices. It wasn’t until after his death that I found out he had started taking heroin , too.”",
        "Learning the truth made Puglisi angry. “I wanted answers to where he got those drugs, and why he chose not to tell anyone about his addiction.” His grandfather was “pretty secretive,” to say the least – even his part-time caregiver was unaware of the opioid abuse – and Puglisi recalls feeling devastated: “I knew he still had years ahead of him, but also felt he was too old to be abusing drugs and should have known better.”"

Rule one: Don’t throw up your hands. “Addiction is actually a very treatable illness,” Lin says. “A large proportion of people who have it get better.” The process begins with a foundation of trust and understanding, especially between patient and doctor. “It’s also important to realize that addiction is physically doing something to your parent or grandparent’s brain,” Lin adds. “Your family member is dealing with a brain craving.

Methadone, the synthetic opioid best known as a treatment for heroin addiction, can be effective in treating other kinds of opioid dependence.",

Rule one: Don’t throw up your hands. “Addiction is actually a very treatable illness,” Lin says. “A large proportion of people who have it get better.” The process begins with a foundation of trust and understanding, especially between patient and doctor. “It’s also important to realize that addiction is physically doing something to your parent or grandparent’s brain,” Lin adds. “Your family member is dealing with a brain craving. That means all they think about is taking the drug they are addicted to.”",
