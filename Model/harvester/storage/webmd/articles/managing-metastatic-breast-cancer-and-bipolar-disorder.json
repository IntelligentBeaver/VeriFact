        "Living with metastatic breast cancer can be challenging enough, but what happens when you also have a mental health condition such as bipolar disorder? I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in October 2000, nearly 18 years before my metastatic breast cancer (MBC) diagnosis.",
        "My journey with bipolar disorder has been difficult, and when MBC entered the picture, I knew I would have to figure out how to manage the challenges that come with both illnesses. It’s not impossible, but time has shown me that it is a delicate balancing act. I’m often afraid of losing my footing, so I’ve learned some tips along the way to help keep me grounded.",
        "Metastatic breast cancer, also known as stage IV breast cancer, is a form of cancer that has spread beyond the breast to other parts of the body, such as the bones, liver, or lungs. Treatment options for metastatic breast cancer include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormone therapy. Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes extreme shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels. People with bipolar disorder may experience periods of elevated or irritable moods, known as manic or hypomanic episodes, as well as periods of depression. Both illnesses require a treatment plan, under the guidance of medical professionals, to provide the best possible outcome and include medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes."

        "I struggled with managing symptoms of bipolar disorder for many years. During severe periods of depression alternating with mania, I struggled to keep jobs, stay in school, and have meaningful relationships. I felt ashamed about my diagnosis due to the stigma that surrounds mental illness. I spent time in inpatient and outpatient programs during severe crises. It took a lot of time, effort, and discipline on my part to find the right combination of medications and therapy to help manage the often-overwhelming symptoms.",
        "When I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, I was in a manic episode. The bipolar high helped in an unlikely way. I was convinced I could beat my incurable stage IV diagnosis and that energy remained with me all through chemotherapy and the beginning of active treatment. The outside world saw me as exceptionally positive, but really I was just manic. They didn’t see the fear that was underneath the surface. People were much more supportive of my breast cancer diagnosis than they had ever been of my bipolar disorder."
