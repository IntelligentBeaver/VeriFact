        "The earliest medical journals were published in the 17 th century. For the first 300 years or so of their existence, medical journals were printed on paper and eventually came to resemble magazines. Most were published weekly or monthly and mailed out to subscribers. But that all began to change in the late 20 th century with the arrival of the digital era. Today, most users read medical journals on computers, tablets, or smartphones. For example, JAMA delivers over 125,000 copies of its print edition each week, but 2.8 million subscribers link to the journal online."

The American Heart Association produces Circulation , a journal devoted to research on the cardiovascular system. But a handful of large commercial publishers produce most other medical journals.",
        "The articles in medical journals that garner the most headlines are research studies in which scientists do experiments designed to answer questions about disease and treatments: “Does this new experimental drug lower cholesterol ?” for example, or “Will walking 30 minutes a day reduce your risk for type 2 diabetes ?” When an experiment is completed, the scientists compile their results and write a manuscript that describes the study -- what they set out to learn, how they investigated the question, and what they found. Then they select a medical journal that they believe will be interested in publishing the research and send the manuscript to its editors.",
        "In traditional medical journals, the next steps look something like this: First, an editor will decide whether a submitted manuscript has merit and will be of interest to readers of the journal. If so, the editor will next ask a group of experts who specialize in the same field of medicine as the study’s authors to read and judge the quality and accuracy of the manuscript. This process, called peer review, can help identify flaws or errors in how the study was done or in its results, in which case the peer reviewers will suggest that the authors make certain changes to the manuscript. If the study is deeply flawed, peer reviewers will recommend against publishing it. But when a study gets a thumbs-up from peer reviewers, it is usually accepted and published in the journal."
