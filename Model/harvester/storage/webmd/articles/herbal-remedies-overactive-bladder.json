It’s hard to know for sure. “There’s very little scientific research on the topic,” says Linda Brubaker, MD, a professor at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. \"Without quality studies, doctors can’t say if these remedies work, or if they’re safe to use -- either alone or with other medications.”",
