        "About 25 million Americans have asthma,  a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that makes the inner lining of your lungs swell . Between 5% and 10% of Americans with the disease have severe asthma . Severe asthma is categorized by needing medium- to high-dose corticosteroids and other long-acting drugs. Often, these drugs won’t control asthma symptoms, which people with asthma have every night and most days of the week.",
