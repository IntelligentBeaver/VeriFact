        "I'm a registered dietitian, and plenty of people have told me that they’re allergic to milk when they really have lactose intolerance. It’s important to distinguish between the two conditions, as one results in passing symptoms while the other is potentially life-threatening. Here’s the difference between lactose intolerance and a milk allergy, and why using the correct terminology matters.",
        "What Is Lactose Intolerance?",
        "Lactose is a carbohydrate found naturally in milk and milk products such as ice cream. Under normal conditions, the body breaks down and absorbs lactose in the small intestine. People who don’t make enough lactase, the enzyme that digests lactose, experience lactose malabsorption. That’s when lactose passes to the colon (large intestine) and is fermented by gut bacteria, resulting in symptoms such as bloating, gas, pain, nausea, or diarrhea, within minutes to a few hours of eating.",
        "Lactose intolerance typically starts developing after the age of 1. It’s relatively common in the U.S., affecting 36% of the population.  Lactose intolerance tends to be genetic. You’re more likely to have it if your family or you are from an area where it’s more prevalent. African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanics/Latinos have a greater rate of lactose intolerance."

        "Lactose intolerance can be annoying and unpleasant, but it’s good to know that it’s not serious. Although the symptoms of lactose intolerance pass, the condition can have lasting effects on your health when you don’t replace the nutrients in dairy foods with other foods or dietary supplements. This includes protein, calcium, and vitamin D.",

The signs of a milk allergy include hives, an upset stomach, vomiting, bloody stools, and anaphylaxis, which can lead to anaphylactic shock.

People with a milk allergy should always carry an auto-injector that contains epinephrine, as that’s the only way to treat anaphylactic shock.",

Under U.S. law, manufacturers of packaged food products sold in this country must label their products as having milk or milk products on the ingredient label.
