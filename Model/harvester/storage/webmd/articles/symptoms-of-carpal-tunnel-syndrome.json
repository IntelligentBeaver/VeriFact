        "For many people with tingling , pain, or numbness in their fingers, the first thing that comes to mind is often carpal tunnel syndrome. It’s a common condition but not the only one causing problems in your hands and wrists . It helps to know what to look for so you can get the right care. Early treatment can make a big difference in how long it takes to get better.",
        "Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on your median nerve . This nerve gives you feeling in your thumb and all your fingers except your pinky. When it goes through your wrist, it passes through the carpal tunnel — a narrow path made of bone and ligament . If you get any swelling in your wrist, this tunnel gets squeezed and pinches your median nerve, which causes your symptoms."

The earliest symptoms start gradually and often include burning, numbness, tingling, or pain in your thumb, pointer, and middle fingers at night. When untreated, carpal tunnel symptoms can become severe and cause pain and tingling that travel up your arm, “shocks” that come and go, a weak grip, difficulty using small objects, and constant numb fingers. In severe cases, muscle loss and irreversible nerve damage can occur. There are many treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome, and it’s important to see a doctor when you start noticing symptoms."
