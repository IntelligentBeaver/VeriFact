        "The male babies were more prone to a range of developmental disorders in the first 18 months of life, says the study , which was published in the JAMA Network Open . It analyzed electronic health records.",

        "\"All we can hope to detect at this point are more subtle sorts of things like delays in language and speech, and delays in motor milestones,” he said. \"Most children of moms who have COVID during pregnancy won't have neurodevelopmental consequences even if there is some increase in risk.\""
