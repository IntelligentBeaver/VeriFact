        "Could a new device called a portable neuromodulation stimulator (PoNS) help improve your mobility and balance with multiple sclerosis?",
        "PoNS is a device that delivers mild electrical pulses to two nerves in your face and tongue. It’s a short-term treatment for adults with walking ( gait ) and motor control problems. PoNS is available by prescription only for use alongside physical therapy.",
        "This therapy is also called translingual neurostimulation. PoNS has been tested on a small number of people with walking or motor problems caused by MS, and a larger number of people with strokes or traumatic brain injury. PoNS sends electrical signals through your tongue to stimulate nerves that go to the brainstem . It triggers a response in your brain called neuroplasticity. That’s when your brain adapts to nerve and tissue damage caused by diseases like MS. It can stimulate new and improved pathways and change the messages it sends to your muscles and limbs.",
        "PoNS devices are noninvasive. You don’t need surgery to implant any part of the device. Combined with physical therapy, PoNS may improve your balance and walking, although it doesn’t work the same for everyone.",
        "MS can cause lesions or scars in your brain and central nervous system that cause you to lose control of your motor functions, like walking. While physical therapy and rehab can help you learn to adapt and manage your symptoms, there haven’t been effective treatments in the past. That’s why PoNS may be a good addition to physical therapy."
