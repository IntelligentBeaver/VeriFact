        "White tea, which comes from the Camellia sinensis (or tea) plant, is the least processed type of tea, as well as the most delicate in flavor. It’s produced by picking the buds and leaves of the tea plant before they’re fully open. White tea gets its name from the fact that the buds have tiny white hairs on them at the time of picking.",

During the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE), it was a luxury item, given as a form of tribute to the emperor of China. Today, there are several varieties of white tea, including silver needle, white peony, Ceylon white, Darjeeling white, and white pu-erh.",
        "People in China have used white tea for centuries for medicinal purposes. It’s full of antioxidants that may provide many potential health benefits. There is research to back up some of the traditional medicine health claims about white tea, but more is needed."
