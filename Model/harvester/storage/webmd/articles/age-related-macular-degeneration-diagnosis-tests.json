        "Your doctor will check for AMD by testing your vision and examining your retina , a layer of tissue at the back of your eye that processes light. They'll look for tiny yellow deposits called drusen under the retina. It's a common, early sign of the disease. Your doctor may also ask you to look at an Amsler grid , a pattern of straight lines that's like a checkerboard. If some of the lines appear wavy to you or some of them are missing, it could be a sign of macular degeneration.",

They take photos as the dye reaches your eye and flows through the blood vessels of the retina.
