        "A migraine is more than just a whopper of a headache. It’s a bout of throbbing pain that can last for several hours or several days. It increases in intensity over some hours and is often associated with nausea or light/sound sensitivity. You usually have it on one side of your head. Some people get migraines once in a while, but others deal with repeated episodes.",
        "Migraines come in two main types -- with or without aura -- and tend to bring on other symptoms. These complications can be serious enough to send you to the hospital or leave you simply uncomfortable or queasy."
