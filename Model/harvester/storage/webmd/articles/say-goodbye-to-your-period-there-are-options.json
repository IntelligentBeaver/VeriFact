        "Birth control methods work in different ways, and some lead to period suppression better than others. The “pill” – usually a combination of progesterone and estrogen – thins the lining of the uterus, reducing the volume of blood to be shed. Patients who take a 28-day pack of birth control pills take 3 weeks of hormonal pills and 1 week of placebos. The non-hormonal pills, which usually consist of sugar or iron, are meant to help people stay on track with the regimen until the cycle starts again.",
        "The absence of progesterone signals the body to start bleeding. Taking the placebo pills for a week allows the body to go through progesterone withdrawal. Patients who do not take the placebo pills can suppress their period because they never get the signal to have a period."
