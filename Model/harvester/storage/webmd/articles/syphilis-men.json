Sores occur mainly on the external genitals, in the vagina , on the anus , and in the rectum. Sores also can occur on the lips and in the mouth (areas covered by mucous membranes). Transmission of the bacterium occurs during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Persons with either primary or secondary syphilis (in the early stages) can transmit the disease. Pregnant women with the disease can pass it to the babies they are carrying. Syphilis cannot be spread through casual contact, such as with toilet seats, door knobs, swimming pools, hot tubs, bath tubs, shared clothing, or eating utensils."

The sore generally lasts three to six weeks, and it heals with or without treatment. However, if adequate treatment is not administered, the infection can progress to secondary syphilis.
