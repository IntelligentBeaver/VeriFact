        "My boys just celebrated their 14 th and 12 th birthdays. All I can think is, “How in the world did this happen so fast?” Everything you hear about parenting really is true. Time. Just. Flies. I would even argue that if you are managing potentially life-threatening food allergies, the days turn into weeks, months, and years even more quickly. As a parent, you have your head down trying to triple-check every ingredient and every decision to ensure your child’s safety as they grow. And then one day you look up, and you have TEENAGERS!",
        "Of course, there are so many important issues to teach your teens. But if they have food allergies, there are extra concerns to consider. I’ve had several topics in my head as “to-do” chats for a long while, but suddenly I realized the time is now .",
        "My parenting philosophy has always been to be open and honest with my kids, and have all the talks , preferably well before they are needed, so my boys are armed with knowledge as they grow into their lives. I’d like to caveat that I’m very aware of protecting my boys’ privacy, even as I write for this public blog, so please note that they haven’t done anything “wrong” to cause these conversations."

I’m sure it has something to do with hormones, or a not fully matured prefrontal cortex, or even just typical teen feelings of independence and invincibility. But trust me, no matter how many times you’ve had this talk, and how sure you are that your teens know to carry their epinephrine, you need to discuss it again."

And while you are at it, have them practice self-administering it, too. I compare carrying epinephrine to putting on a seatbelt when you get in the car – it is just something we do, without question, every time. You might be surprised if they push back, as if they no longer need to carry epinephrine, or act like this is new information. If so, you’ll be so glad you had the conversation. Keep having it – again, and again, and again! There is no downside to ensuring they understand all the reasons they need epinephrine to stay safe.",

While there is a growing amount of research about the harms of smartphones and social media for young brains, let’s focus on our food-allergic kids seeking out medical information online. As adults, we are all guilty of looking to “Dr. Google” about our medical symptoms, and we know that this can often result in inaccurate or scary information from untrustworthy sources."

My favorites are Food Allergy Research & Information (FARE), Allergic Living, Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Connection Team (FAACT), and right here on WebMD.

Did you know there was an actual “kissing study” done in 2006 that measured how long peanut protein stayed in someone’s mouth after they consumed it? It showed that it took a few hours plus eating another, non-peanut-containing, meal to make sure all traces were gone.",
        "What does this mean for your teen? Brushing teeth, rinsing out mouths, or chewing gum won’t get rid of food allergens. As unromantic as this might seem, your teen must learn to ask their crush what they’ve eaten that day before kissing. Is that awkward? Maybe. But remind them that a potential reaction would be worse.",
        "Ideally, kissing won’t start until your teen knows their significant other well enough to have had the “allergy chat” so their partner knows not to eat food allergens on days they spend time together. After that initial conversation, it will get easier moving forward as they choose outings that don’t involve the food allergens. But, looping back to how teens can be forgetful: Make sure your kiddos know to keep reminding their dates not to eat their allergens over the course of their courtship, just in case."
