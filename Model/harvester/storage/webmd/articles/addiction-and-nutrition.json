        "If you have a substance use disorder, whether it involves drinking or drugs, you could be low on certain nutrients you need to be healthy. In fact, even smoking robs your body of important nutrients. Addiction can cause you to eat too little or choose foods that lack key vitamins and minerals . Chemical substances also make it harder for your body to absorb these nutrients.",
        "A poor diet can make you feel depressed, anxious, and low on energy. Those feelings can lead to cravings for drugs and alcohol and trap you in a stressful cycle.",
        "If you are in recovery for substance use, good nutrition is a crucial part of healing your body. You need to replenish the nutrients you haven’t been getting. This will help restore your physical and mental health . Feeling better in both body and mind can also increase your odds of staying clean.",
