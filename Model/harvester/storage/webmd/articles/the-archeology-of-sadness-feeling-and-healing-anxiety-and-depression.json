        "There is an internal ache that inhabits me like a shameful secret. Its slithering, silvery threads, like miles of molten mercury run through my worming veins, flooding me out from the inside. Some days, the upwelling bursts its banks and chokes the ocean of air in my healing lungs. Breathless and silently screaming, I am washed away like a fine silt to a deeply wounded and original place where there is little air or light or anything nourishing that might sustain life at all. It is a lonely, cavernous place. It is prehistoric and collapsed in on itself. Generations of fossilized fear embedded in my body wall – encrusted and entombed. I have carried a brittle map to this place for as long as I can remember. Only recently, have I begun to make the map for the way home.",
        "My personal map-making is a quest to heal the braided sutures of anxiety and depression that snake through the chambers of my tender heart. For epochs, I denied they were even there. Stuffing and soothing the intelligent gift of my own feelings with personal departures. Alcohol, cigarettes, food, denial, endless going, endless doing, and endless pleasing. I built a false facade, brick by brick by brick: Capable, highly-functioning, and always available. An expedition to my soft center was launched from a health crisis that caused a full crumbling. And I have been humbled to my belly, crawling my way through the rubble ever since.",
        "I have been studying the archeology of my sadness, sifting through shards of finely painted dreams once thought lost to the pile, and gently brushing around the elegant bones buried beneath my life story. The site is precarious. The site is dangerous. I make my way to its outer edges every day and fight my own inertia to rappel in and begin uncovering and recording once again. Every day, I try to descend a little more, surrender a little more. Let it all seep through. Allow myself to feel. Allow myself to flow. Allow myself to ask for help and seek refuge in community."

        "There are days I feel crushed and worthless under the weight of my excavation. Like I’m imploding and eroding. Caving into meaninglessness. I am learning and unlearning how anxiety and depression have impacted my body, mind, and spirit. The impact of unexpressed anger, fear, and grief. The impact of denial. The calcified cause and effect of my unconsciousness. The headaches, the insomnia, the night terrors, the fatigue, the digestive problems, and the flaring psoriasis. Each one an artifact. Each one a pin on the map to a new understanding of how to heal and take care of myself.",
        "This month marks 7 years since my uncle died by suicide. I think about him a lot when I am digging through my pile. I wonder what his cavernous place felt like. I wonder how long he carried his ancient map and if he ever started to make a new one. Sometimes I imagine him beside me, both of us sifting and sweating together in the afternoon sun, fingering for treasures in a shared sand."
