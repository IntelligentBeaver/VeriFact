        "A carbuncle is a red, swollen, and painful cluster of boils that are connected to each other under the skin . A boil (or furuncle) is an infection of a hair follicle that has a small collection of pus (called an abscess ) under the skin. Usually single, a carbuncle is most likely to occur on a hairy area of the body such as the back or nape of the neck. But a carbuncle also can develop in other areas of the body such as the buttocks, thighs, groin, and armpits.",
