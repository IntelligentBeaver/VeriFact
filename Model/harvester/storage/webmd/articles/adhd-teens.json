Non-stimulant medications for ADHD  have different side effects from stimulant drugs. For instance, they don't often lead to anxiety, irritability, and insomnia as the stimulant drugs may. They also are not habit-forming and have less likelihood of being abused than stimulant drugs, which may make them a more appropriate option for teens with ADHD who also have alcohol or drug misuse problems."

Don't nag about what they should be doing, and respect their privacy and wishes when they don't want help. You may also want to do things that show them you’re treating them like an adult. For example, you could invite them out to dinner instead of surprising them by dropping by their apartment.",
