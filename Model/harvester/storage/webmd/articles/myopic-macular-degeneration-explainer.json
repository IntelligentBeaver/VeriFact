        "Myopia is the most common eye condition in people younger than 40. It makes far away objects look blurry. This happens because your eyeball is larger or longer than usual. That makes the distance between the front of your eye and your retina – the part of your eye that converts light into an image – longer than it should be. That makes you lose sharp focus on objects that are far away.",
