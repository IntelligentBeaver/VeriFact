        "When Terri Schiavo died in the national spotlight in 2005, after lingering in a vegetative state for 15 years, interest in living wills -- one form of advance medical directives that allow people to specify their wishes for medical treatment at the end of life -- surged. Newspapers even reported “living will parties,” where friends snacked on brie and sipped wine while discussing respirators and resuscitation.",
        "Experts agree it’s important to plan for end-of-life care -- if only to spare your family the fate of Schiavo’s relatives, who squabbled for years in the courts before doctors removed Terri’s life support in 2005. But adequate planning isn’t as easy as checking a few boxes over a glass of chardonnay.",
