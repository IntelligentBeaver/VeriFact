        "Delirium tremens, also called DTs or alcohol withdrawal delirium (AWD), is an uncommon, severe type of alcohol withdrawal. It's a dangerous but treatable condition that starts about 2-3 days after someone who’s dependent on alcohol suddenly stops drinking.",
        "You are more likely to have DTs if you have moderate or severe alcohol use disorder ( heavy or frequent alcohol use even if it causes physical or emotional harm) . Nearly one-third of U.S. adults will have alcohol use disorder at some point in their lives, and it is estimated that about 1% of those people may get delirium tremens. If untreated, delirium tremens can cause severe symptoms including heart attack, stroke , and death.",
        "How long does delirium tremens last?",
        "DTs usually last 2-3 days, but symptoms may linger for months in severe cases. Your chances of recovering sooner and having a good outcome are better if you get treated quickly, have more moderate alcohol use, and don't have other medical issues, such as dementia or heart disease, which could complicate the condition."
