        "HER2+ breast cancer is fueled by a protein called HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). That’s important, because there are specific treatments that can effectively target this protein and kill the cancer without damaging healthy cells. Some breast cancers, including some that are HER2+, contain receptors for estrogen , progesterone , or both. If yours does, you may be able to use treatments that target one or both of these hormones. Your doctor should tell you about the stage of your cancer. If it's “early stage,” then the cancer is limited to the breast and/or axillary lymph nodes . Stages 0, I, IIA, IIB, and IIIA are considered early stage. Feel free to ask your doctor as many questions as you need for you to fully understand your diagnosis."
