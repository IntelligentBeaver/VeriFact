        "The prostate is a gland that produces some of the fluid in semen. About the size and shape of a walnut , it surrounds the urethra, the tube through which the bladder empties urine. It’s located in front of the rectum, between the bladder and the penis. When the prostate gland is stimulated or massaged, it’s possible for a person to have a type of orgasm called a prostate orgasm.",
        "Prostate massage to the point of orgasm is also sometimes recommended as an alternative treatment for prostatitis , a condition that means the prostate is inflamed. Draining fluid from the prostate ducts can help to relieve pressure. There has even been some research into the effectiveness of an at-home device for prostate massage, particularly in the case of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a type of prostate inflammation that can happen as men age and can cause pain or trouble peeing.",
        "Prostate massage can also be a sexual activity. Inserting a finger, penis, or device into the anus and stimulating the prostate from there can lead to orgasm for some people. You can also stimulate the gland from the outside by massaging the prostate through the perineum, the area between the anus and the scrotum. Orgasm achieved solely through perineum massage is sometimes known as perineum orgasm.",
        "The prostate is surrounded by nerve endings, and some people find that massage can feel good even if they don’t have an orgasm."
