        "Joint pain isn’t quite as certain as death and taxes, but it’s a fact of life for many people. Your joints get a lot of wear and tear, so a past injury or a condition like osteoarthritis can catch up with you as you age. Whether your problem is in your shoulders, toes, or any joint in between, you have a lot of treatment options. One of them is a surgery called resection arthroplasty, also known as excision arthroplasty.",
