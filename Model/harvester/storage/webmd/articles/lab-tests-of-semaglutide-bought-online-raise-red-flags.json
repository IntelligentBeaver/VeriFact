        "Aug. 5, 2024 – Researchers who bought the weight loss drug semaglutide online without a prescription were scammed or sent potentially toxic liquids that did not contain the labeled amount of the drug.",
        "Semaglutide is the active ingredient in the weight loss drug Wegovy , and also in the diabetes drug Ozempic that is often used off-label for weight loss. In clinical trials for Wegovy, weight loss averaged between 6% and 12%, but the medicines are very expensive without insurance coverage, and the maker of the brand-name drugs has struggled to keep pace with rising demand. Wegovy is currently listed on the nation’s official drug shortage list.",
        "The researchers paid between $113 and $360 for a single dose of the products they ordered online. The retail price for a comparable dose (one 0.25-milligram pen of Wegovy) is about $325, and the drug is meant to be taken weekly.",
        "“Illegal online pharmacies, which operate without valid licenses and sell medicines like semaglutide without prescription, represent a consumer risk for ineffective and dangerous products,” the authors warned in a study."
