        "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is high blood pressure in the arteries that carry blood from your heart to your lungs. Your doctor might prescribe high doses of a blood pressure medication known as a calcium channel blocker to help. Most people think of calcium in terms of how it benefits your bones. Your heart needs it, too. The mineral helps your heart pump blood. But when you have hypertension, calcium can cause the muscle to squeeze too hard, which adds to the pressure. That’s why you might need medicine to lower the amount of calcium that goes to your heart."

        "Calcium gets into your cells through calcium channels. Those are cell pathways specifically designed to carry this mineral throughout the body. Calcium channel blockers only block some of the pathways. It’s like closing certain roads and leaving others open. As a result, less of it gets to the heart. Once there’s less calcium in the cells of the muscle lining of blood vessels, your blood vessels begin to relax and open wider. Some of the medications in this drug class also slow the heart rate a bit. All of this adds up to lower blood pressure. It can lower pressure in the pulmonary arteries, too. There are two kinds of calcium channel blockers: Dihydropyridines, which work only on blood vessels and cause them to relax Non-dihydropyridines, which work on both blood vessels and the heart muscle"
