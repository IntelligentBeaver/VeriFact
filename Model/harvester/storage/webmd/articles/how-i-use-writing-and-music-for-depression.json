        "This is especially the case when it comes to caring for your mental health and the treatment of depression, including major depressive disorders. I speak from experience when I tell you that what one person or doctor may find beneficial or helpful, another may find completely useless, to the point they question its existence and legitimacy.",
        "Some doctors lean toward certain approaches over others, as well as quietly oppose others personally. This is something you tend to learn on your own. It often goes unsaid for some time at least, and we as patients have to be cordially proactive and politely vigilant when we're advocating for ourselves about what is or isn't working for us. If not us, then who?"

People with depression often deny their own pain because we don't want to burden others. That being said, I always felt a prescription for an antidepressant would never be enough on its own, either.",

This doesn't necessarily mean publishing the next crowd-pleaser I share with everyone I know. Sometimes just writing down how you feel, what's bothering you, or what you wanted to say to someone but didn't -- regardless of the reason -- helps me immensely.",

While I've heard others say this and add that they prefer something upbeat for obvious reasons, I've found music and art of all genres and varieties to be uplifting, to the point I consider it therapy. As an artistic and creative person, it allows me to take my mind off of my life just long enough that the worst of the sadness often subsides. Music and art have lifted me out of dark times more than once.",

This is because this approach is available to me at a moment's notice. The best approaches are often filled with tactics, strategies, hints, and tips that we're able to put into practice almost anywhere or in any situation."
