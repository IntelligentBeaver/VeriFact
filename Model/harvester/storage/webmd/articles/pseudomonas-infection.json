Or you may have already had a pseudomonas infection and didn't realize it. For instance, Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause swimmer's ear and skin rashes from hot tubs.",

In some people, it can be life-threatening. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common and serious infections people get from being in the hospital."
