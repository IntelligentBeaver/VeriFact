        "High heels have made Susan Juarez's feet ache to their soles, and she even sprained her ankle once while dancing in stiletto boots. But soaring, slimming heels remain the 24-year-old Californian's favorite fashion vice. \"I like that they make me taller, and they just look a lot sleeker,\" she says.",
        "Like Juarez, legions of women have suffered in the name of painful fashion. How many of us have endured strappy sandals that cut into our feet, oversize designer bags that hurt our shoulders, too-tight jeans, and corsets that nip 3 inches off our waists but leave us breathless?",
        "Sometimes, the cure is simple. Replace the enormous tote with a small handbag and the shoulder pain vanishes.",
        "But in more dire cases, the beauty trap turns into true torture. A decade of stiletto heels can create painful foot deformities, and as little as one night of improperly worn fashion contact lenses can trigger a serious eye infection.",
        "Of course, it's only natural to want to look smashing, so don't worry: You need not resign yourself to a wardrobe of ballet flats or shapeless outfits. With an ounce of common sense, experts tell WebMD, you can still turn heads -- and not by crashing down a staircase in your 6-inch platforms."

        "High heels make the legs look more toned and elongated, but poorly fitted ones are a major cause of female foot problems , says Frey, who is also a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. The biggest risk: the bunion, a foot deformity marked by an often painful swelling at the base of the big toe. The big toe can also angle in toward the smaller toes.",
        "\"The No. 1 cause of bunions is a tight-fitting pair of shoes, particularly the high-heel shoe with the narrow, pointed toe box,\" Frey says. \"Clearly, the pointed shape crowds the toes together, and over time, your foot will start to take on the shape of the shoe.\" In general, deformities appear after roughly 10 years of wearing women's fashion shoes, she says. \"Some people can get away with it and not have deformities, but actually, the majority of people pay some price.\"",
        "Aside from bunions, the smaller toes can bend permanently to fit into tight shoes, eventually resulting in hammertoes , Frey says. Pinched nerves, corns and calluses , and ingrown toenails round out the list of the top five women's shoe-related complaints."
