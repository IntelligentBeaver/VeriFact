        "A C-section is a way of delivering a baby by surgery that opens up the mother’s abdomen and uterus. It’s also known as a cesarean birth. They are very common in the U.S., making up about one-third of all births. Sometimes, C-sections are planned in advance — in situations where the baby is very large, in the wrong position, or the mother has an underlying health condition like high blood pressure or diabetes. Other times, they’re done in an emergency, such as if the baby is in distress. You’ll need to stay in the hospital for two to four days after a C-section. You should be fully recovered within six to eight weeks."
