        "A slipped disk – also called a herniated, bulged, or ruptured disk – is a painful condition. While your spine can handle a lot of twisting, flexing , and supporting, it may give you trouble at some point in your life. Each bone in your spine is surrounded by shock-absorbing disks, and these disks are often the ones to blame for your pain.",
        "When the soft spongy center comes through a crack or tear in the outer layer of the disk, it can lead to pain in your back, neck, hips , legs, or buttocks, depending on which disk is affected. Not all slipped disks cause pain, but the majority will. You might also experience tingling, numbness , or muscle weakness, which can make daily activities more difficult.",
        "To help your spinal disk heal, you want to take it easy and avoid overexertion , especially right away. But while bed rest was a common suggestion in the past, it is not the course of action that doctors advise today. Gentle exercise is now the recommended way to get pain relief for a slipped disk, helping your spine heal and return to a healthy state while you keep your body moving."
