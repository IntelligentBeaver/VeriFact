        "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is very easy to catch. With it, you’ll get cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose and cough. Many people get over RSV within a week or two, usually without treatment. But for older adults and infants, RSV can lead to serious, sometimes life-threatening complications. This is especially true for people with respiratory conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd ) and asthma . It can also become very serious for people who have cardiovascular disease or another type of heart disease. Because RSV symptoms are like those of the common cold or flu, you may think it’s OK to dismiss them as relatively harmless. But at the first sign that symptoms are getting worse, you should get medical attention to lower your risk of getting pneumonia or other serious health problems. You can get RSV throughout the year. But it’s most common in the winter months through the spring (roughly November to April or May). It coincides with the peak of flu season. Most babies have at least one RSV infection by the time they’re 2. You can get it again at any age. It’s unusual for it to cause a very serious illness in older kids and most adults. But by age 65, the health risks are greater."

        "The CDC estimates that more than 160,000 older adults in the U.S. are hospitalized with an RSV infection every year, and about 10,000 die. RSV is a leading cause of major respiratory tract illness among adults in the U.S., along with the flu and COVID-19. People with heart disease, lung problems, or other serious medical conditions that weaken their immune systems are at greater risk for serious RSV complications. And if you have asthma, COPD, or heart failure, RSV can make your condition worse. For older adults and people with ongoing health conditions, RSV can lead to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs’ air sacs. Bronchiolitis – inflammation of the lungs’ small airways – is another common complication in older adults who get the virus."

Another clue is flu symptoms often come on faster with a higher fever. That makes many people go to their doctors sooner than people with RSV. Symptoms of RSV and the flu are also very much like symptoms of COVID-19, so your doctor will likely have you test for those as well.
