My liver produces misformed rogue proteins (amyloids) that affect my organs, especially my heart and nervous system. These proteins thicken and harden the walls of my heart, making it harder to circulate  blood throughout my body. ATTR-CM causes shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, fainting, tingling, and numbness in my fingers and toes, and it leads to heart failure.",

Before then, I would get out of the car, walk maybe 20 feet, and have to find something to hold on to because I felt like I was going to faint. Walking uphill or up steps was very difficult. That’s improved, but I still take precautions. For instance, when I’m getting out of bed, I sit up before standing. Once I go from sitting to standing, I walk slowly and stop if I feel woozy.",
