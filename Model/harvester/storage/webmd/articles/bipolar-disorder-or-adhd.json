That's especially true for teenagers in whom irritability and moodiness commonly co-exist as part of a normal adolescence.

Or they may have bipolar disorder with periodic mood changes that shift from depression to mania .",

The higher rate could be the result of more awareness on the part of health professionals. There are those, though, who say it could be a result of a lack of parenting that leads to behaviors that are tagged as mental illness or other conditions misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder.",
