        "April 30, 2025 – The FDA has approved a new cell-based gene therapy for people with a rare genetic skin disorder known as recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) after clinical studies showed significant and longer-lasting benefits from a single treatment.",
        "Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) affects about 200 children every year in the United States, with RDEB being the more severe form. The treatment, known as prademagene zamikeracel or pz-cel but sold as Zevaskyn, is the first and only approved treatment of its kind for RDEB, offering hope to both adults and children who usually rely on regular wound care and protective bandaging.",
        "RDEB is a lifelong condition that usually appears in infancy. It is caused by a faulty COL7A1 gene, which normally helps produce a type of collagen that holds the layers of skin together. When this collagen is defective, the skin becomes extremely fragile, leading to painful blisters and wounds that are slow to heal, prone to infection, and may result in serious health complications over time."

        "The FDA's decision to approve the therapy was based on a clinical trial that showed Zevaskyn was well-tolerated and helped with wound healing and pain relief in patients with RDEB, according to a news release from Abeona Therapeutics, Zevaskyn's maker. After six months, 81% of large long-lasting wounds treated with a single application of Zevaskyn showed at least 50% healing, compared with only 16% of wounds treated with standard care.",

This allows the cells to produce the functional version of collagen protein needed for proper wound healing. Zevaskyn is designed as a sheet of cells that can be surgically transplanted onto the wounds, covering most of the affected area in a single procedure. This helps the wounds to heal, reduces pain, and protects them from infections."
