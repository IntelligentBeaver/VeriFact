        "Michael Snyder, PhD, was on a flight to Norway when he noticed some of his health stats weren’t normal. Several biosensors showed his heart rate and temperature were up. His blood oxygen levels were down.",
        "At the time, he was taking part in a study about the potential roles of biosensors in managing health. Snyder, the director of the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine, didn’t feel sick, but he guessed that was about to change.",
        "“Those signals were really quite strong: The elevated heart rate, the amount of outlying measurements. I knew something was up,” Snyder says.",
        "Because he’d recently spent time outdoors in rural Massachusetts, where many ticks carry Lyme disease, Snyder wondered if he’d been infected. He went to a doctor in Norway instead of waiting it out, and he got a prescription for antibiotics that fight Lyme disease. Sure enough, a blood test in the U.S. would later confirm that’s what he had. He credits his early detection and treatment to those early warning signs from biosensors.",
        "That’s just one success story about the health potential for wearable biosensors. What are they, exactly? The name is an umbrella term that applies to many gadgets. On one end of the spectrum, it includes those wildly popular wristbands that track your every step. But other types of biosensors could also have a big impact on your health -- and lead to better, more personalized care from your doctor."
