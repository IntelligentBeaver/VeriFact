        "Washington state has been home for me ever since I was brought into the world. Thanks to my girlfriend taking a contract out here, I can be closer to family, immerse myself in more nature hikes (compared to the Midwest), and focus on a career I’m enjoying so far.",
        "I've also noticed a decrease in my usual psoriasis symptoms, and I think several factors have played a role in that. Since February, I’ve worked as a mechanical construction recruiter and have placed two candidates with companies. My fitness goals are back on track; I regularly go to the park at least 4-5 days a week. Spending extra time with my sister, nieces, nephews, and extended family members has also given me an extra burst of energy. Despite missing our friends back in the Midwest, we’re finding our stride to make the most of our time out here.",
        "Could it be the air quality and climate that’s treating me better? Possibly. The air seems less polluted and fresher. This stable climate has reduced the dryness and irritation in my skin, as compared to the humid Chicago summers. Out West, it feels like there are so many places to discover, hike, and explore, which always gives me something to look forward to. Spending extra time in nature has helped reduce my stress and improve my overall well-being."

        "One thing that stressed me out regularly was being far from my family. I was the only one in my immediate family living in Illinois, but my girlfriend’s family made me feel like I belonged, which I will be forever grateful for. There seem to be a lot of benefits to returning home to a place that I am familiar with, where a lot of my family and childhood friends are. The sense of belonging definitely contributes to a more stable and mentally positive state. There’s something about being home that is comfortable. I have returned to my roots.",
        "Since starting my new job as a recruiter, I’ve already had a couple of candidates accept offers from my client companies, and I genuinely enjoy the work. It’s one of the first times in a while that I truly enjoyed the flexibility, the day-to-day, and the interactions that I have in this job so far. I would say that finding a career that I’m passionate about has provided a sense of purpose and fulfillment. All while being remote and traveling to new states with my girlfriend as she tackles her surgical technician contracts at new hospitals across the country."

A good balance of everything and a slight change to my environment have definitely played a key role in this upward trend in my encounters with psoriasis.",
