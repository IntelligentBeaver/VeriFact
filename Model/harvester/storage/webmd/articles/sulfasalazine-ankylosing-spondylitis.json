Sulfasalazine can help your spine loosen up and feel less stiff. It also can help other joints. But doctors haven’t shown that it helps your spine move better or that it will help you function better physically. It doesn’t help with inflammation in your tendons either.",

Etanercept is one of a few drugs approved for ankylosing spondylitis that work in a different way.

So other approved drugs might work better for you than sulfasalazine if you’ve already found that NSAID therapy doesn’t work or you can’t take NSAIDs.
