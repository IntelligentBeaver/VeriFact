        "An important part of destigmatizing depression is breaking down common misunderstandings. While the perception of major depressive disorder is changing, many misconceptions linger. For example, people often think depression is something you can brush off or flip like a light switch. They may say things like “cheer up” or “just be happy.” But depression isn't a choice. It's a feeling and it's real. Another misunderstanding is how it appears on the surface. Just because someone looks happy doesn't mean they’re not struggling. Often, people with depression put on a happy face to hide it from others."

        "People sometimes think someone who’s struggling with depression is trying to get attention. But no amount of attention is worth the painful feelings of major depressive disorder. The problem with the ongoing stigma is that it may prevent you from speaking up and getting the help you need. The stigma can even be triggered by your own feelings. In the past, I often felt I wasn’t worthy of help or I had no value because of my depressive disorder. But people with major depressive disorder are some of the most resilient and hard-working people I know. It takes courage to face this condition day in and day out. People with chronic illnesses like cancer or diabetes are often told they’re brave, courageous, and inspiring. People with major depression should be told the same."
