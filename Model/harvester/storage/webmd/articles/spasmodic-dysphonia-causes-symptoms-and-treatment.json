        "Spasmodic dysphonia (or laryngeal dystonia ) is a rare voice disorder that is thought to happen when your brain sends abnormal signals to your vocal folds. It only affects about 1 in 100,000 people. With this condition, the muscles in your larynx (or voice box) have spasms – or tighten up – when you use your voice. While it can happen in children or much older people, it usually shows up in middle-aged people. Both men and women can have SD, but women are affected more."
