        "Clinical trials for MASH are research studies that evaluate potential new treatments for a form of liver disease called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). In a clinical trial, researchers test whether an experimental treatment, such as a new drug or medical device, provides any health benefit to people, such as preventing or treating a disease. Clinical trials for MASH are usually designed to find out whether a treatment improves features of the condition, such as inflammation and the accumulation of fat and scar tissue (known as fibrosis) in the liver.",
