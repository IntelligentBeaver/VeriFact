        "Ovarian cancer is often called the “disease that whispers.” That’s because finding ovarian cancer early can be a challenge. Odds are you might overlook the symptoms or have none until the cancer is advanced. In fact, only 2 out of 10 cases are found during the early stages. Most people tend to have symptoms during the later stages when the cancer has already spread. But by then, the cancer is harder to treat and your chances of survival are lower.",
        "Research shows that if ovarian cancer is found early, it can make a big difference. More than 90% of people with stage I ovarian cancer can live longer than 5 years after diagnosis.",
        "While experts are constantly looking for better ways to screen and test for ovarian cancer, they haven’t had much success. And most ovarian tumors are difficult or impossible to feel during your annual pelvic exam . But in recent years, cancer medicine, with the help of cutting-edge technology, has made some progress in finding newer ways to catch ovarian cancer early."
