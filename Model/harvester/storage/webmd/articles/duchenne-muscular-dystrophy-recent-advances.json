        "There’s no cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), but thanks to advances in treatment, people with the disease now have longer and healthier lives. Years ago, children with DMD rarely lived past their teens. Today, they live into their 30s and sometimes well into middle age. There are also more ways to ease symptoms and protect the heart and lungs.",
        "“These are exciting times,” says neurologist Brenda Wong, MD, director of the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Program at UMass Health Chan Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts. She points to greatly improved heart care for patients and new stem cell and exon-skipping treatments in clinical trials."

It slows muscle loss, helps your lungs  work better, and helps many kids and teens walk for longer.  Steroids also have serious side effects, including slowed growth, weight gain, and brittle bones and fractures. Studies show that Emflaza helps kids as much as prednisone. It also seems to aid normal growth and is a little less likely to cause weight gain and bone loss."
