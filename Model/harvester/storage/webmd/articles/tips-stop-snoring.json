        "Most people snore sometimes. But snoring can be more than just an annoying habit. It can keep you – and your bed partner – from getting needed sleep. That can cause daytime sleepiness and eventually take a toll on your physical and mental health . If your snoring is loud and persistent, it may even be a sign of a serious condition called obstructive sleep apnea . You snore when air doesn't flow easily through your mouth and nose . This can happen when the muscles in your mouth, tongue, and throat relax, which narrows your breathing passages. This causes the soft tissues there to vibrate and make noise as you breathe. If you think you may have sleep apnea, you need to see a doctor. But for garden-variety snoring, some strategies you can try at home may provide relief."

You sometimes feel you can't breathe when you sleep. They may recommend a test to see if you have obstructive sleep apnea, in which your breathing briefly stops again and again while you sleep. Sleep apnea increases your risk of health conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease , and stroke . If you have sleep apnea, your doctor can prescribe a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which blows air into your airway to keep it open while you sleep. In extreme cases, your doctor could recommend surgery.",
