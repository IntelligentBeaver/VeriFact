You and your doctor can make this decision based on your risk of breast cancer.",

Drugs called aromatase inhibitors, including anastrozole (Arimidex) and exemestane (Aromasin), have also been shown to lower breast cancer risk in post-menopausal women. The risks and benefits of using these medications should be discussed with your doctor."
