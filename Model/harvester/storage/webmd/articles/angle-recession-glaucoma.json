In some cases, medicines called antimetabolites are needed with this surgery to prevent scarring and improve the success rate. Another less invasive option might be to implant a tiny drainage tube in your eye to reduce pressure. Though surgery has shown good results for angle recession glaucoma, the success rate is lower for this type than for other forms of the disease."
