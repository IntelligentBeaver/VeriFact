        "Your eyes are critical to maintaining your quality of life. Through an intricate network, the eyes take in information from the outside world, and with their direct connection to the brain, they allow us to process the world around us. Even if you have great vision, it’s important to obtain an eye exam to assess and maintain your overall eye health. Some eye diseases do not show obvious symptoms and affect some communities more than others.",
        "Glaucoma",
        "Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in African-American populations. The risk of glaucoma is 4 to 5 times higher in the Black community, and the risk increases to 20% if a person has a family history of the disease process. In addition to the higher risk, it tends to affect the Black community at earlier ages than other ethnicities. Glaucoma is known as a “silent thief.” Studies have shown that about half of individuals with the disease are unaware they have it, putting them at risk of irreversible vision loss."

        "Chronically elevated blood pressure, also known as hypertension, causes blood vessel injury that can damage organs, including the eyes. High blood pressure is observed in 33% of Americans, and risk factors include a high-salt diet, tobacco and alcohol use, obesity, family history, stress, and ethnic background. Increased prevalence is seen in African American and Chinese American populations, in addition to the male gender and aging populations.",
        "Age-Related Macular Degeneration",
        "Age-related macular degeneration causes loss of central, sharp vision and is the leading cause of visual impairment in adults ages 50 and over. White Americans are at higher risk of developing AMD, compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Dry and wet AMD are the two typical forms. However, nearly 80% of cases are dry and don’t require treatment. Risk factors for developing AMD include family history, UV light exposure, tobacco use, diet, and lack of exercise.",
        "Diabetic Retinopathy",
        "The most common specific complication of type 2 diabetes is diabetic retinopathy. If you’re diagnosed with diabetes, your primary care provider will advise annual eye exams to monitor your eye condition. Diabetes causes the breakdown of blood vessels, which causes leakage of blood vessels in the retina. Risk factors for diabetic retinopathy include a longer time with the disease, high fasting blood glucose, tobacco use, gestational diabetes, and high blood pressure. A multi-ethnic cohort study showed that African American and Latino American populations have higher rates of diabetic retinopathy than White and Chinese American populations."
