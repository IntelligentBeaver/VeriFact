        "Lung disease can interrupt your exercise routine, making it harder to be as active or independent as you once were, says Pat Owens, 76, who lives alone in Tucson, AZ. She uses supplemental oxygen to support her breathing during exercises like squats, leg lifts, and balancing on one leg while she holds onto the kitchen sink.",
        "“I also have some exercise and stretching tapes. I walk inside and when I can, I walk outside too. I do all my own housework, shopping, and laundry,” says Owens, who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). “I try to stay as active as I can, so I can continue to care for myself. My only obstacle is that I can’t move around as fast as I used to. It takes me longer to do things, but at least I get things done.”"
