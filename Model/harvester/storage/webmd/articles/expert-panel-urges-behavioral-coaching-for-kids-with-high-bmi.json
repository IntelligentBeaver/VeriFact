        "June 19, 2024 – The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that children and adolescents with a high body mass index, or BMI, receive intensive counseling – but not weight reduction drugs – to achieve a healthy weight.",
        "In a report issued Tuesday, the USPSTF said that children and adolescents over age 6 with a BMI in the 95th percentile should receive 26 or more hours of counseling a year. The counseling could include supervised physical activity sessions, information about healthy eating and reading food labels, diet and activity monitoring, and help with setting goals.",
        "The USPSTF said it did not recommend weight loss drugs sold under brand names such as Wegovy or Lomaira because there had not been enough research into their effect on children, and they have been known to cause stomach upset. Also, limited evidence shows that people who do take the drugs have weight rebound when they stop taking them, the report said.",
        "“Therefore, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to promote behavioral interventions as the primary effective intervention for weight loss in children and adolescents,” the report said."
