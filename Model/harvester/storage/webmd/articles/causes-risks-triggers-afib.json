        "Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common problem with your heartbeat's rate or rhythm.",
        "Your heart has four chambers – two upper chambers called atria and two lower called ventricles. Inside the upper right chamber of your heart, you have a group of cells called the sinus node, which creates the signals to start each heartbeat. Those signals move across the upper parts of your heart and reach another node, called the atrioventricular (AV) n ode. From there, the signals travel to the lower chambers of your heart.",
        "The basic cause of AFib is disorganized signals that cause the atria of your heart to squeeze very fast and out of sync. They contract so quickly that the heart walls quiver, or fibrillate. The AV node is overwhelmed with signals.",
        "A normal resting heart rate is about 60-100 beats a minute. When you're in Afib, your heart might beat 100-175 times per minute.",
        "Damage to your heart's electrical system can cause AFib. This damage often results from other conditions that affect the heart. But in at least 1 of every 10 AFib cases, other things may be at play. Sometimes, doctors can't figure out what's causing AFib."

But paroxysmal AFib can progress to the persistent type (lasting more than a week) or long-standing AFib (lasting more than a year). It all depends on your risk factors. If you develop persistent or long-standing AFib, you'll need treatment. Because AFib can lead to a stroke, you should talk to your doctor about the best way to manage your symptoms.",
