The American Medical Association officially started calling it a disease in 2013. Obesity affects more than 100 million adults and almost 15 million children in the United States.",

They can work with you to come up with a plan that can include diet, exercise, medicines, and behavior changes to meet your specific goals and needs. And if you need surgery, they can send you to a doctor who does weight loss operations.",
