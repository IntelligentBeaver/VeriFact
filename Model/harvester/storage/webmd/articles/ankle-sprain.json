        "Your ankle joint connects your foot with your lower leg. Three ligaments keep your ankle bones from shifting out of place. A sprained ankle is when one of these ligaments is stretched too far or torn. Anything that stretches your ankle more than it’s used to can hurt a ligament. This usually happens when your foot is turned inward, outward, or twisted.",
        "If you’ve fallen or twisted or rolled your ankle and you’re in pain and have ankle swelling, you may have sprained your ankle.",
        "Most sprains happen when ligaments on the outer part of the ankle are hurt. Treatment depends on how much pain you’re in, ranging from resting the ankle and taking an over-the counter medication to going to a doctor for an exam.",
        "Sprained ankle vs. broken ankle",
        "While a sprained ankle involves torn or stretched ligaments, a broken ankle means that at least one of the bones in your ankle is broken. Symptoms of a sprain and break can be the same, including pain, swelling, and bruising. A broken ankle can take up to 6 weeks to heal."
