And her best friend was not speaking to her because of a fight they had a couple of days earlier. Amanda felt alone and afraid. After a particularly tough algebra exam, she felt her world was caving in. She ran into a stall in the girls' bathroom, rolled up her sleeve, and cut her left arm as hard as she could with her nails. She drew blood , but she continued to scratch and cut. In her mind, self-injury was the only way she could deal with all the dealing with stress .",

And self-injury gradually became a ritual: Every time Amanda was in a stressful or uncomfortable situation, she would \"release\" the bad feelings by cutting her left arm with her nails or even with a razor blade. She carefully concealed the scars to avoid questions from friends and family."
