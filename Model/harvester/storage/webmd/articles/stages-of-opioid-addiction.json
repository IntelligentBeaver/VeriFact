        "Opioids are a class of powerful drugs designed to treat pain. Anyone who takes them, whether as prescribed or not, can develop problems with how they use them. Doctors can legally prescribe opioids to relieve pain. They might prescribe, for example, hydrocodone or oxycodone . Opioids are also available illegally as heroin , prescription pills, illicit fentanyl, and other substances sold on the street. More than 2 million people in the U.S. misuse these drugs. About 90 people die from opioid overdose each day.",
        "People don’t usually develop an addiction or other problem with opioid use right away. Some might not have any problems with taking the drugs. And others might feel symptoms that make them not want to use opioids at all, including nausea , itchiness, or feeling sedated. It’s not clear exactly what makes someone develop addiction or a related problem, but some risk factors include genetics, a personal or family history of trouble with substance use, the strength of the opioid, and how much a person takes and for how long."
