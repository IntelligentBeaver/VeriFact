        "March 6, 2025 – Men whose female sex partners get the itchy vaginal infection called bacterial vaginosis may also start being offered treatment for the condition. That’s because a new study has determined that the infection isn’t simply a women’s health issue but is actually a sexually transmitted disease.",
        "The findings , published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine, mark a major shift in how bacterial vaginosis (BV) is understood and defined, challenging long-held views that it was not an STI. BV develops when there is an imbalance in vaginal bacteria, and research now confirms that sexual activity—particularly with new or multiple partners—can introduce or spread the bacteria that cause it.",
        "Left untreated, bacterial vaginosis (BV) can increase the risk of getting other STDs, including HIV , and also increases the risk of problems during pregnancy and birth. It is the most common cause of vaginal discharge among women of reproductive age. Until now, there has been no way to prevent the infections."
