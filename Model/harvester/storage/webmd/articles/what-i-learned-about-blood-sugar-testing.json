For instance, you have to change your eating habits to make better choices. You also have to read nutrition labels, manage your portion control, and not over- or under-eat. You also must exercise regularly for at least 30 minutes a day for 5 days a  week. This will help to manage your weight, keep you active, and reduce your blood sugar.",

If you have to take medication by mouth or insulin, then you have to take your medicine on time according to your doctor’s orders or eat before you take your medicine, so your blood sugar won’t go too low.
