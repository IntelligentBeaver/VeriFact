If it's not taken care of, uveitis can lead to serious eye problems, including blindness. It's a leading cause of blindness worldwide.",

It's important to get uveitis diagnosed and treated early. Untreated uveitis can lead to permanent vision loss and blindness. You shouldn't delay treatment in hopes that it'll just go away.",
        "How long does treatment for uveitis take?",
        "It depends on the type of uveitis you have, what's causing it, and what treatment your doctor recommends. If your uveitis is related to an infection, it should go away when you get rid of the infection. But uveitis often has unknown causes, or it may result from a chronic autoimmune condition. You should expect treatment to last at least a few weeks. Sometimes, uveitis is chronic and needs long-term treatment. Ask your doctor how long your uveitis treatment will take.",
        "Can uveitis be treated at home?",
        "You'll likely be able to take your uveitis medicines at home. Home remedies may also help your eyes feel better, but they shouldn’t replace medical treatment for uveitis."
