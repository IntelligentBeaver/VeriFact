        "Oct. 28, 2024 –The FDA has approved Orlynvah, a new oral treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women who have limited options for effective antibiotic therapy.",
        "Uncomplicated UTIs are bladder infections that typically affect women who don’t have other issues like kidney disease or urinary tract abnormalities. These infections are common, affecting around half of all women at least once in their lives.",
        "Treating UTIs can be difficult when standard antibiotics don’t work well, often due to antibiotic resistance or certain health conditions. Orlynvah offers a promising new option by combining two drugs, sulopenem etzadroxil and probenecid, in one oral tablet. This combination helps keep the antibiotic in the body longer, making it work better, especially against bacteria that resist traditional treatments. Orlynvah is specifically approved to target infections from bacteria like E. coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Proteus mirabilis , which can be harder to treat.",
        "Marjorie Golden, MD, an infectious disease specialist at Yale New Haven Hospital, described Orlynvah as a much-needed alternative for women struggling with difficult-to-treat UTIs."
