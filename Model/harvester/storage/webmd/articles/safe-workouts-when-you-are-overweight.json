        "Those with larger bodies may feel that others are judging them in fitness-focused settings, said Mathias Sorensen, an exercise physiologist at the University of California, San Francisco. “That alone can create a negative spiral of lowered self-respect or self-esteem.”",
        "But it’s important to realize that, when you’re working out, others are likely too focused on themselves to spend time judging. And if someone is unpleasant, it’s most likely a reflection of their own insecurities.",
        "The physical challenges may also be tough to get used to. “It’s important to understand that there’s going to be significant physical discomfort, strain, fatigue , and frustration,” said Sorensen.",
        "With some movements, you may have more pain in your joints with obesity because you’re carrying more weight. For this reason, it’s important to find movements that aren’t harsh on your body.",
        "For example, you might want to avoid high speeds on the treadmill if you have joint pain, according to Matthew Kampert, DO, a sports medicine specialist from the Cleveland Clinic,. Increasing the grade instead of the speed of a treadmill can be a better option. And if it’s painful to squat, you can swap out the movement with a leg press instead. This will work almost all of the same muscles, but take some of the load off your joints."
