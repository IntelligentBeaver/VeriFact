        "Dogs with diabetes aren't able to make enough insulin , a hormone that allows the body to store energy from food and move glucose into cells. Because this condition has serious and potentially fatal consequences, diabetic dogs are typically treated with insulin injections one or two times each day.",

Store unopened bottles of insulin in your refrigerator. After they have been opened, it is still advisable to keep insulin in the fridge. It can tolerate short periods of time at room temperature in an area where it’s out of direct sunlight.",

Pointing the needle this way will minimize the likelihood that you will put the needle in one side and have it come out the other.",

Go ahead and reinsert the needle into your dog. If you do not get air or blood, depress the plunger to give your dog their insulin injection. Try to give the shot in a different spot every time you give your dog an injection.",
