        "Progressive supranuclear palsy , or PSP, is a rare neurodegenerative disease that is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease because its symptoms are similar. The disease affects an estimated 10 to 12 people out of every 100,000. Because it's so rare, PSP is mostly unknown to the general public.",

        "If you have PSP, you'll have something called \"axial rigidity.\" This causes you to lean backward and extend your neck. This can sometimes cause people with the condition to fall backward. If you have Parkinson's, you'll tend to lean forward instead.",
        "With PSP, you'll develop an eye movement problem that affects looking up and down.",
        "With PSP, speech and swallowing issues are a lot more common. They're also worse with PSP, compared to Parkinson's, and tend to show up earlier in the disease.",

        "With PSP, there's a buildup of protein (called tau) in affected brain cells. With Parkinson's, a different protein (alpha-synuclein) builds up in your brain cells instead."

Another eyesight problem that you may have is not being able to keep eye contact with another person when you talk to them. PSP can also cause \"tunnel vision,\" which sometimes causes problems when you try to drive.",
