        "Even newbie parents can spot diaper rash or a runny nose with no problem, but ear infections may come with only a whisper of symptoms. Yet three-quarters of children will get one by age 3.",
        "\"An ear infection happens when you get infected fluid or pus behind the eardrum,\" says Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP. She is a pediatrician in Atlanta and editor of American Academy of Pediatrics Baby & Child Health . The most common cause? Colds. When secretions get trapped in the middle ear, viruses or bacteria can cause an infection and result in a bulging or reddened eardrum.",
        "Children under 3 are most susceptible to ear infections , Shu says. \"They don't have strong immune systems. They haven't been exposed to many of these germs before, so it takes them a little longer to fight them off.\" Young kids also have more horizontal Eustachian tubes (channels that connect the middle ear to the throat), allowing fluid to collect instead of drain.",
        "Fever may come with an ear infection, but not always, Shu says. Parents might spot other symptoms, such as earaches , ear drainage, trouble hearing or sleeping, ear tugging, poor appetite, vomiting , and diarrhea . But \"for many children, it's just fussiness, crying more than usual, being clingy ,\" Shu says."
