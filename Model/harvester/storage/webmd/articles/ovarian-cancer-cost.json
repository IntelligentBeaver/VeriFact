        "Your treatment may cost even more depending on what type of drug your doctor puts you on. If your ovarian cancer recurs, or if you have certain types of ovarian cancer, your medical team may recommend a class of drugs known as PARP inhibitors. These work very well, but they can be very expensive. The average out-of-pocket cost is about $305 a month, and most patients need to take them for about 3 months.",

        "The costs of ovarian cancer go beyond those just for medical care. If you have ovarian cancer, you may have to miss time at work or may not be able to work for a while. Research shows that people who work and who get cancer treatments such as chemotherapy miss about 22 more workdays a year than noncancer patients. If you can’t work, you not only lose income, but you may also lose your work-based health insurance . You’ll then need to pay your own premium.",
        "In fact, one study found that work loss costs were anywhere from two to four times higher for patients with ovarian cancer who took medical or disability leave after they began chemotherapy. Patients who took short-term disability, for example, reported that they lost about $335 in work income a month over 12 months, compared with $45 among women without ovarian cancer."
