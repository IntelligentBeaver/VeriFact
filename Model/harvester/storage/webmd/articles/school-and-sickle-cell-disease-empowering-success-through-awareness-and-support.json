School is one of the most crucial environments for growth, learning, and socializing, but for children with sickle cell disease, it can also present unique challenges.",

Every school year, I provide the school staff – especially the school nurse and homeroom teacher – with books about SCD and information from the CDC. I always make sure that there is an open door for any questions, too. I believe that we are one team with one goal: to support my princess in the best way possible so she can be successful and safe."

Teachers need to be aware that a child with SCD may require more frequent breaks, might need to drink water throughout the day, and could sometimes appear tired or distracted because of pain. Understanding these needs can create a more empathetic and supportive classroom environment.",

This is especially true for the school nurse since the nurse plays a huge role in managing the child’s health needs during the school day. When your child has SCD, the nurse should be aware of your child’s medication schedule, potential triggers, and the steps to take in case of an emergency. Regular check-ins with the nurse can help monitor your child’s well-being and ensure that their needs are met throughout the day."
