        "July 18, 2024 – In 2021, Emma Javits, 35, thought she was going through a really, really bad depressive episode: She was barely able to get out of bed and do basic tasks. It took 3 years to figure out that her debilitating fatigue was due to long COVID , not just depression.",
        "She had been working as a licensed clinical counselor, running weekly group therapy sessions at an intensive outpatient eating disorder clinic in Los Angeles before the pandemic and throughout its first year.",
        "For Javits and many other mental health professionals, holding space for both her clients' emotions and her own was challenging as the world changed in what felt like the blink of an eye. Maybe her fatigue was from intense burnout, she theorized. As an essential worker, she was able to receive the first COVID-19 vaccine earlier than most, but she eventually contracted the Omicron variant of COVID in 2021.",
        "She had struggled with major depressive disorder long before COVID came into the picture, which was treated with antidepressants. Fatigue was a pretty common symptom when her depression would creep up, but moving her body was always the antidote. Weekly yoga, high-intensity workouts, and cardio were her saviors. Even during her lows, she was still able to see clients and work out, albeit with a considerable amount of apathy and anhedonia – the inability to derive pleasure – which are often linked to bouts of depression."

When that didn’t work, she tried transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) – a noninvasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells – after which she felt a bit more clear-headed for a couple of days, but it didn't help with her debilitating fatigue. She sought out ketamine therapy, use of an anesthetic drug that in some clinical settings is given to help with treatment-resistant depression. It made her body feel relaxed but still didn’t address the fatigue.",

For the past several months, she has been taking low-dose naltrexone , an opiate blocker that is typically used to treat substance use disorder but has recently been studied as a treatment for patients’ extreme fatigue after COVID."
