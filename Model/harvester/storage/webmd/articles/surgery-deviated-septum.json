        "Most people have a septum that is at least slightly off-center. But if your wall is way off, you have a deviated septum. Some people were born that way. For others, a nose injury caused the issue.",
        "If your deviated septum doesn’t affect your breathing or lead to frequent sinus infections, also known as sinusitis , you probably can leave it alone. You may want to talk to your doctor about treatments other than surgery.",
        "But if your deviated septum blocks one or both nostrils so that it’s hard or impossible to breathe through your nose, you may want to consider surgery.",
        "That stuffy nose can be a breeding ground for bacteria to grow. This causes painful inflammation and infection, which may keep you from getting better. If this is the case, an operation might help."
