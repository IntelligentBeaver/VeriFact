        "B-cell lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It affects your lymphatic system, which includes organs, vessels, and other tissues that make up part of your body's defenses against germs and infections. B cells are white blood cells that normally play a key role in protecting you. But when you have B-cell lymphoma, your B cells turn cancerous and grow out of control. There are many types of B-cell lymphoma. In general, they can be aggressive (fast-growing) or indolent (slow-growing). Its symptoms vary a lot, depending on the type of B-cell lymphoma you have and the parts of your body it affects. It's possible to have B-cell lymphoma and no symptoms.",
        "Many treatments can help control B-cell lymphoma, make the symptoms lessen or go away for a time, or offer the chance for a cure. We spoke with Paolo Strati, MD, of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, about the latest treatments, how to get relief from side effects, and why there's more hope today than ever before after a diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma."

        "A: We have many treatment options for B-cell lymphoma today. Immunotherapy has meaningfully increased as an option for B-cell lymphoma over the last few years. These are treatments that use the immune system to fight cancers. The only immunotherapy we used to have for either indolent or aggressive lymphomas were antibodies that recognize one protein on lymphoma cells. More recently, the FDA has approved what's called bispecific antibodies. Instead of recognizing one molecule, they're able to recognize two. They physically bring the immune system closer to the lymphoma.",
        "We also have cellular therapy. For many years, what we have done for either indolent or aggressive B-cell lymphoma has been a stem cell transplant. While we still do those, the utilization of this treatment approach has been meaningfully decreased with the introduction of a specific type of cellular therapy called CAR T-cell therapy. In CAR T-cell therapy, we collect the white blood cells of patients with lymphoma and engineer them in the lab with a virus to make them able to recognize better proteins on lymphoma cells (currently a very specific protein called CD19). Then we infuse those cells back into the lymphoma patient.",
        "Finally, we have what we call antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). ADCs bring chemotherapy right to the lymphoma cells. So it's kind of a combination of immunotherapy and chemo, with an antibody linked to a small amount of chemo."

That's very important for our patients to know because if they have a history of lymphoma and they get treatment and then they have no symptoms, they may make the wrong decision not to seek regular surveillance or medical attention. They need to be aware that even in the absence of symptoms, the lymphoma may still be present. It's always important to be regularly restaged through follow-up checkups to find out if the cancer has come back or has gotten worse after treatment.",

It's very important from the beginning, if any of those symptoms are present, to integrate supportive care.",

The reason is that most of the time, symptoms related to lymphoma resolve very quickly once you start lymphoma treatment. So, our patients may be disease-free more frequently and, as such, symptom-free. But sometimes, even if they are cured and off treatment, they may still have long-term complications from the treatment. Once again, integrating supportive care earlier rather than later may increase the chance that those complications will not be irreversible."
