        "When bread goes stale, it gets hard. The ingredients in bread make the bread spongy and lock in moisture. Over time, the starch molecules in the bread break down, and the bread starts to lose moisture. Sometimes, the starches in the crust will also pull moisture from the inner, spongier part of the bread.",
        "Chips, on the other hand, have the opposite problem. Chips are flash-fried in hot oil to give them their delicious, crunchy texture. Frying them like this causes them to lose most of their moisture. Chips contain starch molecules that absorb water. When they’re left out in the open, they pull that water from the air around them, leading to them becoming less crunchy.",
        "This is part of the reason chip bags have so much empty space. The main reason is that it keeps the chips from getting crushed on the truck or at the store, but the air inside is all nitrogen and no moisture. This prevents the chips from drawing in extra moisture."
