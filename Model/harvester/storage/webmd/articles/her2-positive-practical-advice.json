It tends to be aggressive. The good news is that treatments for this cancer, especially those that directly target HER2, do a great job fighting it off. They come with a range of rather unpleasant side effects, as all cancer treatments do. But there is a silver lining: We know a lot of tips, tools, and strategies to make life during treatment easier."

Cut your hair short to ease the transition. If you want a wig, shop for one before treatment is in full swing. Your scalp will be more sensitive then."
