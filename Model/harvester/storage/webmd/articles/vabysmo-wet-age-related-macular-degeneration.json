        "As a person ages, they may develop a condition that causes their vision to change. One of the most common eye conditions in older people is called age-related macular degeneration (AMD) . This condition affects the retina , which is the layer of the eye that processes the images that you see. The center portion of the retina is called the macula. This portion processes the images in the center of your vision (right in front of you). In AMD, the macula becomes worn down and stops working as well."
