When rheumatoid factor is in your bloodstream, it will help your doctor know if you have rheumatoid arthritis and how severe it is. The test also helps your doctor tell the difference between rheumatoid arthritis and other types of arthritis , as well as other conditions.",

But even if the test results show you have a high level of it, your doctor will want to do other tests before they make a diagnosis. They will examine you and may order other types of lab tests, such as X-rays, a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan, an ultrasound , or other scans.",
