        "A ventilator, sometimes called a mechanical ventilator, is a machine that helps you breathe when you're sick, injured, or sedated for an operation. It pumps oxygen-rich air into your lungs. It also helps you breathe out carbon dioxide, a harmful waste gas your body needs to get rid of.",
        "Even while they help you breathe, ventilators sometimes lead to complications. These problems can result from the ventilator itself, or from things that are more likely to happen when you're on a ventilator.",
        "Ventilator vs. respirator",
        "People sometimes use the word respirator to mean the same thing as ventilator. The CDC defines a respirator as a mask or device that protects you from dangerous particles in the air. But a respirator can also describe a device that helps you breathe, like a ventilator.",
        "Ventilator vs. intubation",
        "Ventilators and intubation are often used together, but they aren't the same. Intubation is a procedure in which a health care worker places a tube down your throat to move air in and out of your lungs. This tube can then be hooked up to a bag or a ventilator machine."
