        "July 12, 2023 -- Can a seemingly healthy person develop high blood pressure? The answer is yes: You can develop primary hypertension, or high blood pressure, even if you exercise regularly, eat healthy foods, and don’t smoke.",

Secondary hypertension is high blood pressure from an illness such as kidney failure , sleep apnea , preeclampsia , or thyroid disease .",
        "Nearly 50% of U.S. adults, or around 119 million people, have stage 1 hypertension (meaning a blood pressure at or above 130/80) or stage 2 hypertension (at or above 140/90), according to the CDC. Having high blood pressure can lead to heart disease -- the leading cause of death in U.S. adults -- but only around 1 in 4 people with high blood pressure have the disease under control.",

Cassels was surprised when his family doctor diagnosed him with high blood pressure in his 40s at a routine checkup. Cassels needed to shed pounds to normalize his blood pressure levels. He adopted a strict diet and exercise plan, and even dropped a pant size."

        "Can You Prevent Primary Hypertension?",
        "Regularly checking your blood pressure can help you get ahead of the disease or get treatments early in the diagnosis. Cingolani suggested buying a blood pressure machine for your home instead of waiting for your next doctor’s visit. If you're obese or overweight and eat salty foods regularly, changing what you eat could “prevent or delay hypertension for years,” he said.",
        "An active lifestyle can also make an impact. Shoot for at least 10 minutes of light to medium exercise intensity 3 days a week, though 30 minutes of physical activity is ideal, said Hoos-Thompson. Swapping overly processed foods for nutritious veggies and fruits, along with limiting carbs and fats -- like pasta, bread, and other starches -- can also help you maintain a normal blood pressure.",
        "Getting enough sleep -- at least 6 hours -- is critical, too, Hoos-Thompson said. “People with sleep disorders are more prone to high blood pressure and resistant hypertension.”"
