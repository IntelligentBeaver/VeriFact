        "Symptoms of celiac disease happen when your body reacts to gluten, a protein in foods that have wheat, barley, or rye. If you have celiac disease and keep eating gluten, your body's reaction to the protein can lead to damage in your small intestines and celiac symptoms. This tissue damage can cause your body to stop absorbing the nutrients it needs from foods you're eating.",
        "Celiac disease can have different symptoms. Yours may be different from someone else's. This is one reason why celiac disease can be hard for doctors to diagnose. More than 200 different symptoms can go along with celiac disease.",
        "By following a diet that's gluten free, you can keep your symptoms under control. It's possible you could have celiac disease and not even have any symptoms you notice. If you're following a diet you think is gluten free and are still having trouble with symptoms of celiac disease, talk to your doctor or see a dietitian. It's possible you're eating something containing gluten, perhaps even in trace amounts, without knowing it. Or you may have another condition."
