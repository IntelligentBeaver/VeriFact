        "A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS for short) is a procedure meant to help blood flow more easily through your liver. It’s usually done to treat complications caused by liver damage.",
        "Normally, blood from your esophagus , stomach, and intestines passes through your liver before going back to your heart. When the liver is damaged, scar tissue can form. This tissue is stiffer than healthy tissue, so it’s harder for blood to move through it. This can cause blood to back up in a major vein, leading to bleeding or a buildup of fluid in your abdomen if the pressure becomes too high. The TIPS procedure connects two main blood vessels in the liver to relieve this pressure and prevent complications."

At the end of the catheter is a small, inflatable balloon attached to a metal mesh tube called a stent. During the procedure, the balloon is filled with air to make space for the stent, which is put in place to create a new path for blood to flow more easily between the two main veins in your liver.",

It can also be done using a local anesthetic, which numbs the area where the catheter goes, so you won’t feel pain. You’ll lie on your back while the area is shaved and cleaned before the catheter is inserted. The doctors will keep an eye on your heart rate and blood pressure throughout the procedure.",
        "The procedure usually takes about an hour to an hour and a half, but it can last up to six hours. Once it’s done, the doctor will check the pressure in your main liver vein to make sure it has gone down."
