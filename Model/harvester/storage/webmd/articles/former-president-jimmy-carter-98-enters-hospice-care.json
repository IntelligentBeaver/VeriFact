The Carter family asks for privacy during this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers.”",

Carter thought he only had weeks to live but doctors at the Winship Cancer Center developed a treatment plan that included stereotactic radiation to control metastatic tumors in his brain and a new immunotherapy drug that worked systemically."
