        "April 30, 2001 -- Kelly Hasten was 17 weeks pregnant when an ultrasound showed that her baby likely would be born with spina bifida , a serious birth defect that can cause devastating, lifelong disability.",

        "A few years ago, the answer would have been no. Hasten's unborn daughter would have been born with spina bifida, which can result in paralysis, poor bowel and bladder control, learning problems, and hydrocephalus, a buildup of fluid that requires surgical placement of a drainage tube in the brain .",
        "But since the late 1990s, doctors at three U.S. hospitals -- Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, and the University of California at San Francisco -- have been operating before birth on such fetuses, hoping to forestall damage to the brain and nervous system .",
        "So far, surgeons have operated on 148 fetuses with varying results, including at least two deaths. Because the procedure is so new, doctors acknowledge it is still too soon to know whether the children who have undergone the operation will be healthier in the long run."
