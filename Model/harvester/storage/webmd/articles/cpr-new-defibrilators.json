Make sure you're prepared -- take a CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) class and get trained to use an automated external defibrillator, or AED. It could mean the difference between life and death."

(Most machines are programmed to talk you through the process, or a 911 operator can assist you.) Minimize interruptions in chest compressions before and after each shock.
