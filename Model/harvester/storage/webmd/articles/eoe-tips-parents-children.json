Around ages 10 to 12, kids are able to understand how other things factor in or trigger their EoE. They’re able to take in more facts. As they get older, it’s also key to go over the EoE basics at least once a year, so you can gauge how much your child grasps about it.

        "Stress happens to everyone, but having a chronic disease heaps on more. Some ways to help open the lines and help your child cope are: Allow your child to express emotions, whether it’s frustration, anger, or unhappiness. Try to quell fears about the unknown. For example, if there’s a doctor’s appointment coming up or a new treatment on the horizon, explain in detail as much as possible about what they can expect and what will happen. Arrange for your child to meet and interact with kids with similar conditions. Keep an eye out for ways your child can make their own choices. For example, they might choose the day of an appointment based on other things that might be going on."
