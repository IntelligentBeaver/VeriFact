From the comedic Captain Wagner in the CBS sitcom hit Elsbeth , which just returned for its third season, to the heroic Perry White in this past summer’s blockbuster Superman , to the tragic Othello in the Washington D.C. Shakespeare Theatre Company’s Othello next year, his list of credits is as deep and dynamic as ever.",
        "With a career that spans four decades and counting, the Juilliard-trained actor shows no signs of slowing his roll—or roles. With Marvel’s Thunderbolts , Jubilee , a musical based on Scott Joplin’s Treemonisha , and Spike Lee’s Highest 2 Lowest in his rearview mirror, 2025 was a “summer of movies and a season of theater.” He takes great pride in his diversity and breadth of work, which he has carefully cultivated with intention.",
