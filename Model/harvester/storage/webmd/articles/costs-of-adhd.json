        "An estimated 8.7 million American adults have a diagnosis of ADHD ( attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ). If you are one of them, you know that it can be expensive to treat – around $14,000 per adult. Copays for office visits and medication can be high, even with health insurance. Societally, ADHD costs $122.8 billion, with most of the burden in excess unemployment and then loss of productivity, according to a study published in 2022 that looked at health insurance claims and published academic and medical research.",
