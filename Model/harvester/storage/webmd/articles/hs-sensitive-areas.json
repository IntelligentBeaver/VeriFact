It's common to get them in your groin area, armpits, bottom, and under your breasts. Why do HS flares show up in these sensitive spots, and what can you do to manage the pain in these areas?"

        "HS happens when hair follicles get clogged with keratin, which is a protein that makes up hair, skin, and nails. Once a clog forms, sweat and bacteria get trapped and build up to form a lump. If this lump gets too full, it bursts and spreads to nearby follicles, causing more lumps to form. The most common places these lumps form are: Underneath breasts In the armpits On the genitals On your bottom On the skin between your anus and genitals On your inner thighs These are all spots where skin touches skin. Typically, they start in the places where you have the coarsest hair, such as your armpits and groin. Later, they spread to other spots, like your breasts. It's possible to get HS lumps in other places on your body, such as your face, neck, or back, but it's rare."

        "Taking care of your skin in these areas is important when you have HS. You may be tempted to pick or pop the lumps, but don't. Squeezing your nodules irritates the area and makes your symptoms worse. Plus, you could introduce other bacteria to the spot and cause an infection. Instead, wash all affected areas with antimicrobial wash, such as acne wash with benzoyl peroxide or zinc pyrithione. This will reduce bacteria on your skin and reduce flare-ups. Don't scrub sensitive areas when you wash. Be gentle and pat dry afterward. Scrubbing and rubbing with a towel only makes inflammation worse. In general, watch for times of day and activities that worsen your symptoms, and work on ways to lessen friction and discomfort in your daily life. Consider telling your school or employer about your condition so you can ask for accommodations. For example: Use (or ask for) a standing desk or a padded chair at work if sitting on sores is a problem. Request a looser work uniform if your clothing is rubbing on sores. Ensure your work environment is cool."

HS and hair removal Because hair follicles are at the center of HS symptoms, removing hair in common spots like the groin area and armpits can be tricky. Dermatologists recommend shaving over waxing. Waxing pulls out hair at the root, which can cause irritation, making HS symptoms worse. Shaving can be gentler, but take care as you do it. Avoid nicks and cuts – which may cause irritation and infection – with these tips: Prep the area by washing well with antibacterial soap. Before shaving, rub shaving gel over the area that foams to help the razor glide smoothly over skin. Go slowly and carefully over the area in the direction of hair growth."

        "Some people use laser hair removal as a solution. Not only does it remove hair where you may want it to be gone, studies show it can reduce flare-ups. Laser hair removal (done by a dermatologist) reduces the number of hair follicles you have, decreases bacteria on your skin, and makes glands less active. This can lead to fewer bumps. When wounds impact your intimate areas, you may wonder how you can have sex without pain or further irritation. People with HS are around 40% more likely to find doing sexual activities difficult, compared to people without HS. Connecting with other people living with HS can be a huge help when you're trying to navigate a successful sex life.
