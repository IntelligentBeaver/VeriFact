        "Maintaining a regular exercise routine throughout your pregnancy can help you stay healthy and feel your best. It can also improve your posture and decrease some common discomforts such as backaches and fatigue. There is evidence that it may prevent gestational diabetes (diabetes that develops during pregnancy), relieve stress, and build more stamina needed for labor and delivery.",
        "If you were physically active before your pregnancy, you should be able to continue your activity with modifications as needed. But some exercises are not a good idea when you're pregnant. Knowing the difference can help keep you and your growing baby safe.",
        "You can exercise at your former level as long as you are comfortable and have your doctor's approval. Low-impact aerobics are encouraged over high-impact ones. Do not let your heart rate exceed 140 beats per minute. If you're a competitive athlete, follow your obstetrician's advice.",
        "If you have never exercised regularly before, you can safely begin an exercise program during pregnancy after consulting with your doctor. Do not try a new, strenuous activity. Walking and swimming are considered safe to begin when pregnant. The CDC recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise per day for 5 days a week unless you have a medical or obstetric complication."
