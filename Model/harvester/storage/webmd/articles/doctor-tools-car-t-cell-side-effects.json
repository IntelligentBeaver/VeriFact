It's a treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that didn't respond to other treatments or that came back afterward. But it can cause side effects. Some side effects are mild. Others may be life-threatening and will need treatment right away. You'll have tests to make sure CAR T-cell therapy is right for you.

        "Most people who have CAR T-cell therapy will get CRS. Another name for it is \"cytokine storm.\" Usually, it isn't serious. CRS starts in the first 2 weeks after treatment. Because it mimics the effects of your immune system attacking a virus, it feels like you have a bad case of the flu . These symptoms usually start 1 to 5 days after the T-cell infusion. They usually last for about a week but may last longer, depending on the methods used to treat it. Doctors can usually treat them with pain relievers like acetaminophen and fluids through an IV. Tocilizumab (Actemra ) is a treatment for CRS. It works quickly to bring down inflammation. CRS sometimes causes more serious side effects like: Fast heartbeat Low blood pressure Trouble breathing While side effects from CRS usually respond to treatment, they can be life-threatening. If your symptoms are severe, you'll need treatment in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). You'll get oxygen, medications, and fluids to control your symptoms."
