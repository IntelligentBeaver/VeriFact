        "Your hand is made up of 27 bones, including those in the wrist. Broken bones most often result from a direct blow to the hand or a fall onto the hand. Common injuries include fractures of the fingertip, or of the pinky side of the palm, or of the thumb.",
        "When doctors describe the bones in the hand, they use several terms. Carpals are the 8 bones in your wrist. They aren’t actually part of the hand but are key to the way it works. Metacarpals are the 5 bones that form the palm of your hand. Phalanges are the 14 small bones that, when strung together, form the thumb and fingers. The thumb has 2 phalanges. The other 4 fingers are made of 3 phalanges each. The knuckles of your hand are referred to as MCP joints. This stands for metacarpophalangeal joint (because the fingers, composed of phalanges, join the palm, made of metacarpals). The joints in your fingers are called the PIP and DIP joints. The PIP joint is the proximal interphalangeal joint and is the joint closest to the palm. The DIP joint is the distal interphalangeal joint and is the joint closest to the fingertip."
