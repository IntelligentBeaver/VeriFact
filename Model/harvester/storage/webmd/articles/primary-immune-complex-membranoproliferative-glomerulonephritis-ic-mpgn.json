        "IC-MPGN happens when your body's immune system creates clusters of proteins called immune complexes, which get stuck in your kidneys. These clusters cause swelling and damage your glomeruli, making it harder for them to clean your blood properly.",
        "IC-MPGN may be caused by certain long-term infections like hepatitis C, autoimmune diseases, or some types of cancer. It can cause blood or protein in your pee, high blood pressure, or problems with your kidney function. Treatment usually focuses on finding and treating the cause and calming down your immune system to protect your kidneys."
