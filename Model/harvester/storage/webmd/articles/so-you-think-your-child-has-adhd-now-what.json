        "Whether it’s been a nagging concern or a bolt out of the blue from a teacher or pediatrician, it can feel like a big deal that your child might have ADHD. This can be especially true when you don’t really know that much about it and your imagination eagerly fills in all the gaps with worries and worst-case scenarios. So, let’s replace that anxiety with some real information.",

        "Because ADHD has such strong genetics, one of the first clues might be a genetic relative who has been diagnosed with ADHD (or it is suspected). You will also want to consider whether your child has notable symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity, compared to kids the same age.",
        "The inattentive symptoms would include distractibility, forgetfulness, disorganization, procrastination, poor time management, and losing items. The hyperactive/impulsive symptoms are more visibly obvious and include physical restlessness, impatience with waiting their turn, interrupting, trouble settling for sleep or quiet activities, stirring the pot when bored, and generally leaping without looking first. These symptoms will tend to be lifelong and happen across different settings (at home and at school; this year’s classes and also last year’s)."

        "You can share your concerns with your child’s pediatrician and see if they think it worth further exploration. You can also ask your child’s teacher to see how your child compares to peers. Teachers are informal experts on child development and have a good sense of how individual students stack up, compared to classmates. They can’t make an official diagnosis, but they may nudge you one way or the other. One thing to remember, though, is that likeable, bright students who are inattentive may fly under the radar by compensating with charm and raw intelligence – until the demands exceed those coping skills. By contrast, students who also have the hyperactive/impulsive symptoms tend to make themselves known.",
