        "Feb. 14, 2024 -- The overall rate of women giving birth with syphilis more than tripled from 2016 to 2022, according to new figures from the CDC .",
        "The figure rose from 87.2 to 280.4 per 100,000 births, the CDC says. More than 10,000 women who gave birth in 2022 had syphilis. The number was 3,400 in 2016.",
        "That has coincided with a sharp increase in congenital syphilis, or babies being born with the disease, CNN reported, noting; “In infants, syphilis can be a severe, disabling and sometimes life-threatening infection.”",

        "The CDC report also said, “Syphilis rates were highest in mothers who were American Indian and Alaska Native, younger than age 25, and had no prenatal care. For 2021–2022, the rate ranged from 45.8 in Maine to 762.6 per 100,000 births in South Dakota.”"
