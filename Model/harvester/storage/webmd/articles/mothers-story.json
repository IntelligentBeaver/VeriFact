        "I should have seen the signs, but when Kristin was arrested, it was the first time I had any idea that she was abusing cough medicine and other drugs. And I have a degree in psychology ! The school did interim reports, and her grades would drop significantly -- but then I’d say something to her and she’d get them back up to the honor roll before the final grading period. This is a kid who’s always wanted to succeed. She did very well in school, was a dancer, made varsity lacrosse in her sophomore year.",
        "I guess I did know something was going on. I always invite the kids to have their friends here, and Kristin wasn’t doing that as much and wasn’t as interested as she used to be in her appearance. Her group of friends started changing.",
        "I thought it was just normal teenage rebellion. I set curfews and put her in therapy, but of course the therapist can’t tell you everything -- that’s a breach of confidentiality. So I thought it wasn’t that severe an issue."
