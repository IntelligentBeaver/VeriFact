        "Asymmetric tonic neck reflex , or ATNR, is one of the primitive reflexes that babies experience as part of brain development. These reflexes are crucial because they help your baby to survive and thrive.",
        "ATNR should only occur during the first few months after birth without any sequential order. Afterward, new types of reflexes called postural reflexes develop. These latter reflexes are more mature and help in coordination, balance control , and sensory-motor development . ‌",
        "ATNR presents as consistent, one-sided movements of the body that go together with proper hand-eye harmonization. This ''fencer’s pose'' is a motion where your baby appears to be challenging an opponent. The head turns to one side, with the arm and leg on the corresponding side extended or flexed in the air. The opposite limbs flex or curl inward.",
        "A baby begins experiencing ATNR while still in the womb, and this reflex can start as early as 18 weeks into your pregnancy. It’s an important type of reflex that helps your baby move through the birth canal during vaginal birth."
