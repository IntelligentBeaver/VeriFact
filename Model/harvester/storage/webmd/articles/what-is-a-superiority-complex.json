        "Superiority complexes were first identified by Alfred Adler, an early psychologist , in his theory of individual psychology. He defined superiority complexes as a reaction to a deep feeling of inferiority.",
        "The idea behind the theory of individual psychology is that everyone is trying to overcome a sense of inferiority. According to this theory, some people react by working hard to master skills and complete achievements.",
        "However, people with very strong feelings of inferiority have a hard time convincing themselves that they have actually achieved enough. To compensate, Adler argues that these people play up their accomplishments and opinions to make themselves feel better.",
        "Other psychologists argue that some people with superiority complexes may not be consciously hiding low self-esteem . Instead, these people genuinely believe that they are more successful than others, despite a lack of evidence. This is different from a sense of confidence because these people have not actually had past successes that support their beliefs.",
        "Today, there is no official mental health diagnosis called a \"superiority complex\". However, this idea can still describe why some people exaggerate their accomplishments and successes."
