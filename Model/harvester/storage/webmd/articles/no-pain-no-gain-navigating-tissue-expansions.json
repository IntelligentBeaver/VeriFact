        "My second time going through the tissue expansion process brought a whole new meaning to the saying “no pain, no gain.” For those unfamiliar with tissue expanders, they’re temporary breast implants with a small valve that can be filled over time with liquid to help stretch the skin and prepare for a permanent implant. The number of expansions required varies from patient to patient, but in my case, I had nine expansions from September 2023 to January 2024.",
        "Contrary to the four smooth and nearly painless tissue expansions I had during my first experience with breast reconstruction in 2022, this time brought a great amount of discomfort. I had become accustomed to the poke of the needle going into my port and barely felt it, given the limited sensation in my breasts after my double mastectomy. However, I wasn’t prepared for the extreme tightness and lingering pain I felt in my left breast for several days after each expansion this time."

        "Since I was only expanded on one side this time around, I could feel the stark difference between my expander and implant. The best way I can describe the sensation is to imagine a hard brick sitting on the left side of my chest and a soft balloon floating on the right. I had radiation treatment on my left side, which is why it’s much tighter than the right. My sweet nurse practitioner was always super cautious not to overdo each expansion to minimize my pain and prevent the expander from rupturing.

However, after waking up to my chest feeling numb, I quickly learned that continuing to sleep in this position would make the journey much more painful. I’ve been using pillows to help me adjust to sleeping on my side or back, greatly alleviating my pain.",

        "Invest in rest. This has been my most-used strategy since the beginning of my breast cancer journey. Understanding that my body’s been through a lot of changes and sometimes just needs time to recover and adapt, while giving myself grace, has been crucial to healing."
