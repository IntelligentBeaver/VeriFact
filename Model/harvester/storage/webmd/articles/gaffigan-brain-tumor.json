        "Last year, comedian Jim Gaffigan and his writer wife, Jeannie, faced a health crisis that nearly ended her life, derailed their family, and halted his career. But innovative technology -- and a little humor -- got them through.",
        "Yes, Jim’s a famous comedian. But ignore his film work, late night appearances, and standup gigs, and the Gaffigan family is like any other loving, if slightly frantic, large clan. Jim and partner Jeannie (in marriage and material -- she’s a writer, producer, and his frequent collaborator) together juggle five young children, joke-making, and insane schedules. And they do their best not to drop any balls, least of all when it comes to their health.",
        "So when Jeannie developed crushing headaches, frequent falls, and severe fatigue in the final months of 2016, she chalked it up to, well, life. The busy mom thought, I don’t have time for this! “I figured I had the flu ,” she says.",
        "It was her kids’ pediatrician who first raised a red flag during a routine visit. That is, if you deem “routine” a single appointment last April with all five children, two daughters and three sons (now) ranging in age from 4 to 13, in tow."

Had it gone unchecked for even a short time longer, she would have had problems thinking and remembering, paralysis, and very likely death, according to her doctor, Joshua Bederson, MD, at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.",

No. This might be it.’ And if things went further south, the priority would be for me to be the continuity in my children’s lives. I knew I couldn’t do that and tour as a comedian and be an actor in films,” says Gaffigan, who next appears in the big screen drama Chappaquiddick in April. “When we finally got out of the woods, my obvious gratitude was about Jeannie.

Jim says he’s been irrevocably “changed by the experience. The writing we do, there’s been a shift. The simple process about talking about it all in a humorous manner has been cathartic for me, but I think it’s cathartic for others to hear about it, too. There’s not a single person out there who hasn’t lost, or almost lost, an important person in their lives.”"
