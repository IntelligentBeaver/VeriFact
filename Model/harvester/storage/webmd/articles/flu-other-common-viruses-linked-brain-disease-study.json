        "Jan. 24, 2023 – People hospitalized with viral infections like the flu are more likely to have disorders that degrade the nervous system, like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, later in life, a new analysis shows.",
        "Researchers found 22 links between viruses and common neurological conditions often seen in older people. The viruses included influenza, encephalitis, herpes , hepatitis, pneumonia , meningitis, and shingles . Those viruses were linked to one or more of these conditions: Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia, and multiple sclerosis.",
        "The authors of the study, which was published this month in the journal Neuron , cautioned that their findings stopped short of saying the viruses caused the disorders.",

Singleton, PhD, said in a news release from the National Institutes of Health. “Our results support the idea that viral infections and related inflammation in the nervous system may be common – and possibly avoidable – risk factors for these types of disorders.”"
