        "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease without a cure that’s often not diagnosed until it’s in advanced stages. When you're diagnosed with a condition such as PAH, it’s important to receive the best care possible. But certain groups may run into obstacles known as health disparities. Health disparities are preventable differences in the way you are cared for due to your race, socioeconomic group, or other factors that could leave you at a disadvantage. PAH gets worse over time, and there’s a high risk of death. Early treatment can help people live longer with this form of pulmonary hypertension (PH). That’s why early detection, better therapies, and aggressive treatments are critical. But disparities in treatment remain a challenge."

          "text": "One thing helping research on PAH and disparities is the Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry (PHAR) -- a database on people getting care at PHCCs. It’s helped to increase research on PAH and see how disparities affect outcomes, Mathai says. More research will lead to better therapies. Both have increased in recent decades, but this area has room to grow, Mathai says. Mathai says PAH drugs can cost anywhere from $50,000 to $250,000 a year. If you have PAH, you may need to be on multiple therapies, which can raise costs. You also may need frequent follow-up visits and tests, which are an economic burden, Mathai says. Insurance can improve care access and outcomes regardless of race, one study found. If more PAH medications are available in generic form, that could also lower costs. Mathai says frontline providers need to know more about PAH so they can diagnose people faster and avoid misdiagnosing them. Doctors who are unsure about symptoms need to refer people to a specialist, Mathai says.",
