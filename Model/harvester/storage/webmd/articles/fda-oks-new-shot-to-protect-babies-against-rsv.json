        "June 10, 2025 – The FDA has approved a new shot to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in babies during their first RSV season, which typically lasts from fall through spring.",
        "Clesrovimab, which is sold as Enflonsia, is the first and only RSV protection for babies that uses the same dose for all infants, regardless of their body weight. This makes it a simpler and more precise option that ensures reliable protection throughout the RSV season.",
        "RSV is a common virus that spreads during colder months through coughs, sneezes, direct contact, or contaminated surfaces. It typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Infants (especially those under 6 months) and older adults are more likely to have a severe RSV infection. RSV can cause bronchiolitis (inflammation of small airways) and pneumonia, sometimes leading to hospitalization. Because it's the leading cause of hospitalization in infants, vaccines and preventive treatments are the best way to protect them.",
        "Merck, the maker of the new preventive, said the FDA's decision was based on two clinical trials. In the first trial, a single dose of Enflonsia was given to newborns, both preterm and full-term, and reduced RSV severe lung infections by 60% and hospitalizations by 84% over five months, compared to a placebo. The second trial showed Enflonsia was as effective and safe as an older RSV medicine (palivizumab) for babies at higher risk, such as those born very early or with lung or heart issues. The clinical trials also showed that Enflonsia was just as safe on its own or with other routine childhood vaccines."
