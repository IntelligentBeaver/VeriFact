        "Ovarian cancer and the treatment for it impact every part of your life, from your relationships to your job and self-image. Living with this condition can be very stressful. While you're undergoing treatments to slow your cancer, it's also important to manage side effects and care for your emotional health. That's where palliative care can help.",
        "Palliative care is a special type of care designed to relieve the symptoms and stress of living with ovarian cancer -- or any type of cancer. It doesn't take the place of cancer treatments, such as surgery or chemotherapy . Instead, it works alongside your cancer treatment to help you feel better.",
        "Studies show that people with ovarian cancer who start palliative care early in their treatment have a better quality of life. They may even live longer than they would have without this care. That's why it's important to talk to your doctor about palliative care as soon as you learn that you have ovarian cancer."
