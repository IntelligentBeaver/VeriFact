LDL is the main source of artery-clogging plaque. HDL, on the other hand, clears cholesterol from your blood.",

You'll find these in many processed foods like doughnuts, frozen pizza, cookies, and crackers. You can also get it from milk, eggs, meat, and other animal products. Over time, without you even being aware, this extra cholesterol collects inside your body and begins to do damage."
