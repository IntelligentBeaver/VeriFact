My migraine lingered for a bit longer, but when I stood up, I realized just how desperate I was for relief. I had tried to muscle through my migraine episodes for years and had saved my prayers for the big stuff -- like Aunt Margaret’s death or best friends with breast cancer. It was a reality check that I needed help. I can do only so much when it comes to relief from migraines, and then I need something stronger. I need someone stronger."
