        "Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts and ABC inspired me when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007. It was refreshing to see that her employer publicly supported her and chronicled her experience. In 2012, when she was then diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), ABC once again partnered with Roberts to use their platform to bring public awareness about her health plight. This is a great example of when a company demonstrates humanity to its employee, which ultimately increases the public value of their brand.",
        "Unfortunately, not every breast cancer patient has a supervisor or works for an organization as understanding as ABC. For some, it may be challenging trying to balance one’s health and job expectations. Furthermore, in addition to the obvious privacy considerations, survivors generally don’t want to be defined by their disease. Conversely, they do want to work for a company where they can be their authentic self and be supported. I can relate to this."

This would be in stark contrast to my previous job where I worked for a breast cancer organization. That is until one day when someone came to my office (I work in the creative communications field) and mentioned that they wanted to launch a department-wide breast cancer awareness campaign.",

I was only a few months into this new venture and had already spilled the beans, so to speak. But I became a credible messenger and steered the campaign to a place beyond what the organization had ever experienced. In this case, my past fueled my passion, and it gave me purpose beyond what my job description entailed.",
