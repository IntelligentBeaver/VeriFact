        "Every year, around 700,000 women in the U.S. are sterilized, or get their “tubes tied.” Tubal ligation is a surgery that blocks the fallopian tubes (the tubes that link the uterus to the ovaries) to prevent pregnancy. For American women aged 15-49, this method is more popular than birth control pills : 14% of women use the pill , while 18.1% get their tubes tied.",

But tubal ligation reversal surgery isn’t as common as it once was. That’s because doctors often suggest in vitro fertilization (IVF) instead of reversal surgery. With IVF, a specialist combines eggs and sperm in a lab. From there, the fertilized egg (also called an embryo) can be placed into your uterus for pregnancy.",
