        "Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a chronic pain disorder that affects the fascia (the connective tissue that covers the muscles) and causes inflammation . MPS may affect a single muscle or a muscle group. In some cases, the area where a person has the pain may not be where the myofascial pain generator is located. Experts believe that the actual site of the injury or the strain prompts the development of a trigger point that, in turn, causes pain in other areas. This is known as referred pain.",
