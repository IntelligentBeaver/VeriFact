Most people get calcium in dairy products; dark, leafy greens; and fish (canned salmon and sardines). But doctors advise people to get their calcium from foods, not supplement pills. Some studies suggest that too much calcium can lead to a higher risk of heart disease. If you don’t think you get enough calcium from food, talk to your doctor before you begin supplements."
