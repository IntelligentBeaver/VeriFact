        "The diet encourages you to eat fruit, become aware of your hunger and fullness levels, and eat dinner by 8 p.m. There aren’t strict meal plans or calorie counts. For lunch and dinner, you’ll eat what you always have, but stop when you’re 80% full, and you’ll skip dessert after dinner.",

        "You could lose weight simply because you’re eating fewer calories. Besides testimonials, there is no proof that this diet works."

        "Does It Work?",
        "The Morning Banana Diet will probably work simply because you’ll eat less. There is nothing, though, about a morning banana that specifically promotes weight loss.",
        "There’s nothing magical about not eating anything after 8 p.m., however. But if you eat late now, this tip will likely cut out some calories. Stopping eating when you’re 80% full will help, as well.",
        "Few other diet programs focus on sleep like this one does, but multiple studies show that people who get 7 to 9 hours a night tend to weigh less. When you’re tired , you’re more likely to overeat and eat unhealthy foods.",
        "Despite the diet’s concern that exercise might stress you out, working out can help with stress and sleep in addition to burning calories.",
        "If you’re not up for huge changes, this diet should appeal to you, as it’s more of a gradual transition into healthy eating and weight loss. If you build these skills into your routine, you’ll see the weight drop off and stay off.",
        "Is It Good for Certain Conditions?",
        "Any healthy diet that leads to weight loss is good for diabetes, high cholesterol , high blood pressure, and heart disease. If you follow the concepts in the diet and cut back on how much unhealthy food you eat, you should be able to better manage your conditions.",
        "The Final Word",
