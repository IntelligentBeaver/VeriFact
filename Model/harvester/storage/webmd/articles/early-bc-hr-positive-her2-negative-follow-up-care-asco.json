        "Breast cancer survival rates have come a long way in recent years. Thanks to better detection and treatment, more than 80% of women with early-stage breast cancer live at least 10 years. About 8 million people worldwide are living after a breast cancer diagnosis. Many doctors will consider you “cancer-free” if all of your signs and symptoms of cancer are gone after five years. But even if you’ve beat breast cancer, you’re likely to face physical and emotional challenges after treatment. Researchers at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Meeting offered insights on how breast cancer survivors can tackle these issues head-on and thrive after treatment."

In her presentation, Luis outlined what she sees as the main problems with the current survivor follow-up care models: They are “oncology-driven” and tend to focus solely on tracking cancer recurrence. There’s a lack of coordination between supportive care specialists and other doctors. There’s not enough supportive care. There’s a lack of personalization."

        "Luis proposed that digital tools could solve some of these issues. Several models are in development that use remote monitoring and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve follow-up care. Luis said that these sorts of digital health tools could offer better individualized care for patients. The digital tools may also provide remote monitoring and improve communication between different health specialists. Additionally, they could boost patient empowerment, self-management, and supportive care delivery, Luis said. She provided an example of the Young and Strong Program for Young Adults with Breast Cancer at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. This resource is used to educate patients on symptom management and survivorship issues. Though digital tools appear to be a promising resource, Luis said there are some obstacles. For one, they need to be available in all languages and accessible for diverse populations. She also stressed that more research needs to be done to prove that these digital tools can be effective. “There is an urgent need to accelerate research, but also to improve the robustness and scalability of the digital health infrastructures that are serving us to ensure a large-scale, sustainable impact on survivorship care delivery,” she said."

Hot flashes “Almost every patient complains at some point of time about hot flashes,” Janni said. He went on to describe possible remedies: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This is a type of talk therapy. Research suggests it can help you work through negative thoughts and feelings, so you can manage hot flashes better. Exercise. Regular physical activity can help lessen the frequency of hot flashes over time. Medicines. Examples include gabapentin, melatonin, venlafaxine, and newer drugs, like fezolinetant. Genitourinary Syndrome Many breast cancer survivors have genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which is due to low estrogen. Symptoms include vaginal dryness, pain during sex, and frequent urinary infections. In his presentation, Janni said that research shows these treatments can help GSM: CBT Exercise Pelvic floor exercises Vaginal moisturizers Fatigue Studies show about 1 in 4 breast cancer survivors have severe fatigue, even 10 years after a diagnosis.
