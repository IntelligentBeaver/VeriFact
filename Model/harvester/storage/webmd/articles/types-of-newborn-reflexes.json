        "Root reflex. This newborn reflex is triggered by touching the corner of the baby’s mouth. Your baby will turn their head in the direction of the touching. With their mouth open, they’ll “root” in that direction. This rooting aids in feeding, as it helps the baby find the bottle or breast that will nourish them. This reflex lasts about 4 months.",
        "Sucking reflex. The rooting reflex sets the stage for the sucking reflex, which allows the baby to breastfeed safely. When the nipple touches the roof of the baby’s mouth, they automatically begin to suck. The sucking reflex helps coordinate the rhythms of sucking, breathing, and swallowing. This reflex gets stronger the more the baby does it and will evolve into habits like sucking their thumb for comfort."
