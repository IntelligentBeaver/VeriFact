        "Asterixis is a disorder in which a person loses motor control of some parts of the body. It is commonly called flapping hand tremor because the muscles in the fingers and the wrists are typically affected. ‌A person with asterixis loses muscle control and experiences irregular jerking movements in the hands. If you have asterixis, the movement of your hands may resemble the flapping of a bird's wings.  This motion is why asterixis is also known as flapping hand tremor. ‌"

Scientists do not yet have a clear understanding of how these changes lead to flapping tremors. Other causes of asterixis are still unknown or have not yet been explained in detail. ‌"
