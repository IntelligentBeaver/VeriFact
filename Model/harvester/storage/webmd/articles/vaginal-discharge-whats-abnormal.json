        "Vaginal discharge, also known as leukorrhea, is a fluid that's usually clear or whitish and comes from your vagina. It's an important housekeeping function in the female reproductive system. Glands inside the vagina, uterus, and cervix produce a fluid throughout the day that carries away dead cells and bacteria, which is the stuff you might see in your underwear from time to time. This keeps your vagina clean and helps prevent infection.",
        "Most of the time, vaginal discharge is perfectly normal. The amount can vary, as can odor and color, depending on the time in your menstrual cycle. It may also smell different when you're pregnant, or if you've been letting your personal hygiene slide.",
