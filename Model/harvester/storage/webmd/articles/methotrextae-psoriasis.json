        "Methotrexate is a strong drug that could help clear up your psoriasis . It’s part of a class of medications called antimetabolites that stop cells from dividing and slow their growth.",
        "In psoriasis, methotrexate blocks enzymes and cells that cause inflammation and puts the brakes on your too-active immune system . This can heal the scales on your skin and stop them from coming back.",
        "Your doctor may prescribe methotrexate if your psoriasis covers more than 10% of your body or if topical medicines or light therapy don’t clear your skin. They may also suggest it if you have psoriasis in sensitive areas like your face, scalp, genitals, palms, feet, or the inside of your mouth.",
        "Although no drug works for everyone, methotrexate improves psoriasis symptoms in many people. If it works for you, your skin will probably start to get better in 4 to 6 weeks. Some people have clear or nearly clear skin in 6 months.",
        "Methotrexate costs less than some medications used for psoriasis. That means health insurance plans may pay for it more often than newer, more expensive drugs. These are reasons your doctor may prescribe it instead of biologics, which work better for psoriasis.",
        "If methotrexate doesn’t clear or nearly clear your skin, ask your doctor to suggest one of the many other drugs that work well for psoriasis."
