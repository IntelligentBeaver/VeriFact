        "Many women get breast cancer. But the disease is deadliest for non-Hispanic Black women. And when it comes to metastatic breast cancer, women of color are less likely to get timely treatment that follows national guidelines. According to Grace Suh, MD, medical director at Northwestern Medicine Cancer Center Delnor, lack of access to health education and regular medical care is a big part of what’s fueling this disparity. And medical centers are actively trying to find and fix differences in breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment that fall along racial lines. “Regardless, despite all these efforts, there still remains a significant gap in health equity,” Suh says, “And we recognize that.” Here’s some of what we know so far about what affects breast cancer treatment in women of color."

        "Systemic drug therapies are typically the go-to for breast cancer that’s spread to other parts of your body, also known as stage IV or metastatic breast cancer. But there may be a benefit to surgery and/or radiation therapy for some people. Treatment of metastatic breast cancer typically includes one or more of the following drugs: Hormone therapy Chemotherapy Targeted therapy Immunotherapy But metastatic breast cancer isn’t the same in everyone. “In general, it’s actually multiple different diseases,” says Sarah Schellhorn, MD, a breast oncologist with Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital and an associate professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. “And we tailor therapy based on biology and what’s driving the cancer.” The types of drugs your doctor chooses for you depend on things like whether your cancer is aggressive, fueled by hormones, or tests positive for HER2 (a protein that helps cancer cells grow). But they’ll also consider how treatment will impact your overall health and well-being."
