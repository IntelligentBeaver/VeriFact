        "Bright red, tender skin is often the mark of a summer day spent outdoors. But sunburn is not a healthy glow. It’s a sign of skin damage that can lead to premature aging and skin cancer. Even if you “tan, don’t burn,” you’re inviting trouble, says David Leffell, MD.",
        "“Any amount of unprotected sun exposure is damaging to your skin,” says Lefell, professor of dermatology and surgery at the Yale School of Medicine and author of Total Skin . “Even a tan is a sign that your skin has been injured by ultraviolet (UV) rays.”",
        "Over time, sun exposure can cause a range of skin damage, from age spots and wrinkles to skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma and melanoma . “I tell people that if they’re not worried about cancer , they should at least protect their skin for vanity’s sake,” Leffell says.",
        "But it is possible to enjoy the summer -- and even the summer sun -- without burning. By learning a bit about how sun damage happens and taking a few simple precautions, you can enjoy a summer free of sunburn."
