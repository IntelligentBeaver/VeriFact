        "Paralysis is when you can’t move certain parts of your body after something goes wrong with their connection to your brain. It comes in many different forms and can be temporary or permanent, or even come and go.",
        "Someone who is paralyzed because of a sudden injury often can’t feel or move anything at all in their affected body parts. Someone paralyzed by a medical condition, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), might feel tingling or muscle weakness.",
        "Paralysis can cause problems with blood flow, breathing, how your organs work, speaking or swallowing, sexual responses, or controlling the urge to go to the bathroom, depending on where you’re paralyzed and how bad it is.",
        "What is temporary paralysis?",
        "Some people with paralysis regain their ability to move the muscles involved. So, their paralysis is temporary. For example, that happens with Bell's palsy, a type of facial paralysis. There's also a rare condition called periodic paralysis that causes sudden repeated attacks of muscle weakness, stiffness, or paralysis. The symptoms go away between attacks.",
