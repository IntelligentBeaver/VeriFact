Experts aren’t sure what causes pernicious anemia . Some people are born with it, but that’s rare. Symptoms can include: Tiredness Pale skin Weakness Fast heart rate Your body also needs B12 to make red blood cells. That’s what carries oxygen to your tissue and organs. You can become anemic when you don’t have enough. “Pernicious” means deadly. But it’s not so deadly anymore. Today, there are simple ways to treat this kind of anemia. Your doctor will likely give you a B12 shot in your muscle. You’ll get it once a week until your levels are normal. After that, you may need a shot or high-dose supplement once a month for the rest of your life. If you don’t like shots or pills, ask your doctor if a B12 nasal spray is right for you."
