        "Playing on a community or school sports team is a great way for teens to stay in shape and learn teamwork. That's probably why more than 38 million American children and teenagers play at least one sport.",
        "Sports physicals typically start in middle school and go through high school. Many club sports, however, do not require a physician's clearance.",
        "No matter which sport your teen plays -- whether it's soccer, football, baseball, track, or martial arts -- there's always a risk of getting hurt. The casualties of teen sports can range from minor sprained ankles and repetitive strains, to more serious conditions like heat stroke or concussion. Some kids have serious allergic reactions to bees and other stinging insects found around playing fields.",
        "To avoid getting hurt or sick on the field, court, and track, teens need to be prepared. That preparation starts with seeing a health care provider for a sports physical to make sure their bodies are ready for the season ahead and that there isn’t a family history or past medical history that requires further attention.",
        "Some states won't let young (middle school-age) athletes start a season or play a new sport without first having a sports physical. Even if your state doesn't require a sports physical, it's a good idea for every teen who plays a sport to get one annually to make sure they're in top shape and healthy enough to safely participate."
