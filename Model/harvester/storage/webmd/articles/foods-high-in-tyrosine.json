        "Tyrosine is one of the 20 amino acids that people need to make proteins. It is a non-essential amino acid — which means your body can make it, so it doesn't have to be included in the diet. In fact, tyrosine is a building block that appears in almost every protein in the human body.",
        "Your body makes tyrosine from an essential amino acid called phenylalanine. A small percentage of people can't process phenylalanine because of a condition called phenylketonuria, or PKU. They might need to take tyrosine supplements, although doctors usually take a different approach to treating PKU.",
        "Studies have suggested that tyrosine supplements could help people with memory and performance when under stress, or that tyrosine might help sleep-deprived people be more alert, but further research is needed to support this. Most people do not need to take tyrosine supplements. Many foods contain tyrosine, so it is unlikely that you have a deficiency.",
        "Also, the body has a way of regulating its tyrosine intake. If you get too little tyrosine in your diet, your body will manufacture more. If you take in too much, the body will break it down. Supplements aren't usually needed and probably wouldn't be used by the body."
