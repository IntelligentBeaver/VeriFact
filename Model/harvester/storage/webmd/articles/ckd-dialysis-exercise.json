        "Kristal Higgins, 42, has been on dialysis to treat her chronic kidney disease since 2010. She goes to her kidney clinic three days a week for about three hours, and when she factors in travel time it takes up about four hours of her day. But she still makes time to walk for about 10 to 15 minutes with her two small dogs every day. “When it comes to my health, there are many things I can’t control, like my kidney disease,” says Higgins, who lives in Olive Branch, Mississippi. “But I can make sure I at least get some exercise in to make me feel better, both physically and emotionally.” It may seem tough, if not downright impossible, to fit regular exercise into your schedule if you’re on dialysis for chronic kidney disease. But it’s important that you do. A 2021 study published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases found that people with advanced kidney disease who exercised regularly were about 50% less likely to die from any cause than those who didn’t. “Regular exercise helps to reduce risk of other conditions that people with advanced kidney disease tend to be more vulnerable to, such as heart disease or type two diabetes,” explains Laura Maursetter, DO, a nephrologist at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine in Madison. “It also boosts mood, which is important since patients on dialysis are more likely to experience anxiety and depression .”"

        "There are a few reasons why people with CKD who are on dialysis find it so hard to stay active. The biggest barriers are: Lack of time. “I have patients who tell me that dialysis for them is a full-day activity – it takes them two hours to get to their center in New York City, four hours for dialysis, and then two hours to get back home,” says Goldfarb. “If you do that, you have very little time to get to everything else you need to get done, including work, family, and running a household.” Extreme fatigue. Many people feel exhausted after their dialysis, and it can take them a day or two to recover, says Maursetter. Fluid loss after dialysis, for example, can cause temporary low blood pressure in patients that leaves them feeling weak, dizzy, and nauseous. In addition, “your kidneys control the production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen that your body needs for energy,” Maursetter says. “When your kidneys aren’t working properly, they can’t do this as well. You’ll feel more tired as a result.”"

        "The CDC recommends that all adults get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise like brisk walking a week and do two days of muscle-strengthening activity like lifting weights. But most people on dialysis aren’t able to do that, at least initially, says Maursetter. Here are some exercise guidelines for CKD patients on dialysis: Check with your doctor. People with CKD often have other conditions, like heart disease, that can make exercise more of a challenge, says Goldfarb. Your doctor can recommend whether you need to see other specialists, like a heart doctor, before you begin an exercise program. If you have been very sedentary, there may be some steps you need to do first. “We often have patients start with physical therapy , where they are under professional supervision, and meet with a dietitian to make sure they get enough protein and calories to prevent muscle wasting,” Goldfarb explains. Start small. Most people who are on dialysis for their CKD can often only do a few minutes of exercise before they fatigue, says Maursetter. “I often recommend that people focus on short, five-minute bursts of activity during the day and then gradually build up to one longer 30-minute session,” she says. If you’re watching TV, for example, stand up and walk around the room during commercial breaks. Or walk your dog in two 10-minute bursts each day. As you build muscle and stamina, you’ll be able to be active for longer, reassures Maursetter."

        "Resistance training is important for people with CKD since it helps ward off muscle loss. But it can be tough to find time. “I often recommend patients bring resistance bands to dialysis so that they can do some easy exercises while they wait, or even just chair yoga,” says Maursetter. Research shows that this is safe and makes you stronger so you can do more things. Don’t overdo it. While it’s always good to push yourself, people with CKD need to pace themselves, especially if there has been a change in their dialysis plan or in their medication, warns Maursetter. Not sure? Check your breathing. You should still be able to talk to someone while you work out, according to the National Kidney Foundation. When Betts started dialysis, she was so weak she could barely walk for more than a few minutes. But over time, she was able to build up to a couple of miles, with rest breaks built into the workout.
