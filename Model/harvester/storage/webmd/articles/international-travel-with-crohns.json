        "Traveling is something that I believe everyone should do, especially international travel. There’s so much culture and life happening, much of which is very different from what we experience at home. I believe it’s so important to learn and see how other people live all over the world -- it really helps you to appreciate what you have, and it helps you to connect with others from all different walks of life.",
        "Whether you’re someone who loves to travel often like I do, or someone who saves up for one nice vacation once a year, everyone enjoys taking a trip every now and then. But even a small trip can be turned into a hassle when you have to deal with other issues, like having Crohn’s. Not only do you have to plan ahead tremendously, but there are a lot of things you have to be prepared for while away.",
        "The thought of being sick in a foreign country where you don’t know the language, or don’t know how to find medical attention, can be terrifying! On my first big international trip after being diagnosed I was definitely worried and really didn’t know how my body was going to handle it."

        "As someone who’s extremely passionate about traveling (before and after being diagnosed), it’s important to still be able to fully experience a place and its culture. And a huge part of that is being able to try new foods -- something that makes most of us Crohn’s patients extra nervous. I was especially nervous about this when I took my first trip out of the country after being diagnosed -- would I be able to still try new foods, or would it ruin my trip because I’d end up feeling sick the whole time?",
        "Surprisingly though, I’ve still been able to try tons of new cuisines while traveling! Funny enough, I can even eat things that normally I would expect to make me feel sick at home.",
        "One of the biggest tips I have for traveling internationally with Crohn’s is always look up restaurants beforehand. I like to typically eat at local places, which sometimes means there aren’t a lot of Google reviews. But it’s helpful to see how touristy a place is, or if you see any reviews about food poisoning. If you can’t look a place up, my rule of thumb is usually to look for the place with the most local people inside. Anytime I’ve ever gotten sick, it was from a touristy restaurant, or God forbid the buffet breakfast bar at the hotel! That place is a petri dish for germs."

        "While I highly recommend everyone to travel somewhere outside your comfort zone at least once in your life, no matter what health conditions you believe are stopping you, I wouldn’t automatically suggest eating as adventurously as I do (especially if you have Crohn’s). But it’s never a bad idea to slowly try a few new things here and there, until you’re more comfortable or understand more about your own triggers.",
        "I’ve always believed that having Crohn’s shouldn’t be a reason for not doing something or missing out on experiences that “normal” people get to do without a second thought. I’ve heard from others with Crohn’s who’ve said they’re scared to travel because of all these reasons, but I encourage you to not let fear dictate your life. Chronic health problems often cause a lot of fear for people, and I think it’s crucial to fight against it in order to fully experience life. Traveling the world is what I most enjoy, and although I now have to put in a lot more thought and preparation than I did before Crohn’s, it’s still always worth it."
