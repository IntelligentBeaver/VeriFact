        "“Studies show that masks don’t impact air exchange, even for people with severe emphysema ,” says Bradley Hayward, MD, a pulmonologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian in New York City. “Your breath might feel warmer. But if you think that’s uncomfortable, imagine being on a ventilator because you got COVID-19.”",
        "You might have heard that masks cause a dangerous buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) that you end up inhaling. That’s a myth, too. CO2 particles are so small that they easily pass through masks, including special protective masks called N95s. Even so, if you do have very severe lung disease and feel uncomfortable, talk to your doctor about finding the best mask for you."
