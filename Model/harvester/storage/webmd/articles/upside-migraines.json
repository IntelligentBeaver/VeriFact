        "In the midst of a migraine , it probably seems like there couldn't possibly be anything good about them. However, researchers have found some potential benefits associated with migraines . They've also found some possible reasons migraines may be related to our evolution as a species. While it probably won't make your migraines any less painful, knowing the upsides may make them a little more bearable.",
        "In a French study of nearly 75,000 women who were followed for 10 years, those who had active migraines were one-third less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those without migraines. The protective benefit only lasted as long as the migraines, though. If their migraines improved, the women's chances of developing diabetes returned to normal.",
        "Researchers aren't clear about why people who have migraines are less likely to develop type 2 diabetes, but this research confirms what headache specialists have noted for years. One possible reason could be that high blood sugar levels prevent you from developing a headache. Another theory is that the protective effect is related to CGRP, a protein molecule that's active in both type 2 diabetes and migraines."
