        "Carvykti (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) is a type of cancer immunotherapy known as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy , which works to help the body’s immune system find and attack cancer cells. When CAR T-cell therapy is given, a machine initially removes T cells (immune cells) from your blood, while the rest of your blood is infused back into your body. Your collected T cells are then sent to a laboratory, where they are genetically modified to attack cancer cells. Once the modified T cells are ready, people undergo chemotherapy infusions to prepare their body for the infusion of the CAR T-cell therapy."
