An epidemic of sexually transmitted HPV is now swirling around the U.S. and the U.K., with some serious cases leading to oropharyngeal cancer , which can affect the back of the throat, tonsils , and tongue.",
        "HPV is the leading cause (70%) of this oropharyngeal cancer, according to the CDC. It is the most common sexually transmitted disease ( STD) in the nation, and around 3.6% of women and 10% of men report oral HPV specifically. But over the past decade, oropharyngeal cases have been steadily falling a little under 4% and 2%, respectively, according to the National Cancer Institute.",

        "Studies show the HPV vaccine to be extremely effective in lowering sexually transmitted HPV cases . Yet, only 54.5% of young people ages 13-15 have taken the recommended two to three doses, according to the National Cancer Institute."
