        "Type 2 diabetes didn’t cause my foot pain, but, as I hobbled through the fall, having to abandon my beloved walks with friends and enter a 3-day-a-week physical therapy routine, it made me think of all the things that neglecting your diabetes can do to your feet."

        "A physical check of your soles and between your toes can help discover if there are things happening that have escaped your notice.",

        "Moisturizing, then pushing them back gently, is preferable, once again to prevent injuries.",
        "The same advice applies to calluses and corns. Hold the line at the nail salon on techs who come at you with sharp tools or acids that burn the skin off your feet. These are not medically necessary and open small fissures in the skin that can lead to trouble. Thick moisturizers are preferable."
