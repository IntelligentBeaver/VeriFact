It’s like diabetes, but easier to live with, in my opinion.",

It doubles your protection because it protects you from partners who aren't HIV negative and who aren’t on medication. They may not know they have HIV. So even those with multiple or anonymous sexual partners at risk of HIV can be protected from the virus."
