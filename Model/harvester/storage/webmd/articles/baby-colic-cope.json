        "As new parents will attest, there's almost nothing more unnerving than a crying baby . Worse still? An infant who won't stop crying, regardless of what you do. If your baby fits this bill, it could signify that dreaded C-word: colic.",
        "As many as one in five infants are colicky , a condition characterized by inconsolable crying and fretfulness for hours at a time -- sometimes round-the-clock but usually at the same time of day, typically in the late afternoon or evening. These babies often have excessive gas and may repeatedly pull their knees to their stomachs and clench their fists in distress.",

Nor is there a definitive test or X-ray doctors can use to diagnose colic in infants.",
