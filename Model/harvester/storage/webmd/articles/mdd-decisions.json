        "By Arielle Wozniak, as told to Stephanie Watson From as early as I can remember, my dream was to be a doctor. I can recall drawing pictures in kindergarten of me dressed in a doctor's robe at the bedside of a patient. In my freshman year of college, anatomy and physiology crushed that dream, so I decided to shift my dream to being a super successful corporate CEO living in a high-rise in New York City. Both my old vision and new vision revolved around one thing: success. I had no plans of ever getting married or having children. Fast forward to my senior year of college, when I met my now husband. Within months we were engaged, and less than a year later we were married and expecting our first child. Add a cross-country move from Connecticut to Georgia and my life was going nothing like I’d planned. That started the spiral of major depression for me. On the recommendation of my mom (who’s also a therapist), I tried therapy. But it was basically me sitting on a couch while a therapist asked me questions for 45 minutes. It was like pulling teeth to get more than a \"yes\" or \"no\" out of me. It wasn't working and I wasn't sure why."

A ton of healing came out of that process. About a year later, I got pregnant with my second child and decided to quit all my medications cold turkey. If you're thinking about getting off of meds, I don't recommend doing what I did, because I went through some pretty serious withdrawal when I stopped.

So many people reached out to me and said, \"I'm going through the same thing you went through.\" They asked for my advice. That was a really eye-opening experience. In 2019, I decided to get certified as a health and wellness coach and start my own podcast. Today, that podcast has reached over 20 countries. I hear from women all over the world who tell me the impact that my story has had on them. I now get to help them set goals and find their path forward. I've had countless success stories. One woman called me while sitting in her car, crying. It was the first time in her life that she was unhappy. We worked together for about 12 weeks. By the end of it, she was back to her normal self, smiling, laughing, and planning for the future with her husband. To me, that is making an impact – not just on her, but also on the family and friends who are part of her life. Every single day I get to tell people, \"You're not alone. There are so many people who have gone through this before and have healed. There is a light at the end of your story.\" To go from the point of not wanting to live anymore to truly being happy and sharing my story to help others be happy is mind-blowing."
