Often this impact can lead to isolation, which can further hurt your personal well-being. Getting support and treatment can help with both the physical and emotional effects of TD."

If you haven’t already, it would help to: Stop smoking Quit using illegal substances Get diabetes under control Exercise regularly Get good quality sleep Stay in touch with your doctor Making small changes can improve your life. Use voice to text instead of typing on your phone, and use an electric toothbrush or razor to make daily tasks easier. Your mental health is equally important to protect and preserve. To feel your best, add these practices to your life: Don’t go it alone. Talk to people you trust about what you’re going through. Use online resources and support groups to connect with others living with TD. Find a counselor or therapist who can help you work through the mental challenges of your condition."

        "The FDA approved two medications in the last few years specifically to treat TD symptoms. They work by adjusting the levels of dopamine in your brain, which helps turn down the extra muscle movements in your body. They are: Deutetrabenazine (Austedo) Valbenazine (Ingrezza) The potential downsides to these medications is that they can be expensive. You may also have concerns about adding a medication to your daily regimen. Talk to your doctor about potential side effects and financial assistance options. Try other therapies. Some people get benefits from botulinum toxin (Botox) injections to the face. These injections block facial nerves so they can’t move involuntarily. The treatment only lasts a few months, but you can repeat it. You could also be a candidate for deep brain stimulation, which is a procedure in which a surgeon implants tiny electrodes in your brain that block the abnormal nerve signals causing your involuntary movements."
