        "As the seasons shift, inclement weather means going indoors for quality workouts. Going to the gym isn’t easy in general. For those with psoriasis, it can allow the anxiety to grip us. We have intense flare-ups on our legs, arms, faces, backs, and necks, and other areas. Our feelings suggest that we do not belong. We isolate ourselves because we think that others will not accept us. That is not the case.",
        "Regardless of the situation, there’s a mental block that stops us from going or staying consistent. In December 2024, I committed to three to five workouts a week. My stress levels were all over the place, and my flare-ups were noticeable. The easiest thing I did for myself was to wear sweatpants and a Dri-FIT long-sleeve shirt. No one saw beneath my clothing. I kept to myself, locked in, and stayed incognito. Although being a fly on the wall didn’t give me any problems, it also didn’t provide me with any interactions or a sense of community either. To some degree, the gym we continue showing up to is a place of peace and part of our social hub."

        "In the spring of 2025, I shifted gears and I got more into basketball. This came with a mix of playing indoors and outdoors. As many know, basketball is a high-cardio sport that requires a lot of running, jumping, and sprinting. At this point, I knew I needed to shift into short-sleeved shirts and shorts. That’s when I bought Vaseline Intensive Care Aloe Soothe Body Lotion. It costs about $20 for three bottles. For me, this brand helped my dry skin more effectively than other brands have.",
        "Having a solid mix of discipline at the gym, combined with nature hikes, lake outings, or waterfront runs, provides a good balance of different environments that leads to positive results. Part of the reason why I have been able to get ahead with my fitness could be due to location. Washington state has served me well all year. With Mount Rainier a couple of hours away, a culture built on fitness and community, and all the great parks and facilities to work out in, I feel like I am where I need to be."

        "When I lived in the Midwest, I had a much stronger sense of gym anxiety. Flare-ups and breakouts looked concerning. Cracks in my skin would take too much energy from me to even want to exercise. I found that once you break through the mental challenge of being comfortable in your own skin, it becomes a physical battle. For some, their bones might feel weaker because it’s been some time since pushing ourselves. After nearly six months of discipline, I started to notice the results I was looking for, and then, before you know it, summer hit.",
        "Getting back into the gym during the winter was not easy. You wouldn’t reap the rewards until summer, but you know that it will pay off. People notice the psoriasis marks, but they don’t judge because you’re working on yourself. I surround myself with a community of open-minded individuals who know that fitness is important and that we’re all working on it despite our downfalls. Three items I always bring to the gym include a sweat towel, deodorant, and lotion. As long as I have those three, I am well prepared for sweaty or dry situations."

For years, it has been a back-and-forth battle, but I’ve learned a variety of things from trial and error. Moving to different locations, being a more responsible adult, and finding nourishing support group relationships have all taught me a lot. Once you are more sure of yourself and who you are, nothing can shake you."
