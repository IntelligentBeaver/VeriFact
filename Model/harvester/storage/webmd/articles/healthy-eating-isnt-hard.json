Beach says it's a strategy that can be helpful if a teen is trying to lose weight . For example, if your teen loves soccer but is also working toward a weight loss goal, talk about what types of healthy foods he can choose to boost his endurance for soccer games rather than only restricting foods. Talk about healthy options in a way that makes them relevant to helping your teen today rather than following nutrition rules for some far-off goal."
