The insect’s most distinctive features are two large front legs that resemble pincers. It uses these powerful limbs to grasp and subdue prey.",
        "All Belostomatidae insects have cylindrical, needle-like beaks for biting and eating. The giant water bug’s bite injects poisonous digestive enzymes into prey. These compounds paralyze the victim and liquify muscles and tissues. The giant water bug sucks this fluid out."
