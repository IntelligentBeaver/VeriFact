Female ticks have an orange-brown body, while their legs, mouthparts, and scutum are darker. Their abdomens are light-colored when they haven’t fed lately but become darker after feeding. Males are and remain reddish brown.",

For example, larvae may prefer to feed on raccoons and deer, while adults may prefer to feed on humans and household pets."
