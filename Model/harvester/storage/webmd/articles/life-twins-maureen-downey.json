        "Maureen Downey and her husband, Bo Emerson, conceived twins Rebecca and Joey with help from IVF 10 years ago. The couple, of Decatur, Ga., had two children conceived without assisted reproductive technology, but when the couple tried for a third child, Downey went through several miscarriages, so they turned to IVF. Maureen was 42 when they had two embryos transferred. They weren't trying to have twins, but they liked that possibility.",
        "Downey spoke to WebMD about her experiences:",
        "I was hopeful that both would take. I was quite happy with the prospect of twins. I didn't ask for two, and I didn't go into it thinking I'd have twins.",
        "I think it's different if you have never had any children. If this may be your one shot, I could certainly see why people would be interested in twins. But because this would be baby number 3 and our goal was three children, it wasn't that I went in there thinking, 'Gee, I really want to have twins.'"
