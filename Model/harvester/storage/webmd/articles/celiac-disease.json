        "Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that’s triggered when you eat gluten , a protein found in wheat, barley, and other grains. The condition is also known as celiac sprue, nontropical sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy.",
        "When someone with celiac disease eats or drinks something that contains gluten, their body overreacts to the protein. This damages their villi, small finger-like projections found along the wall of the small intestine. When your villi are injured, your small intestine can’t properly absorb nutrients from food. Eventually, this can lead to malnourishment and potentially to symptoms ranging from weakened bones to mood changes to miscarriage.",
        "Most people with celiac disease never know they have it. Researchers think that as few as 20% of people with the disease get the right diagnosis. The damage to your intestine is very slow, and the symptoms vary a lot from person to person.",
        "Is celiac disease serious?",
        "While celiac disease itself isn't usually life-threatening, it can lead to serious complications and symptoms if it's not managed. Untreated celiac disease also raises your risk for some types of cancer ."
