        "I was just so excited. It was the best present ever! I was overwhelmed; it was a little hard to believe at first. We had been waiting for about 3 months to hear the final word on casting.",
        "2. How well does the program reflect your experiences -- and your family’s -- with cerebral palsy (CP)? A good deal of what you see are things that have really happened in my own life. The sled hockey episode is a direct result of the producers and writers finding out I play sled hockey in real life. Although I am not great at it, I absolutely love playing.",
        "3. Your character, JJ, has more severe CP than you. Unlike you, he can’t speak. What challenges does that present? Sometimes I just want to blurt out what JJ is saying and feeling. Every night, my mom and I come home and go over the next day’s scenes, and she really helps me dial in on the emotions JJ would be feeling during the scenes -- then I come up with the different expressions."
