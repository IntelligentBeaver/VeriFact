As your body begins to go through the necessary changes to support the growth of your baby, your body will most likely feel the aches, pains, and discomfort that come with these changes. Since most of the pressure from the baby will be sitting on your hips and lower back, these bouncy balls are great for relieving that pressure. A lot of lower back pain can come from your baby being in a posterior position, and the pregnancy ball can be used to encourage the baby to take on an anterior positioning. Starting at 32 weeks, the birthing ball can also be used to perform exercises that help your prepare for labor by strengthening your pelvic floor, stomach, and back."
