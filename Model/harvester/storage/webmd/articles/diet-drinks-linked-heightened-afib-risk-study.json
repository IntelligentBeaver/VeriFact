        "March 5, 2024 – People who drink 2 liters or more of artificially sweetened beverages per week raised their risk of the heart condition atrial fibrillation by 20%, compared to people who drank no artificially sweetened beverages, according to new research.",
        "The study, published in the journal Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology , also found that people who drank 2 liters (about 67 ounces) or more per week of sugar-sweetened beverages had a 10% higher risk of atrial fibrillation. People who drank 1 liter or less of pure fruit juice each week had an 8% lower risk of atrial fibrillation.",
        "Atrial fibrillation, sometimes called AFib or arrhythmia, is a quivery, fluttery heartbeat caused by faulty electrical signals in the heart. The abnormal rhythm stops the heart from pumping as well as it should and raises the chances of having a stroke and other heart problems.",
        "Researchers examined health records of about 202,000 people in the UK Biobank, a biomedical database for people who received health care through the U.K.’s National Health Service. The people they studied were 45% male and ranged in age from 37 to 73. During a 10-year follow-up period, researchers found 9,362 cases of AFib among them."
