She’s talked to us about what that team might look like in a hospital. But also offered us so much information about what we might be looking for if our loved one is outside of the hospital. What does outpatient hospice care look like? And I think the biggest takeaway for me is this type of care team approach is whole person care. This type of approach is something that we can all benefit from. And this is something that really helps us meet the needs of our loved one medically, spiritually, emotionally, psychologically, and helps us fill in all of the other gaps and questions that we might have. How do I help my loved one fill out a power of attorney? How do I help my loved one to get to an appointment if it’s very difficult for them to leave the house for labs?"

And when is the right time to research and engage them for our loved ones? In this episode, we break down the myths and realities of hospice and palliative care. We spoke with Neha Shah, MD, infectious disease and palliative care doctor, about the collaborative nature of palliative care teams, the essential role of caregivers, and what really happens in end-of-life care in a discussion to empower you with knowledge and compassion for whatever lies ahead.",
