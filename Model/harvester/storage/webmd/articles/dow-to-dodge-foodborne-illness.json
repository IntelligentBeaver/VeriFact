        "I can remember having a foodborne illness once, and I wouldn’t wish that much gastrointestinal discomfort on my worst enemy. I’m not alone, of course. Food is responsible for an estimated 48 million cases of illness every year in the U.S. and it’s not just from big outbreaks you hear about in the news.  Foodborne illness, also called food poisoning, can occur in your own backyard especially during the summer months. Here’s how to stay safe.",

        "Bacteria that are naturally present in the soil, air, water, in our bodies, and in animals’ bodies are most often to blame for foodborne illness.  For example, viruses in some raw oysters can make you very sick, but proper cooking destroys them.",
        "Microbes thrive in warm and humid conditions, and they can multiply to the point of irritating or infecting your digestive system to make you miserable. Allowing food to sit for hours without proper refrigeration at backyard barbecues, lakeside picnics, and beach parties is one way to invite trouble to gatherings with family and friends. Proper food handling is just as crucial for dodging foodborne illness."
