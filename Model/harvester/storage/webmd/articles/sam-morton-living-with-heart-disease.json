        "I've discovered that most of the time, my life with a chronic disease can be              much like everyone else's. I am 41 years old. I am a father, husband, uncle,              nephew, and son. I am an ex-cop. And, to either the bemusement or bewilderment              of my friends and family, I am a former professional wrestler-the raucous,              fake, TV kind. I am a writer and the token male member on my office's women's              advancement committee.",
        "I am many things to many people. Most of all, I am a man with advanced heart              disease, aggravated by type 2 diabetes . When I was 38, I had quadruple bypass              surgery. One of my arteries was 99% blocked, the others a mere 90%.",
        "After the surgery, I had a stent [a tiny mesh-like tube used to prop open              clogged arteries] inserted. A week passed before I felt \"normal.\" Then              I was back into a routine-insulin pump management and medications. It's my              diabetes that has sped me along this path to heart disease, and I can't afford              not to manage it properly."
