        "Broken heart syndrome is a condition with symptoms that may feel like a heart attack, such as chest pain and shortness of breath . It can happen after you go through a very stressful physical or emotional event, such as a stroke or the death of someone you love. Your doctor may call this stress-induced cardiomyopathy.",
        "Broken heart syndrome symptoms are similar to those of a heart attack. If have pain in your chest, you should seek immediate medical attention. (Photo credit: LaylaBird)",
        "How did the broken heart syndrome get its name?",
        "Much of the early research into this condition came from Japan, where it was called takotsubo cardiomyopathy or takotsubo syndrome. That's because it causes one of the heart's chambers to take on an unusual shape that resembles that of a traditional pot used in Japan to catch octopus, called a takotsubo. Researchers also called it transient left ventricular apical ballooning.",
        "A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2005 noted that many of the people being treated for the condition had recently experienced the death of a loved one. The name broken heart syndrome took off in popular culture."
