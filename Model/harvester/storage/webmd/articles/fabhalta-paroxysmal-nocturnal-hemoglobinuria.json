        "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare blood disease due to a genetic defect, where your red blood cells (RBCs) do not have a protective layer of proteins. These missing proteins cause your immune system to attack your red blood cells and break them down too early, also called hemolysis. The hemolysis can happen inside (intravascular) and outside (extravascular) your blood vessels.",
        "The most common symptoms of PNH are anemia and blood clots, which can be life-threatening. People with PNH may have many of the following symptoms or only a few.",
        "Treatment for PNH includes blood transfusions, folic acid or iron for anemia, anticoagulants to prevent blood clots, and medicines that protect your RBCs from being attacked by your immune system. Your treatment will depend on how many symptoms you have and how severe they are.",
        "The common medicines that protect against the attack by your immune system are IVs or shots, like eculizumab (Soliris) or ravulizumab (Ultomiris). These medicines inhibit the C5 portion of the complement system. They have shown to improve symptoms by stopping the intravascular hemolysis. But some people still have anemia while on treatment due to extravascular hemolysis still happening. Fabhalta , the first oral medicine, can further help reduce symptoms of PNH, even if the other medicines did not work."
