Its chief function is to carry sensations of pain, touch, heat, and cold from the face to the brain. One part of this nerve also controls the muscles used for chewing. Injuries or disorders of the trigeminal nerve can have several symptoms that affect daily life."

The pain usually lasts less than two minutes, but some people have episodes lasting up to 10 minutes. The pain is often triggered by simple touch on the face and inside the mouth, such as by talking, chewing, brushing, shaving, washing, or drying.",

They may ask for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computed tomography (CT) scan to find the reason for the neuralgia. Your doctor will then prescribe medicines to reduce the severity and frequency of the painful episodes.",

Other causes are injury, tumor surgery, placing dental implants , and local anesthesia injections . Mild injury causes pain in the distribution of the nerve. If the nerve has been cut, the area supplied is numb. If you feel either of these symptoms, consult your doctor soon. Nerve repair is most successful when done soon after the injury."
