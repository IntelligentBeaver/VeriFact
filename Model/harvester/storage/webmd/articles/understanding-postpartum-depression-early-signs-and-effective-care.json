In this episode, we speak with Megan Spence, PsyD, PMH-C , licensed clinical psychologist, about how PPD is diagnosed, the signs to look for, and what effective treatment and recovery truly involve. We also explore why open communication and early support are key to healing and reclaiming emotional well-being after birth."

        "Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered Podcast. I'm Dr Neha Pathak, WebMD's Chief Physician Editor for Health and Lifestyle Medicine. Today we're exploring a topic that too many families weather in silence: postpartum­­ depression, or PPD. Postpartum depression is a condition that affects up to one in five new parents and can touch anyone regardless of age, background, or number of children. We'll unpack the rampant myths and misinformation to talk about what postpartum depression really looks like — everything from irritability or rage, intrusive worries, guilt, numbness, and trouble sleeping — and how to tell when it's time to reach out for support. Experiences with postpartum depression can be isolating, but they're also treatable, and recovery is possible. Together, we'll take a step-by-step approach to the questions you've probably been carrying in silence: Who should I talk to first if I'm concerned about postpartum depression? How can partners, friends, and family really help? How is postpartum depression diagnosed? What do effective treatments look like? Whether you're a new parent, a partner, or a friend, the goal of this episode is to leave you feeling informed, supported, and safe. You are not broken, you haven't done anything wrong, and you're not alone.",
        "First, let me introduce my guest, Dr Megan Spence. Dr Megan Spence is a licensed clinical psychologist with more than 15 years of experience. She has expertise in trauma, anxiety, depression, life transitions, and work stress. She's certified in perinatal — meaning pregnancy and postpartum — mental health. Her approach is trauma- and multiculturally-informed, evidence-based, and empowering. Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered Podcast."

What were some of the questions and issues that helped frame how you changed your practice or the work that you're doing?",

What I came to love about perinatal work and just this time in people's lives is that I really learned and heard from parents how much they wanted to do better than past generations for their families. And so I find this to be such an important time in terms of intervening, where the impact of treating and working with people at this time in their lives can affect multiple branches of the family tree — past generations and future ones.

In this episode, we speak with Megan Spence, PsyD, PMH-C, licensed clinical psychologist, about how PPD is diagnosed, the signs to look for, and what effective treatment and recovery truly involve. We also explore why open communication and early support are key to healing and reclaiming emotional well-being after birth.",
