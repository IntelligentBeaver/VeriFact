Objective tinnitus refers to noises produced within your body that a doctor can hear using a stethoscope. These noises are caused by blood flow, muscle movements, or middle ear disorders like otosclerosis, allergies , or benign tumors . Objective tinnitus is rare, contributing less than 5% of all cases."
