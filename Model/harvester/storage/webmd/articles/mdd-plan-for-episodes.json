        "By Dan Collins, as told to Hallie Levine I’ve been living with major depressive disorder since I was 16.  My moment of critical mass was in the spring of 1991. I was 28 and still living at home. My life revolved around getting up, going to work, and returning to my house. I fell down a rabbit hole of extreme depression and anxiety . I felt like I was being devoured by waves of despair and panic that would never end. I finally ended up at the local hospital’s ER. I was told it would take a few weeks to get me in to see a psychiatrist , and I was horrified. The idea of waiting a month or two for this appointment, when I felt that I could barely last another minute, was terrifying. My only refuge was sleep that provided no rest and left me without any appetite or humor. To try to escape, I’d jump in my car and drive to malls to purchase books on mental health . I had decided that if I could understand what was happening to me, I’d be able to overcome it. Eventually, my father told me, \"You are not going to think your way out of this,\" and I realized he was right."

        "Thankfully, this depressive episode happened right around the time a new drug, Prozac, was gaining steam. I like to joke that I was the original Prozac nation. I was one of the lucky ones who responded well to this medication, and quickly. One morning I woke up and realized that the cloud of despair wasn’t hanging over me anymore. That was 30 years ago. I’m still on Prozac, but I’ve also learned many ways to manage my depressive episodes, so I’m not caught off guard when they happen. Depression isn’t like a cold in that you recover from and it goes away. It can happen at any time, sometimes without any apparent reason. I’m sharing what helps me in the hope that it will help you."

During the pandemic , I think one thing that helped prevent me from sliding into another depressive episode was the fact that I was on my elliptical machine every morning for an hour to get those feel-good endorphins going. (Research bears me out on this: Exercise has been shown to have a strong antidepressant effect among people with depression.) But it goes beyond just exercise. When you have depression, the worst thing you can do is just sit and stew in it. When I was going through the worst of my depressive episodes in my 20s, I’d stay home and stare at the wall. But once I started Prozac, I felt good enough, and confident enough, to sign up for an acting class. I realized that I needed to change my solitary lifestyle because that had played a big role in how depressed I’d become in the first place. Even when I feel my worst, I force myself to get out of bed and go to work. You need to get your focus away from your mood and emotions and on something else. . When you’re depressed, it’s almost impossible to lift yourself out of it alone. You need other people to help drag you out. I was lucky when I was diagnosed to have amazing, supportive parents. My father prided himself on being an amateur psychiatrist. He wanted to understand how I felt and encouraged me to get help and get better."
