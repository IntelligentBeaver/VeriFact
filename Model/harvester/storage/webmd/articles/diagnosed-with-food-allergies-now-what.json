I ask myself these three questions every single time I leave the house with my girls, who have multiple food allergies. When we planned to start our family, carrying an EpiPen did not quite fall on that list, but neither did having food allergies.",
        "I remember when we first found out. Cali, my 7-year-old daughter, was 4 months old at the time and we could not get rid of the eczema that had taken over her body. The medication was not working, and I was feeling defeated watching her scratch all day to the point she would bleed. The ice and all of the internet recommendations were not enough. During the same time, I was having trouble nursing, so I wanted to give her formula to help supplement. Worst decision I made. My 4-month-old baby projectile vomited all the way across the room. I knew I had to do something."

I know I have to ensure all caretakers understand what my girls can and cannot eat and how to treat an allergic reaction. I know how to read ALL food labels. I know I have to bring a doctor’s note for certain venues or certain travel destinations. I know I cannot take my youngest daughter to a seafood restaurant because just the smell of seafood causes her to have an allergic reaction. Do I have this? I cannot afford not to."
