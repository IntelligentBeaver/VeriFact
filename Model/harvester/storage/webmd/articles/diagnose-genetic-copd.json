        "It's not always easy to get a diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, a rare condition that sometimes leads to serious lung and liver damage. In fact, most people who have this disorder are never diagnosed at all, experts say. Also called alpha-1, this genetic condition means you don't have enough of the alpha-1 antitrypsin protein in your bloodstream. When it affects your lungs , it can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD ). Normally, AAT protects your lungs from being damaged while your immune system fights infection and inflammation . But without enough AAT, substances released during the immune process may harm your lungs and make them more prone to damage from smoking or pollution."

        "Many people with AAT deficiency are healthy and never have symptoms. If you do develop symptoms, they're most likely to start when you're between 20 and 50 years old. Some lung-related symptoms you can have are: Shortness of breath Chronic cough and bronchitis Wheezing Repeated colds or pneumonia Difficulty exercising These symptoms can look a lot like those of asthma or smoking-related COPD. Many people are diagnosed with those more common conditions instead. Asthma medications are often helpful for people with AAT deficiency, which can add to the confusion . Even if you do get diagnosed with AAT deficiency, it can take a long time -- an average of 5-8 years after you start having symptoms. You might have to see multiple doctors, too. Research has found that it tends to take longer for women and older people to be diagnosed."

It’s a relatively rare disease that doctors might not know much about. Or they might not think testing is helpful. Treatments for AAT deficiency are often expensive and are sometimes seen as ineffective, Diab says. But certain conditions – especially when they show up in younger people -- should prompt testing for AAT deficiency. \"We know alpha-1 can cause COPD and emphysema , but it can also lead to liver injury and cirrhosis , so usually having one of those conditions should clue a provider in to test,” Wells says. In fact, the American Thoracic Society recommends that doctors test all adults who have COPD, emphysema, severe asthma, or unexplained liver disease for AAT deficiency. The group recommends that siblings of people with the deficiency be tested as well."

If you have AAT deficiency, you inherited an abnormal gene from each of your parents. Different alpha-1 genes carry different risks.
