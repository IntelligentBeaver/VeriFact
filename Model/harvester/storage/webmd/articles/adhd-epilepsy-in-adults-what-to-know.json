        "Both conditions often begin early in life – it’s estimated that 30% to 40% of children with epilepsy have ADHD. Since epilepsy is so common -- it affects about 50 million people worldwide -- researchers are striving to fgure out more about this connection.",

Both genetic and environmental factors also appear to potentially play a role, the study authors suggest. For example, family history of both epilepsy and ADHD correlated for 40% of the risk of having both conditions. And the study authors cited research showing that the more air pollution you are exposed to as a child, the more likely you are to have a dual diagnosis of ADHD and epilepsy."

Also, the more seizures a patient has that aren’t effectively controlled by medication, the higher risk that patient has of having ADHD.  This potential trigger for ADHD could be due to problems with the frontal lobe itself, electrical charges from the seizures, or undiagnosed brain lesions."

Also, previous research found that the drug may increase the frequency of seizures.",
