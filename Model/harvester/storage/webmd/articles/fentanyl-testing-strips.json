While some people use fentanyl on purpose, many others get it in their systems without their knowledge.

        "Use 1 teaspoon of water per every 10 mg of crystal or powder meth, MDMA, or ecstasy to dissolve the drugs in a small container (like a soda bottle cap). If you’re using a different type of drug, use half a teaspoon of water instead.",

You can speed up the process by putting the dissolved drugs in a pan in the oven on the lowest setting (maximum of 225 F) while keeping the oven door cracked.
