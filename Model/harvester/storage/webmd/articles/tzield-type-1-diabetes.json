        "Tzield (teplizumab-mzwv) is a biologic (made from live cells) prescription medicine that can slow down the progress of type 1 diabetes when caught at an early stage. The FDA approved Tzield in 2023 for adults and children 8 years and older who have early-stage type 1 diabetes with no noticeable symptoms. Tzield is the first type 1 diabetes medicine to work to delay the need to use insulin . A health care provider puts it into a vein (intravenous infusion, or IV) at a clinic or at home. It is given in just one series of IVs, once a day for 14 days straight."

The beta cells produce insulin, a hormone that helps your body use sugar for energy. Damage to the beta cells happens gradually and in three stages. In stage 3, so many of the beta cells are damaged that your body cannot make enough insulin, and blood sugar levels rise. This is when the symptoms of diabetes usually appear and health care providers diagnose type 1 diabetes.",
