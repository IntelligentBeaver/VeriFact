Over time, sleep trouble can wear down your teen's mood, sap their energy, and make it harder to get through the day.

Studies show that targeting sleep can improve mood, even without changing anything else in your teen's mental health care. That’s why many providers recommend treating both at the same time. CBT-I is a structured, evidence-based treatment designed to help you retrain your mind and body for better sleep. It’s one of the most effective ways to treat chronic insomnia. A doctor, nurse, or therapist helps you change behaviors and beliefs that interfere with sleep. CBT-I is a short-term (usually six to eight weeks) skill-based treatment. Here’s how it works: Stimulus control. The goal is to rebuild a healthy connection between your bed and sleep. Use your bed only for sleep. Don’t read, watch TV, or scroll through your phone in bed. If your teen can’t sleep after about 20 minutes, suggest they get out of bed and do something quiet in another room until they feel sleepy again."
