        "Chemicals and fragrances from everyday products like soap, deodorant, laundry detergent, fabric softeners, and dryer sheets are often to blame. Even the clothes you wear and the way the skin folds on itself can lead to a skin rash in your armpit. More severe rashes can be painful and a signal of a medical condition. Some may come with boils, pimples, or skin discoloration.",
        "The color of your armpit rash can depend on your skin tone. In people with lighter skin, armpit rashes tend to be red. Rashes on darker skin may appear purple or simply lighter or darker than the surrounding skin.",
