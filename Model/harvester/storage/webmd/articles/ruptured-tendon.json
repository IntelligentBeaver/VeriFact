        "A tendon is the fibrous tissue that attaches muscle to bone in the human body. The forces applied to a tendon may be more than 5 times your body weight. In some rare instances, tendons can snap or rupture. Conditions that make a rupture more likely include the injection of steroids into a tendon, certain diseases (such as gout or hyperparathyroidism), and having type O blood .",
        "Although fairly uncommon, a tendon rupture can be a serious problem and may result in excruciating pain and permanent disability if untreated. Each type of tendon rupture has its own signs and symptoms and can be treated either surgically or medically depending on the severity of the rupture and the confidence of the surgeon.",

      ],
      "bullets": [
        "Quadriceps A group of 4 muscles that come together just above your kneecap (patella) to form the patellar tendon. Often called the quads, this group of muscles is used to extend the leg at the knee and aids in walking, running, and jumping.",
        "Achilles This tendon is located on the back portion of the foot just above the heel. It is the site where the calf muscle attaches to the heel of the foot (the calcaneus bone). This tendon is vital for pushing off with the foot. The Achilles helps you stand on your tiptoes and push off when starting a foot race.",
        "Rotator cuff Your rotator cuff is located in the shoulder and is actually composed of 4 muscles that function together to raise your arm out to the side, to help you rotate the arm, and to keep your shoulder from popping out of its socket. The rotator cuff tendons are some of the most common areas in the body affected by tendon injury. Some studies of people after death have shown that 8% to 20% have rotator cuff tears.",
        "Biceps The biceps muscle of the arm functions as a flexor of the elbow. This muscle brings the hand toward the shoulder by bending at the elbow. Ruptures of the biceps are classified as proximal (close) or distal (far). Distal ruptures are extremely rare. The proximal rupture occurs where the biceps attaches at the top of your shoulder."

        "Rotator cuff The rotator cuff is unique because treatment without surgery is the treatment of choice in most tendon injuries. More than 90% of tendon injuries are long-term in nature, and 33-90% of these chronic rupture symptoms go away without surgery. In contrast, acute rupture, as occurs with trauma, may or may not be repaired surgically depending on the severity of the tear. If the tear is either less than 50% of the cuff thickness or less than 1 cm in size, the dead tissue is removed arthroscopically. A small incision is made and a tool called an arthroscope is passed into the joint. Through it, the surgeon can see and remove dead tissue without actually cutting the joint open. The shoulder is then left to heal.",
        "Biceps Most surgeons prefer not to operate on a ruptured biceps tendon because function is not severely impaired with its rupture. Studies suggest that after biceps rupture, only a small fraction of elbow flexion is lost and approximately 10%-20% strength reduction in supination (ability to turn the hand palm up). This is considered to be a moderate loss and not worth the risk of surgery in middle-aged and older people.",
        "Quadriceps Unless the doctor is sure that the injury is a partial tear, surgery will be done to repair the tendon. After your operation, you will be placed in a cast or immobilizer as if you had a partial tear. With physical therapy, your injured leg should be up to speed with your noninjured leg in 6 months.",
        "Achilles tendon Surgery to repair your Achilles tendon is recommended for active people who desire near normal strength and power in plantarflexion. An additional advantage of surgical correction is a lower re-rupture rate of the tendon. After your operation, your foot will be immobilized with your toes pointing downward for 3-4 weeks and then progressively brought into a neutral position over 2-3 weeks before weight-bearing is started. Surgery carries with it a higher risk of infection than closed treatment.",
        "Rotator cuff Many surgeons will not attempt surgical repair until nonoperative treatment has failed, even in cases of larger tears. Surgical treatment is usually reserved for a severe tear in a young person or in an older person (aged 60-70 years) who is suddenly unable to externally rotate their arm. Acromioplasty, removal of the coracoacromial ligament and repair of the rotator cuff tendon, usually results in near full rotator cuff strength.",
        "Biceps In young people unwilling to accept the loss of function and mild deformity involved with this injury, surgery is performed to repair the tendon. Distal bicep ruptures are very commonly fixed surgically while proximal bicep tears are less commonly operated on. Surgery is also considered for the middle-aged person who requires full supination strength in their line of work. You should leave your arm in a sling for a few days after surgery and then begin to use the affected arm as tolerated. After surgery, your elbow flexion and arm supination is near normal in about 12 weeks."

            "Quadriceps Partial tears may be treated without surgery by placing your straight leg in a cast or immobilizer for 4-6 weeks. Once you are able to raise the affected leg without discomfort for 10 days, it is safe to slowly stop the immobilization.",
            "Achilles tendon Treatment without surgery involves immobilizing your foot so that the sole of the foot is pointed downward for 4-8 weeks. This treatment has been advocated by some because it gives similar results to surgery in motion and strength. The problem with this treatment is that it has a re-rupture rate of up to 30%. Nevertheless, it may still be a reasonable option for those who are at increased operative risk because of age. medical problems. or inactivity.",
