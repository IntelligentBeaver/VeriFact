        "Feb. 18, 2002 -- Shawn Kelley delivered her first son, Evan, prematurely at 32 weeks. It looked like she was headed down the same path with her second baby when she started having contractions at 22 weeks. That is, until she tried an unconventional treatment that seems to be working.",
        "Kelley started seeing a chiropractor , and within a few sessions of gentle manipulations the baby had moved up. She was no longer experiencing severe back pain and her obstetrician gave her the green light to cease bed rest and resume normal activity.",
        "\"It's amazing,\" says Kelley, of Minnetonka, Minn., who is now 33 weeks pregnant with her second baby . \"I'll go in, she does some adjustments, and within an hour or two, everything opens up. The baby moves up, I don't feel as much pressure, and the back pain goes away.\" What's more, she says, she has been able to avoid more bed rest or drugs to stop pre-term labor.",
