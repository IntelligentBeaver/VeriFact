For example, they may have an allergic reaction or want to adjust the position of the implant. Others may need to replace the original implants years later. Like most medical devices, breast implants don't last forever. Some implant makers offer lifetime guarantees. If the implant breaks, the company will offer a replacement at no cost. However, check the details. The warranty may not include the cost of the surgery or other expenses. Keep in mind that removing breast implants can cost more than putting them in.",

The FDA recommends that women with silicone breast implants get periodic imaging such as an MRI or ultrasound to screen for implant rupture five to six years after the initial implant and then every two to three years after that. This is the only way to make sure the silicone implant hasn't ruptured. Women with saline implants do not need these tests. MRIs can be expensive. The average cost of an MRI in the U.S. is $2,000."
