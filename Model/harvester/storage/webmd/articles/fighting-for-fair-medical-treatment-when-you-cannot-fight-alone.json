        "A common misconception that sickle cell disease warriors face is the label of being a drug seeker. When you have a chronic disease that causes frequent, intense pain and the only way to treat your disease is to address it with heavy narcotics, you are automatically suspected of being a drug seeker. And when your disease is improperly characterized as a disease that Black people get, you have another obstacle that you have to overcome to get the degree of care you deserve. People with chronic pain conditions (like sickle cell disease) have to constantly educate their health care team about their disease, how their body responds to certain pain medications, and what it takes for them to break through the pain and get it under control.",
        "As someone who has had sickle cell disease for the majority of her life, I can tell you that you learn relatively quickly that you have to become your own advocate if you want to live. Sickle cell disease isn’t a disease that has a one-size-fits-all approach to care that works for everyone. What works for one person may not work for someone else, especially if your disease has progressed and continues to worsen over time.",
        "One time, I remember working out in my parents’ basement on a treadmill with ankle weights.  I was trying to strengthen my body and build up my endurance, but after working out for a while, I realized that I had a dull pain in my legs. I noticed it and it bothered me and I knew that I needed to stop. I stopped working out and sat down. The pain, which started as a low, dull ache in my lower legs, began to travel up my legs. Immediately, I started hydrating with water and Gatorade. Then I took pain medication (hydrocodone). By the time I took the hydrocodone, I had made it upstairs to my bedroom. I took off any restrictive clothing and tried to lay down with my heating pad to get some rest and sleep the pain off."

        "The pain was too intense, and the hydrocodone had the effect of a Tic Tac. Then the same pain that I felt earlier returned. My legs felt like someone had a weighted blanket of pain on them, and the pain grew in intensity, spreading from my legs to my back. When the pain reached this level, I knew I had limited options and I had to try and attack the pain as aggressively as possible at home with the medications I had.",
        "The next thing I did was take a stronger narcotic (oxycodone) and rotate it with 800-1,000 milligrams of Advil. I would rotate the medication every 4 hours. When I realized that the pain was becoming unbearable and I was running out of medication, I would let my family know that I needed them to take me to the ER.  I don’t know why my body didn’t have a pain crisis during my hematologist’s office hours, but I do know that the majority of the time when my pain was unmanageable, it would be on the weekend or after hours."
