        "If your newborn has been diagnosed with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), you may have a lot of questions about the condition, especially when it comes to treatment. Unlike nonclassic CAH, classic CAH must be treated right away, says Deborah Merke, MD, chief of the Department of Pediatrics and head of the Section on Congenital Disorders at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. “The condition is almost always picked up within several days of birth as part of each state’s neonatal screening program,” says Merke. Treatment needs to start as soon as possible to avoid adrenal crisis. That’s a life-threatening condition where the adrenal glands don’t make enough cortisol and aldosterone. But with care comes challenges. Here’s a closer look at your options, along with tips on how to make the best decisions for your child as you work closely with their medical team."

        "\"Although there are some long-term negative effects from glucocorticoid treatment, the benefits of treating CAH, a potentially life-threatening disease, outweigh the risks of this necessary treatment,\" says Phyllis Speiser, MD, emeritus chief of pediatric endocrinology at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New York City. \"Hopefully, as newer treatments become available these concerns will decrease.\" Merke recommends asking your child’s doctor these questions: “One way we ideally manage patients is to try not to give them too much of a replacement of hydrocortisone,” says Merke. This helps limit potential long-term side effects like stunted growth. The typical starting dose for newborns is 2.5 milligrams three times a day. That’s lowered once your child reaches target hormone levels, says Merke. How many people with classic CAH do you see? Since it’s a rare disease, it’s important to choose a pediatric endocrinologist who has specific experience in the area. “The management of classic CAH is complicated, because there’s a delicate balance between giving too much medication and too little,” says Merke. In addition to stunted growth, too much hydrocortisone can lead to: Obesity High blood pressure Low bone mineral density"

        "“They block a substance called corticotrophin-releasing factor type 1, which controls stimulation of the adrenal gland,” says Merke. Another promising option is gene therapy. People with classic CAH don’t make enough of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. That’s an enzyme your body needs to make cortisol and aldosterone. A mutation, or change, in a gene is what causes the problem. Gene therapy uses a virus to deliver working copies of the gene so the adrenal glands can make 21-hydroxylase. Merke says they’re currently studying the effects in adults with classic CAH. “It would be the only way to cure the disease, because it would allow the adrenals to make cortisol themselves, instead of adding on medications,” says Merke."
