        "Jan. 17, 2024 – Limiting the amount of 100% fruit juice that children drink could be a way to help combat childhood obesity, particularly among young children, new research suggests.",

The findings are important because past research has shown that children who are overweight or obese during childhood are likely to continue to remain so during adulthood. The authors of this latest study recommended limiting “consumption of fruit juice to prevent the intake of excess calories and weight gain.”",
        "Led by researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada, the team looked at data from 42 past research studies, looking for links between drinking 100% fruit juice and weight gain in adults and in children. They also found evidence that drinking 100% fruit juice was connected  with adult body weight gain but said more research is needed in the area. The researchers did find clear patterns between children’s juice intake and weight gain."

        "Health officials and researchers have sounded the alarm about childhood overweight and obesity in recent years, as 1 in 5 U.S. children ages 2 to 19 years old are medically obese. Having obesity puts children at risk of serious obesity-related health problems like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes , asthma , sleep apnea, and joint problems, the CDC warns.",
        "Children in this latest study gained more weight than children who drank zero-calorie beverages, like water, or when juice was intentionally added to a child’s daily intake and then compared to children with a normal diet. The biggest increase in BMI among children drinking fruit juice was seen among kids ages 8 years old and younger when compared to kids of the same age who drank other non-caloric beverages.",
        "Types of juices that the children drank included pomegranate , berry, tart cherry, apple, citrus, and grape. The researchers didn’t find any differences in the impact on BMI based on the type of juice consumed. They said a potential cause of weight gain from drinking 100% fruit juice was “the consumption of liquid calories, which has been shown to result in greater weight gain compared with the ingestion of solid calories. Compared with whole fruit, 100% fruit juice contains less dietary fiber, leading to the rapid absorption of fructose in the liver.” They explained that this rapid absorption of naturally occurring sugar from fruits can impact how the liver works and can also influence cholesterol levels in the body.",
