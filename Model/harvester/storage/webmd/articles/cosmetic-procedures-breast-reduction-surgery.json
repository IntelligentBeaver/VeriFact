        "Breast reduction surgery (also known as reduction mammoplasty) is an operation to remove extra fat, tissue, and skin from your breasts. You might consider it if you have very large breasts (sometimes called macromastia or gigantomastia) that are making you self-conscious or causing neck pain, back pain, or other symptoms. This surgery is for people of any gender, including men with large breasts (gynecomastia). About 100,000 people get it each year.",

This can involve adding or removing breast tissue, moving the nipples, or making other changes. Top surgery can be helpful if your gender identity doesn’t match the sex you were assigned at birth. Many transgender and nonbinary people choose to have top surgery.",
