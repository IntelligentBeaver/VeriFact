        "Stress -- physical or emotional -- can make your myasthenia gravis symptoms worse. Proper rest is key in helping keep things under control. Here are some ways to be sure you’re getting the down time you need. Focus on good sleep hygiene: Stick to a regular bedtime and wake time every day. Don’t eat too close to bedtime. Have a screen-free wind-down routine with relaxing practices like reading, taking a bath, or drinking hot tea. Keep your bedroom cool and dark to set the stage for sound sleep. Take naps. No need to feel guilty about midday snooze sessions. Your body needs the rest. If you can work it in, lie down, turn off your phone, and grab some ZZZs to help your body relax. Schedule stillness. If you can schedule breaks in your day, do it. Spend that time resting your body and mind: meditate, do some gentle stretching, or simply sit in silence. Pace yourself. Have a task to do? Plan it for a time of day when you know you’ll have the most energy. Slice it into smaller to-dos, if possible, so you don’t overextend yourself all at once."

        "Think about the ways you’re using your body during the day. Could you be sitting while you cook or brush your teeth? Could you lie down while on phone calls? Any chance you can give your body a break, take it. Use tools. Many stores have scooters you can use when you shop. Talk to your doctor about whether a cane, walker, or wheelchair could give you more comfort during your daily activities. You can also apply to have a handicap sticker for your car so you can park closer to shop entrances. Let machines do the work. Take stock of the things you use in the home. See if you can swap manual appliances for automatic options, like can openers, mixers, and toothbrushes. Use your dishwasher instead of washing by hand. Consider a countertop hair dryer instead of one you hold."
