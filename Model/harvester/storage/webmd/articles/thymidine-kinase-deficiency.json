        "Thymidine kinase 2 deficiency (TK2d) mainly causes muscle weakness. It’s a very rare mitochondrial disease. Mitochondria are tiny organ-like structures inside your cells that make energy. And if the DNA gets damaged or lost, you can have symptoms.",
        "TK2d is caused by genetic changes in your TK2 gene on chromosome 16q21, explains Angela Lek, PhD, chief research officer of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. The changes stop an enzyme called thymidine kinase from working, which means that it can’t repair the DNA inside your mitochondria.",
        "Only about 600 to 2,700 people have TK2D in the United States, but its effects can be devastating. “Over time, TK2d leads to progressive muscle weakness, first in your arm and leg muscles, then difficulty with swallowing and breathing, and, eventually, early death,” says Lek.",
        "There is some hope, however. In November 2025, a new drug was approved by the FDA to help treat this condition. While it’s not a cure, it can slow the disease’s progress, says Lek."

Most children with early-onset TK2D end up on a ventilator to help them breathe and only survive for a few years.",
        "Childhood onset. This form appears between the ages of 1 and 12. Symptoms start with muscle weakness in the arms and legs, and then spread to the face. It can cause facial paralysis and droopy eyelids (ptosis). As breathing muscles weaken, some children need a ventilator.",
        "Late onset. People with late onset TK2D develop symptoms in adolescence or adulthood. Symptoms of muscle weakness begin in the limbs and worsen slowly. Most people will require assistive devices such as canes, walkers, and wheelchairs but don’t lose the ability to walk entirely. Many will eventually need to be on a ventilator. On average, people with late-onset TK2D live 20-30 years after the start of their symptoms."
