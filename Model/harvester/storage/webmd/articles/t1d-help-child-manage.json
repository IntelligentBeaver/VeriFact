There are many signs or ketoacidosis, but your child may: Be very thirsty and pee a lot Be tired and confused Feel sick to their stomach Hypoglycemia : This is when blood sugar levels get very low. It triggers several symptoms too. Your child may be: Pale and shaky Sweaty and anxious Hungry and feel like they may throw up Both ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia can get dangerous very fast. That’s why it’s so important that your child (and the adults around them) know the signs and what to do."

It can be a great experience for your child, teaching self-confidence, independence, and more.

Ask that your child be allowed to stop taking a test if they don’t feel well. Speak up about any other needs your child has, and get the school’s response in writing.

        "When the school day and homework are done, it’s time for fun. Your child may want to have a play date or have a sleepover on the weekends. It’s easiest to invite other kids to your house so you can help manage your child’s diabetes. But that’s not always possible. Your child will want to go to friends’ houses, parties, the movies, and more. It’s important to let them go, not only because it’s fun, but it also teaches independence. Let the other parent know your child has type 1 diabetes, and let them know the basics of care and what to watch out for. Make sure they or your child can reach you quickly by phone or text. Have your older child check their blood sugar late into a party or right when they get home. During the summer, you may want to look into diabetes camps. These are specifically for kids with diabetes and are staffed with medical professionals to keep them safe. It can be a great experience for your child, teaching self-confidence, independence, and more. Plus, they’ll be around other kids with type 1 diabetes, so care isn’t something that makes them different. It also gives you a break from the day-to-day responsibility of your child’s diabetes care. These camps are widely available, and most offer financial assistance, if you qualify."

        "Making the transition to college is a huge step in a young person’s life. If your child is planning to go, they’re entitled to accommodations – something they need to advocate for themselves. They’ll need to contact their college or university’s office of disability services. Most likely, they’ll also need to ask their doctor to provide a letter that states the diagnosis. Your student may need to push for academic accommodations that include: Priority registration so classes fit their medical needs Official notification of teaching staff about their diagnosis The ability to take breaks during class time or exams for self-care Rescheduling of exams or excused class attendance if they become ill If your student is living on campus, they should: Tell their roommate that they have type 1 diabetes and how they manage it. Make sure there’s a set space in the shared dorm or apartment fridge for their insulin and snacks. Tell the resident assistant (RA) about their diabetes, if there is one. Let their RA and roommate know the signs to look for that they may be in serious trouble. Inform the student health center and figure out how they’ll get their diabetes medication, insulin, and other supplies. Always wear a medical ID bracelet. Parties and alcohol are often a part of college or even high school life. Before your child leaves for school or just a night out, have a heart-to-heart with them about drinking and the dangers that can arise when someone with diabetes indulges. This is typically low blood sugar, but it can be unexpected highs, too. If not taken care of, these conditions can lead to seizures and even death. And when you’re not sober or “sleeping it off,” it makes it harder to do this safely."
