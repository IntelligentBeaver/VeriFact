        "The FDA has granted priority review status for pegcetacoplan (Empaveli) to treat two rare kidney diseases that can lead to kidney failure. Up until now, there hadn’t been any drugs approved specifically for these two conditions, called C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and primary immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN). It’s already in use to treat a rare blood disorder called PNH (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria). It also treats geographic atrophy, a leading cause of blindness in people with age-related macular degeneration.",

        "Before pegcetacoplan could be used to treat any condition, it had to go through a lengthy drug development process. This process included plenty of research in the lab and in animals before the drug was ever given to people. It also had to be studied and reviewed carefully by teams of researchers and other experts in clinical trials to make sure it’s both safe and effective.",
        "It can take more than a decade to develop a single drug, and many never make it all the way through to the market. Some of the earliest discoveries that led to pegcetacoplan as a safe and effective medicine go back to 1996."
