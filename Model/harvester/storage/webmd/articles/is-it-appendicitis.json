        "What Is the Appendix?",
        "The appendix is a small, fingerlike pouch that hangs from the cecum, the part of the intestines located at the start of the colon (the large intestine). The appendix is 3 to 4 inches long and about a half-inch wide. It’s unclear exactly what the appendix does, but it may play a role in the immune system.",
        "What Is Appendicitis?",
        "Most cases of appendicitis happen between the ages of 5 and 45. Appendicitis is the most common childhood surgical emergency in the U.S. Though appendicitis happens more often in teenagers and young adults, it can occur at any age.",
        "Appendicitis is when the appendix is abnormally swollen because it is filled with mucus or stool, which can occur when the opening to the appendix is blocked. This prevents it from emptying into the cecum. A closed-off appendix allows bacteria to grow, causing irritation and inflammation, which reduces blood flow to the appendix. As the swelling increases, the appendix can weaken and burst, which may result in infection inside the abdomen."
