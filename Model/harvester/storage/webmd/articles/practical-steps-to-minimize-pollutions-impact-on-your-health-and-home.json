        "Sep. 12, 2024 -- Most of us are aware of the risks of air pollution, but what about the pollutants we encounter inside our homes every day? In 2024, the American Lung Association reported that over 131 million people in the U.S. are exposed to unhealthy levels of pollution, but the dangers don’t stop at the front door. In this episode, we dive deep into the topic of pollution with Philip J. Landrigan, MD, MSc, FAAP , a leading expert in global public health. Dr. Landrigan helps us identify different sources of pollution, including microplastics, pesticides, and air pollution, and their health risks. Learn practical strategies for minimizing exposure , safer alternatives to common pollutants, and how pollution is linked to climate change. Whether at home, in your community, or at a societal level, discover actionable steps you can take to reduce pollution’s impact on your health and the health of those around you."
