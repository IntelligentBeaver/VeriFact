        "An elbow dislocation happens when one or more of the three bones in your elbow joint — the humerus, radius, and ulna — get pushed out of place. It’s usually very painful and can make it hard or even impossible for you to move your elbow.",
        "A joint is simply the place where two bones meet, and you’ve got them all over your body. They help you move and give your body support from head to toe. Your elbow joint is a little different because it’s made up of three bones working together: the humerus, which is your upper arm bone, and the radius and ulna, the two bones in your forearm .",
        "If you have an elbow joint dislocation, don’t try to push the joint back in place yourself. Keep your elbow as still as you can. Don’t let anyone move it unless they’re a doctor. Treatment usually includes a brace or support while your joint heals. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images)"
