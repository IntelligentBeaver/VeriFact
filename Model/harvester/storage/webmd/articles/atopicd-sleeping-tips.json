        "Sleep is important in general. When you don't sleep enough, your health and emotional well-being suffer. People who are sleep-deprived miss work and visit the doctor more often than those who sleep soundly. The lack of sleep can also make it harder for you to concentrate and get out socially. Driving while sleepy increases the risk of car accidents. Excessive tiredness can also make you moodier and more cranky than usual. If you have AD, a lack of sleep could make your symptoms flare up. And people who have both eczema and sleep problems tend to be less healthy than those who don't have these two conditions."

        "Both children and adults with AD say they have trouble falling asleep. They also wake up more often during the night and feel sleepy during the day as a result. You're more likely to have trouble sleeping if your AD is severe or you're in the middle of a flare. The most likely cause of sleep disruptions in AD is itching, which tends to get worse at night. One possible reason for the itch is that the skin barrier doesn't work as well at night, leading to more water loss and drier, itchier skin. When you're itchy, you scratch. Constant scratching damages your skin. In response, your body launches an allergic response. The chemicals released during that response cause even more middle-of-the-night awakenings and more disrupted sleep. They also damage your skin, making the itch even worse. A lack of sleep also changes your immune system, boosting levels of inflammatory chemicals like interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-12 in your body. It also lowers levels of melatonin, a hormone that promotes sleep. Lower levels of these chemicals might be another reason why you don't sleep well. Also, sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea are more common in people with AD, possibly because both conditions feature inflammation . Eventually, you'll get into a cycle where AD prevents you from sleeping, which will make your itching and other symptoms even worse."

They feel cool and soft against your skin, plus they absorb moisture when you sweat. Layer a cotton blanket and duvet on top. You can pull them off during the night if you get too warm. Night clothes made from cotton, bamboo, or silk are cool and comfortable. If you often scratch at night, you may want to wear cotton gloves to bed. Keeping your skin well-moisturized is important at any time of day, but especially at night when itching could wake you up. Apply a thick layer of emollient or moisturizer to your skin within an hour before you go to bed. Cover it with wet wraps or bandages to hold in moisture."
