        "Diabetes mellitus, also called diabetes, is a term for several conditions involving how your body turns food into energy. The term comes from the Greek word “diabetes,” which means to siphon or to pass through, and the Latin word “mellitus,” which means sweet. In 2021, 529 million people worldwide and 38.4 million in the U.S. had diabetes.",
        "When you eat a carbohydrate, your body turns it into a sugar called glucose and sends that to your bloodstream. Your pancreas releases insulin, a hormone that helps move glucose from your blood into your cells, which use it for energy.",
        "When you have diabetes and don’t get treatment, your body doesn’t use insulin like it should. Too much glucose stays in your blood, a condition usually called high blood sugar . This can cause health problems that may be serious or even life-threatening.",
        "There’s no cure for diabetes. But with treatment and lifestyle changes, you can live a long, healthy life.",
