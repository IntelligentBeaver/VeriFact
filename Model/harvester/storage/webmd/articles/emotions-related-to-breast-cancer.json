        "Estes, a 45-year-old pediatric nurse practitioner from Palmetto, GA, says she was caught off guard because she didn’t have any family history of cancer except for a grandfather with prostate cancer . While a family history of cancer is a risk factor, cancer can still happen if it doesn’t run in your family. Most women who get breast cancer don’t have a family history of the disease.",
        "As a health care worker, Estes’ medical instincts pushed her to get what felt like a mastitis breast pain , clogged milk ducts that may happen when you breastfeed, checked out. “I knew that I didn't have mastitis because I was not [breast]feeding.”",
        "In September 2018, Estes was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma , a common type of breast cancer that starts in the milk ducts. It makes up about 80% of all breast cancer cases."
