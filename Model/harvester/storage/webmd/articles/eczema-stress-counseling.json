        "A lot of times, people view mental health and physical health as two separate things. But with eczema, and other skin conditions, there’s a direct link between the two. The nerves in your body connect to your brain and skin through neuropeptides. So when you feel stressed, it can show up on your skin.",
        "When you’re in stressful situations, your body creates more hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. If your body makes too much cortisol, it can affect your immune system. If your immune system is lowered, it can cause an inflammatory response in your skin. With eczema, you’re especially at risk for these responses.",
        "Similarly, anxiety, anger, low self-esteem, sleeplessness, or depression can all result from eczema. These feelings create more stress, which continues the cycle of eczema flares. It’s important to get help if you notice any of these feelings. Not only to benefit your skin, but also to protect your overall mental health."
