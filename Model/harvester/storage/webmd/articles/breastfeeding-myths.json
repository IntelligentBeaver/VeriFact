        "Fact: The more you nurse, the more milk you make. Breaking your regular nursing schedule to \"rest\" the breast actually may decrease your milk supply, says Lebbing.",
        "This myth got started, she says, because skipping a feeding or pumping during the day results in greater supply of milk at night. But by the next day you will have less milk if you skip a feeding. \"The only way to ensure a steady supply is to keep expressing milk as regularly as you can,\" says Lebbing. You should nurse at least nine to 10 times a day to ensure milk production.",
        "Myth # 3. Formula fed babies sleep better. Fact: Research indicates that babies fed on formula do not sleep better, although they may sleep longer. \"Because bottle milk doesn't get digested as quickly, it may be a longer stretch between feedings so your baby may sleep longer,\" says Pat Sternum, RN, IBCLC, a lactation counselor at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City.Â",
        "But there's a downside. Formula remains in the baby's system longer, so it begins to ferment, she says. This results in what she calls \"ultra-stinky poop!\" Breastfed babies typically start sleeping longer at 4 weeks old and soon are sleeping the same amount of time as formula-fed babies."

However, experts do believe breastfeeding is 98% effective -- similar to other forms of birth control. La Leche League International experts say hormones involved in breastfeeding prevent ovulation , thereby blocking your ability to conceive for up to 14 or 15 months following delivery.",
