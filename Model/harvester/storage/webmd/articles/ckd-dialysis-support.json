        "When Kim Betts was 59, she was diagnosed with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) after a combination of two drugs she was on, the blood pressure medication losartan and the anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam , caused her to go into kidney failure. “By the time I was diagnosed, I only had 5% kidney function, and I needed to go on dialysis ,” recalls the 61-year-old former nurse, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee. It was a scary – and lonely – time for Betts. She felt like she had very few people to turn to. A triathlete, most of her friends were bikers and runners, like her. “Most of my social life revolved around physical activity,” she says. “But I was so exhausted all the time I couldn’t even make it to church. I felt so isolated.” Social support is crucial if you have CKD and are on dialysis. Research suggests that it improves quality of life and increases the likelihood that you’ll stick to treatment. Here’s a closer look at why it’s so key and what you can do to get the support you need."

        "Dialysis takes a toll, not just on your body, but on your mind and emotions, too. “It’s a huge life change,” says Marissa Argentina, patient programs director at the National Kidney Foundation. One 2020 study of 150 dialysis patients found that most reported symptoms of depression , anxiety, and stress. “If you do dialysis at a center, it’s a huge time commitment that eats up several hours three times a week. If you do it at home, it takes a lot of learning and adjustments, not just for you, but for your family members as well.” Here are some ways that social support can help: Shared experiences. If you talk to someone else on dialysis, you’ll feel less alone. “It helps to speak to another patient who is going through the same lived experience,” says Argentina. “It’s a whole other perspective that your loved one, and medical team, can’t provide.” Other people on dialysis can also share what’s helped them cope, both physically and emotionally. “Oftentimes, many patients feel guilt that they’ve done something to cause their advanced CKD,” says Argentina. “It can be helpful to talk to others about that and realize that they’re not at fault.”"
