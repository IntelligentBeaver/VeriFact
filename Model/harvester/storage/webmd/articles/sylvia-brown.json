        "Born in Japan to an American father and French mother, Sylvia Brown was raised bilingually in the U.S. and Europe. The daughter of a U.S. Navy serviceman, Brown attended 13 different schools as a child and is also conversant in Spanish and German.",
        "Brown graduated with a Bachelor of Science in economics from the Wharton School at The University of Pennsylvania in 1982. She then received a Master of Arts in international relations, with a concentration in economic development, from the University of Pennsylvania in 1984.",
        "After completing her education, Brown lived in New York City for nine years, where she worked in banking, public relations, and financial marketing. Her career specialty has always been in economic development, particularly the role of women in Third World Societies, so she traveled extensively during this time to South America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Brown married a U.N. official, and together they were posted to a number of war zones, including Croatia on the Bosnian border during the Yugoslav war and Pakistan on the Afghan border, where she ran a humanitarian project for Afghan refugees.",
        "The idea for The Post-Pregnancy Handbook initially came to Brown within days of giving birth to her first child in 1993. However, it wasn't until the fall of 1996, well after the birth of her second baby when she was spending time in Paris, that she started to research and write the book. Originally published in France, The Post-Pregnancy Handbook was published in the U.S. in July 2002.",
        "\"Most pregnancy and childbirth books are written by doctors who often talk down to women. Before writing a word of my book, I distributed an extensive questionnaire to 300 women and interviewed 57 specialists in maternal health,\" writes Brown.",
        "Brown continues her humanitarian work for a British Charity called Learning for Life, which supports educational projects in South Asia, focusing on vulnerable groups such as girls, the handicapped, and Afghan refugees. Most recently, Brown developed a successful program for LFL whereby a British school \"sponsors\" an Afghan refugee school and the children form links across the world.",
        "Continuing in the philanthropic tradition of the Brown family of Providence, R.I., founders of Brown University, Sylvia Brown 's career, charity work, and her book reflect a deep interest in women's issues and improving the quality of life for women worldwide.",
