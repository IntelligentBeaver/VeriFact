For depression alone, the annual cost for treatment and lost wages may be as high as $52 billion.

Emmons, author of The Chemistry of Joy: A Three-Step Program for Overcoming Depression through Western Science and Eastern Wisdom, prescribes medications for his patients, but he also highly recommends exercise and good nutrition as physical treatments for depression , combined with a few targeted mood supplements ."

Fugh-Berman says that trials in the U.S. have been oddly less positive than in Germany, where it is widely prescribed.

However, an analysis of 37 clinical trials found that St. John’s wort may have minimal to no benefit for those with more severe forms of depression. Although more research is needed, St. John’s wort may also have the potential to reduce symptoms of anxiety , premenstrual syndrome (PMS ), or perimenopausal mood changes. Available as capsules, tablets, liquid extracts, and teas, a typical dose of St. John’s wort ranges from 900 to 1,200 milligrams a day, and it should be taken for at least one to three months, just as with pharmaceutical anti-depressants, to see the best effect. St. John’s wort does have the potential for serious interactions with a wide variety of prescription drugs, including birth control pills , antidepressants , HIV medications, and blood thinners . It can also interact with other herbs or supplements. Mainly, it may lower the effectiveness of certain medications, Fugh-Berman tells WebMD. St. John’s wort may also lead to an increase in side effects when taken with pharmaceutical antidepressants."
