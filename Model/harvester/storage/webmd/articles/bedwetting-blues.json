        "Nov. 6, 2000 -- Michelle Taylor (not her real name) is no stranger to soggy sheets and training pants. This Idaho mother of four has washed more than her share over the years. Her two oldest children, Amy (age 8) and Tania (almost 7) both wet the bed nightly until they were over 6 years old. And Michelle, who says bed-wetting seems to run in her family, is wondering if her two other children (aged 3 and 8 months) will follow the pattern.",
        "Michelle's girls are not alone. An estimated 5 to 7 million American children over the age of 6 regularly wet the bed at night, according to recent statistics from the National Kidney Foundation (NKF). It's so common and so misunderstood that the NKF began running public service advertisements this year featuring baseball star Mark McGwire -- a former bed wetter -- to raise awareness of the issue. They want parents to understand that bed-wetting is a developmental or medical problem that can be treated, rather than a form of stubborn or disobedient behavior on the part of a child. But in order to get help, parents and their children need to break through some of the mythology that has surrounded bed-wetting for so long."

        "While a small number of bed-wetting cases are due to medical conditions such as a kidney infection or other urological problems, Alan Greene, MD, a San Francisco Bay Area pediatrician, says enuresis is most often a developmental issue. Children who wet the bed simply don't \"shut off\" urine production at night. This ability normally occurs around the age of 5, when bed-wetting will stop on it's own for 90% of kids, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
        "While babies produce urine around the clock, toddlers start to go to the bathroom on a daytime and nighttime schedule once their bodies start to produce a substance called 'anti-diuretic hormone' (ADH) that inhibits urine production. In addition, as kids mature they become more sensitive to the feeling (produced by stretching of the bladder walls) that they need to urinate.",
        "Children who continue to wet the bed beyond the age of 6 may not be producing enough ADH hormone at appropriate times, or may not yet be attuned to their bodies' signals, or both, says Greene. Parents should start looking into formal treatment sometime between the ages of 6 and 7, according to the National Enuresis Society -- or sooner if the child seems troubled by the bed-wetting.",
        "The first step is to work with the child's doctor to rule out any illness and to develop a safe and effective treatment plan. The two main approaches are behavioral modification and medications that inhibit urine production. \"Almost all kids can be dry within about 12 weeks, with treatment,\" says Greene."

In theory, children on this medicine will be more likely to awaken when they need to go to the bathroom. However, it has many troublesome side effects including nervousness, intestinal problems, and excessive tiredness during the day. And as with many medications, an overdose can be fatal.",
        "The newer drug treatment, Desmopressin is a hormone that is chemically similar to ADH and works by inhibiting urine production. Taken before bedtime , it can help children make it through the night without wetting. It is available in nose drops, nasal spray, and tablet forms. Headaches, nausea , upset stomach , and nasal irritation (from the drop and spray forms) are the most common side effects. In some cases, depression, agitation, dizziness , and a reduction in the ability to produce tears can occur.",
        "While using medications may sound easier than getting up every few hours, parents should be aware that they only have a success rate of around 50% and don't train the child's body to hold its urine on its own, says Greene. Therefore, many kids revert to bed-wetting after they stop taking the drugs. Still, these medicines can be a good option when a child faces an overnight trip away from home, at camp or a sleepover, for example."
