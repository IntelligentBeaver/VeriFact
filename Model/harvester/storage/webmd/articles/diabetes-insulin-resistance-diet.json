        "Insulin is a hormone your pancreas makes that helps move sugar (glucose) from your blood into your muscles, fat, and liver cells, where your body uses it for energy. Insulin resistance happens when these cells don’t respond well to insulin and can't take in glucose easily. When you don't have enough insulin, extra glucose stays in your bloodstream i nstead of moving into your cells. This results in the buildup of too m uch sugar in your bloodstream, which may lead to type 2 prediabetes or diabetes.",
