        "Having lived with HIV for more than 20 years, I've had plenty of situations where I had to ask potential sex partners about their status and when they were last tested. As uncomfortable and frightening as it was, I had to develop the courage to be transparent with them about my HIV status and when I was last tested for STIs.",

        "Because, at the end of the day, I have to be proud of myself for honoring and living in my truth. With no shame.",
        "There are also very real concerns about backlash, including violence, as a result of disclosing your HIV status. This can even lead to prosecution linked to HIV criminalization laws, which vary from state to state. There are times people have been wrongfully charged, prosecuted, and imprisoned because of these laws, which continue to stigmatize and polarize people living with HIV in cruel and harmful ways."
