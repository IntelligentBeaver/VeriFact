        "Alopecia areata is a condition in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own hair follicles. This can cause hair to fall out on the scalp or other parts of the body. The most common areas where people with alopecia areata lose hair are the scalp and beard. Hair loss with alopecia areata does not leave scars, so hair can grow back over time.",
        "Aside from hair loss, some people may get burning or itching where the hair falls out. Changes to the nail, like tiny dents (called pits), may also happen.",
        "Experts suggest that chemicals in the immune system called cytokines may become overactive, attack hair follicles, and cause hair loss. These pathways have allowed health care providers to identify medicines that can work to treat alopecia areata.",
        "Olumiant contains the medicine baricitinib, which helps calm the overactive cytokines in the immune system. Specifically, baricitinib blocks a chemical called Janus kinase, which blocks the activity of the specific cytokines interferon-γ and interleukin-15."
