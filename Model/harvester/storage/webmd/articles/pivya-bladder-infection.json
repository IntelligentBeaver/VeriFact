        "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections in the world. They happen more often in women. UTIs include bladder and kidney infections. Bladder infections are sometimes also called cystitis or referred to as uncomplicated UTIs. Common symptoms with bladder infections can include a burning feeling when you pee ( dysuria ), frequently feeling the need to pee even though not much comes out when you do ( urgency ), and pain in your lower belly area. Kidney infections are sometimes also called pyelonephritis . Common symptoms with kidney infections can include the symptoms above plus fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or pain in your back or side.",

Pivya is approved to treat uncomplicated UTIs or bladder infections in adult women caused by certain bacteria. These bacteria include susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli , Proteus mirabilis , and Staphylococcus saprophyticus ."
