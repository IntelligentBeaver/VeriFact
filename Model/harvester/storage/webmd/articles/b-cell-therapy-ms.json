If you have MS, some B cells enter your brain and spinal cord and attack the myelin sheath that protects your nerves.",
        "B-cell therapy uses drugs called monoclonal antibodies to attack these cells. These meds stick to the surface of B cells. This kills the cells, helps ease inflammation, and plays a part in slowing down nerve damage.",
        "B-cell therapy might affect other parts of your immune system as they fight MS. That’s because B cells affect other immune cells called T cells. T cells usually kill viruses and bacteria. But when you have MS, B cells recruit T cells into your brain. There, they cause inflammation.",
        "When your number of B cells goes down, your amount of T cells that cause inflammation goes down, too. At the same time, your level of something called regulatory T cells goes up. Regulatory T cells turn off inflammation. They may even help slow your immune system’s attacks on your body."
