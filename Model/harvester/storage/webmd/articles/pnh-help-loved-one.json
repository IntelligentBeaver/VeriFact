        "If you have a loved one with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), you know firsthand how challenging it can be to live with this disease. You may not think of yourself as a caretaker. After all, you’re just someone’s spouse or child, so you are supposed to be there to help. But whether you live in the same house or across the country, you’re in a caregiving role. It’s very common: Almost 30% of all adults in the United States are caregivers, including 20% of people who work full-time. Caregivers of people with rare diseases, like PNH, may find the job is even more time-intensive: One survey found that they spend about 37 hours a week on average providing care, which is about 12 more hours a week than general caregivers. You may help your loved one do things they are too fatigued to do themselves, like household chores. You may occasionally drive them to a doctor’s appointment or help them manage their prescriptions. You also provide emotional support when your loved one deals with the emotions that come with living with a rare disease."
