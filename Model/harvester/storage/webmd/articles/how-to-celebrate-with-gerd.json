        "Gastroesophageal reflux disease happens when stomach acid and partially digested food flows backward into the esophagus. The tissue that lines the esophagus, which is the tube that transports food from the mouth to the stomach, becomes inflamed and possibly damaged with GERD.",
        "Most people with GERD, including me, have a lower esophageal sphincter (LES) that doesn’t function properly. Under normal conditions, the LES shuts tightly to keep food, fluids, and acid in the stomach where they belong. With GERD, the LES doesn’t close properly, resulting in discomfort and pain.",
        "More Joy, Less GERD",
        "People with GERD tend to know what foods and beverages trigger it for them, but sometimes we need reminders about how to eat, especially when we’re at a wedding or a night out with friends. Here are some helpful ways to enjoy time with family and friends without upsetting your stomach."

Eat smaller, balanced meals throughout the day to avoid extreme hunger.",

Fat digestion also requires bile acids, which can irritate the tissue in the esophagus. Limit fatty foods such as cheese, salami, sausage, and bacon, and opt for chicken, fish, or shrimp instead of marbled cuts of beef. Choose lower-fat side dishes such as plain or sweet potato or green beans to minimize fat intake."

        "It’s tempting to crash on the couch after a get-together, but it’s one of the worst things to do when you have GERD. It takes time for the stomach to empty. Lying down too soon after eating encourages acidic stomach contents to creep up into the esophagus. Wait at least three hours after eating and elevate your head at night to keep stomach acid from flowing backward. I sleep with three pillows, but a foam wedge that raises your head at least 6 inches is what experts advise. If possible, dance or walk around after eating to help stimulate the stomach to empty faster.",
