        "Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) describes a group of cancers that make blood cells in your bone marrow unable to mature and become healthy blood cells. MDS can cause big challenges to your physical and emotional well-being. MDS can make you feel out of breath and exhausted even after a good night’s sleep. It can also make you have frequent infections. Treatments, such as blood transfusions or chemotherapy , can be difficult and stressful on your body. MDS is also very hard to cure, and most people with low-risk MDS have to find ways to learn to live with a cancer that never really goes away. The most disruptive symptom for people with low-risk MDS is usually a lack of energy and low stamina, says Cecilia Arana Yi, MD, a hematologist and oncologist at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, AZ. This fatigue, which can be overwhelming , is partly caused by anemia (low levels of red blood cells), but other things likely drive it, too, such as inflammation . For people with high-risk MDS, she says, the main concern is their ability to endure chemotherapy and bone marrow transplants. Extreme fatigue also plays a big role in their quality of everyday life, and it can even affect survival. No matter how serious your MDS is, it can greatly affect your quality of life. MDS is different for everyone, so ways for improving your well-being are different, depending on the nature of your condition."

        "The most important way to improve your quality of life with MDS is to find the treatment that works best for you, Arana Yi says. “If the patient is having their best response to their treatment, they will have a better quality of life,” she says. Doctors will check your treatment response, in part, by looking at hemoglobin levels (how well your red blood cells can carry oxygen through your body) and something called transfusion dependence. Many people with low-risk, or chronic, MDS have to get blood transfusions every so often to replenish their healthy red blood cells. That can help improve anemia and the extreme fatigue it causes. But, often once people start getting transfusions, they can become dependent on them and the time between visits starts to get shorter. This means more frequent trips to the clinic – and increased treatment costs."

Reducing transfusion dependence also reduces the financial burden of treatment, she says. This reduced stress on your time and resources gives you more freedom to do joyful activities, return to work, and have a social life. If a certain treatment to improve your anemia doesn’t help ease your fatigue, there are likely other factors at play.

For example, you should quit smoking (including vaping) and lower your alcohol intake. You can also try to maintain a weight that allows you to feel healthy and able to do physical activities you enjoy. Better physical health can also make your treatments both more effective and easier on your body. “For [patients] who have high-risk MDS, it’s certainly very important to maintain a healthy lifestyle,” Arana Yi says. “[This improves] efficacy of chemotherapy, and the side effects are much less for patients living a healthy lifestyle. And being fit is also a very important factor for transplant eligibility, [as well as] dealing with less transplant complications.” Heart disease is one of the major conditions that can happen along with low-risk MDS, she says. So it’s important to address risk factors like high blood pressure and cholesterol to improve your quality of life. It may also help to look at alternative methods if you think they’ll improve your mental well-being. Many people with MDS have reported that meditating, for example, helps with chronic exhaustion. Other activities might include yoga, tai chi, or other nontraditional approaches – just make sure to talk with your doctor to make sure it’s safe."

You may also ask your doctor if there are any easier options for how you get your treatment. For example, clinical trials have shown that the way doctors give drugs to treat MDS has a big impact on patients’ quality of life, Arana Yi says. For example, rather than usual treatment plans that often involve up to a week straight of meds each month, she says, some trials have allowed people to take one treatment orally every 3-4 weeks. “The patients like it and are very enthusiastic to participate in treatments that are very easy to administer,” she says."

For example, clinical trials have shown that the way doctors give drugs to treat MDS has a big impact on patients’ quality of life, Arana Yi says. For example, rather than usual treatment plans that often involve up to a week straight of meds each month, she says, some trials have allowed people to take one treatment orally every 3-4 weeks. “The patients like it and are very enthusiastic to participate in treatments that are very easy to administer,” she says.",

For many years, health care providers have neglected quality of life as the end goal for patients with MDS and other blood cancers. “Right now, we are changing the paradigm,” she says. This includes better use of patient-reported outcomes, where someone specifically describes the impact of their treatment on their well-being, in addition to clinical concerns, such as hemoglobin levels, that have long been used as a proxy for quality of life. “We understand that patient well-being is a priority,” Arana Yi says. “Not only how long the patient is going to live, but how well they are going to live.”"
