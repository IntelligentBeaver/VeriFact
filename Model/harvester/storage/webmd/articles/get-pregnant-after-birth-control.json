        "It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor about getting pregnant before you start trying. While most women conceive within a year of trying, there are many different factors -- like age, health history, and weight -- that can impact your fertility. If you’re under 35 and it’s been more than a year since you stopped using birth control and you haven’t been able to get pregnant, it’s a good idea to let your doctor know. If you’re 35 or older, you should see your doctor after 6 months of trying. An OB/GYN, family practitioner with experience in women’s health, or a fertility specialist can evaluate you and make suggestions that may up your odds of getting pregnant."
