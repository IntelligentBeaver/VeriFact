For example, yoga uses breath and movement to bring energy into the body, and move it through the chakras. Ayurveda uses herbal medicine, meditation , and other practices to open the chakras and balance energy.",

        "Western science hasn’t studied chakra healing very much and doesn’t have a clear understanding of if or how it works. Most Western research about chakras has looked for links between the chakras and the parts of your endocrine and nervous systems that are near them on your body.  For example, scientists might study the pineal gland, a part of your endocrine system , which is in the same part of your body as your third eye chakra (ajna).",
        "Some research has tried to measure changes in electrical energy where your chakras are located on your body. Other studies have asked people how they feel after they do treatments to balance or open their chakras. Most people say that doing practices to balance their chakras helps them deal with stress and anxiety and improves their mental and emotional health.",
        "Many Western doctors think about chakra balancing practices as a form of complementary or alternative medicine. These are healing practices that people might use along with other, more standard treatments to help themselves feel better emotionally, physically , or spiritually.",
        "They recommend also talking to a health care provider in addition to using chakra healing practices if you don’t feel well."
