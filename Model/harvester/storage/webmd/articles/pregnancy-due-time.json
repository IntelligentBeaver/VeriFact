        "It was only when she miscarried that Himel-Nelson and her husband, a Navy reservist, felt the loss. \"When I had that miscarriage , we realized we really did want to be parents and we wanted it to happen sooner rather than later,\" she says. Within a couple years, she and her husband started trying to conceive -- this time, intentionally.",

        "An estimated 8% to 20% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. In the past, women who miscarried were told to wait 2 to 3 months. Today the thinking has changed, since several studies show no increased risk with shorter intervals between pregnancies."
