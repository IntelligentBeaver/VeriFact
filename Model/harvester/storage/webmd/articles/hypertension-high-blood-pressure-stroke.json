        "Strokes caused by blocked blood flow. In almost 9 out of 10 cases, you have a stroke because something, usually a clot, blocks the flow of blood to the brain . Doctors call this an ischemic stroke. Without oxygen, brain cells start dying within minutes. Usually, a clot forms either at the site of a clogged blood vessel or somewhere else in the body and then reaches the brain. A traveling clot usually means you have an underlying issue, often an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation (AFib).",
        "The clots happen more often with high blood pressure because it speeds up atherosclerosis, a condition that makes your arteries get harder, narrower, and clogged with fatty plaque. Hypertension also makes you more likely to have atrial fibrillation . It causes blood to collect in the heart, where a clot can form. AFib is very dangerous because it raises your chances of stroke fivefold. But there are treatments for it."
