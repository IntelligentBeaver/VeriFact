        "Drugstore shelves have no shortage of makeup, cleansers, and lotions labeled “for sensitive skin.” But how do you know if you should use these products? And if do have sensitive skin, will they really help?",
        "There’s no official definition for sensitive skin, says Temitayo Ogunleye, MD, assistant professor of clinical dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. But most doctors think of it as skin that’s irritated by things that don’t bother most people.",
        "It’s actually quite simple, Ogunleye says: If your skin burns, itches, or gets red and inflamed after you apply makeup or skin-care products, those are good signs that you have sensitive skin. The harder part, she says, is finding out what causes it.",
        "For some people, those symptoms are a signs of an allergy or a mild form of a skin disease like eczema or rosacea, says Leila Tolaymat, MD, a dermatologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. “These conditions can flare-up in certain situations, like when the skin is exposed to certain ingredients or environments,” she says. Your doctor can help you sort out if you have one of these issues or if a skin care product is the cause."
