High blood pressure is common with ADPKD and can damage your kidneys. Try these tips to lower how much salt you eat: Aim for less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. (It's the main ingredient in salt.) Buy fresh foods. Cook meals from scratch. Don’t add salt when you prepare meals. Use herbs and spices to flavor food. Limit how much prepared, packaged, and canned food you eat. Avoid foods with hidden salt, like bacon, bread, breakfast cereal, ham, sausage, and ready-to-eat foods. Check Nutrition Facts on food labels. Avoid foods with a Daily Value of sodium of 20% or higher. Rinse canned vegetables , beans, fish, and meat before you eat or cook them. Eat less restaurant food and takeout food. Restaurants tend to use a lot of salt."
