How much sight you lose, and how quickly that happens, depends on the type of IRD you have. The good news is that low vision rehabilitation can help. Low vision rehabilitation is the standard care for any kind of vision loss that can’t be helped with glasses. Think of it as physical therapy for your eyes.

        "When you start to lose your sight, it’s normal to feel sad or angry about it. Vision loss changes your life. It can take away some of your independence and make it hard to enjoy your favorite hobbies or complete responsibilities. You’re also more likely to fall and have other accidents that could hurt you. But studies show that people who do low vision rehab are less likely to have accidents, which helps keep you independent. The research says they’re happier, too."

        "First, you’ll get a full checkup with a specialist. They’ll want to understand how much vision you’ve lost and how it’s affected by your disease. For example, do you have blind spots? Do you have blurred vision? They’ll also want to know your goals. What activities are most important to you that you want to make sure you can keep doing? Is it cooking? Going to the movies? The specialist will come up with a plan for you that may include: Methods you can use to make the most of the eyesight you have. For example, in “eccentric viewing,” you look around your blind spot to see objects with your peripheral vision . New ways to do daily tasks . This includes writing, cooking, and grocery shopping. Mobility training. This teaches you how to get around safely with your current level of vision. Changes you can make around your house to help keep you independent. For example, you might make new labels for medicines and spices that are easier to see."
