        "When your baby flashes his gummy smile, caring for teeth that have yet to sprout is probably the last thing on your mind. \"The surprising thing to a lot of parents is how early you need to start,\" says Amr Moursi, DDS, PhD, associate professor and chair of New York University's Department of Pediatric Dentistry.",
        "At birth, your child's baby teeth -- 20 in total -- are already formed, hidden within the jawbone. Wiping your baby's gums once or twice a day with a soft cloth will \"reduce the bacteria load and intensity [in a child's mouth ] so when teeth erupt, there should be less cavity-causing bacteria,\" Moursi says. It's also a good way to get your baby used to having her mouth worked on.",
        "Dental visits should start early, preferably within six months of the first tooth coming in, and no later than your child's first birthday."
