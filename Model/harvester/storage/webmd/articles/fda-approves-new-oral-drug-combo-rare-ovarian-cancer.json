        "May 9, 2025 -- A new oral cancer drug combination has gained a quick federal nod after clinical trials found that it provides significant and longer-lasting relief for a rare ovarian cancer that doesn’t respond well to standard therapies. This marks the first and only FDA-approved medicine for low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) that tests positive for a gene change known as the KRAS mutation.",
        "The treatment includes two drugs known as avutometinib and defactinib and is marketed as Avmapki Fakzynja Co-Pack. It is for adult patients who have already tried other therapies, offering  hope to about 6,000 to 8,000 women in the United States who are living with this disease.",

Patients were given oral doses of avutometinib twice weekly and defactinib twice daily for the first three weeks of each four-week cycle, continuing until cancer progression or severe side effects occurred. Results showed that the tumor shrank in 44% of patients, with the response lasting from 3.3 months to 31.1 months.",

Avutometinib blocks a protein called MEK, but when that protein is blocked, another protein called FAK can become more active. That’s where the second medicine, defactinib, comes in, blocking the FAK protein to prevent the cancer from fighting back. For each four-week cycle, patients take Avmapki twice a week and Fakzynja twice a day for three weeks, as long as the treatment’s working and the side effects are tolerable."
