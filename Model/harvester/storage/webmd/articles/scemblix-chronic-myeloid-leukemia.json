        "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a type of blood cancer . CML is Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) when pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 break off and swap places. This creates a new abnormal chromosome that is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The Philadelphia chromosome causes leukemia by affecting your normal bone marrow and causing changes in your white blood cells.",
        "Scemblix is usually used to treat Ph+ CML that is in the chronic phase and that has been treated with at least two medicines called tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It can also be used in Ph+ CML that is in the chronic phase and has a specific mutation called the T315I mutation. The chronic phase means it is stable and developing slowly. Your health care provider will help find out what stage your leukemia is based on certain tests on your blood and bone marrow."

        "Scemblix is a type of medicine called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). This means it is a medicine that works by binding to specific sites on abnormal proteins. When the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome is created, it creates a fusion between two genes that is known as the BCR-ABL1 fusion. This fusion is a protein, and Scemblix works by attaching to the protein and blocking the ABL1 part of the fusion. It treats the leukemia by helping to prevent or limit changes in your bone marrow that lead to abnormal white blood cells."

This is so that the medication can be fully absorbed into your body to treat your leukemia. Scemblix should be taken whole, and you should not crush or chew the tablets.

It can also cause issues with your pancreas, which can sometimes show up in blood tests. If not treated, low blood cell counts can cause serious infections that can be dangerous and even life-threatening.

It’s important to go to all of your bloodwork appointments so that your health care provider can make sure Scemblix is safe for you. These tests will make sure you do not have any problems with your blood cell counts that make it unsafe for you to take Scemblix. This is because Scemblix can cause low blood cell counts, such as low platelets ( thrombocytopenia ), low red blood cells ( anemia ), and low white blood cells ( neutropenia ). It can also cause issues with your pancreas, which can sometimes show up in blood tests. If not treated, low blood cell counts can cause serious infections that can be dangerous and even life-threatening. They will also do other tests regularly, like testing your blood pressure to make sure Scemblix is safe for you to continue taking.",
