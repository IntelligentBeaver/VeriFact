        "Prediabetes affects nearly 98 million people in the U.S. ages 18 and older, which amounts to 38% of the population, according to the CDC. In prediabetes, blood glucose levels (BGL) are higher than normal but not high enough to qualify for type 2 diabetes. However, most cases of type 2 diabetes are usually diagnosed after months or years of having prediabetes.",
        "There’s nothing “pre” about prediabetes, which is caused by cells’ resistance to insulin. Insulin binds to cells and allows glucose to enter, lowering BGL. In addition to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance is linked to inflammation and the buildup of plaque in blood vessels that can block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Prediabetes can also alter gut health in ways you can and cannot feel.",
        "How Prediabetes Affects Your Gut",
        "The gut is home to trillions of microbes, nearly all of which benefit your health. Gut bacteria produce several types of compounds, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as butyrate. People who don’t process insulin properly have lower levels of a type of bacteria that produces butyrate."

        "When SCFA production is limited, it affects the strength of the gut wall. A weak wall allows a compound called lipopolysaccharides to leak into the blood and circulate around. Lipopolysaccharides are linked to inflammation that increases insulin resistance and makes it harder to control BGL.",
        "People with prediabetes have a lower gut diversity, meaning fewer types of beneficial bacteria live in their gut. A diverse gut is linked to a lower risk for gut health issues, including inflammation and obesity which contribute to higher BGL and increase the risk for developing type 2 diabetes.",
        "Elevated BGL can harm nerves and result in gastroparesis, which prevents your stomach from emptying properly. In gastroparesis, nerve damage in the stomach slows or stops digestion and causes pain and bloating. Nerve damage can also disrupt other normal gut functions, resulting in constipation or diarrhea."

An eating plan that includes the right amount of calories from carbohydrates, fat, and protein is essential for weight control. If you don’t know how to plan a balanced diet, work with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN).",

The body quickly breaks down sugars and refined grains to glucose and elevates glucose levels in the blood. A steady diet of sugar and refined grains can worsen insulin resistance."
