        "One study tallied the average lifetime out-of-pocket cost to treat psoriasis symptoms and related emotional health at $11,498. Those  price tags likely don't include biologics, one of the most expensive -- and effective- - treatments for severe psoriasis. Other systemic medications can be pricey, too.",
        "Having health insurance can help with costs of medications and office visits. A National Psoriasis Foundation survey reports that about 89% of people with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis patients have health insurance. More than half of them spent more than $2,400 per year in out-of-pocket costs to treat the disease. One report finds out-of-pocket costs were $706 over 6 months. Another review found that people paid about $527 each year out of their pockets to treat psoriasis.",
        "It is difficult to give an exact price. But we do know that people with psoriasis tend to have higher health costs each year compared to those who don't. The costs may reach as high as $135 billion annually, based on one estimate."

Or you might get a prescription for phototherapy -- regular use of ultraviolet (UV) light -- in a doctor’s office or at home with a portable unit. As with medication, light therapy can help relieve skin inflammation and slow the growth of skin cells.",
        "The more phototherapy sessions you need, the higher your cost. Sometimes, people need 20 to 36 sessions over several weeks to get their symptoms under control. Research online found sessions priced at around $65 each, so your phototherapy regimen could cost $1,300 to $2,340. Another estimate says phototherapy could cost about $5,000 over a 3-year span, but that price is directly from the manufacturer and may not take into account insurance. Most private insurance, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, covers in-office phototherapy that is “medically necessary.” But you will have to pick up the copay and meet your deductible first. Insurance usually does not cover in-home phototherapy, and a portable unit can cost $3,000 to $6,000."
