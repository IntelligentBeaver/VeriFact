If you have urgency incontinence (a constant “gotta go” feeling), your doctor may tell you to practice holding your urine for a short time when you get the urge instead of going right away. You can start by holding it for 10 minutes. After you successfully do that a few times, you can increase your time. You can also use set times during the day to go, and increase the time in between those regular bathroom trips. You can help your body learn to wait longer by practicing breathing or relaxation techniques. With some effort, you may be able to tame your symptoms and only have to urinate every 3 or 4 hours. Keep in mind that you may not see results right away. But if you stay with it, you should benefit within a few months."
