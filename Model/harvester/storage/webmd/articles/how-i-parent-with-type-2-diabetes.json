        "If I told you that your diabetes management affects your parenting, would you believe me? It sounds weird, but if you know, you know, and if you don’t know, let me give you a glimpse.",
        "I am a single mother to a smart, handsome, and fast-growing 14-year-old son. I was diagnosed with diabetes before I had him, so he doesn’t know me without it. For the sake of context, my son was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at age 4, and we have both been on a ride with many challenges, but a ride that I’ll never regret. I think we can all agree that caring for a child at any age has its own set of challenges, but caring for a child, caring for yourself, and dealing with a chronic illness compounds it all.",
        "My son has had to learn to care for me in his own way during different stages of my life. We’ve both learned to be patient with each other (I think). He doesn’t verbally communicate much, so I have learned to watch and listen to his mannerisms, noises, and movements. He’s had to help me during one of the most difficult times in my life – my blindness and vision loss."

He also learned to follow directions very quickly because I needed help. I missed a few inches of growth, but I was still able to capture his increased level of maturity in such a short time. After I gained some sight back in my left eye, I was able to see about 30-35% more than before. I still needed him for help, but learning to adapt has become a strength of mine that I don’t take lightly.",

        "Living with complications from diabetes can make a parent worry about their child or children’s future because of a possible predisposition to their old unhealthy habits, old unhealthy ways of doing things, and conformity to the society that we currently live in. About 4 years ago, my son’s A1c was very close to the prediabetes stage. The moment that I heard his A1c level was high, I panicked and started changing his lifestyle to mine.",

I began to share with his teachers that they should only allow him to eat the food that I would send with him daily and not reward him with food, but privileges, such as computer or tablet time. It was rough at first, but he finally got used to the new changes, and ultimately, his A1c levels went down."
