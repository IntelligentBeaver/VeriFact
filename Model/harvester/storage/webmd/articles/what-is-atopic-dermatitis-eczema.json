        "Eczema is the name of a group of inflammatory skin conditions that can cause itching, dryness, rashes, scaly patches, blisters, and infection. It has no cure and isn’t contagious. If you scratch, your skin can get inflamed. This increases swelling and itching. The most common type of eczema is atopic dermatitis . Symptoms of atopic dermatitis can improve or worsen over time. In fact, symptoms can go away for a long time and come back if you touch something you’re allergic to or if a product irritates your skin. About 30 million people in the United States have some form of eczema. An estimated 16.5 million of those people have atopic dermatitis, and 2 out of every 5 people (nearly 40%) have moderate or severe symptoms."

        "Experts don’t know exactly what causes atopic dermatitis and other types of eczema, but think genetic and environmental factors play a part. In fact, people who live in urban areas or are exposed to certain environmental allergens, such as dust or mold, tend to have a higher risk of developing atopic dermatitis. In a clinical trial, researchers wanted to understand how common atopic dermatitis is in Mexican children compared with children from other countries. They found that only 6% of U.S. patients with eczema symptoms were diagnosed with atopic dermatitis. According to the researchers, their findings suggest a lack of diagnosis and treatment among U.S. children who come from low-income families and possibly have limited access to health specialists. We need more clinical trials to help explain why atopic dermatitis is so severe in Hispanic children living in the United States."
