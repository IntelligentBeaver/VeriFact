        "Research suggests that CBD is safe when taken orally in small doses for a short period of time. Studies have shown that taking up to 200 milligrams daily for 13 weeks is usually safe. So far, the FDA has approved only one CBD medication, called Epidiolex, for the treatment of two types of epilepsy . Other CBD products have not received FDA approval, including ones marketed as supplements. That means they are not regulated by the FDA. States have their own CBD regulations and have different ways to ensure safety. Because of the lack of regulation, some CBD products are marketed with misleading or false claims that may cause people to postpone doctor visits to get the right diagnosis and treatment. Also, many of the CBD products aren’t necessarily pure, and the label does not always reflect the amount of the supplement contained or any contaminants, such as THC, that may be there."

        "There are many unknowns about CBD. But the current guidelines are clear that certain people should avoid taking CBD products. CBD is not recommended if you: Are pregnant or breastfeeding: The effect of CBD on pregnancy is not known at this time. The CDC recommends that pregnant women not take any kind of CBD product. CBD is also not recommended if you are breastfeeding. It is unknown whether it can be passed through breast milk. At least one animal study shows high doses of CBD can harm an unborn baby. Have liver disease : Studies show healthy people could get liver damage if they take high doses of the FDA-approved CBD drug, Epidiolex. People who already have liver problems may need to take a lower dose. Have Parkinson’s disease : Data suggests higher doses of CBD may make tremors and muscle movement worse for some people who have Parkinson’s disease. Are a child: The anti-seizure prescription CBD drug (Epidiolex) in a 25-milligram dose is approved for children who are at least 1 year old who have certain health conditions. But it is unclear whether CBD products are safe for children generally. It’s a good idea to keep CBD products in childproof containers. Are older than 55 : Older adults could be at greater risk for some of the side effects of CBD since it may affect thought and motor skills."
