        "If you have dry eye disease, your peepers might need a little more TLC when it gets cold. For starters, cold air doesn’t hold as much moisture as warm air. The drop in humidity makes your tears evaporate even faster. And frigid wind blasting across your face doesn’t help. Plus, you probably spend more time indoors with dry, heated air when temperatures are low. This winter wallop can leave you with eye pain, blurry vision, and/or a gritty feeling. Your eyes might tear up when it feels like something is stuck in them. But these watery drops don’t stick around long enough to provide long-lasting moisture. The good news is there are ways to protect and soothe your eyes this winter. You might need special drops, lifestyle changes, or other treatments. Your eye doctor can tell you what’s best. Here are some tips to get you started."
