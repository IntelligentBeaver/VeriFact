        "By Tracy Winn, as told to Kara Meyer Robinson I was a wheezy sort of kid who got tired easily and seemed to catch every passing virus. It ran in my family. I remember one day my pediatrician sat me on his table and said, “Oh, you poor thing. You have asthma .” Asthma might have been part of it, but no one really knew what “it” was. In college, I took good care of myself and still caught every respiratory germ. I had shots for environmental allergies and took medication every day. In my 20s, as an elementary school teacher, I kept getting pneumonia and had to cut back my hours. My primary symptom was and still is shortness of breath ."

        "I was grateful I had a doctor who knew to test for such a rare disease. But beyond testing, she didn’t know much about it. She had another patient who was 10 years older, had no symptoms, and was doing fine. The doctor said I shouldn’t worry about it, but if I wanted to see a pulmonologist , she’d give me a referral. Since it wasn’t anything to worry about, I didn’t get around to seeing a pulmonologist for about a year. He didn’t know much about AAT deficiency, either, but sent me to the internet to read about it. He also gave me a blood test that showed that I’m a piZZ – I have a type of severe AAT deficiency associated with early-onset emphysema. Months later, he called to say he’d been talking to colleagues and recommended that I start augmentation therapy. At the time, augmentation therapy meant going to the hospital for IVs every month for several hours, or every week for less time. I couldn’t imagine spending my time that way. Being outdoors hiking, birding, and canoeing is what I live for. But climbing hills was getting harder, and the more I read about alpha-1, the more necessary IV therapy seemed to be."
