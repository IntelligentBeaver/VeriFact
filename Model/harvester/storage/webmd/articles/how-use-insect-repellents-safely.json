        "No one likes bug bites. Along with itching and irritation, bites from an infected mosquito, tick, or other insect can lead to illnesses like West Nile virus, Zika virus, and Lyme disease. Bug repellent (also called bug spray) helps keep the bugs away and lowers your chances of getting insect-borne illnesses.",
        "Bug repellents can be sprays, lotions, creams, and sticks. Many bug repellents use a chemical called N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, or DEET for short. As long as you follow the directions carefully, doctors say that the benefits of using DEET outweigh the risks. People have been using DEET to keep bugs away for over 60 years.",

        "Another chemical that's used in bug repellents is called picaridin (chemical name, or KBR 3023). Picaridin is more common in Europe than in the U.S., and it is a synthetic (human-made) copy of chemicals found in the black pepper plant.",
        "Some kinds of bug repellent use a natural product made from the lemon eucalyptus tree, called oil of lemon eucalyptus. A synthetic version of it is called para-menthane-diol, or PMD. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says that DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, and PMD are all safe to use on your skin if you use these products as directed."

It can also be dangerous for your nervous system , especially if it is eaten.",

You should avoid petting animals that have been treated with flea products that use it.

Keep in mind that permethrin also kills \"good\" insects like bees, and might harm birds. Scientists aren't sure if permethrin is safe if you're pregnant."

But the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says not to use bug repellent on babies younger than 2 months old. Use caution putting it on premature babies, because their skin can be more sensitive. DEET is considered safe to use if you're pregnant.",
        "The AAP recommends using repellents with no more than a 30% concentration of DEET for kids over 2 months. A 10% concentration of DEET protects for about two hours. Use the lowest concentration of DEET possible for the amount of time that kids will be exposed to bugs. You can find this information on the product label. In general, you will not need more than a 20-30% concentration of DEET. Bug repellents with high concentrations of DEET (over 50%) don't protect you longer or better."

        "Traps. These devices use various methods to attract and then trap mosquitoes. Many give off carbon dioxide, mimicking people's breath to lure the mosquitos into the trap. Others use pheromones, light, colors, heat, moisture, and other smells to draw mosquitos in. Some traps only work on certain species of mosquitos--for example, light traps don't work well for the kind of mosquitos that carry dengue fever and Zika virus . Scientists are still figuring out how well traps work. If you decide to use them, it's important to check on them often.",
        "Screens, nets, and other physical barriers. If possible, put up screens around your porch or other outdoor areas. Check your screens often, and use a patch kit to fix any holes. You can also put mosquito nets over strollers and seats.",
        "Make outdoor areas less welcoming to mosquitos. Mosquitos lay their eggs in water, and they like to hide under tall grass, sticks, and leaves to stay cool in the heat. Get rid of standing water by emptying out tools, toys, and containers that might hold water after it rains. If you have outdoor space like a yard, cut the grass and rake up leaves so that mosquitos have fewer comfortable spots.",
        "Bug repelling plants. Some plants naturally help keep bugs away, although research isn't complete about how well it works. If you are able to garden or have house plants in containers outside, you can try growing lavender, basil , thyme , mint, lemongrass, chrysanthemum , and marigolds. The mosquito plant is another obvious choice!"

            "Fans. Mosquitoes have trouble getting around in the wind, and studies show that a fan can cut the number of bugs around you in half. Using a window fan, box fan, or overhead fan when you're sitting outside on a porch or stoop will confuse mosquitos and help keep them away. Experts say that fans also spread out the carbon dioxide we breathe out, which mosquitos use to find people to bite.",
            "Citronella candles. Despite the rumors, citronella candles--or other natural bug repellent candles--don't seem to work very well. Plus, when you inhale the smoke from the candle, you also breathe in any chemicals that are in it.",
            "Wearable devices. These include bracelets, stick on skin patches, and clip-ons. Scientists have found that most of them don't work very well. They also only protect the area immediately next to the device, so the rest of your body still gets bitten.",
            "Bug zappers. These devices use electricity to kill mosquitos. But they also kill a lot of the \"good\" bugs that eat mosquitos. In fact, one study showed that less than 1% of all bugs killed by bug zappers were mosquitos. They also kill bugs that birds and other animals need to eat, so they aren't very good for the environment.",
            "Ultrasonic devices . These products claim to use sound waves to keep bugs away, but science hasn't shown that they work. Some ultrasonic devices might even make mosquitos bite more often, although scientists don't really know why.",
