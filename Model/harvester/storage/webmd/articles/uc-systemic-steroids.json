        "The symptoms of ulcerative colitis happen because of inflammation in your digestive tract. Systemic steroids (corticosteroids) are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs doctors have turned to for decades as a first-line treatment for UC and Crohn’s disease, another inflammatory bowel disease. Because of serious side effects and newer medical treatments, doctors don’t use systemic steroids for UC as much as they used to.",
        "Your body makes steroids, which are a type of chemical or hormone, naturally. Systemic steroids that treat UC are a lab-made version of the same hormone. The drug comes in a much higher dose than your body makes on its own. This leads to side effects. These drugs are different from anabolic steroids , which people sometimes use illegally to increase their muscle mass.",
        "Steroids aren’t a cure for ulcerative colitis. But they are highly effective at reducing inflammation and getting you into remission, meaning you don’t have signs of the disease. They aren’t a long-term solution for UC symptoms, because of their serious side effects. Also, symptoms can come back while you’re on them.",
        "Steroids are very good at healing an inflamed bowel. But they aren’t as good at preventing further flare-ups. Once your serious ulcerative colitis reaches remission on steroids, your doctor will switch you to different medications for longer-term use."
