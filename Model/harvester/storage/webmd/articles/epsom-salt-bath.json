The scientific evidence to back up those claims is sparse. Magnesium is one of the main ingredients in Epsom salts, and it's an important nutrient in your diet. But it's not clear that you can absorb much magnesium through your skin. As long as you follow directions, there's little chance that an Epsom salt bath will harm you. It's relatively inexpensive if you want to give it a try."
