        "Lymph nodes are small (about 1-2 centimeters around or the size of a couple of AAA batteries side by side) oval or kidney-shaped structures that are a part of your immune system. They're part of your lymphatic system, which, along with your spleen , tonsils, and adenoids, help you fight off illness and infections. They also filter germs, cancer cells, and wastes out of your lymphatic fluid.",
