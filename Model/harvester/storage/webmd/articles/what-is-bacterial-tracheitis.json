Viruses like these can cause damage to the membrane of the trachea, leaving the body sensitive to infection. However, typically healthy children will recover quickly if they are diagnosed and treated early.",

This is especially true if the child has a long-term tracheostomy, a tube that is inserted into someone’s trachea to deliver oxygen to the lungs after an injury, reduce swelling of the throat, or prevent fluid or food from entering the lungs."
