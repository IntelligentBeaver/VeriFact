        "If you have heart failure, the right treatment can make all the difference in improving your symptoms and extending your life. Treatments range from lifestyle changes like cutting back on salt to a heart transplant for the most serious cases of heart failure. In the U.S., heart failure is more common among Black and Hispanic people than among white people. Black people are more likely to have heart failure at a younger age and lose their lives to the disease. Kelly McCants, MD, a cardiologist with Norton Healthcare in Louisville, KY, calls it the “40/40 club.” “Forty percent of heart failure diagnoses in our hospital happen in African Americans under the age of 40.” McCants says this startling statistic is similar to heart failure rates in other big cities with large Black populations. Besides these health challenges, Black and Latino people face major hurdles to getting treatment for heart failure. Research shows these groups are less likely to get: Care from a cardiologist when they’re in the hospital and critically ill from heart failure Advanced heart failure therapies like a heart transplant A doctor’s referral for a cardiac rehabilitation program Surgery to implant cardiac devices The reasons for these health disparities are complex. Things like your health insurance status, bias in the health care system, and lack of representation in clinical research all play a role. Addressing these barriers can help Black and Hispanic people gain equal access to treatment."

        "When your doctor says you have heart failure, one of the first questions you may ask is how you’re going to afford heart failure treatment . A heart failure diagnosis often requires expensive medicines, frequent hospital visits, and close tracking by doctors. The cost of health care is a critical concern for many people, especially for those who have less money. Data show that people of color people are more often uninsured or underinsured and live in poverty than white people. “When patients are faced with a choice of either taking medication or having money for food, that’s where it becomes a very difficult balance,” says Jim Cheung, MD, a cardiologist and electrophysiologist with Weill Cornell Medicine in New York. The more serious your condition, the more expensive treatment can get. One example: a heart transplant. If you have advanced heart failure, you may need a new heart from a donor, a surgery that costs more than $1.6 million. Transplant centers need proof of health insurance or other financial resources before they will even put you on a waitlist for a new heart."
