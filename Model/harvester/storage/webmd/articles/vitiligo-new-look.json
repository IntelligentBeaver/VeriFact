        "By Melissa M., as told to Keri Wiginton I was 8 years old when I started getting these little white speckles on my knees. I really didn’t think anything of it at first. But then, the spots grew to the size of a half-dollar. Things progressed pretty quickly after that. My mother took me to a doctor who diagnosed me with vitiligo. Even though I was only a child, he didn’t show me much sympathy. Instead, he told me there weren’t any treatments and dismissed my questions. It was a horrific experience that scared me away from dermatologists for decades. Childhood was tough on me in lots of ways. But I’ve gone through therapy and found some really amazing friends since then. It’s because of that strong support system that I’ve come out the other side of vitiligo celebrating my skin. But it took me some time to get here."

        "My mom and I would wake up super early. Then, we’d use makeup to cover the vitiligo on my face and neck as much as possible. She wanted me to have some sense of normalcy, but that process got to be too expensive. I started rocking my spots in about seventh or eighth grade. It wasn’t easy. That’s partly because, along with vitiligo, I was on the heavier side. And I was a biracial kid living in Vermont. I stuck out like a sore thumb and got bullied all the time. Before vitiligo, I was a confident child who made friends easily. I tried to keep that up as I headed towards high school. But it’s hard to be social when people are laughing, spitting, and drawing on you. Some kids thought they were doing me a favor by coloring my white spots with brown marker. Others tried to wipe the vitiligo off my body. Then, there were the people who didn’t want to sit next to me because they thought they might catch something. All that took a toll on my mental health. But I’ve gone through a lot of personal growth since I was a kid. Now I feel perfect in my skin and have nothing to hide. It’s liberating."

Some would tell me my vitiligo was beautiful and the contrast in pigment only highlighted my features. At first, I thought they were poking at me.

The stigma is gone at that point. They know there’s no reason to be afraid. But I still catch people looking at me with disgust. And sometimes, I’ll walk up to them and say, this is vitiligo. Would you like me to spell it for you? Because if you’re going to stare for that long, you must have questions. If I tell you what it is, then you can do your own research. Melissa M., 40, is a vitiligo advocate. She’s lived with the condition for 32 years. You’ll find her rocking her spots under the handle @TheSpottedBeauty on Instagram. She lives in central North Carolina.",
