        "While they're breast-feeding, babies show a marked reduction in almost all viral and bacterial illnesses, including diarrhea , ear infections and respiratory infections, such as pneumonia and meningitis . That's because breast milk contains not only the mom's antibodies, but also hundreds of compounds that alter the growth of bacteria and viruses.",
        "Researchers also have discovered long-term benefits for breast-fed babies: a lower incidence of childhood middle- ear infections , chronic illnesses such as diabetes, allergies and, most recently, even obesity. Schoolchildren who were breast-fed also were found to have IQs about eight points higher.",
        "There's even evidence that bonding between mothers and babies is enhanced with breast-feeding. When mothers nurse, the letdown reflex triggers the release of oxytocin, which sends signals to her brain that produce relaxation, mothering behavior and maternal attachment. Skin -to-skin contact appears to produce the same effect in the baby's brain."

        "Set realistic expectations: Expect to breast-feed eight to 10 times in 24 hours for about 20 minutes to 30 minutes each time. Your baby will let you know when she's hungry (don't wait until she's crying), and she'll typically bunch her feedings together several times in the morning, late afternoon and evening. Eventually, by about four weeks to six weeks, a more regular pattern will emerge ( breakfast , midmorning snack, lunch, midafternoon snack, dinner and nighttime snack). To avoid being overloaded, divvy up household chores and set aside some time each day for yourself."
