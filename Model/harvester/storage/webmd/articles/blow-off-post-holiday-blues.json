        "Hitting January 2 is like going from 60 to zero in one day. The mandatory cheer, cooking, visitors, glitz, glitter, toys, a million chores -- have drowned out the drumbeats of war, the nuclear posturing, the fear of downsizing, all the doubts and fears , for a couple of weeks -- then, over, zip. What now?",
        "The usual blah-blah New Year's resolutions -- lose 20 pounds, go to the gym more, spend more time with your family -- have a way of fading by mid-January as reality sets back in. You go to the office and facing you is a blank calendar. Before you get that sinking feeling -- think.",
        "\"A blank calendar means, literally, a clean slate,\" says Andrew J. DuBrin, PhD, professor of management at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York. \"Think of something positive as of this very minute,\" he advises. \"Say, you just got a little check from an insurance company -- even if it's only $36, that's positive. Maybe you got a compliment from the boss -- that's positive. And old customer calls -- that's positive.\"",
        "\"If you keep looking back at the old year -- especially last year -- you will get into a downward spiral,\" agrees Susan Battley, PsyD, PhD, a leadership psychologist and clinical associate professor at State University of New York at Stony Brook. \"I believe in 'Three Bags Full.' A BAG is a 'Big Audacious Goal.'\" Three is the absolute maximum (mileage may vary -- one might be more realistic)."
