        "Immunocompromised people – who make up 3% of the population and are living with a weakened immune system as a result of certain diseases, cancer treatments, or recent organ transplants – are particularly vulnerable to the measles because they may not tolerate live vaccines like MMR and there are no antiviral therapies for the disease. Higgins suggests speaking with a doctor about your particular level of protection and whether it’s safe to travel to states with reported measles cases.",

        "Beyond getting vaccinated, experts say that protecting yourself against the measles is largely futile. Things like washing your hands and wearing a mask are good practice in terms of other respiratory infections like COVID-19, but they won’t protect you from the measles if you’re unvaccinated. Measles is transmitted through droplets when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets can remain on surfaces or in the air and cause infection for up to 2 hours .",

She said that it’s important for patients who fear they’ve contracted the disease to let their doctor know because it's so contagious. The virus can spread days before a rash appears.",
        "Still, according to experts, most of us are safe to visit the Sunshine State. So if you’re vaccinated, it’s OK to pack your bags because while you might bring home a sunburn, you’re unlikely to bring home a case of the measles."
