        "Serotonin syndrome can happen when your body has too much of a chemical called serotonin, usually because of a medication or a combination of medications.",
        "What is serotonin?",
        "Your body makes serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), to help your brain cells and other nervous system cells communicate with each other. This chemical plays many different roles in your body. It affects your sleep, memory, ability to learn, happiness, body temperature, hunger, and sexual behavior.",
        "Most of your body's serotonin is in your gut; only around 10% is made in your brain. Serotonin is created from an essential amino acid called tryptophan. You can only get essential amino acids from the foods you eat, as your body can't make them on its own.",
        "Researchers think a lack of serotonin in your brain may play a role in depression. However, too much of it can lead to extreme nerve cell activity and dangerous symptoms.",
        "Serotonin syndrome vs. NMS",
        "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is similar to serotonin syndrome. This condition is rare but very serious. If it's not treated quickly, it can lead to death. But most people recover fully after treatment."
