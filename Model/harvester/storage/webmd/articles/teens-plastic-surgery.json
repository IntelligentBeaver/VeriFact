If you're self-conscious about a physical characteristic, you may be among the thousands of teens who consider plastic surgery each year.",

Some of the most common types of plastic surgery teens choose include nose jobs and correction of protruding ears, too-large breasts, asymmetrical breasts, and scarring caused by acne or injuries. A lot of procedures go unreported, though, including those performed in dermatology offices and spas."
