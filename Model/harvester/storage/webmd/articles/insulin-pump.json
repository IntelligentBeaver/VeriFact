        "The device releases insulin almost the way your body naturally does: a steady flow throughout the day and night, called basal insulin , and an extra dose at mealtime, called a bolus, to handle rising blood sugar from the food you eat. You program the pump for both basal and bolus doses. If you eat more than normal, you can program a larger bolus to cover the carbs in your food. A bolus can lower high blood sugar at other times, too.",
