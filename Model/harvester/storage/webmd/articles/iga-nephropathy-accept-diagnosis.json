Get regular physical activity. Move your body daily in a way that feels good to you. That may be yoga, dancing, or a walk through your neighborhood. Try to get at least 30 minutes a day. Prioritize quality sleep. As best you can, get good rest. Try these tips: Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day, keep your room dark and cool, take electronics out of your bedroom, and avoid caffeine or heavy meals before you sleep. Tune in to a higher power. If religion or spirituality plays an important role in your life, your connection to that belief can be a lifeline. Lean on your spiritual community for compassion and encouragement. Keep up with hobbies. What brings you enjoyment? Make time for creative outlets, skills, or activities you find pleasure in."
