        "Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a group of genetic conditions that cause tumors to grow on the nerves and skin. They can cause symptoms in the brain, spinal cord, skin, eyes, and more. The tumors aren't cancerous, but there's a chance they can develop into cancer. Most people are diagnosed with neurofibromatosis as children. The symptoms vary by person, and they can worsen over time. Although there's no cure, the symptoms are managed with medicine, surgery, devices, and therapies. You'll see a team of specialists.

NF1 can cause many symptoms, but the hallmark is flat, light brown spots on the skin called café-au-lait spots.",
        "Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) makes up 3% of neurofibromatosis cases. It's caused by a mutation on the NF2 gene. This gene prevents tumors from developing, so NF2 leads to noncancerous tumors. Most of the time, tumors grow on the nerves that connect the ears to the brain, which can affect hearing and balance.",
