        "Neuromodulation is a technique that uses electrical or chemical signals on specific nerve pathways in your body to change the way they carry information. Researchers are exploring a type of neuromodulation called vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as a way to repair nerve damage in multiple sclerosis (MS). The defining marker of MS is that it causes damage to myelin, the protective sheath that covers your brain and spinal cord nerves. Without myelin, your nerves can’t transmit messages to and from your body correctly. This can cause issues with your vision, movement, and ability to feel things that come in contact with your body (sensation). At the 2025 Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum in late February, Cristin Welle, PhD, professor of neurosurgery, physiology and biophysics and vice chair for research in neurosurgery at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, presented research that suggests there may be a way to repair myelin and get back some of its function with VNS."

        "Welle says the idea sprung from advances in stroke rehabilitation. VNS through an implant directly on the nerve has been a treatment for depression and epilepsy for decades. In 2021, the FDA approved a paired vagus nerve stimulation device that helps restore upper arm and hand movement following a stroke. “I was inspired by that work, and my lab began looking at the brain mechanisms that underlie that device in stroke,” says Welle. Her team partnered with a fellow CU Anschutz lab studying animal models of demyelination. This allowed them to monitor the myelin state inside an animal's brain before, during, and after a demyelinating event. “We wanted to see if perhaps vagus nerve stimulation could not only drive neuroplasticity, but might have an influence on myelin plasticity and repair,” says Welle."

The team then had the mice learn a new motor task (reaching for food pellets) for seven days.
