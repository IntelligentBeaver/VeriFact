        "By Aleksandra Rachitskaya, MD, as told to Hallie Levine It can be devastating to be diagnosed with an inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD). These rare, inherited eye diseases cause progressive vision loss , and sometimes even blindness. Here at the Cleveland Clinic, we’ve seen more patients than ever before with IRDs. Our numbers have risen from 327 patients in 2015, to almost 800 in 2019. The reason? We’ve become much better at both diagnosis and treatment. Over the last 2 decades, we’ve learned that there are around 300 genes associated with IRDs. Thanks to advances in genetic testing technology, we’re able to diagnose the gene mutations in over 70% of all cases. That’s great news, because once we know what genetic mutation is driving your disease, we can often refer you to an appropriate clinical trial that may help improve or maintain your vision. Even if we can’t now, thanks to gene therapy, there’s a very real chance that in the next decade or two, there may be a revolutionary new treatment to save your sight. Here’s why we’re so excited about gene therapy, what’s available now, and how to go about finding a clinical trial near you."

        "In gene therapy, an abnormal gene is replaced with a normal one. While there are many ways to do it, the most common way is to use a vector -- a virus without the disease-causing parts -- to deliver a healthy gene into the cells. This is done through surgery to the eye by a physician . The hope is that the cells with the new, functional copy of a gene will now work properly. As it turns out, the eye itself is actually an ideal candidate for gene therapy. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is that the retina itself is relatively easy to reach compared to other parts of your body, like your heart, or lungs . The second is that the eye is “immune privileged.” This means its immune response isn’t as active as in other parts of the body. That’s important, because when a virus vector with a normal gene is injected into the eye, you don’t want the eye’s immune response to go into overdrive."

        "There’s only one FDA-approved gene therapy for inherited retinal disorders: Luxturna, which was approved in 2017. It is specifically for people with IRD who have mutations in the RPE65 gene. This may be seen in two diseases: retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). The treatment delivers a functional copy of the RPE65 gene into the retinal cells of the eye. These cells then produce the normal protein that converts light to an electrical signal in the retina. This helps to slow down the progression of a patient’s disease and vision loss. Patients with these forms of IRD first find they have trouble seeing at night. They then begin to lose their peripheral, or side, vision, then finally, their central vision. During Luxturna’s clinical trials , researchers had patients go through a mobility maze both before and after treatment. Almost all of them saw significant improvements in their ability to get through the maze, even in a darker environment, which is usually more difficult. There have been some amazing stories of children whose vision has been restored by this procedure."
