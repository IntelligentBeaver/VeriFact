The first sign of the eye condition is often feeling extra sensitivity when you close your eyes, especially when you do not have your contact lenses in . It may feel like there’s a foreign object inside your eye. When you lift your eyelid, there are small circular lesions anywhere from .03 to 1 mm in diameter. ‌",
