        "Eosinophilic esophagitis is a long-term (chronic) condition that is caused by a type of white blood cell, called an eosinophil. In this condition, eosinophils gather in the lining of the esophagus, which is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. These cells can cause swelling (inflammation) that narrows the esophagus, making it difficult for food to move down into the stomach. This can cause issues with swallowing food. In some cases, food can even get stuck in the esophagus, which can cause vomiting and pain.",
        "The key to treating this condition is to reduce the amount of swelling in the esophagus, which helps to reduce symptoms. In many cases, people with eosinophilic esophagitis have allergies to certain foods, which are called allergens. One way to manage this condition involves removing all allergens from the diet."
