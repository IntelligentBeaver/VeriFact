Another way to calm aching feet and bring down swelling is by resting them on a bag of ice or pack of frozen vegetables covered by a towel for about 10 minutes. You can also get the same benefits from a frozen water bottle when you use it to massage your feet.",

Wide and open-toed shoes are a much better choice, since your feet and toes will still be comfortable even if they swell. You should also look for shoes with ankle support, which reduce pain and can help prevent injury.",
        "Consider acupuncture. A licensed acupuncturist puts very thin needles into specific areas of your body. The process doesn’t usually hurt, and it can help your body provide natural pain relief. Studies haven’t proved that acupuncture can treat psoriatic arthritis pain, but a review of studies did show benefits for people with chronic pain."
