        "When you get an injury, blood may leak from the vessels (veins and capillaries) under your skin. The discoloration you see as a bruise on the surface of your skin is from blood that has pooled in or under your skin. On people with lighter skin tones, bruises may start out red or purple soon after the injury, then turn light brown, green, or yellow as they heal. On people with darker skin tones, bruises can look purple, dark brown, or black.",

        "Ecchymosis vs. bruise",
        "Ecchymosis (pronounced eh-kuh-mow-sis) is the medical term for a bruise. An ecchymosis is bigger around than 1 centimeter, which is about as big around as a triple-A battery.",
        "Hematoma vs. bruise",
        "A hematoma is a large pool of blood that may come from a serious injury, such as a major fall or a car accident. Hematomas are usually painful and may make the skin over it feel raised, spongy, rubbery, and/or lumpy. Hematomas are more serious than ecchymoses , and they generally need medical attention."
