        "Jul. 3, 2025 -- How does oral health affect your entire body? What is the oral microbiome, and how can oral bacteria trigger inflammation beyond your mouth? In this episode, we spoke to Nammy Patel, DDS , holistic dentist and leader of Green Dentistry, to dive into how gum disease impacts chronic conditions and autoimmune health. We also explore myths about oral health, the effects of smoking , pregnancy-related dental changes, and warning signs that mean it’s time to see your dentist. Plus, we discuss dental care disparities and share resources to help you protect both your smile and overall wellness."

        "Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered podcast. I'm Dr. Neha Pathak, WebMD's Chief Physician Editor for Health and Lifestyle Medicine. In today's episode, we're discussing how our oral health can have a ripple effect on everything from heart health to sleep quality. We'll explore how an inflamed mouth can set off chronic inflammation throughout our bodies, and what practical measures we can take in our oral health regimen to keep us comfortable in the dentist chair and beyond. We're going to take a slightly broader look at what oral health actually means. We're going to be talking about the health of our tongues, our oral microbiome, along with our gums and teeth, so that we can keep inflammation down in our mouths to protect the health of the rest of our body."

I provide confidence in health, and I focus on longevity and disease prevention. So what I'm looking at is where you are in life right now, what the current condition is, how can I fix it? Then secondly, how can I help you prevent disease 20 years from now?",
        "Pathak: And that's really interesting. So for many listeners, this might actually be the first time they're making the connection between overall health and their dental health. So let's take a step back. Why is it important for patients to learn how oral health influences the entire body? What is the connection there?",
        "Patel: That is a great question. The number one thing about Western medicine is that dentistry has been a stepchild of medicine. We've always said, sure, the mouth is connected to the rest of the body, and sure they're connected somehow, but not really knowing the pathophysiology or not understanding exactly how the connection really exists. And it's been so nice that there's been great research that is out there that really looks at how the mouth is connected to the rest of the body. Two most important ways: number one, your saliva. Your saliva is very important. You swallow five gallons of saliva every single day. I'm gonna repeat that—five gallons. And in that saliva, there is bacteria. In our bodies, everywhere we go, there's good bacteria and bad bacteria. We want the good bacteria to live because that protects us. The bad bacteria actually causes heart attacks, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's, arthritis, and it causes this low-grade infection or this low-grade bacterial load over a long period of time. And what that does is it exhausts the body's resources. When our body's resources are too busy fighting an infection, it's not available to fight cancer. It's not available to prevent heart attacks. It's not available to fight arthritis, and that's really the problem with having bad bacteria in the mouth and the oral-systemic connection."

You exhale out and you smell that air, and a lot of times it will have a bad odor and it will smell funny. When you try flossing your teeth, they will bleed. That is a sign that the bacteria has invaded the gum tissue and is into your bloodstream at that point. So that's something you'll realize. When we talk about the oral microbiome, there are other things. When we start thinking systemically, the first things I hear a lot of patients say is, \"I'm grinding my teeth,\" which you would think is a dental problem, but majority of the time that grinding is actually a clue to an airway problem."

        "Patel: The first thing I would tell a patient when they come into my practice is, let's test it. Medical doctors are using biomarkers as the blood. In dentistry, we're going to use saliva. So we can actually test the specific bacteria that cause heart attack, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s, arthritis, right? We can also test the red-light or bad bacteria that we find in patients with IBS or any sort of gut issue—H. pylori, right? That's a common one. The other thing we do is test the saliva for nitric oxide. We can actually test the saliva to see how much nitric oxide is present, because we will find that there’ll be low amounts of nitric oxide. Then I’ll do more research and do a sleep study and a CT scan and a posture analysis to really deep dive in and figure out what the problem is, so that we can get it down to the molecule level, get it down to the cellular function, and really fix it at its root."

In this episode, we spoke to Nammy Patel, DDS, holistic dentist and leader of Green Dentistry, to dive into how gum disease impacts chronic conditions and autoimmune health. We also explore myths about oral health, the effects of smoking, pregnancy-related dental changes, and warning signs that mean it’s time to see your dentist. Plus, we discuss dental care disparities and share resources to help you protect both your smile and overall wellness.",
