        "People with bipolar disorder, depression, and other mood disorders often have episodes when they feel extremely sad, hopeless, anxious, or confused. When these emotions get too intense, the person may struggle with how to cope with overwhelming emotions, and for some people, efforts at coping with distress may take the form of acts of self-injury.",
        "Self-injury, often including cutting, self-mutilation, or self-harm, is an injurious attempt to cope with overpowering negative emotions, such as extreme anger, anxiety , and frustration. It is usually repetitive, not a one-time act. Often, people who deliberately injure themselves are survivors of traumatic events during childhood or early developmental periods in life. Self-injuring behaviors that occur because of difficulty coping with stress are not a symptom of bipolar disorder , but may happen when someone's emotional coping strategies are not well-developed, or when certain other mental health problems co-exist with bipolar disorder.",
        "Self-injurious behavior is most widely recognized as a key feature of a condition called borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is a disturbance involving longstanding problems in regulating moment-to-moment emotional reactions to stressful events, especially those involving strong emotional reactions with high sensitivity to interactions with other people. Self-injuring behaviors also sometimes happen in people whose behavior becomes disorganized because of a primary psychotic disorder (that is, an inability to literally differentiate reality from fantasy), head traumas, or developmental disabilities."
