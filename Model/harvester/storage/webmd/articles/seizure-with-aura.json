        "When you have epilepsy, there's a chance you might have an aura before you have a seizure. An aura is a feeling, experience, or movement that just seems different. It can also be a warning that a seizure is going to happen.",
        "There are several types of epilepsy . Auras generally go hand in hand with partial -- also called focal -- seizures. With this kind, only a part of your brain is affected. Unlike other types of seizures , you stay awake and aware when you're having this kind. However, you may have auras and not remember them.",
        "An aura is actually part of a simple partial or focal seizure. You might have just the aura all by itself and not end up having any other seizure. Doctors call that a simple partial seizure or partial seizure without change in awareness. Not everyone who has this type of seizure will have aura.",
        "You can have an aura from several seconds until about an hour before a seizure happens. Most auras last from a few seconds to as long as a minute or two. It may just end with the aura, or from there it may lead into a seizure.",
        "If you get auras, you can take steps to protect yourself if you know a seizure is on the way."
