An injury to this group is common, especially in people who work with their arms a lot like painters or construction workers. Usually, a portion of the cuff tears, which causes pain. This can happen at once as the result of a single injury, or the tearing can happen over time with repeated use. More advanced rotator cuff injuries may cause difficulty moving or weakness in the affected arm.",
