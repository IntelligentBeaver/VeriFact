        "When a gallstone temporarily blocks the duct that leads to your stomach, it can cause bile to back up into your gallbladder. This can cause your gallbladder to spasm, which then leads to a sharp pain in the center of your belly or under your rib cage on the right side of your belly. This is called biliary colic because the pain can build and then fade slowly as the gallstones block and unblock your ducts.",
        "The pain can be so bad, it takes your breath away, makes you feel nauseated, or makes it hard for you to sit still. Some people describe the pain as being intense, sharp, stabbing, cramping, or squeezing. Some people may think they're having a heart attack because the pain can start in the middle of your belly or chest and radiate to your shoulder or upper back. Biliary colic may be more likely after you eat a really fatty meal. This is because your gallbladder needs to squeeze hard to release enough of its stored bile to help you digest fatty food."
