While side effects from hormone therapy are common, you can manage them with lifestyle changes, medications, and other strategies.

Intermittent dosing Some men follow a plan called intermittent dosing to help ease side effects. This means you stop hormone therapy for a period of time when your blood markers are low. Then, you can pick it up again when your numbers start to rise. While this method may work for some men, others don’t notice a change during the relatively short amount of time they go off the meds. Also, there’s a chance your cancer can grow while you take a break from hormone therapy."

        "To help you , especially if you notice symptoms of depression or mood swings, you can try yoga, mindfulness, or listening to music. To cope with hot flashes , try these steps: Stay hydrated. Aim for about six to eight glasses of water a day. Steer clear of smoking, alcohol, and caffeine. Avoid spicy foods. Wear light clothing to bed. Keep your room cool. Don’t take hot showers. Here are some strategies to help with bone thinning : Eat lots of calcium and vitamin D to support strong bones. Calcium is found in dairy products, tofu, and green, leafy veggies. Foods that are rich in vitamin D are oily fish like salmon and some breakfast cereals. Avoid too much alcohol. Don’t smoke. Maintain a healthy weight. If you want to lower your risk of heart-related issues , be sure to: Eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly. Limit your salt intake. Don’t smoke. Cut down on alcohol. Radiation Low-dose radiation therapy can lessen swelling and tenderness in your breasts. But it has to be done quickly – within a month of starting hormone therapy. This therapy may not help reduce breast size once swelling has already started, but it may lessen tenderness and pain. Radiation has its own side effects, which may include hair loss and red, dark, or irritated skin."
