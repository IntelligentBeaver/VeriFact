        "Still, the wider ramifications of going through The Change threw her for a loop. “I thought the period was gone -- that was it. But now you’ve got all these other symptoms you have to deal with.” Richardson was taken by surprise by hot flashes , thinning hair , vaginal dryness , fuzzy thinking, and weight gain. She was officially in menopause -- her periods had stopped for more than a year -- but the pesky symptoms continued.",
        "And so Richardson found herself caught up in a quandary that binds millions of American women. Now that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is no longer prescribed as widely as it once was, what does a woman do for menopause symptoms that range from annoying to miserable and downright disruptive?",
        "“I started doing a lot of research on what my options were, as opposed to hormone therapy,” she says, “because I was afraid of cancer and all this other stuff.”"

First, keep in mind that menopause is not a disease, but a natural passage that usually occurs between ages 45 and 54. “Puberty in reverse,” says Susan Love, MD, in Dr. Susan Love’s Menopause and Hormone Book: Making Informed Choices . While some women barely notice a blip, others feel the change throws their lives into disarray.",

Twenty percent of women get no hot flashes whatsoever.” But, she adds, many women are debilitated, “no matter how fabulously they take care of themselves.”",
        "Not long ago, doctors routinely prescribed hormone replacement therapy to menopausal women, convinced of its power to relieve menopause symptoms and prevent heart disease and other ills. But women and doctors were stunned in 2002 when the NIH halted a Women’s Health Initiative study that indicated that long-term hormone use posed more health risks than benefits, such as an increased chance of heart attacks , strokes, and breast cancer ."

As estrogen levels drop, skin , eye , and vaginal tissues become drier. “I call it ‘the Sahara decade,’” Giblin says of the perimenopause years leading up to menopause. Vaginal tissues get thinner and less elastic. As a result, “the pain during intimacy can flatline sex.”",

In reality, things like that serve as a wet blanket to our libido.”"
