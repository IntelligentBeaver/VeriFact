        "WebMD senior writer Miranda Hitti interviewed breast cancer survivors as part of a series for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The series, called “Me & the Girls,” explores the personal stories of these women after they were diagnosed with breast cancer.",
        "Breast cancer survivor Diane Morgan, 71, lives in Santa Rosa, Calif. now. But her breast cancer story began in 2005, when she was 67 and living near Miami in Sunny Isles, Fla. That's one of the places where Hurricane Katrina struck before devastating New Orleans. The night of the storm, Morgan used towels to mop up water Katrina sent through her windows. While dumping the wet towels in her bathtub, she slipped, fell, and hit her side on the bathroom doorknob.",
        "In the weeks that followed, her breast on that side still ached, and she figured that was from her fall. She was due for a mammogram, but more storms had followed Katrina, pushing her mammogram appointment back until the end of November."
