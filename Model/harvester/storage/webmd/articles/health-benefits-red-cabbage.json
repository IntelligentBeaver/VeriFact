        "Red cabbage is a nutrient-rich, cruciferous or Brassica vegetable that's related to broccoli, cauliflower, and kale. It’s sometimes called purple cabbage because its leaves are a dark purple-reddish color. Red cabbage is usually a little smaller and denser than green cabbage, and it has a more peppery taste.",
        "This type of cabbage gets its purple-reddish color from the plant compound anthocyanin and the acidity level of the soil where it’s grown. Like most colorful vegetables, it has many health benefits.",
        "Some people disagree on whether certain foods are truly healthy. This isn’t true for cabbage, which many people think of as one of the world's most nutritious foods. Low in calories and chock-full of important vitamins and minerals, cabbage is also versatile enough to be used in a variety of dishes, including many regional specialties.",
        "Cabbage comes in white varieties as well as red and green. Its leaves may be smooth or crinkly.",
