        "Millions of people do. Antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, beta-carotene, and coenzyme Q10 are among the most common supplements I see on my patients' medication records. The typical reasons for taking antioxidants include promoting health, slowing aging, and preventing heart disease and cancer.",

        "The reasoning behind our enthusiasm for antioxidants makes a lot of sense. Our normal metabolism creates potentially dangerous substances called free radicals. We can also be exposed to free radicals from toxins like cigarette smoke, excessive sun exposure, and pollution.",
        "The problem with free radicals is that they can cause cell damage (called oxidative stress), leading to health problems like heart disease, dementia, diabetes, and cancer.",
        "Antioxidants are potentially helpful because they have been shown in laboratory studies to neutralize free radicals. Also, many healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts, and berries are high in antioxidants. This information led to the idea that antioxidant supplements could help prevent heart disease and cancer."
