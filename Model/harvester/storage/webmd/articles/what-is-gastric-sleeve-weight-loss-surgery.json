        "Also called sleeve gastrectomy, this is a weight loss surgery that removes a large part of your stomach and leaves a small \"sleeve” behind so you become less hungry and eat fewer calories.",
        "The gastric sleeve procedure is also known as vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). It works for weight loss by removing about 80% of your stomach, leaving behind a gastric sleeve stomach about the size of a banana . This leaves less space for food, so you feel full faster. It also lowers the amount of hunger hormones your stomach can pump out. This helps keep you from having as much of an appetite or craving for food.",
        "Gastric sleeve weight loss can be a helpful choice if you have serious obesity and are looking to lose weight effectively. VSG surgery can also help treat obesity-related conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol , and diabetes."
