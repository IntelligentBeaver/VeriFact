If you suspect your diet is to blame for your IBS symptoms, an RDN can help you find relief.",
        "They may ask you to keep a food diary to pinpoint the foods that may trigger your symptoms. The diary may help rule out foods that you thought were causing you trouble. RDNs may gradually add fiber to your diet. That may help food move at a more normal speed through your digestive tract. Adding too much fiber too quickly can cause problems. But RDNs should know the right pace for you.",
        "Your RDN also can help identify the best mix of foods for your symptoms. They may suggest you steer clear of foods high in certain carbs that can cause IBS symptoms. If you follow the \"low-FODMAP\" diet, you need to avoid some fruits, vegetables , sweeteners, and dairy products that can cause diarrhea, bloating, and other discomfort. Your RDN can guide your diet safely over a month or two. If that helps, they can then help you add back the missing foods to better balance your diet."
