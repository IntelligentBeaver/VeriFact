        "May 31, 2023 – New research shows that having a heart attack eventually leads to faster mental decline that is the equivalent of adding 6 years to the age of the brain.",
        "The study was published Tuesday in JAMA Neurology and specifically examined the impact of heart attack on the normal process of brain aging. It’s normal for people’s thinking speed, memory, and ability to concentrate to worsen as they age – a process that medical professionals call age-related cognitive decline.",
        "Cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke have previously been linked to cognitive problems. In this latest study, researchers set out to determine how heart attacks impact overall cognitive function, memory, and brain skills called executive functions.",
        "Having a heart attack did not impact those three cognitive measures immediately following the event. But all three of the measures were impacted in the years following the heart attack, and a person’s race and gender also played a role in the severity of the decline."
