Over time, the artery walls become thicker, making the space where blood can flow even more narrow.",

When Uptravi attaches to a specific protein on cells, called the prostacyclin (IP) receptor, it sends a signal that helps blood vessels relax and widen. It also stops smooth muscle cells from growing too much, which can help slow the thickening of artery walls. Together, these actions lower blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries and make it easier for the heart to pump blood through them."
