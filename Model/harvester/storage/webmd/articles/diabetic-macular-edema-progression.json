        "When you have diabetes, it’s important to watch out for other serious health problems that can come along with it. Eye disease is a common condition that happens with diabetes. Blood sugar spikes can damage blood vessels throughout the body, including those in your eyes. Diabetic retinopathy is one type of eye disease caused by diabetes. It happens when your blood sugar is too high and damages your retina , the tissue that lines the inside of the eye. The retina’s job is to take in light and transfer signals to your brain via a nerve at the rear of your eye called the optic nerve. Small blood vessels connected to your retina leak fluid or bleed when sugar damages them. Your eyes do grow new blood vessels, but they’re weaker and have trouble keeping in blood and fluids."
