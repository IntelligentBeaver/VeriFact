The most common are multivitamins, supplements to support arthritic joints, and fatty acids to reduce shedding and improve a coat’s shine, according to a 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association . Pet owners also may give probiotics to alleviate gastrointestinal problems or antioxidants to counteract the effects of aging, such as cognitive dysfunction.",
