        "Manufacturer gluten-free labels: May look like the words “gluten-free” or “free of gluten.” If a U.S. manufacturer includes this, it must legally meet the FDA’s gluten-free criteria, which is less than 20 parts per million (the general safety limit for celiac disease). There isn’t a standard “gluten-free” FDA label, so it’s up to companies to print words or symbols to show this. Gluten-free labels can be placed on any food or beverage product including naturally gluten-free items like bottled water.",
        "Gluten-free certifications: Denoted by a distinct logo on the package, indicates a third party certification group has verified the product is 100% gluten-free. These independent organizations collaborate with food manufacturers to assess gluten contamination using similar or stricter standards than those of the FDA. They typically examine both the food and production process to ensure gluten is absent.",
        "No gluten-free labeling is common on naturally gluten-free or single-ingredient products, such as milk or fresh fruit, as they’re assumed gluten-safe. However, products with longer ingredient lists may not be assumed 100% gluten-free. Scanning the ingredient list for sources of gluten as well as looking for a wheat disclaimer may give initial clues that there could still be gluten in an unlabeled product.",
        "Wheat labeling is mandatory for all U.S. food products containing wheat, one of the nine major food allergens. The FDA requires an allergen label stating “contains wheat” or the word “wheat” noted in the ingredient list. This label helps identify a product that contains gluten, since gluten is a protein in wheat. However, it’s possible for some wheat products to be stripped of gluten, so it’s not guaranteed. Additionally, wheat labeling doesn’t cover rye or barley, which also contain gluten, so wheat-free is not necessarily gluten-free."

Certified gluten-free products are generally more reliable, while manufacturer claims may require further scrutiny. A product without any gluten-free labeling could be naturally free of gluten or may include a more complex ingredient list that requires a careful read through. Ultimately, choosing a food product is a contextual decision and is based on your specific dietary needs. When in doubt, find an alternative you feel comfortable with."
