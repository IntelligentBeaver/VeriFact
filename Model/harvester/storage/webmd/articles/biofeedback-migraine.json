        "Biofeedback (or biological feedback ) is a type of noninvasive mind-body therapy technique in which you’re hooked up to electrical sensors to monitor your body’s functions like heart rate, blood pressure, brain waves, breathing, skin sweat, and muscle tension. If you’re under stress, these functions may change.",

The connected electrodes collect information about your body’s unconscious or involuntary responses to stress and measure it. This feedback can then help determine reactions to consciously soothe your behaviors to help bring your body and mind back to a relaxed state. Besides migraine , biofeedback is used for other pain and stress-related conditions like ADHD, fibromyalgia, stroke, and high blood pressure."
