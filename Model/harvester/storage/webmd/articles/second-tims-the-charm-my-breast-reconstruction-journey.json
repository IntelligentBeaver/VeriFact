        "When I started the breast reconstruction process in 2022, I thought it’d be a one-and-done ordeal. I had waited 2 years after my double mastectomy surgery to begin the process, which my plastic surgeon said was the longest among any of his patients. However, I was in no rush, as I moved to Spain 10 months after my surgery and was just focused on allowing my body to heal -- physically and emotionally -- while living life to the fullest.",
        "I knew that reconstruction would be time-consuming, requiring weekly tissue expansion appointments for a month or longer, depending on the size of the breasts I wanted and other factors. Then, when I was satisfied with the size and had allowed my skin to rest for at least a month, the next step was an implant-exchange surgery, in which my plastic surgeon would remove the tissue expander and replace it with an implant.",
        "The process was as straightforward as it sounded, and I completed all my tissue expansion appointments in October, having my implant exchange surgery at the end of November 2022. It was an outpatient procedure, so I went home the same day to recover. I was pretty satisfied with the results of my surgery. The only thing I did notice was that my nipples were different sizes and asymmetrical afterward, but I was fine with that and just happy to be over this last hurdle. Or so I thought."

        "Following my secondary sarcoma diagnosis last year, I underwent surgery to remove the tumor, leading to the removal of my left breast implant. My surgeon placed a tissue expander in my left breast, requiring me to go through the reconstruction process all over again. I’ll admit, when I first did my expansions in 2022, there was some excitement about getting to “choose my new chest.” However, this time around, I went into the process already feeling exhausted because I knew how time-consuming it was.",
        "I started my reconstruction about a month after my surgery, flying back and forth to Michigan for each appointment. After hearing that I was coming all that way for my tissue expansions, which typically take 10 minutes or less, my surgeon contacted one of his former residents, now a practicing physician in the Atlanta area, to see if she would be able to do my last few fills. She happily agreed, which was a huge blessing. Her practice is about 45 minutes from where I live in Atlanta, much better than the 2-hour flight I’d been taking to Michigan before."

        "Going through reconstruction the second time around, my expansions were more painful. Because I had radiation on my left side, it’s always been tight, but now it is extremely tight, making it harder to fill the expander. Additionally, my doctor wanted to overfill my expander so that he has extra skin to work with during my next surgery, in which he also plans to reconstruct my nipples, hopefully returning them to symmetry.",
        "Despite the process being longer and less straightforward this time, I completed my last expansion appointment on Jan. 24, 2024. Now, it’s just a waiting game to schedule my implant-exchange surgery. Here’s to the hope that the second time’s indeed the charm, marking the end of my reconstructive journey.",
