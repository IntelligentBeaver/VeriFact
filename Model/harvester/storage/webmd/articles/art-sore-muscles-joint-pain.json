You suddenly kicked up your exercise intensity level or increased the length of your workout. You did unusual exercises that lengthen instead of shorten your muscle, like walking downhill or extending your arm during a bicep curl. These changes to your exercise routine can lead to tiny injuries in your muscle fibers and connective tissue. About a day later, you'll start to feel sore."

        "One big question a lot of people have when they're nursing sore muscles is whether to use heat or ice. Experts say indirect ice -- an ice pack wrapped in a thin towel -- is best for immediate relief. \"Heat will feel good while it's on, but it's not going to lessen the damage or make it go away anytime soon,\" Frese says. Goldfarb suggests you ice the sore area right after the activity to cut inflammation. Then use heat later to increase blood flow to the area. Heat also can help relieve joint pain. If you get sore muscles once in a while, you can take acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like aspirin , ibuprofen , or naproxen to help ease the discomfort. Just be cautious about using NSAIDs regularly. Long-term use can interfere with your muscle's ability to repair itself, Goldfarb says. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about any interactions these over-the-counter drugs may have with other medications you take. Also, you may need to avoid some medications if you have ulcers, kidney disease , liver disease, or other conditions. Sometimes soothing sore muscles requires more than an ice pack or over-the-counter pain reliever. Muscle pain that comes on quickly and feels intense is a sign that you've injured yourself. Call your doctor if your pain is severe or lasts for more than a few days."

A couple of natural substances are touted for preventing sore muscles, including antioxidants like vitamin C . But check with your doctor before taking high doses of any vitamin.
