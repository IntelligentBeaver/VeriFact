        "When you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), it’s important to control its effects, whether they're everyday symptoms or more intense flare-ups. COPD can leave lasting damage on your lungs if unmanaged, so it's important to know how to spot when symptoms are getting worse for both short-term relief and long-term health. COPD can also impact other parts of your life. When your lungs and airways don't work properly, it can put limits on the normal daily activities you used to carry out with ease. It can also make you more likely to get certain other illnesses down the line and affect your overall quality of life, especially if symptoms worsen. To help guide management of the disease day-to-day, explore the risks of COPD and ways the physical effects can change other parts of your life."
