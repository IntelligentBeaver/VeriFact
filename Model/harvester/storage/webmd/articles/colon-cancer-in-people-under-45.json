        "Historically, if you were an adult with an average risk for colorectal cancer (colon and rectal cancer), also known as colon cancer , you would need to start getting colonoscopies when you turned 50. But in May 2021, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force updated the guidelines. Now you’ll need a colonoscopy when you turn 45. But you should do it earlier if you have a family history of colon cancer. That’s because recent studies show that it’s on the rise among people under the age of 50. “We've never seen more colorectal cancer happening in such young people. It's the only demographic, people under age 50, where this disease is rising and becoming more deadly, not less common and less deadly,” says Mark Lewis, MD, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah. More specifically, Lewis notes “women have a greater risk” of getting this cancer early."

But lifestyle and changing environmental factors in recent times might have a role to play. This can include: Obesity and overweight Sedentary lifestyle Smoking Drinking too many alcoholic beverages Low-fiber diets High-fat diets Eating too many processed meats Gut bacteria Inflammation According to the National Cancer Institute, if you’re obese, you’re 1.3 times more likely to get colon cancer."

        "There are things you can do to take control and reduce your odds of colon cancer. First, get screened when you become eligible or notice early signs of gut cancer. A colonoscopy is one of the best screening procedures available to nip the cancer in the bud and prevent it from growing or spreading in your gut. To get one, you’ll need to see a colonoscopist. This is usually a gastroenterologist – a gut specialist – or a general surgeon. During the procedure, they’ll insert a flexible tube with a lighted camera on the tip into your large intestine. If they see a polyp – a type of extra piece of tissue that grows like a skin tag inside your body – they’ll remove it. “You've interrupted that polyp's disease trajectory. It can't become cancer if it's removed from your body,” Lewis says. “So, to sum up, know yourself, know your family, and know the age when you should start screening.” Besides this, you should: Eat a well-balanced diet with whole foods, fruits, and vegetables. Add whole grains and fiber to your meals. Cut down or quit smoking. Find ways to be more physically active. You can start with regular walks and work your way up to more rigorous exercises. Limit how much alcohol you consume. Eat less red meat and processed foods in general. Take calcium and vitamin D supplements if you’re deficient. Studies have shown this can lower your risk for colon cancer."
