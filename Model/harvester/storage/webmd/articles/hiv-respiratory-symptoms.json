If you have a weakened immune system due to HIV -- which can happen if you're not on top of your treatment the way you should be -- you’re more likely to have respiratory symptoms than people who don’t have the virus.",
        "As with uninfected people, the most common symptom is a runny nose. More serious respiratory symptoms in people with HIV are shortness of breath and coughing. Your cough might be dry, or it may bring up sticky mucus (phlegm).",

The common cold viruses, influenza (flu), and COVID are also possible concerns. But the reason you get them might have nothing to do with HIV. For example, things like age, smoking, or drug use can also cause respiratory symptoms for everyone."
