Many people ask about what causes lupus, what can I do to make it better, is it inherited, are my children at risk? And then what can I do about it? Or is there a special diet I should be on? Those kinds of questions I hear all the time. People are especially interested in lifestyle changes and food, and so it's motivated me to do research in that direction as well.",

Normally, the immune system is there to ward off invaders—viruses, bacteria, you know, infections and external things—but not to attack itself. So autoimmunity is really at the central part of lupus definition, but it's also chronic, meaning once it starts, it goes on forever. It's a chronic disease. It's not going to be there for a couple years and then go away."

Overall, about 90% of cases—nine out of ten people with lupus—will be female. That ratio is lower, so it's more equally split among boys and girls until about the age of the first period, around 10 to 12, and then it really becomes mostly females.

I have fatigue. There’s problem concentrating,” et cetera. So understanding all of that and being very patient, understanding that it’s a chronic disease that is going to go on for life, that patients and their loved ones are immunosuppressed in many instances.

        "I’d love for you to do a little myth busting. Can you give us some of the biggest myths that you hear that you really just want patients and caregivers to recognize as myths, and to give them a little bit more of the accurate health information that they should have?",
        "Costenbader: Yeah, there are a lot out there about lupus because it’s really not very well understood. So first of all, it’s not contagious. I mean, it may run in families—there’s a super strong genetic component—but often, you know, the genetic component is very small and the risk is still a 5% lifetime risk. And so it’s not contagious. It’s not going to affect everyone in the family. There’s nothing you can do to give yourself lupus. And that being said, there’s a lot of misinformation out there about vaccines, that vaccines can cause lupus or other autoimmune diseases. We really highly recommend vaccines of all kinds, especially for our patients with lupus who are immunosuppressed. We have to give them the, you know, non-active vaccines. We make sure that they get them before they get there. We really try to get them before they get immunosuppressive medications so that they can have full protective effect. And there isn’t any good evidence that vaccines will cause lupus. Vaccines have been associated with, you know, some slight increase in other autoimmune diseases like Guillain-Barré, but not lupus. So that’s really just very important. And vaccines don’t cause lupus flares in a large sense, and not severe flares. So the preponderance of the evidence really is in support of vaccines. I also unfortunately see people—even though I’m trying to explain it’s a chronic disease and you need to take the medications for life—that the medications start to work and they say, “I don’t need them anymore. I feel fine.” And that is actually likely because you’re taking the medications, and you do need to continue to take the medications because it is, you know, getting you back to low disease activity states and remission and feeling good. But the medications you take every day are working. So it’s hard to remember all those medications, but especially for medications like hydroxychloroquine and antimalarials, it’s an everyday medication. It works long term. It’s disease stabilizing, and people will think, “Oh, I don’t need it anymore because I’m feeling fine.” So that’s a myth that needs to be busted. And then I think last, people are very interested in, you know, foods and what they can eat or drink, and there’s a lot on the web about inflammatory diets. I think a healthy diet, to remove the junk food, the ultra-processed food, French fries and donuts and, you name it—we know what junk food is—definitely corn syrup and Coca-Cola and all the sugary beverages are definitely associated with increased systemic inflammation. Those probably do contribute. But removing eggplant and tomatoes, there’s no scientific basis for that. So probably a healthy Mediterranean-style diet is good, but a very restrictive diet of any kind is not necessary."

          "text": "Costenbader: Yeah, there are a lot out there about lupus because it’s really not very well understood. So first of all, it’s not contagious. I mean, it may run in families—there’s a super strong genetic component—but often, you know, the genetic component is very small and the risk is still a 5% lifetime risk. And so it’s not contagious. It’s not going to affect everyone in the family. There’s nothing you can do to give yourself lupus. And that being said, there’s a lot of misinformation out there about vaccines, that vaccines can cause lupus or other autoimmune diseases. We really highly recommend vaccines of all kinds, especially for our patients with lupus who are immunosuppressed. We have to give them the, you know, non-active vaccines. We make sure that they get them before they get there. We really try to get them before they get immunosuppressive medications so that they can have full protective effect. And there isn’t any good evidence that vaccines will cause lupus. Vaccines have been associated with, you know, some slight increase in other autoimmune diseases like Guillain-Barré, but not lupus. So that’s really just very important. And vaccines don’t cause lupus flares in a large sense, and not severe flares. So the preponderance of the evidence really is in support of vaccines. I also unfortunately see people—even though I’m trying to explain it’s a chronic disease and you need to take the medications for life—that the medications start to work and they say, “I don’t need them anymore. I feel fine.” And that is actually likely because you’re taking the medications, and you do need to continue to take the medications because it is, you know, getting you back to low disease activity states and remission and feeling good. But the medications you take every day are working. So it’s hard to remember all those medications, but especially for medications like hydroxychloroquine and antimalarials, it’s an everyday medication. It works long term. It’s disease stabilizing, and people will think, “Oh, I don’t need it anymore because I’m feeling fine.” So that’s a myth that needs to be busted. And then I think last, people are very interested in, you know, foods and what they can eat or drink, and there’s a lot on the web about inflammatory diets. I think a healthy diet, to remove the junk food, the ultra-processed food, French fries and donuts and, you name it—we know what junk food is—definitely corn syrup and Coca-Cola and all the sugary beverages are definitely associated with increased systemic inflammation. Those probably do contribute. But removing eggplant and tomatoes, there’s no scientific basis for that.

        "Costenbader: Well, I think that most healthcare professionals—primary care physicians and rheumatologists—will ask about all kinds of symptoms you may be having and how you’re feeling, and getting your labs done, and getting your eyes checked, and going to all these other follow-up appointments. But I think anything that’s important to you needs to be brought into the room as well. What are your goals? It’s amazing how sometimes, especially for young women, the disease is now, you know, quiet and the doctor’s very happy. But what about those plans for pregnancy? We need to think about that too, and really keep the disease quiet and make sure you’re on the right medications. What are your goals? I think physicians forget to always be inquiring about what’s going on in people’s lives. And it’s for patients to bring that to their appointments and talk about how their lupus affects their lives and what they hope to be able to accomplish in the future, and how they would hope that their lupus will remain in good control so they can do it."

        "Pathak: As we close this episode, I want to share three key takeaways. First, lupus is a chronic, lifelong condition, but it is manageable. Staying connected with your healthcare team, keeping up with labs, and continuing medications even when you feel well are critical to preventing complications. Second, lifestyle factors matter. Lupus is definitely not your fault, but a healthy diet, stress management, sleep, and avoiding triggers like smoking can lower the risk of flares and improve long-term quality of life. Small changes add up, and it’s important to speak with your healthcare provider, who can help you identify what matters most to you and which small lifestyle changes you can implement to make living with lupus more manageable. Finally, shared decision making. Shared decision making with your care team and social support system is critical. Bring your goals, worries, life plans, and emotional realities into the exam room. Whether it’s thinking about pregnancy, travel, work, or simply wanting to feel better day to day, lupus care works best when you and your healthcare team communicate openly. I want to acknowledge anyone listening who’s living with lupus or supporting someone with lupus. Lupus can be confusing, unpredictable, and deeply personal. Dr Costenbader reminded us that understanding the disease is only half the story. The other half is learning how to live with it, how to ask for help, and how to build a team around you.
