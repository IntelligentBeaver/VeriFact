        "May 3, 2023 -- A drug maker is seeking FDA approval to treat a rare form of muscular dystrophy with what would be the first gene therapy OK’d through the agency’s accelerated approval process.",
        "“The request has reportedly triggered intense debate within the FDA,” NPR reports.",
        "The request comes from Sarepta Therapeutics, which says its experimental gene therapy infuses trillions of harmless viruses that have been genetically modified to deliver a gene to the muscles.",
        "“The gene produces a miniature version of a protein called dystrophin, that boys with muscular dystrophy are missing or don't have enough of. The hope is this ‘micro-dystrophin’ will at least help slow the progression of the disease,” NPR says.",
        "Sarepta bases its belief on how much micro-dystrophin the gene therapy produces in the muscles. It doesn’t have direct evidence that the treatment alleviates symptoms or prevents the disease from getting worse.",
        "The FDA says independent advisers will consider the request for accelerated approval on May 12. That would grant FDA approval before strong evidence shows the treatment works as long as companies promise to prove later that it works."
