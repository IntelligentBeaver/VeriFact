        "Bipolar disorder is characterized by dramatic or unusual mood swings between major depression and extreme elation, or mania. The mood swings can be mild or extreme. They can come on slowly or quickly, within hours to days. Bipolar disorder usually starts between 15 and 30 years of age. It's more prevalent in those teens who have a family history of mood disorder or psychiatric problems.",
        "There are two subtypes of bipolar disorder: bipolar I and bipolar II.",
        "While many teens can be irritable with or without bipolar disorder, the irritability that comes with mania or hypomania may be more hostile. Some believe there is a link between ADHD and bipolar disorder. Some 57% of teens who have adolescent-onset bipolar disorder also have ADHD."
      ],
      "bullets": [
        "With bipolar I, the teenager alternates between extreme states of depression and intense mania. With the mania, the teen might be abnormally happy, energetic, and very talkative, with no need for sleep for days. They might also have hallucinations , psychosis , grandiose delusions , and/or paranoid rage, all of which might require hospitalization and medications. Once bipolar I begins, it typically persists throughout the person's life.",
        "With bipolar II, the teen has a depression that can be severe but a lesser form of elation called \" hypomania .\" While someone with either mania or hypomania may have grandiose mood and reduced need for sleep , hypomania is a period of incredible energy, charm, and productivity. It's often associated with high achievers."
