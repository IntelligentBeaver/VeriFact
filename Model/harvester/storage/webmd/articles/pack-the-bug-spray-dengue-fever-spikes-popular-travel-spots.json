        "Formally known as dengue fever , the CDC issued an alert Tuesday to health care providers about the virus that causes the illness, urging them to be on the lookout for what may simply appear to be a fever and other run-of-the-mill symptoms like nausea and muscle aches.",
        "Diagnosing dengue fever is critical because some people with it will get severe complications like organ failure and blood vessel damage that can cause bleeding under the skin and from the gums of the mouth.",
        "Already this year, 745 U.S. travelers have been diagnosed with dengue fever, according to the CDC. Through the first half of this year, the number of cases recorded in countries in the Americas has surpassed 9.7 million, which is double the case count for all of 2023, the CDC alert stated. The virus has infected about 1,500 people in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, prompting officials there to declare a public health emergency."
