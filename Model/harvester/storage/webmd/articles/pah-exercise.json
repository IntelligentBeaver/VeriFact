        "Almost any way you slice it, exercise is good medicine. “We call sitting the new smoking,” says Eugene Chung, MD, chair of the American College of Cardiology Sports and Exercise Cardiology Leadership Council and professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan. “If you live a predominantly sedentary lifestyle, the biggest bang for your buck, health-wise, is to get up and start moving around more often.” Regular exercise helps the heart and body work smarter, not harder. It keeps your blood vessels in good shape and eases inflammation. All these have a positive impact on PAH. Here’s how: PAH stresses the right ventricle of your heart. This stress starts a cascade of changes in your body. One of those is a bump in adrenaline, the hormone that triggers your “fight or flight” response."

This improves your peak exercise heart rate. That’s how many beats per minute your heart can safely pump when exercising. It also lowers your blood pressure, which helps keep the cascade of changes from happening in the first place. In short, exercise helps break the cycle of worsening PAH symptoms."

Elliptical bikes and recumbent bikes are a safe way to cycle without risking a fall. Other types of exercise include: Yoga . Although there isn’t much research about the direct benefits of yoga on PAH, its slow and mindful stretching reduces stress and lowers inflammation in your body. Light resistance training. You can keep your muscles flexible and strong by using light weights (soup cans can work well) or just body weight. A rehabilitation specialist can teach you moves such as chair squats, wall pushups, calf raises, bicep curls, and more. It’s important not to lift heavy weights because it can worsen symptoms. “If you were to push it and do more high-intensity weightlifting, there's a chance that, depending on the cause of pulmonary hypertension, you could put increased strain on the right side of the heart,” says  Chung. You’re more likely to hold your breath as you lift as well, which raises the pressure in your chest cavity."
