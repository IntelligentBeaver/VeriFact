        "Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colon cancer is when colon cancer cells have DNA mistakes called mutations that can't be fixed. This makes them very unstable. Microsatellites are short sections of DNA in cells that repeat over and over.",
        "Normally, when cancer cells divide to make new cells, their DNA copies itself. A process called mismatch repair (MMR) constantly scans for any mistakes in the DNA copies and fixes them. If MMR doesn't work, each time the DNA copies itself, the mistakes get copied, too, and they make the cancer cells unstable. The name for a problem with the cell's DNA repair system is deficient DNA mismatch repair, or dMMR.",
