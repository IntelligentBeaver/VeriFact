        "Bipolar disorder is a condition that causes severe changes in mood and energy that can cause unpredictable high (manic), low (depressive), and mixed (both high and low) mood swings. There are two types of bipolar disorders: bipolar I and bipolar II. A person with bipolar I has experienced at least 1 episode of mania (also called a manic episode). Each person with bipolar I disorder has differences in how severe or less severe their high and low mood swings are and for how long they last. There is no cure for bipolar disorder, but medicines are used to help control symptoms and improve quality of life."
