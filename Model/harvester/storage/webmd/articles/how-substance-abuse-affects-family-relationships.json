Many do because they don't know what else to do, other than what they've always done. Be it drinking or a drug. If they’re the user or acting like they don't know what the user is doing or if they’re the loved one."

Addiction and alcoholism don't care about you or your family's feelings. They don't care what happens to your wife, husband, mother, father, brother, sister, or kids. When the drugs, alcohol, depression , isolation, and all that comes with it took over my uncle’s mind, body, and soul, it didn't stop him from taking his own life on my grandmother's steps while the rest of the family, myself included, were on vacation. I was 17.",

But there is a vast network of people willing to help those who ask for it and are serious about committing to changing their lives for the better.
