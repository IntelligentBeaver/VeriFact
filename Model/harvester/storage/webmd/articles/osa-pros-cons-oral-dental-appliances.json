An oral and dental appliance, also called a mouthpiece, might be another option. Some people use both appliances and PAP to treat their OSA. For example, you might use PAP at home and a mouthpiece when you’re on vacation or traveling for work. Here’s more information about the pros and cons of each."

        "These devices help keep your airway open by positioning the jaw and tongue a certain way. The goal is to make it easier for you to breathe while asleep. There are three main types: Mandibular advancement devices (MADs). Also called mandibular advancement splints, mandibular advancement appliances, or mandibular repositioning appliances, they fit over your teeth and pull your bottom jaw forward. This also pulls your tongue forward to make space in your throat to breathe. Mouthguards. A less expensive appliance, these also pull your lower jaw forward. Just not as much as MADs. You can buy them over the counter or get one custom made for your mouth. Tongue-stabilizing devices (TSDs). These use suction to pull your tongue forward. You aren’t likely to try a TSD unless there’s a reason you can’t put an appliance over your teeth."

        "An appliance may be a good substitute for or addition to PAP if you have mild to moderate OSA. Research shows many people struggle to stick with PAP therapy. Only 17% to 60% consistently use their mask. Doctors measure OSA based on how many obstructive respiratory events occur each hour you’re asleep. In other words, the number of times you stop breathing. Studies to measure how well appliances work are based on whether they can cut the number of events in half at least. Research suggests they work well for about 7 in 10 people. But they don’t stop breathing events completely."

Some PAP machines can be a bit noisy. Saves energy (and money). Unlike PAP machines, appliances don’t need electricity to function. They also don’t have multiple parts that must be replaced over time, such as a hose and filters. No setup required. All you have to do is put the appliance on. May not work as well as PAP. Appliance therapy is becoming a more common treatment for OSA. But it doesn’t work for everyone. An analysis of people treated with oral and dental appliances from 2000 to 2013 found that 1 in 3 people saw little to no improvement in their symptoms. MADs likely won’t work if you have a severe form of OSA. For example, doctors don’t usually suggest them for people with central sleep apnea. That’s because signaling issues in your brain trigger this form of the condition, so appliances won’t help. And treatments that work in adults may not be a good fit for children with OSA."
