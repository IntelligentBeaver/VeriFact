        "If there’s one certainty about life, it’s that it’ll throw you curveballs. In 2015, a head injury and a series of strokes left me couch-bound with brain damage. My neurologist instructed me to take up reading. It was the best way to remap my brain, they said. Even though I’d never liked it before, I started reading everything I could get my hands on.",
        "From that set of curveballs came another: A career change I’d never envisioned. I found I not only loved reading stories, but I also wanted to write them. I started penning novel-length fanfiction stories. The feedback I received at the site was very affirming. One incredibly talented author there encouraged me to continue learning proper writing craft and to pursue publication. Fast-forward to 2019, and I was signing my very first book contract.",
        "In May of that year, as I was hard at work trying to get my manuscript up to snuff, I noticed I was having eye strain. I wasn’t concerned. I thought it must be time to get new glasses. So I made an appointment with the optometrist. That’s when life tossed me my next curveball.",
