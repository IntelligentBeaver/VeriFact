        "An Achilles tendon injury can happen to anyone, whether you're an athlete or just going about your daily life.",
        "The Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in your body. It stretches from the bones of your heel to your calf muscles. You can feel it: a springy band of tissue at the back of your ankle and above your heel. It lets you point your toes toward the floor and raise up on your tiptoes. Thanks to its dense fibers, your Achilles tendon is also quite strong, able to withstand the force of up to 1,100 pounds.",
        "But because this part of your leg doesn't have great blood flow, it's easy to injure your Achilles tendon. Your doctor might call this tendinitis or tendonitis. It can feel like a burning or stiffness in the lower part of your leg. If the pain is severe, your Achilles tendon may be partly or completely torn.",

Use an elastic bandage around the lower leg and ankle to keep down swelling. Raise (elevate) your leg. Prop it on a pillow when you're sitting or lying down. Take anti-inflammatory painkillers . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen can help with pain and swelling. Follow the instructions on the label to help prevent side effects, such as bleeding and ulcers. Take them with food. Check with your doctor first if you have any allergies, have an ongoing medical condition, or take any other medication or supplements. If you feel like you need NSAIDs for longer than 7 to 10 days, let your doctor know. Use a heel lift. Your doctor may recommend that you wear an insert in your shoe while you recover. It can help protect your Achilles tendon from further strain. Ask your doctor which heel lift is best for you. Practice stretching and strengthening exercises. Your doctor or physical therapist can recommend ones for you to try. Take part in low-impact activities. When your doctor says it's OK, activities like swimming can help promote healing.",
