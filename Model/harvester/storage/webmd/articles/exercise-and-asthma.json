        "If you ask most people, exercise and asthma do not play well in the same sandbox. If you ask them to consider an athlete with asthma, it seems even more far-fetched. After living with asthma for more than 15 years, I’m glad to say I’ve seen the range of active lifestyles with asthma, from casual exerciser to professional competitor. I didn’t start that way, however.",
        "One of my worst fears when I was diagnosed was hearing the term exercise-induced asthma . It’s just like how it sounds -- asthma that’s kicked off when you exercise . I was incredibly upset! Who wants to do something that brings asthma to a perfectly normal day? I thought it meant I wouldn’t be able to continue an active lifestyle despite what the doctor said. Don’t get me wrong: I wasn’t a triathlete, but I took regular dance classes. I was on a dance team in college. I ran 5Ks. Right before I got the news, I had just started boxing lessons at a real boxing gym. By real , I mean Laila Ali (Muhammad Ali’s daughter) trained there, and I have the photo to prove it!"

I have covered the range when it comes to exercise and asthma. At times, I’ve pushed too hard in an effort to lose weight, and it made my asthma worse. There have been times that I have been too afraid to exercise, and that didn’t help my asthma either.",
        "The longer I have asthma, the more I understand the importance a finding that perfect middle. For me, the name of the game is slow and steady. It's been helpful to learn about major athletes who still excel in their sport with asthma -- athletes like six-time Olympic track star Jackie Joyner-Kersee and soccer phenom David Beckham. Now retired, both Kersee and Beckham kept their asthma quiet for most of their careers. This is another example of why representation matters. If I saw more athletes living out loud with their asthma back then, I would have been inspired to stay active. Instead, I treated myself with kid gloves when I know full well the benefits of exercise. It’s good for my lungs."

        "Being a healthy weight can positively impact your health in so many areas, including for those of us living with asthma. I have noticed a difference in my breathing when I pick up a few pounds. Sometimes, a difference of 5 pounds can make my breathing a little bit more labored.",
        "These days, I continue to take things slow. I’m tempted to jump on the latest fitness craze, but I take my time. If my friends are going hiking, I research the trail first. If someone invites me to their gym to work out, I’ll do a trial class with the understanding that I can bail if my breathing becomes labored. I’m past the days being embarrassed about my asthma or concerned that it will significantly impact my life. I make adjustments and speak up when something is just too much for me.",
        "What works best for me now is to keep my asthma controlled by taking my medication as prescribed. I have my rescue inhaler with me whether it’s a walk around the park with friends or a dance workout at home. I try to always do a warmup and cooldown. Also, I avoid exercising outside when it’s too hot or cold. I definitely feel better staying active, so I will keep it up for sure."
