        "A Bartholin’s cyst, also called a Bartholin’s gland cyst, is a small fluid-filled lump (cyst) that can form on one or both sides of the vaginal opening, where the Bartholin’s glands are. The glands are small, about the size of a pea, but you usually can’t notice them. Their role is to produce lubricating vaginal fluid.",
        "The fluid travels to the vagina through ducts (tubes). Occasionally, one or both Bartholin glands become blocked and cause the fluid to build up, forming a cyst . These cysts are common among people of childbearing age, affecting about 2 of every 10 women.",
        "Bartholin's cysts mostly occur on one side, but some people get them on both sides. They're almost always benign, or not cancer .",
        "The cysts aren’t always obvious and are sometimes only found during a medical exam.",
