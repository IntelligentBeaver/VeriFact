        "One in every five of those diagnosed with multiple myeloma are African American. It’s estimated they’ll make up almost 25% of all people with the condition within 10 years. But there are significant differences when it comes to them getting care. That includes access to clinical trials and groundbreaking treatments like CAR T-cell therapy. One study found that African Americans are less likely to get CAR T-cell therapy than other racial and ethnic groups. For example, only 1% of participants in a clinical trial for a new treatment were Black. “Despite all the treatment advances for multiple myeloma like CAR T-cell therapy, access remains limited,” said lead study author Nausheen Ahmed, MD, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Here’s a closer look at the reasons behind the disparity and what can be done about it."

        "The T cells turn into CAR T cells that attack myeloma cells. Large numbers are grown in the laboratory. They’re put in your body a few weeks later. Two drugs have been approved for CAR T-cell therapy for multiple myeloma in the last 2 years: ciltacabtagene autoleucel and idecabtagene vicleucel. You can only try them if your multiple myeloma has come back or isn’t responding to treatment and you’ve tried at least four other therapies. The research so far suggests CAR T-cell therapy works well. One study found that ciltacabtagene autoleucel stopped the cancer’s progression in 76% of clinical trial participants at the 1-year mark. This is compared to the 48% who got standard care, such as targeted therapy or chemotherapy. A little more than 70% of participants on ciltacabtagene autoleucel also had a complete response, compared to almost 22% in the standard care group."

For example, there were two centers in New York City that were literally across the street from one another. This could be avoided if we spread out trials and conducted them in areas of the country where there were large pockets of Black people with multiple myeloma.” Researchers are also studying whether it’s possible to shorten the recovery period after CAR T-cell treatment.

For example, one particularly dangerous side effect, cytokine release syndrome, did not affect those in treatment after day 14. It can trigger high fever, trouble breathing, and severe nausea. The other option would be for CAR T-cell centers to set up outreach clinics that are closer to people for monitoring, said Al’Hadidi. “This way, we make it as easy as possible for (them),” he said."

It’s currently 30 days, which is why you must stay close to the cancer center. But research Ahmed plans to present at the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy’s annual meeting suggests it could potentially be shortened to 14 days. “That’s when we see the most toxicity from treatment, but it drops significantly after that,” said Ahmed. For example, one particularly dangerous side effect, cytokine release syndrome, did not affect those in treatment after day 14. It can trigger high fever, trouble breathing, and severe nausea. The other option would be for CAR T-cell centers to set up outreach clinics that are closer to people for monitoring, said Al’Hadidi. “This way, we make it as easy as possible for (them),” he said.",
