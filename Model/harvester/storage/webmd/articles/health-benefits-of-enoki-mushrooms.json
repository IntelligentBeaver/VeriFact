But enoki mushrooms cultivated indoors without sunlight look like a white sprout with a velvet stem and a small white cap on top. They're grown on a substrate or medium containing sawdust with corn cob, rice bran, and other organic material."

Enoki mushrooms are also rich in fiber, good fats like linoleic acid, and compounds like lovastatin and gamma-aminobutyric acid . These substances lower your cholesterol levels and blood pressure. They also prevent inflammation and protect you against conditions like thrombosis (blood clots in veins) and atherosclerosis.",
