        "I visited Washington, D.C., with a few of my friends this spring to see the Cherry Blossom Festival. It was a trip we had been planning for a couple of months, so I was excited that the time had finally come for us to go. A week before our trip, the blooms reached full peak. We did not worry because while it is not easy to determine when this will actually happen, the trees usually retain their beauty for several days afterward. Unfortunately, a sudden wind and rain storm battered the blossoms a few days before our trip. So these already fleeting beauties were all but blown away into the Tidal Basin where many of the cherry trees are planted. I kept close watch of this area in real time via a live view camera. Each day it seemed that the trees were becoming greener with just some speckles of pink left behind. Instead, I focused on a cluster of pretty pink ones that had weathered the storm."

        "I can relate to those trees, as someone who has found the beauty in the ashes of life. The spiritual context of this saying – according to GotQuestions.org – is “the Lord promises that He would ‘bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair’” (Isaiah 61:3).",
        "This is the 22nd year since my breast cancer story began. Lord knows that it has not been easy, as I have lost a lot. Yes, I could be consumed by the heaviness of being in treatment and losing my hair, yet I realize that I have gained so much more. Instead, I try to stay focused on all of my blessings and keep a heart of gratefulness. I appreciate the beauty of flowers, the warmth of the sun, and the friendly smiles of strangers. This is why I did not want to lose focus on the clusters of blossoms that remained pink. I wanted to have something to look forward to."

        "We took a train to Washington and checked in to our hotel in the Capitol Hill area. After we got a bite to eat, we decided to go to the Tidal Basin to see the sunset. During our taxi ride, it was a bit disappointing to see, in person, that indeed, most of the blossoms in various areas were gone. But we were determined to make the most of everything. When we arrived at our destination, we saw a small crowd of people taking photos in front of the cluster of pink trees. Feeling excited, we walked toward them. Although the area didn’t have the full glory of a lot of lush pink trees, it was still a sight to see along the waterfront. We took some amazing photos with the warrior blooms that seemed to wait for us to get there.",
        "During the rest of the weekend, we visited the United States Botanic Garden to see their orchid exhibit, enjoyed a live jazz performance, and ate at some wonderful restaurants."
