This is an issue of reproductive rights that could affect reproductive justice. Laws that make reproductive health care harder to access are more limiting for those who lack resources.",

        "More than half of all states are expected to prohibit or restrict access to abortion as effects of the Dobbs decision unfold. Currently, some states ban abortion regardless of circumstance, others allow it in some cases, and some protect your right to abortion access. Lower-income people and women of color in states that ban abortion will be impacted most. Experts agree they’re more likely to have health, social, and economic consequences when abortion is not legal and safe. In doing this, the Dobbs decision helps drive the sexism and racism that research has shown happens when reproductive rights and services are denied.",
        "One study looked at the effects of immigration law enforcement on reproductive justice. Researchers used existing data on a Latin American community in Michigan. They wanted to see if a raid in the community made women change their plans to have children. They found that it did. After the raid, women were more likely to want to delay having children. The study shows that events that lead people to feel fearful or uncertain about the future can discourage them from having children when they’d otherwise want to. In this way, these are reproductive justice issues.",
        "Another review explored reproductive justice during the COVID-19 pandemic. It looked at how the pandemic has affected access to reproductive health care, including birth control. It found in 24 studies that quarantines and social distancing measures did make reproductive care harder to access.",
        "People with disabilities also may face more barriers in accessing reproductive health care or the ability to make choices about their bodies. One study found that more women with disabilities have had procedures that made them unable to have kids. They’re also less likely to use birth control methods that last a long time but can be removed. They suggest these differences may reflect discriminatory attitudes and policies toward people with disabilities having kids.",
        "Reproductive justice also is relevant to how doctors counsel young people about birth control. It’s common for doctors to suggest contraception for all adolescents. But these recommendations may not always take into account the priorities and wishes of young people about their own bodies.",
        "A reproductive justice framework also applies to reproductive technologies that help people get pregnant and have kids when they otherwise couldn’t. Such assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are costly and easier to access for people with resources than people without. They also may be less accessible to people in the LGBTQ community.",
        "Climate change also can be a reproductive justice issue. For instance, studies show that rising temperatures may lead more babies to be born too soon, which may have health effects for both mother and baby. Worry about climate change also is leading more young people to say that they aren’t sure they should have kids."

One study found that more women with disabilities have had procedures that made them unable to have kids. They’re also less likely to use birth control methods that last a long time but can be removed. They suggest these differences may reflect discriminatory attitudes and policies toward people with disabilities having kids.",
        "Reproductive justice also is relevant to how doctors counsel young people about birth control. It’s common for doctors to suggest contraception for all adolescents. But these recommendations may not always take into account the priorities and wishes of young people about their own bodies.",
        "A reproductive justice framework also applies to reproductive technologies that help people get pregnant and have kids when they otherwise couldn’t. Such assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are costly and easier to access for people with resources than people without. They also may be less accessible to people in the LGBTQ community.",
        "Climate change also can be a reproductive justice issue. For instance, studies show that rising temperatures may lead more babies to be born too soon, which may have health effects for both mother and baby. Worry about climate change also is leading more young people to say that they aren’t sure they should have kids."

            "More than half of all states are expected to prohibit or restrict access to abortion as effects of the Dobbs decision unfold. Currently, some states ban abortion regardless of circumstance, others allow it in some cases, and some protect your right to abortion access. Lower-income people and women of color in states that ban abortion will be impacted most. Experts agree they’re more likely to have health, social, and economic consequences when abortion is not legal and safe. In doing this, the Dobbs decision helps drive the sexism and racism that research has shown happens when reproductive rights and services are denied.",
            "One study looked at the effects of immigration law enforcement on reproductive justice. Researchers used existing data on a Latin American community in Michigan. They wanted to see if a raid in the community made women change their plans to have children. They found that it did. After the raid, women were more likely to want to delay having children. The study shows that events that lead people to feel fearful or uncertain about the future can discourage them from having children when they’d otherwise want to. In this way, these are reproductive justice issues.",
            "Another review explored reproductive justice during the COVID-19 pandemic. It looked at how the pandemic has affected access to reproductive health care, including birth control. It found in 24 studies that quarantines and social distancing measures did make reproductive care harder to access.",
