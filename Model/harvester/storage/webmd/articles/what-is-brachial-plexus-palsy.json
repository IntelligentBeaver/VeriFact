These nerves help your shoulder, arm, hand, and fingers move. If the brachial plexus gets injured, it causes weakness and loss of motion in your arm."

        "The brachial plexus is a complex network of nerves near your neck. It extends from the neck under your collarbone into your arms. It gives rise to all the nerves from your shoulders to your fingers. These nerves connect the spinal cord to your arms. They control the movement of muscles in the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, and fingers. They are also responsible for feeling or sensation in your arms.",
        "You can get brachial plexus nerve damage due to an injury. It can affect the nerves that pass from the neck to the arm. If these nerves get stretched, compressed, or torn due to injury, they can’t pass on signals from the brain to your arm muscles. This causes weakness and loss of movement in your arm, which is called brachial palsy. Palsy means paralysis or the inability to move muscles in the affected area.",
