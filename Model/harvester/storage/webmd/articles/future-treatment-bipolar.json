        "By Paula Zimbrean, MD, as told to Hallie Levine Over the last 2 decades, there have been huge advancements in the treatment of bipolar disorder. We’ve learned that there are several types: bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymic. All present differently and require different treatments. We’ve gotten better at teasing out if symptoms are truly due to bipolar disorder or something else. And we’ve developed groundbreaking new treatments that are easier on the body and make it possible for people with bipolar disorder to live full lives. Here’s what I’m most excited about."

There’s no doubt lithium is an important drug when it comes to bipolar disorder, and it’s very effective. But it carries a risk of side effects, especially at high doses, including both kidney and thyroid disease. I’ve worked with patients who took lithium for many years who eventually required kidney transplants. The good news is today we know much more about lithium and how it works, so when we do need to use it, we prescribe much lower doses."

        "Over the last couple of decades, we’ve also realized that some of the anticonvulsant medications, such as carbamazepine, lamotrigine , and valproate are effective ways to treat the mania from bipolar disorder. At the same time, a group of drugs known as second-generation antipsychotics became available, too. These medications, which include aripiprazole , cariprazine, lumateperone,olanzapine , quetiapine , and risperidone , among others, carry lower risk of side effects than earlier antipsychotics. These side effects include weight gain, elevated cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and tardive dyskinesia -- stiff, jerky movements of the face and body. There are even more of these being approved. Some seem to carry a much lower risk of side effects such as weight gain or elevated cholesterol or blood sugars. Some also appear less likely to interact with other medications, which is something I worry about daily as a prescriber."
