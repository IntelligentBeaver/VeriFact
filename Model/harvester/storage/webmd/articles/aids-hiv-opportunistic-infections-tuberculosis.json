        "Most people think of tuberculosis, often called TB, as a serious disease that affects the lungs. That's true, but it can also affect other parts of your body, including your brain and spine. It's not a problem for most people with healthy immune systems: You can have TB germs in your body and not get sick yourself or spread the disease to others.",
        "But it's different for someone who is HIV-positive. When your immune system is weak, TB germs can multiply and cause symptoms. Someone infected with both HIV and TB is at least 10 times more likely to develop active TB, especially when their CD4 count is under 200. Regardless of your CD4 count, having both infections also means you have AIDS, the advanced stage of HIV.",

        "Taking steps to prevent this opportunistic infection and getting tested and treated for it are an important part of living with HIV. It not only helps control tuberculosis, but it helps prevent greater damage to your immune system."
