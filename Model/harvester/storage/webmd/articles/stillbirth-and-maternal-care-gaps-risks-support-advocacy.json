        "Apr. 10, 2025 -- Stillbirth affects thousands of families each year, yet misinformation persists. What are the risk factors, and how do disparities in care contribute? Heather Florescue, MD, FACOG , OBGYN at the University of Rochester Medical Center, sheds light on the psychological toll of stillbirth, the often-overlooked postpartum period, and steps to reduce risk during pregnancy and conception. We then spoke to Samantha Banerjee, Executive Director of PUSH for Empowered Pregnancy , shares her personal journey and the advocacy efforts supporting families and driving change. Join us as we explore how to navigate pregnancy concerns, advocate for better care, and break the silence surrounding stillbirth."

        "John Whyte, MD, MPH: Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered Podcast. I'm Dr. John Whyte, WebMD's Chief Medical Officer. In today’s episode, I’m joined by two remarkable experts to address one of the most heartbreaking and often misunderstood topics in women’s health: stillbirth. We'll tackle the common myths and misconceptions that swirl around it—everything from Could I have prevented it? to Did I miss some crucial sign? We'll dig deep into the emotional toll a stillbirth can take on mothers, partners, and families, and explore how mental health support plays a critical role in the healing process. We’ll also look at the questions women frequently ask themselves in the aftermath, like whether they can safely conceive again or what tests or precautions they might need next time. How do you navigate the flood of conflicting emotions—grief, guilt, anger, and isolation? And more importantly, where can you turn for reliable information, compassionate care, and community support when it seems like no one wants to discuss what you’ve been through? Our guests are here to shed light on these concerns, offering insights, evidence-based resources, and a sense of hope—even in the darkest of times."

Helping parents to understand the landscape—you know, who in your doctor’s office are you actually talking to when you call to report an issue? And do they have the authority to help you? What questions should you be asking your provider at your routine appointments, and at what point in the pregnancy? And how should you ask those questions in a way that’s going to be well received? Most importantly, how to raise concerns effectively. You know, we have a strategy called using your “curse words.” Not actual curse words, but keywords that really help flag providers that—wow, this mom is really concerned, and I’ve got to listen to that. We know that not every stillbirth will ever be preventable. But we feel extremely strongly—as parents who have had to shoulder the guilt and regret and self-blame after a stillbirth—that every parent deserves to know that they and their providers did everything possible to give their baby the best possible chance.

  "meta_description": "Stillbirth affects thousands of families each year, yet misinformation persists. What are the risk factors, and how do disparities in care contribute? Heather Florescue, MD, FACOG, OBGYN at the University of Rochester Medical Center, sheds light on the psychological toll of stillbirth, the often-overlooked postpartum period, and steps to reduce risk during pregnancy and conception. We then spoke to Samantha Banerjee, Executive Director of PUSH for Empowered Pregnancy, shares her personal journey and the advocacy efforts supporting families and driving change. Join us as we explore how to navigate pregnancy concerns, advocate for better care, and break the silence surrounding stillbirth.",
