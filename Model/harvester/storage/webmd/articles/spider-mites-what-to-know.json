        "Quickly get rid of spider mites with an approved insecticidal soap, miticide, or oil. Horticultural oils can also help summer perennials. The dormant oils target mites and their eggs in the spring and fall.",
        "Evenly spray the oil directly on the leaves, from top to bottom. Avoid spraying on any flowers, though. Keep in mind, regular insecticides won't work as well against spider mites. Be sure to follow label instructions to stay safe.",
        "What is the best homemade spider mite killer?",
        "The best homemade spider mite killer depends on the plant and type of mite. If it's an outdoor plant, try releasing a good insect like the western predatory mite. Also, keep your plants watered to prevent spider mite breeding.",
        "If these aren't working, many locally approved plant extracts can kill mites (acaricides). Some options are garlic extract, clove oil, mint oil, rosemary oil, or cinnamon oil. Cover the mites with the oil and under the leaves, too. Since webs and eggs are more protected, you may need to reapply later."
