        "Cholesterol is a form of fat we need. It helps make the outer membranes of our bodies' cells stable. But for decades, doctors have known that people with high total cholesterol levels are more likely to get heart disease . They’ve also found that the different forms of cholesterol (\"good\" and \"bad\") play a role. High total cholesterol, high bad cholesterol, or low good cholesterol could raise your chances.",
        "For example, low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ), or \"bad\" cholesterol, can stick to blood vessel walls. Over time, it can play a role in clogging arteries in a process called atherosclerosis . Narrowed arteries in your heart can then develop sudden blood clots , causing heart attacks .",

This is a newer class of cholesterol-lowering drugs that’s used in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who cannot control their cholesterol through diet and statin treatments. It’s also used in those with clinical atherosclerotic heart disease. The drugs alirocumab ( Praluent ) or evolocumab (Repatha) block the liver protein PCSK9, which hinders the liver’s ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. This reduces the amount of bad cholesterol in the bloodstream. Evolocumab in particular, has proven to be effective in lowering the risk of heart attack and strokes in people who have cardiovascular disease.",
