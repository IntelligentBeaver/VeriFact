This leads to a problem with the tear film that coats your eye. The tear film consists of three layers: An oily layer on the outside A watery layer in the middle A mucus layer at the bottom closest to your eye The tear film keeps your eyes moist and protects them from irritation. The meibomian glands in your eyelids produce the oily layer. Lacrimal glands in your upper eyelid make the watery layer. And goblet cells in your eyes mainly produce the mucus layer. A problem with the way your eyes make tears or how well those tears stay on the surface of your eye can lead to dry eye symptoms."

A cataract is a clouding of the lens in your eye. It can lead to blurry vision and glare. Cataract surgery removes your clouded lens and replaces it with an artificial lens.
