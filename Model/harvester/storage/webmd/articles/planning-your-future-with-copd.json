        "I've got to admit, this is a depressing subject and a difficult blog to write, because COPD is a progressive condition with no cure. So ultimately, planning for your future includes end-of-life preparations. It's not a very pleasant thought, but it's an ultimate reality of COPD, and it's a reality best thought out and communicated ahead of time.",
        "To tell the truth, I don't even want to think about such things. I'm just 49 years old, that's practically a teenager. (You can pick yourself up off the floor now.) But seriously, I don't feel old, I'm too young to be thinking about end-of-life stuff. Right? Unfortunately, not. Besides, it's always better to be prepared, especially when there's a possibility of losing the ability to communicate in the final stages.",
        "First, you should talk to your family and friends about your wishes, like what kind of care do you want or don't want, who do you want to have power of attorney and/or the authority to make difficult medical decisions, etc. Where you want to receive care, if you want to be resuscitated or on life support, and so on."

        "All that being said, I don't plan on needing end-of-life preparations anytime soon. Like I said, I feel fine, and my doctor says that though COPD is a progressive disease, it can be stymied by taking care of myself . Such as protecting my lungs, being cautious about what I breathe in, minding what I eat, and exercising. So, there are things I can do to prolong my life and put off depressing discussions. I'm not entirely powerless against my condition's progression."
