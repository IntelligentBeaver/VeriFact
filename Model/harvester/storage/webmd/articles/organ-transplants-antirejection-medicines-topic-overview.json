        "Your body's defenses are always on the prowl for germs and other foreign organisms. Unfortunately, this means that your body is not a very well-mannered host. It treats your life-saving transplanted organ just like it treats a mere freeloading germ: It attacks. Organ rejection is your own body's misguided attempt to protect you. That's why there's immunosuppression .",
        "Immunosuppressant drugs can block the effects of these natural defenses. They usually allow your body to live in relative harmony with a donor organ. The catch is that by blocking your defenses, you become more vulnerable to infections. It's the trade-off of getting a transplant.",
