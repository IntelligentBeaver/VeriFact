        "Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is a type of irregular heartbeat in which the heart beats faster than it should. It’s one of many types of heart arrhythmias or irregular heart rhythms.",
        "When your heart beats normally, there are between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Anytime the heart beats faster than 100 beats per minute, it’s called a tachycardia (pronounced tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh).",
        "This happens because the signals that control your heartbeat aren’t working right. In this type of tachycardia, those irregular signals come from three or more places in the heart’s upper chambers. That’s where MAT gets its name. “Multifocal” means having more than one focus and “atrial” refers to the heart’s two upper chambers, called atria."
