        "Cervical cancer is one of the few cancers that’s almost totally preventable. The rate of death from this disease has dropped by more than half in the past few decades.",
        "Why? It comes down to being able to avoid human papillomavirus, or HPV, which is sexually transmitted. HPV is the top cause of cervical cancer, though it doesn’t always cause the disease. Many people have HPV and don’t develop cervical cancer. But a vaccine targets some of the riskiest strains of HPV. And gynecologists routinely perform Pap smears, which can detect almost all cervical cancers. They may also screen for HPV.",
        "That’s why it’s important to keep up with your doctor appointments. Your Pap or HPV tests can find abnormal cells in your cervix before the cancer starts.",
        "You can also make some lifestyle choices that will lower your chances of getting HPV so that you’re less likely to get cervical cancer."
