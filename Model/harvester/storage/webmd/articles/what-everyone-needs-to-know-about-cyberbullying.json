        "Bullying is something many people think happens between kids on the playground. But in today’s social media-centric world, bullying has moved into cyberspace -- and it’s not only between kids. Whether it’s a political argument between Facebook “friends” or in the comments section of a controversial article, adults are increasingly finding themselves targets of online harassment.",
        "Studies suggest that about 40% of adults have been bullied or harassed online. The most common forms of cyberbullying (technically called cyber harassment when between adults) include offensive name-calling or purposeful embarrassment. More intense -- and emotionally damaging -- forms include physical threats, sexual harassment, and stalking. About 1 in 4 women aged 18 to 24 report being stalked or sexually harassed on the Internet.",
        "Researchers believe cyberbullying can be even more hurtful, psychologically, than physical bullying. One reason: “Targets often do not know who the bully is, or why they are being targeted,” explains Sameer Hinduja, PhD, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center . “The aggressor can cloak his or her identity behind a computer or cellphone using anonymous email addresses or pseudonymous screen names.”",
        "Plus, online harassment incidents can quickly go viral, Hinduja says. With just a few keystrokes or clicks of a mouse, many people -- in a school, in a town, in the world -- can get involved or at least find out about the attack. Finally, “the fact that there is a measure of anonymity, and that it is easier to be cruel using typed words rather than spoken words face-to-face, also contributes to the problem,” Hinduja says."

A YouTube vlogger, who is vegan , posted a video in response in which they mocked the article, called the writer derogatory names, and even included death threats. They even encouraged their followers to send the writer hate mails with more threats and disparaging statements.",

Eventually, the hateful comments and emails subsided, but they still revisits the trauma to this day."

After that, the man sent a threatening Facebook message, warning them that they “didn’t want to make\" them angry, \"or there would be consequences.” The man also told them that they knew exactly where the young woman lived. Once they blocked the man on Facebook, the messages stopped, but that didn’t stop the young woman from feeling scared, even unable to eat or sleep.

While most targets of cyberbullying do not become suicidal, research suggests they are more likely to have symptoms of depression than those who have been physically bullied. People who deal with online harassment may also feel sad, irritable, anxious and hopeless. They may lose interest in activities they used to enjoy, start to sleep more or sleep less, and change their eating patterns.
