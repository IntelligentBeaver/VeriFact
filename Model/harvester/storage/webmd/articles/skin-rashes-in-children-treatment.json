        "A virus called varicella-zoster causes chickenpox , a very contagious disease. Although it is rarely a serious disease to otherwise healthy children, the symptoms last about 2 weeks and can make the child very uncomfortable. In addition, chickenpox can be a serious illness in people with weak immune systems, such as newborns, people on chemotherapy for cancer, people taking steroids, pregnant women, the elderly, or those with HIV . A safe and effective vaccine is now available to children ages 1 and older to prevent chickenpox. It takes up to 21 days to develop chickenpox after being exposed to the virus by inhaling infected droplets from coughs or sneezes or by coming in direct contact with the lesions on an infected person with chickenpox or from someone with shingles."
      ],
      "bullets": [
        "Symptoms The symptoms of chickenpox often begin with a very itchy rash, which first appears on the scalp, chest, back and face then spreads to the rest of the body. The rash begins as an area of redness with a small, superficial blister in the center. The blister eventually ruptures with some possible drainage, and the lesion will then form a crust. Other associated symptoms include fever, malaise, sore throat , and red eyes. Fever and malaise may precede the rash in some cases.",
        "Treatment The virus is spread primarily from the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth of the child, but the rash itself is also contagious. The child remains contagious and cannot go to school or daycare until the last lesion has appeared and is fully crusted over. No therapy treats chickenpox once it has begun, but your doctor can provide prescriptions and advice to help with the discomfort and the itching. Never give aspirin to a child in general but especially one with chickenpox. A deadly disease called Reye's syndrome has been associated with children taking aspirin, especially if they have chickenpox. Be sure to check the contents of any other over-the-counter medications for aspirin or salicylates because these are often found mixed with over-the-counter cold medications. Chickenpox can occasionally affect the cornea, the clear front portion of the eye. If your child develops chickenpox on the tip of the nose  it is usually a precursor to having the eyes infected. See your doctor immediately. See a doctor immediately also if your child develops lesions in the genital regions internally or inside of the mouth."

After 1-2 days of these symptoms, the child develops a rash on the body that is red like sunburn and has a sandpaper texture. The skin folds in the neck, armpits, elbows, groin and knees are usually a deeper red color compared to the overall rash. After 7-14 days, the rash sloughs off and peeling is usually present. The face may look very flushed, but the skin around the mouth appears normal or pale. The tongue can look like a strawberry-red with bumps.",

Your child will require a full course of antibiotics, which should be completed even if your child is feeling better before he or she completes the course. Your child may return to school  24 hours after starting the antibiotics if the fever has resolved and he or she is feeling better."

        "Scabies is an itchy rash that is often worsened with bathing or at night. It is caused by a mite, a very small insect ( Sarcoptes scabiei ) that burrows beneath the top layer of skin. It is spread by close bodily contact such as sleeping together or sharing of clothing. It can also be sexually transmitted. Mites can survive for several days in clothes, bedding, and dust."

        "Symptoms The rash starts about 2 weeks after your child has come into contact with the mite. The itchy rash of scabies tends to be found between the fingers, in the armpits, and on the inner wrists and arms. It tends to spare the head, palms, and soles except in infants and with severe infestations. Sometimes you can see the wavy pattern where the mite has burrowed.",
        "Treatment To prevent scabies, good hygiene, frequent hand washing, and not sharing clothing with friends is important. If your child has an itchy rash that lasts for more than 2-3 days, he or she should be checked by a doctor. Prescription medications are available to kill the mites and to decrease the allergic skin reactions of swelling and itch. Once anyone in the family is diagnosed with scabies, everyone in the home should be treated for mite infestation. All clothing and bedding must be washed in hot water and the mattresses vacuumed."

        "Ringworm is a local infection of the skin with a fungus, usually Microsporum canis, Microsporum audouinii, or Trichophyton tonsurans . Doctors refer to these infections as \"tinea\" with several forms such as tinea corporis (ringworm on the body) and tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp). Although the 2 are caused by the same organisms, they are treated differently. Ringworm can be caught from friends (exchanging combs, brushes, or hats) or from household pets. If you think your child may have ringworm, you should see your doctor."

        "Symptoms With tinea corporis, the lesion starts as a red, slightly scaly, oval that gets bigger over time. The rash may be slightly itchy. The center of the rash may clear and appear to be normal skin. Tinea capitis usually starts with a round to oval area on the scalp with hair loss Sometimes, the area of the scalp will swell and may ooze. This is called a kerion and is a reaction of the body to the tinea fungus. Tinea capitis may also present as normal-to-severe dandruff with hairless patches on the scalp.",
        "Treatment Tinea corporis can easily be treated with topical medications available from your doctor. Unfortunately, it can be easily spread among family members and friends, making multiple unwanted return visits. Good hygiene combined with appropriate therapy can break this cycle. If complications such as a secondary bacterial skin infection occurs,or there is no improvement after four weeks, call your doctor. Tinea capitis requires an oral medication from your doctor."
