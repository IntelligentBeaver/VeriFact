        "Road trips to summer vacation destinations can be a fun, economical alternative to flying. But as hours on the open road add up and fast food wrappers stack up, tempers can flare, setting a stressful tone for what should be pleasurable days ahead.",
        "“Long car rides can have several negative effects on passengers,” says Wayne Andersen, MD. Andersen is medical director for Take Shape for Life Wellness program in New York City. Sitting in the same position for an extended period of time can cause swelling in the lower legs, contraction of the muscles, and stiffness in your joints, he says. People prone to motion sickness are affected by winding, smaller highways, especially if they attempt to read.",
        "“And on top of all that, people have a tendency to eat food on the road that’s full of sugar, salt, and fat to relieve boredom. These fast foods can worsen the swelling and lead to weight gain,” he says. Not to mention the general grumpiness that can ensue."
