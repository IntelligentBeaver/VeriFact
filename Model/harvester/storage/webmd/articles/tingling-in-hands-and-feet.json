        "JOHN WHYTE: Hello.",
        "I'm Dr. John Whyte, the Chief",
        "Medical Officer at WebMD.",
        "Today, I want to spend some time",
        "discussing myasthenia gravis,",
        "a complex neuromuscular",
        "condition that affects over",
        "50,000 Americans.",
        "While the cause remains",
        "a mystery, and a cure is still",
        "out of reach,",
        "with some new advancements",
        "in treatment, we're able to help",
        "patients live fulfilling lives.",
        "I'm joined by two experts",
        "today, to discuss how physicians",
        "and patients can work together",
        "to get the best treatment.",
        "Dr. Richard Nowak.",
        "He's Director of the Yale",
        "Myasthenia Gravis Clinic,",
        "and Associate Professor",
        "of Neurology at Yale School",
        "of Medicine.",
        "And Dr. John Bach, Professor",
        "of Neurology,",
        "and Professor of Physical",
        "Medicine and Rehabilitation",
        "at Rutgers University, New",
        "Jersey Medical School.",
        "Doctors, thanks for joining me.",
        "JOHN BACH: Pleasure to be",
        "here, John.",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: Great to be here",
        "as well, John.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: Effective",
        "communication is always",
        "key with a patient.",
        "And sometimes doctors aren't",
        "always the best communicators.",
        "How do you communicate",
        "with patients",
        "about their condition",
        "and their expectations?",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: That's",
        "a great question.",
        "I think it's so critical as part",
        "of caring for individuals",
        "with myasthenia gravis,",
        "or any other health issue,",
        "is that there be",
        "an open dialogue with patients,",
        "and that patients are",
        "comfortable in expressing where",
        "they're coming from,",
        "and what they're feeling.",
        "I view this as a partnership",
        "in care with my patients.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: Sometimes",
        "in neurology, say, in headaches,",
        "they want you to take a journal,",
        "write down symptoms.",
        "With myasthenia, do we do any",
        "of that?",
        "Or how do you assess symptoms?",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: I most certainly",
        "ask patients",
        "about their symptoms.",
        "And I find it extremely valuable",
        "that patients express",
        "and communicate their symptoms,",
        "and how their symptoms might",
        "change from one week",
        "to the next, or from one day",
        "to the next.",
        "Because this condition",
        "can fluctuate,",
        "and there can be variability",
        "of symptoms,",
        "depending on the activity",
        "that an individual is engaged",
        "in, such as work or exercise,",
        "et cetera.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: So it's",
        "important for patients",
        "to be very forthright about how",
        "they're feeling",
        "and their symptoms.",
        "Dr. Bach, you're a professor",
        "of neurology",
        "and physical",
        "medicine, rehabilitation.",
        "What are some",
        "of those other aspects",
        "that patients need to",
        "think about",
        "beyond the",
        "pharmacologic treatment?",
        "JOHN BACH: Well, first of all,",
        "every aspect of what myasthenia",
        "can cause,",
        "there are team members that",
        "address them.",
        "So, for example, there can be",
        "difficulty swallowing.",
        "There can be",
        "difficulty speaking.",
        "There are speech language",
        "pathologists who specialize",
        "specifically in helping people",
        "articulate better,",
        "and helping people",
        "swallow better.",
        "Compensatory actions that you",
        "could do to make",
        "swallowing safer.",
        "For example, very often, it's",
        "more difficult to swallow",
        "thin liquids.",
        "So we have something called",
        "thicket, which can make",
        "the liquids thicker,",
        "to make them easier to swallow,",
        "and so on.",
        "Muscle weakness.",
        "In general, any muscle that has",
        "greater than antigravity",
        "strength can be made stronger",
        "by exercise.",
        "But you also must rest",
        "those muscles so that they're",
        "not sore 2 days later",
        "from overdoing it.",
        "Because you can overdo exercise.",
        "And we have physical therapists",
        "that do that.",
        "We also have",
        "occupational therapists who have",
        "many, many appliances that can",
        "help people open jars, and reach",
        "for objects,",
        "and all sorts of things.",
        "So every aspect of the problems",
        "that can occur",
        "with any neuromuscular",
        "condition, there",
        "are team members",
        "in our neuromuscular clinic",
        "that we can send them to,",
        "to address them and help them",
        "compensate for them,",
        "to maximize their function",
        "within the impairment",
        "that they may have.",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: What I would add",
        "to that",
        "is that physical deconditioning,",
        "or muscle deconditioning,",
        "can occur",
        "with any chronic illness,",
        "including myasthenia gravis.",
        "And that's part of the treatment",
        "plan, is to address any",
        "physical/muscle conditioning",
        "after the autoimmune \"attack,\"",
        "quote, unquote, is squashed",
        "or addressed to get patients",
        "stronger and better.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: So, clearly,",
        "the questions have to be more",
        "than \"How are you feeling?",
        "How are you doing?\" which",
        "sometimes in primary care we do.",
        "But I also wanted to ask you,",
        "what do you think patients",
        "should be asking you?",
        "Because we've talked",
        "at a previous time about,",
        "how do they know a treatment",
        "is working?",
        "What's their expectation?",
        "So the question should go",
        "both ways.",
        "And we always like to give",
        "viewers, empower them",
        "with information.",
        "What should they ask you, Dr.",
        "Novak, at a visit?",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: Absolutely.",
        "I think what I would ask",
        "my patients that I see",
        "is to be engaged,",
        "to be involved,",
        "and to be curious about--",
        "JOHN WHYTE: How do they do that?",
        "Practically speaking.",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: Absolutely.",
        "So there's a lot of resources.",
        "Most certainly, the internet",
        "provides that opportunity.",
        "But patient advocacy groups,",
        "for instance, are a great source",
        "of information.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: And there are",
        "many in myasthenia.",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: Right.",
        "It's important to not just look",
        "to see what's online,",
        "but to get resources that are",
        "good resources,",
        "and not get misinformation.",
        "To be engaged in their care",
        "is important.",
        "There's tools out there,",
        "provided sometimes",
        "by patient advocacy",
        "groups and others, that can",
        "track symptoms.",
        "Some of these are applications",
        "that one can use",
        "on a smartphone, for instance,",
        "or other.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: I gave you",
        "the old-school diary type.",
        "But nowadays, it could",
        "be electronic.",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: Exactly.",
        "And people can keep things",
        "on pen and paper, for sure.",
        "But many patients do track",
        "their symptoms.",
        "And",
        "that's helpful",
        "in",
        "the patient-physician",
        "relationship in terms",
        "of understanding",
        "what are",
        "the unmet and unaddressed",
        "symptoms to the point",
        "of physical deconditioning",
        "that comes up,",
        "or other issues that might not",
        "necessarily be directly related",
        "to myasthenia gravis,",
        "but those other health issues",
        "that emerge that we do",
        "need to pay attention to as part",
        "of a health care team.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: What do you find",
        "are most on people's",
        "minds, going",
        "through this patient journey",
        "with myasthenia?",
        "Are there some common themes",
        "that they ask you, that they're",
        "most concerned about?",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: I think it really",
        "depends on where they are",
        "in their disease course.",
        "Are they just diagnosed today?",
        "Have they had the condition",
        "for a number of years?",
        "But common questions that come",
        "up is, can I work?",
        "Can I take care of my kids?",
        "Can I do the things that I need",
        "to do as part of daily living?",
        "Does having a diagnosis",
        "of myasthenia gravis,",
        "as the gravis implies, a very",
        "significant or serious illness?",
        "So these are top of mind",
        "for patients that come to see us",
        "in the office.",
        "And everyone is different.",
        "And their questions might be",
        "slightly different.",
        "But what I encourage patients",
        "to do is to write down",
        "their questions.",
        "So when they come",
        "to the appointment,",
        "we can address them as best",
        "we can.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: I want to talk",
        "about the role of caregivers,",
        "of spouses.",
        "And how they play into the",
        "care plan.",
        "So what's your counsel when you",
        "see patients-- and sometimes you",
        "might see them with their spouse",
        "or loved ones, or",
        "family members?",
        "How should they be involved?",
        "And how can they be involved?",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: I think,",
        "education is key.",
        "So not only educating",
        "the patient, but their family",
        "members, to understand",
        "the expectations about this",
        "being a fluctuating condition.",
        "So, involving them in the care",
        "plan, I think, is",
        "critically important.",
        "Because some patients might need",
        "help, especially when they're",
        "newly diagnosed,",
        "or have moderate to severe",
        "myasthenia gravis.",
        "And spouses or family might not",
        "necessarily understand that.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: And even",
        "with treatment, they still may",
        "need some support.",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: Yeah, education.",
        "I can say it three times,",
        "but I'll just say it once.",
        "Education about the condition,",
        "and the variability from one",
        "person to the next.",
        "Some people have called",
        "myasthenia gravis",
        "a snowflake disease.",
        "That's not something that",
        "I coined.",
        "And that everyone's condition",
        "might follow a slightly",
        "different pattern.",
        "And tailoring that",
        "to individuals in terms",
        "of our approach is important.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: What's the biggest",
        "misconception that you find you",
        "constantly have to talk",
        "to patients about?",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: I think",
        "that there is",
        "misinformation about what",
        "myasthenia gravis can cause",
        "in terms of the symptomatology.",
        "So some of my patients",
        "will say, \"Well, I have",
        "back pain.",
        "And that's my myasthenia gravis.",
        "Or I have difficulty with",
        "doing something.",
        "And that's my",
        "myasthenia gravis.\"",
        "So pain is not necessarily",
        "a symptom of myasthenia gravis,",
        "but it does come up a lot,",
        "to what we discussed earlier",
        "about addressing",
        "physical deconditioning",
        "and listening to patients,",
        "and teasing out what's what.",
        "One question that sometimes",
        "comes up is, patients might be",
        "well-controlled MG for a number",
        "of years.",
        "They develop shortness",
        "of breath.",
        "\"Oh, that must be my",
        "myasthenia gravis.\"",
        "But rather, it's",
        "another medical issue.",
        "So we've diagnosed other health",
        "issues, like heart failure",
        "or cardiac.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: Sure.",
        "And that can be",
        "totally unrelated.",
        "JOHN BACH: Or a combination",
        "of things.",
        "It could be a combination",
        "of things.",
        "I think the most dangerous",
        "misconception is the thought",
        "that, if you're too",
        "weak to breathe,",
        "you need an invasive",
        "airway tube.",
        "Because that causes pneumonia",
        "and other problems,",
        "and is potentially lethal.",
        "It's the most",
        "dangerous misconception.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: What is your message",
        "to viewers?",
        "RICHARD NOWAK:",
        "That autoimmune myasthenia",
        "gravis is most certainly",
        "a treatable condition.",
        "It has a range of severities",
        "from mild to severe.",
        "And we need to understand how",
        "an individual patient will do",
        "over time.",
        "Weakness and/or fatigue does not",
        "necessarily equal",
        "myasthenia gravis.",
        "Over the last several years,",
        "there's been more attention",
        "about autoimmune",
        "myasthenia gravis,",
        "likely driven by the fact",
        "that we have newer",
        "tailored treatments.",
        "But I think",
        "that any individual suffering",
        "with weakness or",
        "fatigue needs",
        "a comprehensive",
        "neurologic evaluation.",
        "And that weakness and fatigue",

        "So, for example, there can be",

        "There can be",

        "more difficult to swallow",
        "thin liquids.",
        "So we have something called",

        "In general, any muscle that has",

        "not sore 2 days later",
        "from overdoing it.",
        "Because you can overdo exercise.",

        "with any chronic illness,",

        "JOHN WHYTE: So, clearly,",
        "the questions have to be more",
        "than \"How are you feeling?",
        "How are you doing?\" which",
        "sometimes in primary care we do.",
        "But I also wanted to ask you,",
        "what do you think patients",
        "should be asking you?",
        "Because we've talked",
        "at a previous time about,",
        "how do they know a treatment",

        "What's their expectation?",
        "So the question should go",
        "both ways.",

        "viewers, empower them",
        "with information.",
        "What should they ask you, Dr.",
        "Novak, at a visit?",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: Absolutely.",
        "I think what I would ask",
        "my patients that I see",
        "is to be engaged,",
        "to be involved,",
        "and to be curious about--",
        "JOHN WHYTE: How do they do that?",
        "Practically speaking.",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: Absolutely.",
        "So there's a lot of resources.",
        "Most certainly, the internet",
        "provides that opportunity.",
        "But patient advocacy groups,",
        "for instance, are a great source",
        "of information.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: And there are",
        "many in myasthenia.",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: Right.",
        "It's important to not just look",
        "to see what's online,",

        "good resources,",
        "and not get misinformation.",
        "To be engaged in their care",
        "is important.",
        "There's tools out there,",

        "groups and others, that can",
        "track symptoms.",

        "on pen and paper, for sure.",
        "But many patients do track",

        "And their questions might be",
        "slightly different.",
        "But what I encourage patients",

        "their questions.",
        "So when they come",
        "to the appointment,",
        "we can address them as best",
        "we can.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: I want to talk",

        "of spouses.",
        "And how they play into the",
        "care plan.",

        "family members?",
        "How should they be involved?",
        "And how can they be involved?",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: I think,",
        "education is key.",
        "So not only educating",
        "the patient, but their family",
        "members, to understand",
        "the expectations about this",
        "being a fluctuating condition.",
        "So, involving them in the care",
        "plan, I think, is",
        "critically important.",
        "Because some patients might need",
        "help, especially when they're",
        "newly diagnosed,",
        "or have moderate to severe",
        "myasthenia gravis.",
        "And spouses or family might not",
        "necessarily understand that.",
        "JOHN WHYTE: And even",
        "with treatment, they still may",
        "need some support.",
        "RICHARD NOWAK: Yeah, education.",

        "Some people have called",
        "myasthenia gravis",
        "a snowflake disease.",
        "That's not something that",

        "myasthenia gravis can cause",
        "in terms of the symptomatology.",
        "So some of my patients",
        "will say, \"Well, I have",

        "Or I have difficulty with",
        "doing something.",

        "myasthenia gravis.\"",
        "So pain is not necessarily",
        "a symptom of myasthenia gravis,",
        "but it does come up a lot,",

        "and teasing out what's what.",
