        "It shoves me with shame and drowns me in guilt. Am I the things it tells me? Am I lazy and unlovable? A failure? Broken and incapable?",
        "I wish I had a better answer to how I love myself through a depressive episode, but the truth is, I don’t. Self-compassion is one of the hardest things for me to practice, especially in the midst of a depression that crumbles my self-esteem and guilt-trips me into believing things that aren’t true. Loving myself gets pushed to the back corner of my mind, and I can’t fathom extending grace to myself. To others? Always. But I set myself to a higher, impossible standard, an expectation I will never actually reach. Somewhere so high in the sky, I can’t even see it."
