That -- along with exercise and a healthy diet -- would help you to move better and to keep or slow your condition from worsening. AS is not the same as non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nrAxSpA). But experts think the conditions sometimes can be two stages of the same disease. So you’ll probably get the same treatment for both."

Your doctor may prescribe: Methotrexate (Otrexup , Rasuvo , Rheumatrex , Trexall ) Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine ) You can take sulfasalazine as a pill. You may notice side effects, including headaches, stomach bloating, nausea, and mouth ulcers. It’s rare, but you could have problems with your bone marrow. That’s why your doctor may test your blood when you’re on sulfasalazine. Methotrexate comes as a pill or as a shot you give yourself. You’ll need to take it together with folic acid to help prevent mouth sores, nausea, and other side effects. Methotrexate is a powerful drug. Your doctor will test your blood and keep an eye on your liver. You shouldn’t take methotrexate if you’re pregnant. JAK inhibitors are a newer addition of DMARDs to ankylosing spondylitis treatment. Two JAK inhibitors are approved : Tofacitinib (Xeljanz, Xeljanz-XR) Upadacitinib (Rinvoq)"
