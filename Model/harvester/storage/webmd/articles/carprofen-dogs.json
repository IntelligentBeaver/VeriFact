        "Carprofen (brand names: Belprofen, Carprieve, Carprodyl, Carprovet, Levafen, Movodyl, Novox, Ostifen, Quellin, Rimadyl, Rovera, Truprofen, Vetprofen) is a medicine used in dogs for pain and inflammation (swelling) relief of muscles and bones. It’s classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).",
        "Carprofen is an antipyretic, meaning it can prevent or reduce fevers.",
        "Carprofen is used for pain and inflammation from osteoarthritis in dogs. This treatment can be short-term or long-term since it’s tolerated well by most dogs.  Carprofen is also for pain control after surgery in dogs.",
        "Carprofen is one of the safest NSAIDs available for dogs. It has fewer side effects than steroids . It has a lower chance of side effects for dogs than if they take human NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen. It’s quick-acting, with pain relief occurring in 1 to 3 hours when given by mouth.",
        "Carprofen is also prescribed extra-label or off-label in veterinary medicine for other animals, including cats, horses, cattle, ferrets, rabbits, small mammals, and reptiles. While there’s evidence it’s safe and effective for them, the use is controversial, especially in cats. Carprofen is only FDA-approved for use in dogs.",
        "Carprofen is available as a prescription medication from your veterinarian or from a pharmacy with a veterinary prescription."
