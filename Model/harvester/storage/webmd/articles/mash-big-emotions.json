It can take weeks or months to get a firm diagnosis, such as stage II MASH with liver inflammation, or stage III MASH with fibrosis (liver scarring). You may need to have many tests and scans and adopt a new lifestyle. Talking about your diagnosis can feel uncomfortable. These experiences and the difficult emotions involved are normal for people with MASH.",
