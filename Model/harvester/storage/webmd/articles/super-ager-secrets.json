        "April 19, 2017 -- Will you dance at your great-grandchild’s wedding? Most of us won’t be healthy enough to cut a rug into our 90s. But some people are not only dancing, but cooking, driving, and volunteering at an age when they’re supposed to be feeble, addled by dementia , or both. Researchers, with an eye to an ever-aging population, are trying to figure out why. Scientists are studying “super agers” -- 90-somethings who are living without significant physical or memory problems -- to zero in on the kinds of healthy habits that may keep us all living longer and better. With life expectancy on the rise -- the 85-plus population in the U.S. is expected to triple to 14.6 million by 2040 -- researchers want to figure out how we can increase our health span, or the amount of time we’ll live in good health. “The number of people living after age 90 is going to be huge. We need to know very fast how we can help these people to live very healthy,” says Oscar Lopez, MD, director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh."

That means we can affect the majority of our aging -- about 70%-80% -- through lifestyle. So exactly which habits matter the most? While there’s no blueprint, studies can offer some clues. It’s no surprise that eating healthy and exercise are likely to have a role in how well we age. But they are far from the only things involved, and they may not even be the most important ones.

Other people have plaques and tangles in their brains often found with the disease yet have no problems with memory. Kawas suggests a healthy diet and physical activity may create “resilience” in people who might have the genetic potential to develop Alzheimer’s, but don’t. But diet is hard to study, she says. Of all the factors, education seems to be the strongest one for maintaining brain health, says Kawas. “The higher your education level, the likelier you are to maintain normal cognition in the face of Alzheimer’s disease pathology,” says Kawas, a neurobiology professor at UCI’s School of Medicine. “That’s an environmental thing. Diet and exercise could be one of them, but they’re not the whole story.”"

Sofiya Milman, MD, is part of a research team at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York that has been studying 90- and 100-year olds. They are all Ashkenazi Jews, descended from Eastern European Jews, and their children. The Longevity Genes Project, which started with 500 participants ages 95 to 112, found a strong connection between long life and protective genes. Even with lifestyle taken into account, their genes outweighed bad habits. The centenarians in the study didn’t watch their weight or their diet. “There were very few vegetarians in the group or people who avoided salt or meat throughout their lives,” she says. The study has branched into another that is following people in their mid-60s who have a parent at least 100 years old. Researchers want to see how well the children with 100-year-old parents age vs. people with non-centenarian parents. So far, they are aging well, Milman says."

An 80-year-old today has less of a chance of developing Alzheimer’s than one did 30 years ago. Because doctors understand how to manage high blood pressure , the risk of stroke has also declined, Kawas says. Yet, whatever insights science and sociology have provided about longevity, nobody owns the recipe for putting off mortality a bit longer."
