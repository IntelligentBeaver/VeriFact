        "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer that starts in your bone marrow, which is the soft inner part of your bones where all your blood cells are made. AML usually begins in cells that turn into white blood cells but can also start in other blood-forming cells. When bone marrow cells don't grow properly, immature cells called blasts build up in your bone marrow and spill into your blood.",

        "AML is rare; only about 1% of all cancers are AML. It usually affects people who are older than 45 years, and it's more common in men and people assigned male at birth.",
        "There are several types of AML depending on the kind of gene mutations you have, how developed the leukemia cells are when you're diagnosed, and how different they are from normal cells. For instance, one type is called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which occurs when genes from chromosomes 15 and 17 switch places, creating an abnormal gene. This gene prevents a type of white blood cell called a promyelocyte from fully developing. People with APL respond better to treatment than people with other types of AML."

It usually starts in a precursor cell to one type of white blood cell. Many of the symptoms of AML are nonspecific, which means they can be caused by several different conditions. These symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, easy bruising, and bleeding. Treatment is usually with a high-dose combination chemotherapy regimen, which may also include targeted therapy. Your cancer care team will help you choose the right treatment based on your specific situation."

In many cases, your doctor will only recommend testing for an allogeneic stem cell transplant when you've been treated for AML and it has come back within 12 months. Unfortunately, not everyone is a candidate for stem cell transplant. It's a very intensive treatment that you must be healthy enough to undergo, and you must also have a compatible donor.",
