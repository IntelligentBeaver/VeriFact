        "It’s not really the fish oil that helps – it’s the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids that are in fish oil. Your body can’t make omega-3s, so you need to get them from food or supplements. Known as EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), they’re found in fish, seafood, and some algae. They’re essential to maintaining a healthy brain, heart, and immune system .",
        "In addition to EPA and DHA, there’s another type of omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ). This omega-3 is found in plant-based foods like flaxseed. Although it gets changed into EPA and DHA in the brain, it’s not as efficient as if you actually ate fish or took a fish oil supplement."

        "Our brains use omega-3s in the hippocampus, the memory center of the brain. If you are low in omega-3 fatty acids, it may be harder to make new memories. Some research has suggested that kids who have low levels of omega-3s have poorer reading and memory and more behavior problems. For example, a 2012 study published in the medical journal PLOS One found that kids given fish oil supplements rich in omega-3 fatty acids for 4 months showed significant improvements in reading skills and behavior. But a follow-up study found that the fish oil supplements didn’t improve reading ability, working memory, or behaviors. It’s important to note that the kids in these studies didn’t have ADHD.",
