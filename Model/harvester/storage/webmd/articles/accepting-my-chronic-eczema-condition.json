I’m still on the same road, but I’m further ahead from where I began my eczema journey. I’ve experienced specific stages within my chronic eczema journey that have led to my acceptance of my condition.",

        "Prior to knowing I had eczema, I was confused about my skin. I’d go through a flare-up and have no idea why it began or if it would end. And I definitely didn’t know how to control my flare-ups. I didn’t even know the word “flare-up,” for crying out loud! In this first stage, before my eczema was diagnosed, my skin situation was a complete mystery to me.",

I saw a dermatologist that told me I was dealing with eczema and also tested me for skin allergies . My first discovery happened in my mid-20s when I found out I had a fragrance skin allergy. This was a big deal, because my skin condition stopped being a mystery and I finally had information that could help me."

Although the discovery phase is exciting for me each time, it always leads to my realizing I have new things I must now avoid, moving forward. I see others around me consuming things freely, and it frustrates me. “Why must I be this ridiculous snowflake?” I ask myself. The older I get, the shorter this stage gets for me, I’ve noticed. I’d rather not feel self-pity and instead do something about it. Though, the frustration stage still often leads me to the following stage. …",

        "“Nah, I’m OK! I can’t actually be allergic to sandals,” I told myself, even though they literally caused the tops of my feet to flare up terribly -- a spot that had always been clear of eczema. The denial stage is expensive and reckless. It’s cost me many expensive makeups, creams, fuzzy sweaters, scarves, necklaces, earrings … the list goes on and on. My skin allergies range from dust mites to metals, fragrance, and other ingredients that are in common products. I’ve denied my allergies a few times -- as if denying my impending eczema reaction will stop it from occurring. It doesn’t -- I only hurt myself during the denial phase."

I disregard my allergies and make matters worse with my skin, until I stop my nonsense and instead use my skin allergy knowledge to control my eczema. Having improved skin makes me feel and look better, which is what matters the most. This realization and skin success lead me to accept my condition. I have chronic eczema that is triggered by a variety of skin allergies, and it can worsen with stress. It seems so simple, yet I go through these phases every time something new happens with my skin."
