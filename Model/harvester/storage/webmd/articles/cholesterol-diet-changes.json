        "Having a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack or stroke , or getting diagnosed with heart disease can be overwhelming. You may suddenly have to take new medications, modify your diet, and make other changes. But following the treatment recommended by your doctors could save your life. \"Making lifestyle and diet changes is extremely important because after you've had a cardiovascular event, your chance of having another one is higher,\" says Rubí Mendoza Castro, a registered and licensed dietitian and nutritionist in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. After some cardiovascular events, sometimes there are risk factors that people can no longer control, like physical damage to blood vessels. The damage caused raises the chances of having another cardiovascular event. \"The highest risk is during the first year,\" says Mendoza Castro. But even if you've had a cardiovascular event, there's a lot you can do so it won't happen again. And now is the time to act to prevent it."

        "Our bodies need sodium for our organs to work properly. But too much sodium, usually from eating too much table salt, can harm your heart. When you eat too much salt, the level of sodium in your blood rises. This pulls water into the blood vessels, which increases the amount of blood flowing through them as well as your blood pressure. That makes the heart work harder to pump blood throughout the body. If the amount of sodium in the blood isn't kept under control, over time, it can stretch or damage vessel walls and speed up plaque buildup, which can affect blood flow. According to the American Heart Association, people in the U.S. generally eat about 3,400 milligrams of sodium per day. That's 50% more than the recommended amount. A study published by the organization shows that cutting sodium to 1,500 milligrams per day could lower blood pressure by 25.6%. Fortunately, many Latin dishes already use healthy ingredients that allow you to add flavor without relying too much on table salt. \"Use traditional herbs and spices like garlic , oregano , achiote, and cilantro to cut salt,\" suggests Mendoza Castro."

When you eat too much salt, the level of sodium in your blood rises. This pulls water into the blood vessels, which increases the amount of blood flowing through them as well as your blood pressure. That makes the heart work harder to pump blood throughout the body. If the amount of sodium in the blood isn't kept under control, over time, it can stretch or damage vessel walls and speed up plaque buildup, which can affect blood flow. According to the American Heart Association, people in the U.S. generally eat about 3,400 milligrams of sodium per day. That's 50% more than the recommended amount. A study published by the organization shows that cutting sodium to 1,500 milligrams per day could lower blood pressure by 25.6%. Fortunately, many Latin dishes already use healthy ingredients that allow you to add flavor without relying too much on table salt. \"Use traditional herbs and spices like garlic , oregano , achiote, and cilantro to cut salt,\" suggests Mendoza Castro.",
