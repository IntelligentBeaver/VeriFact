        "According to the Cleveland Clinic, “Published studies show that a large number of individuals with MS (50% to 70%) experience at least one fall over a 6-month period, and 30% to 50% of those who fall experience recurrent falls.”",
        "Doctors define falling as any unintentional change in position that leaves a person on the ground. Falls can be gentle, like sliding off a low chair onto a carpeted floor, or more traumatic, like tripping over a curb and banging your head on the pavement. They are a major cause of hospitalization in people with MS.",
        "The MS Society says falls damage lives in two ways. We can be physically injured, from bumps and bruises up to broken bones. Fear of falling also cripples people. It can lead to restricting our activities, which can lead to social isolation. Being afraid to stand may cut into our exercise, making us weaker in a vicious cycle.",
        "I fell about five years ago and chipped my pelvis. It really hurt, and I was stuck in bed for almost a week. Studies show that 40% to 50% of people with MS are injured in falls at some point in their lives. The risk of fracture from falls increases as bones get weaker (called osteoporosis). Weak bones commonly happen to people with decreased mobility."
