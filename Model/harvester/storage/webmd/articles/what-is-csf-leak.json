        "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a type of clear liquid that surrounds, protects, and cushions your brain and spinal cord from possible injuries. The fluid is held in place by the dura mater, a dense tissue that sits directly under the skull and makes up the outermost layer of the brain.",
        "A CSF leak may occur if there’s a tear or a hole in the dura mater. There are two types of CSF leaks. A cranial CSF leak happens when the fluid leaks from the brain, often due to things such as a skull fracture. If the leak occurs at any point along the spinal cord, it’s called a spinal CSF leak.",
        "A leak may cause the brain to sag, which can lead to headaches . CSF leaks may also lower pressure within the skull, which could cause a condition called intracranial hypotension . If it persists, it can pull the brain down and tear bridging veins, causing a subdural hematoma.",
