        "The wax keeps even tinted lip balms from having the shine of a lip gloss or the color intensity of a lipstick.",

        "Some lip balms contain sun protection as high as SPF 30 and antioxidants such as coenzyme Q10. Other common ingredients are vitamins C and E, which neutralize free radicals that damage the skin's collagen and elastin."
