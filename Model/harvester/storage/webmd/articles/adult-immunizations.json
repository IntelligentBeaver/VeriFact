        "Diphtheria and tetanus . Diphtheria can cause breathing problems , paralysis, and heart failure . Tetanus can cause severe and dangerous stiffening of the muscles throughout the body. The CDC recommends that all adults have a diphtheria/tetanus booster shot every ten years. \"Diphtheria is still a rare disease these days, but it's most common in people over 65,\" says Wasserman. \"Continued vaccinations are important.\"",
        "Influenza ( Flu ) vaccine. The CDC recommends that all people 50 and over get the flu vaccine annually, but it's also a good idea for adults of any age. While you may think of the flu as just an annoyance, it can be a serious, even fatal, illness. The CDC estimates that about 36,000 people in the U.S. die from the flu every year. While the injected vaccine is standard, Wasserman is impressed with the more recent inhaled flu vaccine. \"It seems to work even better than the injected vaccine and causes fewer side effects,\" he says.",
        "Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A is spread by contact with contaminated food or fluids and can cause serious liver disease. The CDC recommends vaccinations for adults who use injected street drugs, men who have sex with men, and people with liver disease and other illnesses. Most cases of hepatitis A are mild but some result in severe illness, requiring an emergency liver transplant . \"The hepatitis A vaccine protects against a rare but potentially devastating illness,\" says Wasserman.",
