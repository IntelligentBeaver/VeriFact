        "When you have HIV/AIDS, you’re at higher risk of infections your body would normally be able to fight off. They can also be more severe, more frequent, or both. These infections are called opportunistic infections .",
        "The risks are higher if you have very low levels of CD4 T cells. These are white blood cells that fight infection. The more severe your HIV infection, the lower your CD4 levels get, and the weaker your immune response to invaders. If your CD4 cells drop below 200, that means your HIV infection has progressed to the most severe phase called AIDS.",
        "Fortunately, with the rise of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV in the 1990s, opportunistic infections have gone down significantly. ART does a very good job of getting your CD4 levels back up. But some people may not respond well to ART and need additional protection from infection. And some germs and viruses find ways to cause infection even when you have high CD4 counts."
