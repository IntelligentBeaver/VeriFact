        "Ibrance is a type of medicine called a kinase inhibitor. Kinases are enzymes in the body that can send and receive signals to help your cells do important functions. Ibrance blocks the action of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). Kinases CDK4 and CDK6 send signals to help cancer cells to grow and multiply. Ibrance blocks the activity of CDK4 and CDK6 to help stop cancer cells from growing and multiplying and to make tumors shrink in size."

        "The FDA approved Ibrance for HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body based on clinical trials that looked at how effective Ibrance was when combined with another medicine for certain people.",
        "In the PALOMA-2 clinical trial, Ibrance was combined with letrozole, which is a type of medicine called an aromatase inhibitor and works to reduce the amount of estrogen in the body. People who were postmenopausal and had HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer that had spread in the body and had not previously received a whole-body treatment such as chemotherapy since the cancer had spread in their body took either Ibrance with letrozole or a placebo with letrozole.  A placebo is used in clinical trials as a control so that the potential benefit of a medicine in a group of people can be compared in a similar group of people who did not receive a medicine.",

They were followed to see how long it took for their breast cancer to progress, meaning that the cancer grew or spread. This measurement is called progression-free survival. The median progression-free survival was 24.8 months for Ibrance plus letrozole, compared to 14.5 months for the placebo plus letrozole. This means that half of the people who took Ibrance did not have their cancer progress for at least 24.8 months, compared to 14.5 months for people who took the placebo.",

People who took Ibrance plus letrozole in the study had a median overall survival of 53.8 months, while people who took a placebo plus letrozole had a median overall survival of 49.8 months.

People who had HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer that had spread in the body after or while receiving hormone therapy took either Ibrance with fulvestrant or a placebo with fulvestrant.",
        "The clinical trial included 521 people, with 347 people taking Ibrance. About 74% of the people in this trial were White, 20% were Asian, and 6% were classified as Black or other. The median progression-free survival was 9.5 months for Ibrance plus fulvestrant, compared to 4.6 months for the placebo plus fulvestrant. This means that half of the people who took Ibrance did not have their cancer progress for at least 9.5 months, compared to 4.6 months in people who took the placebo.",

People who took Ibrance plus fulvestrant in the study had a median overall survival of 34.9 months, while people who took a placebo plus fulvestrant had a median overall survival of 28 months. This means that half of the people who took Ibrance survived for at least 34.9 months, compared to 28 months for the people who took the placebo."
