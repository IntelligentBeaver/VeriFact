        "Tendonitis is pain in or around a tendon, which is a band of strong tissue that connects a muscle to a bone. Tendons bend, stretch, and twist to help joints and muscles move. They can become inflamed and painful due to strain, overuse, or injury, resulting in tendonitis.",
        "You may hear your doctor call tendonitis by another term, overuse tendinopathy. Some common examples of overuse injuries that affect the tendons include Achilles tendinopathy of the ankle, rotator cuff tendonitis of the shoulder, and lateral epicondylitis, better known as tennis elbow.",
        "Tendonitis can be very painful, and the discomfort can get stronger if you keep using the joint and damage to the tendon worsens. Tendonitis usually heals in about 2 to 4 weeks, but chronic tendontis can take more than 6 weeks, often because the patient doesn't give the tendon time to heal. If you have chronic tendonitis, you may not be able to move a joint fully due to scarring or because the sheath of tissue surrounding the tendon has narrowed.",

Then again, any activity that requires the same movements over and over again can cause this painful problem.
