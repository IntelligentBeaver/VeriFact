        "When you live with PMR, getting out of bed or combing your hair may feel like a challenge some days. And as a result, you might skip taking care of yourself, be unable to go to work, or skip activities and social events that you usually enjoy. Corticosteroids are often used to treat PMR. They can lessen your symptoms by tamping down your immune system. While helpful, this kind of medication often causes side effects like weight gain and high blood pressure. Corticosteroids are also known for causing: Mood swings Trouble with memory and focus Insomnia (trouble sleeping) Anxiety Depression Over time, dealing with the pain of PMR as well as the side effects of corticosteroids can start to take a toll on your mental health."
