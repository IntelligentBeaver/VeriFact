        "Alyftrek (vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor) is a combination medicine approved by the FDA in 2024. Alyftrek is approved to treat people ages 6 and older who have the genetic condition called cystic fibrosis . Cystic fibrosis happens because of a change in a gene on chromosome 7. This gene is responsible for making a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which helps control the movement of salt and water in the body. Cystic fibrosis changes the way chloride (salt) moves through the cells of your body. This causes the mucus (which should be thin and slippery) in various organs to become thick and sticky, which can lead to infections, inflammation, problems with your organs, and electrolyte imbalances. Symptoms of cystic fibrosis can appear at any age from infancy to adulthood."

        "Alyftrek is a type of medicine called a CFTR modulator. Alyftrek is designed to help make the broken CFTR protein in people with cystic fibrosis work better. Since different genetic mutations can cause different types of problems with the protein, the medicines available today only work for people with certain mutations. Alyftrek is approved for people who have at least one F508del mutation or another responsive mutation in the CFTR gene. Alyftrek contains three active ingredients (vanzacaftor, tezacaftor, and deutivacaftor) that work together to help the CFTR protein work better. Vanzacaftor and tezacaftor help the CFTR protein fold correctly and move to the cell surface, while deutivacaftor increases CFTR activity to lower the buildup of mucus. By helping CFTR work better, Alyftrek helps thin mucus in the lungs and other organs, making it easier to clear and reducing complications of cystic fibrosis."

These studies compared Alyftrek to another standard treatment for cystic fibrosis (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor). People in the studies first received elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor for four weeks, then were assigned to continue this treatment or switch to Alyftrek for 52 weeks. Trial VX20-121-102 included 398 people with F508del-minimal function genotypes. The median (middle) age was 31 and 41% of people were female; most people in the study were White (97%), while 1% were Black or African American, and <1% were Asian. Trial VX20-121-103 included 573 people with F508del-F508del, F508del-residual function, F508del-gating, or other responsive mutations. The median age was 33.1 and 49% of people in the study were female.
