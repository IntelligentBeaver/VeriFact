There's good evidence that blond psyllium husk -- common in fiber supplements -- can lower “bad” LDL cholesterol . It can also raise the “good” kind, HDL. Other fiber supplements include methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil. If you take a fiber supplement, increase the amount you take slowly. This can help prevent gas and cramping. It’s also important to drink enough liquids when you increase your fiber intake.",
