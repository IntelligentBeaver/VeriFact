If they ignore you a third time, don't pick them up and carry them to time-out. Attention, even negative attention, may reinforce the behavior . Instead, give them a consequence that's meaningful to them, such as no video games for the rest of the day. Enforce this calmly, and don't talk about it further.",

For example, if you put your child in time-out for hitting their sister, you should have been praising them earlier for playing well with their sister. And you should praise them after time-out for having a good attitude."
