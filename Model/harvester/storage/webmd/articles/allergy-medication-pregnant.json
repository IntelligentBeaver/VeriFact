        "If you plan to get pregnant or you’re already expecting, talk to your doctor about all the medicines you take, including those that don’t need a prescription. Many allergy drugs may be fine to keep taking during pregnancy , but have the discussion so you can have peace of mind.",
        "Oral antihistamines , like cetirizine ( Zyrtec ), chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ), fexofenadine ( Allegra ), and loratadine ( Claritin ) seem to be safe. So does cromolyn sodium ( Nasalcrom ) nasal spray and the steroid nasal spray Rhinocort, but ask your doctor before using. An advantage to sprays is that the drug is focused only in your nose. It doesn't travel throughout your body.",
