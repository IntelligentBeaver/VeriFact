        "Heart failure is when your heart can't pump enough blood to provide your body with the blood and oxygen it needs. If you have this condition, it doesn't mean your heart stops working. It means your heart doesn't work as efficiently as usual. Blood moves through your heart and body at a slower rate, and pressure in your heart raises.",
        "The condition affects nearly 7 million Americans. About 1 in 4 people will get diagnosed with it in their lifetime. Heart failure is the main reason why people older than 65 go to the hospital.",
