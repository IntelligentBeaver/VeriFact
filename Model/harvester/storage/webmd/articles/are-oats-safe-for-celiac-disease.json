        "From bowls of oatmeal and overnight oats to granola bars and oat milk lattes, oats are a consistently popular grain in the U.S. that many people enjoy without question. However, if you have celiac disease, deciding whether to eat oats can be more complicated.",
        "The good news is that, unlike wheat, barley, and rye, oats do not contain gluten and can be a delicious and nutritious part of a gluten-free diet, which is essential for managing celiac disease. However, the bad news is that not all oats are strictly gluten-free, and some sources may be unsafe for those with celiac disease.",
        "There are two major issues surrounding oats and gluten exposure. The first issue starts all the way at the farming level: Commercial oats commonly get grown alongside wheat or in former wheat fields, and may be processed (i.e. moved, stored, and milled) using the same equipment as the gluten-containing grains. As a result, oats become highly vulnerable to gluten cross-contamination throughout production, and manufacturers typically do not test gluten levels in their oats."

        "The second issue with oats involves labeling. Since oats are a naturally gluten-free grain, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows oat-based products made without any other gluten-containing ingredients to carry a “gluten-free” label on the package. However, this labeling does not require testing for the trace amounts of gluten that may be picked up in processing, which can be harmful for people with celiac disease. A conventional bag of granola, oatmeal raisin cookie, or carton of oat milk simply labeled “gluten free” can still pose a health risk for those with celiac disease.",
        "Fortunately, some changes have been made in the oat supply chain to benefit the gluten intolerant. An increasing number of commercial oat manufacturers are taking measures to test and sort oats for gluten contamination and use dedicated gluten-free facilities. This has resulted in a variety of oat-based products that are safe for celiac disease. These products are specifically labeled with “gluten-free oats” on the ingredient list and include some of the top oatmeal, granola, and oat milk brands. If the product simply lists “oats,” it may also be safe for celiac disease if it carries the certified gluten-free logo, states testing was done with an ELISA gluten assay, or follows the Gluten Intolerance Group’s “Purity Protocol.”"
