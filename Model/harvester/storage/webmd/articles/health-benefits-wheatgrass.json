        "Wheatgrass is the common name for the shoots of the wheat plant, Triticum aestivum . It's harvested early in its development, typically 7-10 days after planting, for use as a dietary supplement.",
        "Many people drink a 1-2 oz shot of wheatgrass on its own or add it to their favorite smoothie recipe or juice. (Photo credit: Elena Moskalenko/Dreamstime)",
        "About 70% of each sprout is made up of chlorophyll, which gives wheatgrass its bright green color. Chlorophyll is the green pigment that plants use to make food during photosynthesis. The structure of chlorophyll is similar to that of hemoglobin, the protein in your blood that carries oxygen to your tissues. So, it's sometimes also called “green blood.”",
        "Fans of wheatgrass love it because it has such a high level of chlorophyll, which is an antioxidant that may have some health benefits. They also love it because it has enzymes, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, alkaloids, and tannins that may also have health benefits. Some people believe that wheatgrass can boost the immune system, kill harmful germs, and remove toxins from the body.",
        "Wheatgrass is used in Ayurveda to treat high acid levels, inflammation in the colon, poor kidney function, and wounds. Ayurveda is a natural system of medicine that originated in India over 3,000 years ago, and its practitioners say that lifestyle changes and natural therapies can help balance your body, mind, spirit, and environment. Wheatgrass is also used in folk medicine to treat colds, coughs, fevers, gout , infections, joint pain, chronic skin disorders, constipation, and swelling of the throat and mouth.",

Myelotoxicity is when chemotherapy medicines lower the ability of your bone marrow to make cells, such as white blood cells and platelets.
