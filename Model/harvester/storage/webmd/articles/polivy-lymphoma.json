        "Polivy works by targeting a certain type of white blood cell in your body, called a B cell. Polivy targets B cells that have become cancerous, but it may affect healthy B cells in your body too. Polivy is made up of two parts: an antibody and an anti-cancer medicine. The antibody attaches to a protein on the B cell called CD79b, and then the anti-cancer medicine enters the B cell. The anti-cancer medicine stops the lymphoma cells from growing and causes them to die."

People in this study got Polivy plus R-CHP or another combination of chemotherapy plus rituximab called R-CHOP. This study looked at progression-free survival (PFS) which measured how long people lived without their lymphoma growing (progressing) or coming back. There were 879 people in this trial, and they were divided evenly between the two groups. The median age was 65 years (range 19 to 80 years), and 54% were male. Fifty-four percent of people in this study were White, 19% were Asian, 1.8% were Black or African American, and 6% were Hispanic or Latino. At two years, the PFS rate was 6.5% higher in the Polivy group, at 76.7%, versus 70.2% in the R-CHOP group. This means that more people in the Polivy group were alive without disease progression at two years than in the R-CHOP group. The risk of death or lymphoma progression or relapse was reduced by 27% in the people who got Polivy. This means that the people who got Polivy had a 27% lower chance of dying than those not getting Polivy.",

People in this study got either Polivy plus bendamustine and rituximab (BR) or BR alone. This study looked at complete response (CR). CR means that after treatment, there are no signs of cancer. This study also looked at how long people had a response to treatment (DOR) and best overall response, which measures how many people had either a CR or partial response (PR) to therapy. There were 80 people in this study, and half were in each group. The median age was 69 years (range: 30-86 years), and 66% were male. Seventy-one percent were White, 4% were Black or African American, 13% were Asian, 1% were American Indian or Alaska Native, and the rest were \"Unknown.\" People who got Polivy-BR had a CR of 40%, versus 18% for people who got BR. This means that at the end of the trial, a higher percentage of patients who received Polivy showed no signs of cancer, compared to those who did not receive Polivy. Of the people who had a response in the Polivy group, 64% had a response that lasted six months and 48% had a response that lasted 12 months."
