        "By Joan Kathryn, as told to Keri Wiginton I’m 79 now, and my doctor diagnosed me with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in 2008. Over the past 15 years, I’ve developed wet AMD in my left eye and geographic atrophy (GA) in both eyes. I don’t like to call attention to myself, and people often don’t realize I have vision issues. But I have blank spots that make it harder to recognize faraway faces, read fine print, or find small objects. GA causes vision loss slowly, and I’ve learned to adapt over the years. But don’t get me wrong, AMD can be aggravating. For example, I can’t see my granddaughter’s facial expressions in a play, even when I can spot her on stage."

Because how many times can you ask: Was that my grandson that made the basket? And I do pick up on body language a lot more. For instance, I can typically tell my son apart from the other men in his adult soccer league based on his movements alone. But some social situations still feel awkward.

        "I recently said I’m visually impaired for the first time. It came up because my husband and I were flying across the country, and I’d somehow downloaded the wrong boarding pass to my phone. The mobile version had my husband’s name, but I hadn’t noticed the error because of the small print. They wouldn’t let me on the plane without my ticket. I felt panicked when I looked behind me at the long line of people waiting to board. I didn’t want to fumble around to find my glasses, and I didn’t know how to look for another boarding pass on my phone. And so, I asked the person at the desk to print out physical copies of my tickets: one for that flight and another for a connecting flight. But when I rushed back to the gate, I couldn’t tell which ticket was for which flight. That’s when I said it! And once I let the attendant know about my vision impairment, she immediately became attentive and helpful. I was surprised at how fast she changed her attitude but felt reassured by the experience."
