To avoid the Part D late enrollment penalty, your drug coverage now through an employer-based health plan must be as good as Medicare's or better. Your employer plan must tell you each year if your plan is “creditable,” which means it provides coverage at least as good as Part D. After insurance from an employer ends, you must sign up for Part B within 8 months and for Part D within 63 days. Keep in mind that an insurance policy from an employer with fewer than 20 employees works differently with Medicare. If you work for a company of that size, you should sign up for Medicare when you are first eligible. You will not incur penalties if you don't, but without Medicare Part B coverage, you could be without coverage for outpatient services.  If you have retiree health insurance through your or your spouse’s former employer, you likely still want to sign up for Medicare. Many retiree health plans act as a “wrap-around” covering the gaps in Medicare coverage. Ask your Human Resources department for assistance.",
        "Sign up for Medigap early. Medigap is private insurance you buy to help pay for additional Medicare costs. If you need a Medigap plan, you should buy it within 6 months of getting Medicare Part B. During that period, you're guaranteed to get any Medigap plan that is available in your state. But if you try to buy it after those 6 months, the insurance company can charge you a higher price or turn you down altogether."
