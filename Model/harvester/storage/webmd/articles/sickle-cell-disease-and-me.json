        "My name is Constance, and I was born with sickle cell disease. On October 30, 2012, I was cured of sickle cell disease via the Stride-HCT bone marrow transplant. As you read about my experience with sickle cell disease, you’ll learn more about how this disease impacts people like me. I hope that as you read my articles, you will gain a better understanding of what it is like to live with a chronic disease that causes you chronic pain and is invisible to the naked eye but as clear as day under a microscope.",
        "I want to give you a little backstory on the disease and what triggers us. Sickle cell disease is an inherited, genetic blood disorder that affects the red blood cells’ ability to carry oxygen throughout the entire body. The deformed cells, or sickle cells, have trouble moving oxygen throughout the body because of their shape and often get stuck. Every place where the cells get stuck causes pain. When you are in pain with sickle cell, you call it a pain crisis, or just crisis. The pain varies in location, intensity, frequency, type, and so on. Every single person who is born with sickle cell disease is called a sickle cell soldier or a sickle cell warrior."
