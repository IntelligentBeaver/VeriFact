You can also get it in the form of iodized salt, which is table salt with a tiny amount of iodine added to it. In the U.S., iodized salt has been for sale in stores since the early 1900s. At that time, many people in parts of the U.S. weren't getting enough iodine in their diets. That's no longer an issue, largely because of the widespread use of iodized salt.",
