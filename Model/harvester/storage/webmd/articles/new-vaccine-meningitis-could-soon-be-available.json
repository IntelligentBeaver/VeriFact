        "Oct. 26, 2023 – A new meningococcal vaccine that better protects against the rare but potentially deadly disease will soon be available.",
        "Vaccines are already available that protect against the forms of bacteria that can lead to meningitis, but full protection requires four or five shots typically given at various points from 11 to 18 years of age. The new “pentavalent” version protects against all five types of bacteria that cause most cases, and is completed in only two shots.",
        "Meningococcal disease is caused by various types of a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis that can be spread via saliva. Many people carry the bacteria in the back of their nose or throat without being ill, but sometimes it invades the body and can cause serious illness.",
        "Sickened people may have brain swelling called meningitis or bloodstream infections. In rare cases, people die within 24 hours or survive with long-term disabilities. Quick treatment can be life-saving, but the symptoms, like fever and a stiff neck, mimic flu or COVID-19 and sometimes result in less urgency for seeking medical attention. Even with timely antibiotic treatment, 10 to 15 out of 100 people die, and 1 in 5 survivors are disabled, according to the CDC ."
