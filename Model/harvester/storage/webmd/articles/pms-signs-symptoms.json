Warren recommends taking the medication three times a day for the three to five days before the period starts to reduce swelling and prevent pain. Continue the medication during your period as needed.",

This disorder is characterized by severe mood and behavioral symptoms such as depression , irritability, fatigue and disturbed sleep, during the two weeks prior to a woman's period. Symptoms are greatly reduced with the onset of the period. While such drug therapy acts primarily on psychological symptoms, \"the fact is, sometimes when women feel better psychologically, the physical symptoms don't seem to bother them,\" Spinelli says.",
