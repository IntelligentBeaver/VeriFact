Things to know about CPAP: It may be uncomfortable. Continuous air can dry your mouth and nose. You may get congestion , a runny nose , or nosebleeds . Some people get an upset stomach or a bloated belly. BPAP With bilevel positive airway pressure, the air pressure is higher when you breathe in than it is when you exhale.
