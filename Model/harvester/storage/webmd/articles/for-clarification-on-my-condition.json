        "I recently had a conversation with a dear friend who is like my big sister. I met her when I was in high school and she was already 30 years old. Prior to this chat, we had not spoken in a few weeks. As we were catching up, I decided to clarify something I had put in a text message to her a few days earlier. I told her that I had recently started a new clinical trial. She, like a lot of my other friends, did not realize that I was back on treatment again (I haven’t been off anything for over 10 years). During our phone call, after we briefly discussed our kids and spouses, I explained that I have been on 13 treatments over the past 21 years. I don’t quite remember what she said, but I sensed her shock and confusion.",
        "The last time we had seen each other in person had been at a themed event where we dressed up in Great Gatsby attire. It was a lovely warm day in June. We picnicked, people-watched, and enjoyed live jazz bands and dancers that performed throughout the day. Before we departed from each other, we hugged and walked away with new, special memories."

        "Since that time, we texted to check in and to try to figure out a time to hang out again. But, as is usually the case, the summer kicked into full gear and our schedules got busy. During this recent phone call, I didn’t linger too much on the cancer thing. We made tentative plans to have brunch in the next couple of weeks and then our call ended.",
        "Later that day, I replayed our conversation in my mind. It hadn’t been awkward, but I had to think about why I've ever gone too in-depth with her about my health status. Maybe it was because her mother passed away from cancer many years ago, well before my own diagnosis. At that time, I mostly just supported her by listening to whatever she wanted to discuss. One thing I remember is that she’d say that her mom just needed to stay positive. This is similar language that she’s used during the rare times I’ve tried to talk about the complexity of my situation. Her response is usually: “K, you just need to stay positive.” My response is usually “I do.” But in the back of my mind, or sometimes under my breath, I say: “It’s not that simple.” I wish it were. I am very optimistic, but I am also a realist."
