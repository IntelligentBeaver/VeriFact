The ultraviolet (UV) light of the sun causes a structural change in the drug. This, in turn, causes the production of antibodies that are responsible for the sun-sensitivity reaction. The reaction usually includes an eczema -type rash , which often occurs a few days after exposure. The rash can also spread to parts of the body that were not exposed to the sun.",

It can occur when skin is exposed to the sun after certain medications are injected, taken orally, or applied to the skin. The drug absorbs the UV light, then releases it into the skin, causing cell death. Within a few days, symptoms appear on the exposed areas of the body. In some people, symptoms can persist up to 20 years after the medication is stopped. Among the most common phototoxic drugs are amiodarone ( Cordarone , a heart medication). NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen ), and the tetracycline family."
