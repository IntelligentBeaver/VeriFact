        "Your pericardium is a tough, double-layered sac. It keeps your heart in a stable place in your chest as your heart beats. In healthy people, the pericardium contains about 15 milliliters (1 tablespoon) to 50 milliliters (3 1/3 tablespoons) of clear, yellow pericardial fluid. This fluid helps your heart move more easily within the sac.",
        "If you have a pericardial effusion, hundreds of milliliters of fluid may gather in your pericardium. Its seriousness depends on what caused it, how much fluid gathers, and how fast it fills your pericardium."
