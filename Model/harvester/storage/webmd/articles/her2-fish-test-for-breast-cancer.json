        "When you get a diagnosis of breast cancer , your doctor will use several tests to learn details about your tumor and the best way to treat it. The FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) test checks the DNA of your cancer cells for extra copies of the HER2/neu gene.",

This can make your tumor grow faster.",
