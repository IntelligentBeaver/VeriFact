        "A migraine is a type of headache with symptoms that can differ from those of non-migraine headaches. These may include unusual symptoms that can be scary, like tingling sensations, flashing lights, weird sounds, and blurred or lost vision. In some cases, you might get nauseated and throw up, or become sensitive to light and hole up in a dark room for days. If you know your symptoms, you may be able to predict when a migraine is on the way.",

        "Talk with your doctor about what you’re feeling, especially if you have headaches on 15 or more days per month ( chronic migraine ) or have any symptoms other than a headache. Some symptoms can mirror those of more serious conditions that need care right away."
