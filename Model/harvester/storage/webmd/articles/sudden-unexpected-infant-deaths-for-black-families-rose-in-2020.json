        "The SUID rate among Black infants was 214 per 100,000 live births in 2020, up from 189.9 in 2019. For White infants, the SUID rate dropped to 75.6 in 2020 from 78.8 in 2019. For American Indian or Alaskan Natives, the SUID rate was 205.1 in 2020, down from 207.4 in 2019.",
        "SUIDs is a classification of child deaths that includes the better-known sudden infant death syndrome, accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, and unknown causes. Overall, SUID rates went up slightly in the U.S., to 92.1% in 2020 from 89.5% in 2019.",
        "The study said the evidence does not show that the COVID pandemic had an effect on SUID rates, except for Blacks. The increase among Black infants reflected “societal failures,” according to a commentary accompanying the study."
