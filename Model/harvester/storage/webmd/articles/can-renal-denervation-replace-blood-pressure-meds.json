        "The procedure, which involves zapping nerves around the renal artery that feeds blood to the kidneys, appears best suited for those with uncontrolled or resistant hypertension.",
        "Resistant hypertension is when someone either is unable to control their high blood pressure with three medicines, including a diuretic , at maximum tolerated doses, or they’re able to control it with four medications. Along with diuretics, which reduce blood pressure by helping the body eliminate water and sodium , other medications might include a combination of drugs designed to block certain hormones or relax the blood vessels.",

There, too, is promising but limited research suggesting it could be helpful for those with refractory hypertension, which is when someone is unable to control their blood pressure with five medications."
