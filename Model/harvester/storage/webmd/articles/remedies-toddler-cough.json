        "As children develop, it’s not uncommon for them to experience illnesses or conditions with coughs particularly if in a daycare setting and during the winter months . A cough in young children can have many causes. The vast majority are caused by viral upper respiratory infections or common colds. If your child has a cold, their cough can linger for up to a month after the other symptoms have gone away.",
        "An acute (short-term) cough will last less than a month. It’s usually associated with a cold or allergies . This type of cough doesn’t necessarily need a trip to the doctor. It can usually be treated at home. But a chronic cough lasting longer than four weeks should be evaluated by a pediatrician.",
        "Though rarely serious, coughs can be miserable for parents and children. They may interrupt sleep and other usual routines, and cause crankiness .",
        "It’s important to remember that coughing is actually good, since it helps the body free itself from mucus that clogs up your throat or nose. However, in cases where coughing persists, some home remedies can help ease your child’s symptoms."
