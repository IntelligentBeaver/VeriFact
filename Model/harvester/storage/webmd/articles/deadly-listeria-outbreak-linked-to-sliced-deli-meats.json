        "July 22, 2024 – Two people have died from an outbreak of the bacteria listeria linked to deli-counter sliced meat, and dozens more have been sickened, prompting the CDC to urge people to take precautions with meat from deli counters at this time.",
        "One person who died was in Illinois, and the other person who died was in New Jersey. A total of 28 people have been sickened and hospitalized across 12 states. Officials have linked the outbreak to eating sliced meat sold at deli counters, but no recall has been issued while the investigation continues to determine specific affected products.",

        "The other states where hospitalized people lived were Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The people got sick between May 29 and July 5, although additional recent cases may not yet be reported because it can take up to 2 weeks for symptoms to arise, as well as another couple of weeks for testing to determine whether a case is linked to an outbreak."
