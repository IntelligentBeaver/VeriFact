        "First, wash your face regularly. If the acne does not go away, there are over-the-counter products (you can buy these without a prescription) available in different forms, such as gels, lotions, creams, pads, and soaps. Common ingredients used in most of these products to fight acne are benzoyl peroxide , resorcinol, salicylic acid , and sulfur. A topical retinoid gel is also available and can help keep pimples from forming. If you have a bad skin reaction to any products you buy on your own, tell your doctor. Also, it can take time for these products to work. If they do not make your acne better after 2 or 3 months, ask your doctor for help.",
        "The doctor can give you stronger medication , including antibiotics or other pills and creams that also have retinoids in them. Retinoids can make you very sensitive to the sun, so apply at night and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a physical blocker like zinc oxide and an SPF 30 or higher to protect yourself. Clascoterone cream (Winlevi), a topical anti-androgen and anti-inflammatory cream, can be used to treat boys and girls 12 years and older. Oral spironolactone ( Aldactone ) is very helpful for treating acne and decreases the need for oral antibiotics for women.",
