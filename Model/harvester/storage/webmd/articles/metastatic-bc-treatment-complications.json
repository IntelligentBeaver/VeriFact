        "Treatment for HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (mBC) usually involves drugs that affect the entire body. And while these treatments can often control the disease and ease symptoms for months or years, they can also trigger complications that may require their own treatment and lifestyle adjustments. Research suggests that almost half of all women treated for breast cancer develop at least one medical condition after treatment. Unlike cancer treatment side effects such as short-term bouts of nausea and fatigue, complications are long-term health issues that may resolve over time or may require attention for the rest of your life. HR+/HER2- mBC treatment complications can include chronic conditions such as neuropathy and lymphedema, which can be particularly challenging when you’re also dealing with the physical and psychological effects of the cancer itself. Of the four main subtypes of female breast cancer, HR+/HER2- is the most common."

        "Because HR+/HER2- mBC is fueled by hormones such as estrogen, one often-used treatment involves drugs that lower estrogen levels. These include aromatase inhibitors (AIs), such as anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara). Because AIs cause a significant drop in estrogen levels, women who have this type of therapy may experience bone thinning. This can lead to osteoporosis and a higher risk of bone fractures. An estimated 10% to 20% of women taking hormone therapy for breast cancer experience a fracture after five years. If you take AIs, your doctor may suggest that you have bone density checked regularly and take medications to help keep your bones strong. These medications include denosumab (Prolia, Xgeva) and bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid (Zometa). Talk with your health care team about getting a bone density scan before you start treatment. This gives you a baseline you and your doctor can use to keep an eye on your bone health through treatment and beyond."

Chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer can lead to peripheral neuropathy. The risk of neuropathy may be high if a type of chemo called a taxane is used. Women who already have neuropathy also may face greater risks of it getting worse after chemotherapy. Being older and being overweight also increase the chances of post-chemo peripheral neuropathy.

You should also talk with your doctor about other potential treatments, such as physical therapy or neurostimulation — the use of low-level electrical pulses to block pain signals from reaching the brain. When breast cancer spreads, it often goes into lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are removed surgically or treated with radiation, it can mess up the healthy flow of lymph, a watery fluid that delivers white blood cells to areas fighting infection, carries unwanted substances to the lymph nodes to be filtered out, regulates fluid levels in the body, and performs other important tasks. When the lymphatic system — made up of lymph nodes, vessels, and organs — is not working efficiently because of cancer and cancer treatment, fluid can build up in the body. The result is lymphedema, and it can cause swelling and stiffness throughout the body as well as skin changes and other symptoms."

        "As you navigate HR+/HER2- mBC treatment complications, as well as the cancer treatment itself, remember to surround yourself with health care professionals to help you all along the way. Your primary care doctor may be best suited to be the captain of your health care team, managing your overall care and staying up to speed with the treatments and recommendations of your oncologist (cancer doctor) and other specialists. Work with your primary care doctor to make sure all of your health care providers know the medications you’re taking and at which doses, as well as your medical history, current symptoms, recent blood work, and planned imaging, procedures, and treatments. It’s important that you feel comfortable sharing information and asking questions of the people on your care team. To make the most of your appointments, write down questions ahead of time, and find out how best to communicate with your doctors’ offices in between appointments. Phone calls may be best, but you may also be able to communicate through patient portals."
