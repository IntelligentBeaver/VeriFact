That’s because the nationwide recall of Boar’s Head meat products has been dramatically expanded to include 7 million pounds of deli sliced and packaged meat, up from about 200,000 pounds initially flagged in a recall announced last week. One cheese item is also listed.",
        "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has published the full list of 71 products, which include meats intended to be sliced at deli counters plus some packaged meat and poultry items, labeled either with the Boar’s Head brand name or the name Old Country. Some of the affected products include varieties of liverwurst, ham, bologna, beef, salami, franks and sausages, Canadian style bacon, pork, and chicken, as well as some specialty items such as meat loaves studded with olives or pickles and peppers."
