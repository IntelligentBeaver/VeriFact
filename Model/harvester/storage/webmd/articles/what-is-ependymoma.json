        "Ependymomas are cancerous tumors that grow in your brain or any part of the spine , including your neck and upper and lower back. They form at first in your ependymal cells in the middle of your spinal cord and in the fluid-filled spaces in your brain known as ventricles.",
        "Unlike other kinds of cancer, ependymomas usually don’t spread to other parts of your body. But they can spread to more than one area of your brain or spine. In children, these tumors are likely to come back after treatment.",
