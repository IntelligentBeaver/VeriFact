When arteries don’t work properly, your feet and legs can’t get enough oxygen and other needed supplies, like nutrients.

        "Most often PAD happens because of atherosclerosis, when plaque, cholesterol, and other substances build up within an artery’s wall and make it narrower inside. If enough plaque builds up, it can block blood flow inside the artery. ( Blood clots can also get in the way of the flow.) Like PVD , there also seems to be a genetic component to PAD.",
        "When the blood is blocked it lowers the amount of oxygen and nutrients that get to your limbs. This can create lasting damage to your skin, nerves, and muscle tissue. Less-common causes of PAD include injuries to the arteries, unusually shaped muscles or ligaments, and infections .",
        "PVD has several different forms. With chronic venous insufficiency, the valves in your veins allow blood to flow backwards in the wrong direction. This can create pressure and strain that damage the tissues causing bulging of your veins, especially if you are pregnant, overweight, or tend to sit or stand in one position for a long time.",
        "On the milder end, this condition can lead to spider veins -- small, raised, swollen blood vessels that twist and turn. As the problem becomes more severe, it can become painful and lead to varicose veins, which are larger but not life-threatening."
