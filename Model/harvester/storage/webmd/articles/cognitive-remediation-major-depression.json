Cognition helps with everything from talking to a friend to buying groceries. There are six main types of cognition: Attention: The ability to select a task and stay focused on it or to divide your attention across different tasks in a productive way. Executive function: The ability to plan and make decisions, remember information needed to do a task, and respond flexibly. Learning and memory: The ability to remember and recall information in both the short and long term. Language: The ability to express yourself with the right language and think of the right words. Perceptual-motor skills: The ability to make sense of visual and other sensory information, such as sounds and smells, from other people and the world around you. Social cognition: The ability to make logical judgments about other people's intentions and wishes and to control your own emotions in a socially appropriate way."
