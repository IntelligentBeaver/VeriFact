Both may require surgery, but, fortunately, these two complications are rare. Recent data suggest that there is an increased risk of cancer of the colon in patients with long-standing Crohn's disease , but studies are conflicting.",

Sclerosing cholangitis with liver failure is one of the reasons for performing a liver transplant. Sclerosing cholangitis often is complicated by the development of cancer of the bile ducts or gallbladder . People who also have cirrhosis are at increased risk of developing liver cancer."
