        "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare genetic condition that affects how certain nerve cells grow and develop. Children with NF1 can have small growths on or under the skin called neurofibromas.",
        "Some children also develop larger growths known as plexiform neurofibromas (PN). These are noncancerous tumors that grow along nerves and can cause lumps or changes in appearance, pain, or other problems. Because these tumors often intertwine with healthy tissue, surgery is not always possible.",
        "In 2020, the FDA approved Koselugo (selumetinib) as the first medicine to treat children 2 years and older with NF1 who have PN that cause symptoms and cannot be removed by surgery. In September 2025, the FDA approval was expanded to include children 1 year and older.",
