        "Give in a little. Eat a bit of what you’re craving, maybe a small cookie or a fun-size candy bar, suggests Kerry Neville, a registered dietitian. Enjoying a little of what you love can help you steer clear of feeling denied. Try to stick to a 150-calorie threshold, Neville says. If you can’t find a small serving size, split your treat with a friend or friends.",
        "Combine foods. If the idea of stopping at a cookie or a baby candy bar seems impossible, you can still fill yourself up and satisfy a sugar craving, too. \"I like combining the craving food with a healthful one,\" Neville says. \"I love chocolate , for example, so sometimes I’ll dip a banana in chocolate sauce and that gives me what I’m craving, or I mix some almonds with chocolate chips.\" You’ll soothe your craving and get healthy nutrients from those good-for-you foods.",
        "Go cold turkey. Cutting out all simple sugars works for some people. But it’s not easy. “The initial 48 to 72 hours are tough,\" Gerbstadt says. Some people find that going cold turkey helps curb their cravings after a few days. Others find they may still crave sugar but over time are able to train their taste buds to be satisfied with less.",

        "Get up and go. When a sugar craving hits, walk away. \"Take a walk around the block or [do] something to change the scenery,\" to take your mind off the food you’re craving, Neville suggests.",
        "Choose quality over quantity . \"If you need a sugar splurge, pick a wonderful, decadent sugary food,\" Moores says. But keep it small. For example, choose a small dark chocolate truffle instead of a king-sized candy bar, then \"savor every bite -- slowly,\" Moores says. Grotto agrees. \"Don’t swear off favorites -- you’ll only come back for greater portions. Learn to incorporate small amounts in the diet but concentrate on filling your stomach with less sugary and [healthier] options.\"",
