        "Picture this: You’re home alone and you suddenly feel a flare creeping in. Or you’re rushed to a hospital where the staff isn’t familiar with myasthenia gravis (MG). Living with MG means these scenarios aren’t just “what-ifs” — they’re real possibilities that can disrupt your life in an instant.",
        "For someone like me, whose condition requires daily management and constant vigilance, being unprepared isn’t an option. Over the years, I’ve learned that while you can’t predict emergencies, you can plan for them. And that preparation makes all the difference.",
        "Oddly enough, my dedication to being prepared was sparked after watching the movie A Quiet Place: Day One . Without giving too much away, there’s a scene where the main character, who has cancer, realizes mid-apocalypse she doesn’t have enough medication. While I was sitting there in the cinema, I thought: “What if something unexpected happened and I didn’t have the medication I rely on?”"

A small but crucial addition is a card that details my condition, medications, and my neurologist’s contact information. This card is always in my wallet, ensuring that if I’m unable to communicate, my essentials are clear for anyone who needs them."
