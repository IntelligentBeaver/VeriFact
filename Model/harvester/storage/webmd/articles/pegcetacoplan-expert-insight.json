        "C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and primary immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) are two rare kidney diseases. They’re both driven by activity of the complement system, which is a critical part of your innate immune system. This is your body’s first defense against invaders like viruses and germs. When the complement system overreacts, it can lead to diseases in various parts of your body, including the kidneys.",
        "Clinical trials have suggested that a medication called pegcetacoplan (Empaveli) might work to treat adults and kids aged 12 and up with C3G or IC-MPGN. This drug was first  approved to treat adults with a complement-mediated blood disorder called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in 2021. In April 2025, the FDA granted priority review status to these new uses for the drug, based on early data from a phase III study.",
