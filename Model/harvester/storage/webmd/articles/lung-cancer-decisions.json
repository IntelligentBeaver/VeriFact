        "By Leah Phillips, as told to Janie McQueen I was diagnosed with lung cancer in December 2019. I never even tried a cigarette. I didn’t grow up around secondhand smoke. But at first, before I had biomarker testing, doctors told me they hoped I’d be alive at Christmas the following year. In September 2019, it started with a cough that was persistent and didn’t go away. Eventually I was misdiagnosed with pneumonia. Then I went in for another CT scan and it showed lytic lesions -- cancer spots -- in my spine. A bone biopsy showed they’d spread from my lung to my spine and pelvis. The oncologist diagnosed me with stage IV lung cancer and was ready to start me on chemo and immunotherapy. Meanwhile, my husband connected with Dr. Leora Horn at Vanderbilt University Medical Center by email over Christmas break. She said, “Absolutely, do not let her put one drug in her body.” She wanted me to do biomarker testing, and if I were to start chemo or immunotherapy, it could cause a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drug treatment I might try instead to not work."

        "Targeted therapy is a type of cancer treatment. It zeroes in on proteins that direct the division, growth, and spread of cancer cells. My doctor at Vanderbilt prescribed Tagrisso (osimertinib mesylate), an approved targeted therapy for people with EGFR exon lung cancer. The way it works is, that gene is broken, but targeted therapy tricks your body into thinking it’s still intact. Sometimes the cancer catches on that it’s not the real deal and mutates. I started on Tagrisso in December 2019. By December 2020, the primary tumor had shrunk by 70% and all my bone mets -- short for metastases, or cancer cells that have spread to the bones -- had healed. We made the decision to be aggressive and proceed with eight high powered SBRT, aka stereotactic body radiation therapy. This treatment uses super focused, strong radiation doses that attack cancer cells but aren’t as harmful to healthy tissue. In theory, this killed any remaining cancer cells that were present in my primary tumor. I’ve remained on Tagrisso and haven’t had any progression."
