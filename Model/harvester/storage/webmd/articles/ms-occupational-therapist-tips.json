My job is to help them remain independent in all the activities of daily life for as long as possible. It’s especially important with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Unlike relapse remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ), where periods of challenge are followed by periods of stability, SPMS can lead to physical, cognitive, and emotional changes that are often permanent.",

We want to make sure they can continue to love life."
