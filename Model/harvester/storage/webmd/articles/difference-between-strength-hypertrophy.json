        "Strength training is a popular form of exercise. It involves lifting weights or dumbbells, using weight machines, and doing bodyweight exercises. With strength training , you’re making your body stronger. The goal isn’t to lose weight, but it will happen with regular workouts. You’ll also improve your physical fitness and build muscle mass. Resistance training is also strength training, using more bodyweight exercises and resistance bands.",
        "With strength training, you’ll typically see a boost in strength within the first 4 weeks. This is because of the neurological system that controls your muscles. After 4 weeks, your muscles will expand, and you’ll start to see growth.",
        "Hypertrophy training focuses mostly on developing your muscles. You’ll focus on increasing the size of your muscle fibers, developing large muscles in areas that you work out the most. This might be places like your thighs, calves, biceps, or back.",
        "Hypertrophy focuses more on moderate weight and moderate repetitions. You’ll have a 1-minute rest period between sets. The quicker movement is intended to induce muscle building."
