        "Cervical radiculopathy is a condition caused by a pinched nerve in your neck. It happens when your cervical spinal cord or nerve roots arising from it become compressed by the cervical vertebrae . Your cervical spine , or neck, is formed by seven small vertebrae that begin at the base of your skull, which is the area affected by cervical radiculopathy.",
        "The nerves that run through your cervical spine send messages between your muscles and brain . The roots of these nerves branch out through openings in your vertebrae called foramen. Damage to these nerve roots can cause pain and loss of sensation along the nerve's pathway into your arm and hand, depending on where the damage occurs.",
        "Often, cervical radiculopathy gets better on its own without treatment. If yours doesn't, there are nonsurgical and surgical treatments that can help.",
