        "By Rukhsana G. Mirza, MD, as told to Rachel Reiff Ellis To understand how far we’ve come with geographic atrophy (GA), it’s important to start with the basics of the disease. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision impairment in older adults. There are two types: wet AMD, which is more aggressive, and dry AMD, which in its late stages can lead to GA. The treatment for wet AMD has been revolutionized during my career. When I was a resident, there was no wet AMD treatment that could improve your vision, only a thermal laser which burned areas of abnormal blood vessels in your eye. But then we developed photodynamic therapy to address abnormal blood vessels. Not long after, anti-VEGF treatments. Suddenly, I wasn’t seeing people with large areas of scarring anymore. The injections changed that. These developments with wet AMD are why I'm excited about the development of a new approach to dry AMD. Because we've seen how rapidly, and with such promise, innovation can come to those we treat."

        "As of 2023 there are now two FDA-approved medications for slowing down the progression of GA: avacincaptad pegol (Izervay) and pegcetacoplan (Syfovre). We still consider these very new and not for everyone. But they have promise for some. These medicines work by targeting part of your immune system called the complement cascade. That’s a group of proteins in your blood that help your immune system. They’re normally inactive but can be switched on in a certain order to help kill germs or boost your immune response. When the medications disrupt part of the cascade, it dampens your immune response so there’s less damage to your retina. You get the medications by an injection into your eye, either monthly or every other month. It’s important to know these medications don’t bring back retinal tissue you’ve already lost. They help slow the rate of further loss. But even though that doesn’t improve your vision, it’s still an exciting advancement. Because prior to 2023, we didn't have any interventions at all."
