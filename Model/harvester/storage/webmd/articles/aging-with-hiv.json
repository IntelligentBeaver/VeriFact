        "I’ve also been experiencing cognitive impairment and severe memory loss. Not all of these conditions are derived from HIV, and they may or may not affect me more because of HIV. Many of them can’t be resolved. But they can’t be ignored because they could do me even more harm."

        "Aging demands that we make more trips to the doctor’s office for checkups and screenings. It’s important we keep these appointments and take them seriously to catch potential problems early. It’s important to have a good relationship with your doctors, keep them apprised of each other, and make sure they know about all your medical care so there’s no miscommunication, misunderstanding, or mistreatment.",

Advances in ART over the past two decades have significantly decreased the severity of HAND – but it affects 30% to 50% of people living with HIV. The most severe form of HAND is called HAD (HIV-associated dementia). This occurs in less than 5% of people with HIV who are on the right treatment plan. MND (mild neurocognitive disorder) is a more common form of HAND. It can affect your behavior, ability to make decisions, learning, concentration, attention, and memory."

        "Another challenge of aging with HIV is how medication management becomes more complex. That’s because you're more likely to develop other health conditions you need medications for, too. So there’s more risk of drug interactions and side effects. This is something your doctors and pharmacists try to stay on top of, but no one knows your body like you. So listen to it, and make sure your providers listen to you.",
        "Medication adherence is important, and it may get more challenging with age. A medication routine is helpful. It may be as simple as a pillbox and alarms, or it may mean asking others for help. Listen to your doctor's recommendations, but find a routine you can stick to.",
        "Social support and interaction are crucial as you age. Depression and other mental health issues become more of a concern. Loneliness is a major issue for older adults that negatively impacts your mental and physical well-being. It can lead to serious issues such as substance dependence and suicidal ideation."
