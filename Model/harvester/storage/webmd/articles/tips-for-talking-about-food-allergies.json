Creating a safe environment for our food allergy children can be as easy as a playdate with no food, or asking people to wash their hands before hanging out, or being prepared with a pre-approved safe treat for an event. “Safe and included” is the phrase I have used most when discussing my boys, particularly with their teachers. Usually, a couple of small behavior changes that have minimal implications for the broader group can go a long way and make a significant difference for our family. It starts with communicating the desire to want to make a classroom, home, or situation safe, and that is the best intention ever."
