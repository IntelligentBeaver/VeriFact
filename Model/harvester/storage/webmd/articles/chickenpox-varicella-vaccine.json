        "The chickenpox vaccine is a shot that can protect nearly anyone who receives the vaccine from catching chickenpox. It's also called the varicella vaccine because chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The vaccine is made from a live but weakened, or attenuated, virus.",

Although the virus in the chickenpox vaccine is generally incapable of causing a disease, it still stimulates a response from the body's immune system.
