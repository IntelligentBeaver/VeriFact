            "Have fun in your off-hours. Find an activity you love and throw yourself into it. Maybe it’s volunteering or joining a theatre group or singing in a choir. The only rule? Enjoy yourself and don’t think about work.",
            "Relax. Find ways to unwind. Try a hobby, sports, reading, meditation or prayer, or anything else you enjoy that enhances your life.",
            "Move throughout your day. Exercise is a proven stress-buster. But don't just look to an official workout. Can you get up from your desk a couple of times an hour and stretch? Or take a walk on your lunch break? Spending time in green spaces like parks may also help your mood.",
            "Connect with others. “When you’re stressed out, you tend to disconnect from your relationships. And that’s exactly the opposite of what you need,” Ballard says. Isolating yourself can raise your risk for heart disease.  Your friends and loved ones can help you get through the rocky times, so keep them close."
