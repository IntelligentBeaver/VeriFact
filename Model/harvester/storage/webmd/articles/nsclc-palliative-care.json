        "Your palliative care team will prescribe treatments based on your symptoms and needs. Some of the main symptoms of NSCLC include shortness of breath, coughing, and pain. These symptoms can happen for different reasons, such as an airway blocked by a tumor or fluid buildup in the area surrounding the lungs or heart. Palliative care treatments include: Palliative chemotherapy. Your doctor may prescribe chemotherapy to shrink your cancer, which may lessen pain and other symptoms. Palliative radiation. If the cancer has spread to your bones, spine, or brain, you may need radiation to ease the pain. A type of radiation called brachytherapy can treat the tumors that block airways. That’s when small amounts of radiation are placed inside your lungs. Procedures to treat fluid buildup around the lungs. To remove the fluid, your doctor inserts a needle through your lower back (called thoracentesis) or your chest (pleurodesis). Procedures to treat the fluid buildup around the heart. A doctor may use a needle to remove the fluid (periocardiocentesis). Or you may undergo surgery to remove a small piece of the sac around your heart, which allows the fluid to drain. This is called a pericardial window. Procedures to treat an airway blocked by a tumor. Laser therapy or light-activated drugs (called photodynamic therapy ) can help with small tumors. For larger ones, a surgeon may need to put in a stent to keep the airway open. Pain medicine. These include NSAIDs, opioids, antidepressants, and steroids. Medicines to help you breathe better. Some medicines, such as bronchodilators, provide short-term relief. Oxygen therapy. You use a small, portable oxygen tank to breathe better. Medicines for treatment side effects. Medications can treat the nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, constipation, and insomnia caused by chemotherapy or radiation. Medicines for depression or anxiety. Depression and anxiety are common among people with NSCLC. Medications may help you feel better. Therapy or counseling. It can help you and your family deal with the emotions of having NSCLC. Nutrition therapy. A dietitian can ensure you’re getting the right nutrients and enough calories. Physical therapy. This therapy can improve your ability to exercise and move. Complementary therapies. Massage, guided imagery, acupuncture, and other therapies may help ease stress and pain."
