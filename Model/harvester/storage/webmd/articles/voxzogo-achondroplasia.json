        "Achondroplasia is a type of dwarfism that affects the growth in children, leading to a short stature or small size. Achondroplasia is a rare genetic condition that affects one in every 15,000 to 40,000 newborns. It can lead to additional complications or health concerns as you get older, including obesity, ear infections/hearing loss, neurological problems that affect the brain and spinal cord, and crooked teeth. Voxzogo (vox-ZOE-goe) is an injection medicine that was approved in 2021 for the treatment of achondroplasia. It is the first FDA-approved treatment for achondroplasia in children with open growth plates."

        "Growth plates are areas at the ends of certain bones that allow the bones to grow. As a child grows, those growth plates remain open. Growth plates are made of cartilage, which is a type of strong and flexible tissue. As a child grows, the cartilage turns into bone. Once the growth plates are closed, a child stops growing.",
        "Symptoms of achondroplasia are listed below.",
        "Achondroplasia can be passed down from parent to child, but in most cases, it happens spontaneously. In children who have achondroplasia, there is a mutation in their DNA that disrupts signaling between certain proteins in the body. There are two different signaling pathways in your body, one that increases bone growth, and the other that slows down bone growth. The mutation found in achondroplasia increases the signaling between the proteins that slow bone growth. Voxzogo works by increasing the protein signaling that causes an increase in the rate of bone growth and bone development. The goal is to use Voxzogo while you have open growth plates and stop using the medicine once the growth plates have closed. Your health care provider will determine if you are no longer able to grow and tell you when you should stop taking Voxzogo."

        "Voxzogo comes as an injection that you will give to your child once a day, around the same time each day. It is injected under the skin in either the thighs, stomach (2 inches away from the belly button), butt, or back of the upper arms. Do not inject Voxzogo into the same injection site two times in a row. Rotate where you inject Voxzogo to prevent skin irritation. Do not inject Voxzogo in skin that is swollen, sore, bruised, red, hard, or scarred. It is important for your child to eat a meal and drink a glass (about 8 to 10 ounces of fluid) of either water, milk, or juice one hour before receiving the injection. This can help prevent your child from developing low blood pressure, which can lead to tiredness and dizziness that the medicine may cause.",
        "The dose you will give to your child will depend on their weight. Tell your health care provider if your child’s weight has changed. Your health care provider will tell you how much Voxzogo to give your child. Your health care provider can train you on how to properly give Voxzogo to your child. It is important that you also read the step-by-step instructions on how to correctly prepare and give Voxzogo to your child through the Instructions For Use paper that comes with the medicine. If you have any questions about how to give the medicine or any additional supplies you may need, you can also talk to your health care provider. Do not try to inject Voxzogo until you have been shown how to use the medicine. The drugmaker also has a program that can provide support with learning more about Voxzogo and details around injection training. Talk to your health care provider to learn more."

This can include redness, swelling, rash, bruising, hives, and pain where the needle goes in the skin. Applying a cool compress to the area may help. Your health care provider or pharmacist may recommend an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, or an OTC antihistamine for itching. Talk to your health care provider if you experience an injection-site reaction and before taking any medicines to help with your symptoms. Rotating your injection sites can also help minimize injection site reactions.",

To help minimize the risk of low blood pressure, make sure you drink 8 to 10 fluid ounces of water, milk, or juice and eat a meal one hour before using Voxzogo. Call your health care provider if you have low blood pressure or dizziness that does not improve or gets worse."
