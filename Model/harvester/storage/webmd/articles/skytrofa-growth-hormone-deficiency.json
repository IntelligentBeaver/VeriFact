        "Skytrofa is a long-acting form of somatropin. Somatropin is also called human growth hormone . Skytrofa is also considered a pegylated somatropin product. Pegylated means the medication is attached to a compound called polyethylene glycol, or PEG. This helps the medicine stay in the body longer by slowing down how quickly it is broken down. For Skytrofa, being pegylated allows the growth hormone to work with just one injection per week. Some other somatropin products require daily injections."
