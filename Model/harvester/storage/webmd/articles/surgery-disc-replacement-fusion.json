This is called a cervical myelopathy and surgery is recommended.",
        "Cervical disc disease is caused by an abnormality in one or more discs -- the cushions -- that lie between the neck bones (vertebrae). When a disc is damaged -- due to degenerative disc disease (or DDD) or an unknown cause -- it can lead to neck pain from inflammation or muscle spasm . In severe cases, pain and numbness can occur in the arms from pressure on the cervical nerve roots or spinal cord.",
