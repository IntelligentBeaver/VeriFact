        "You can develop back pain for many reasons, but some causes are more common than others. Wear and tear on the bones that form your spine (called vertebrae), muscles, and other tissues in your back can occur due to aging or overuse, leading to aches and pains. Injuries from accidents, falls, and other forms of trauma are another common cause of back pain. Others include autoimmune diseases that trigger chronic inflammation in your spine and other back structures. Back pain can also be a symptom of some diseases, such as cancer, or can be linked to certain infections.",
        "Your back has three distinct regions, which you can think of as upper, middle, and lower. While most of the major causes of back pain can affect all three regions, some causes of aches and stiffness strike more often in the lower back, while others tend to affect the middle and upper sections. And while back pain is one of the most common physical complaints, its causes can vary greatly from one person to another.",
        "You can develop back pain for many different reasons, including wear and tear on the bones that form your spine, muscles, and other tissues in your back. Injuries, certain illness, and infections can also cause back pain. If you feel pain for longer than a week, speak to your doctor to confirm the causes of your back pain.(Photo Credit: E+/Getty Images)"
