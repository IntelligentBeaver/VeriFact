        "CAR T-cell therapy is a cancer treatment that works by helping your immune system do its job better. It’s currently offered only once you’ve tried at least two other chemotherapies that didn’t work. To be sure you’re a good candidate for it, your doctor will review your medical records, do screening tests, and study images and biopsy results you’ve had in the past. Once you’re cleared to go ahead, here’s what the process will look like.",
        "Cell collection",
        "First, your doctor will need to collect some of your white blood cells (T cells) in a process called leukapheresis. You sit in a reclining position or lie down while a technician connects you to two IVs. One IV draws your blood. The blood goes through a machine that separates your T cells from the blood sample. Then it sends that blood back into your bloodstream through the second IV.",
        "You’ll need to stay still in one place for 2-3 hours while this happens. You may feel numb, tingly, or have muscle spasms during the process if your calcium levels drop. Your health care team can give you calcium to help manage these symptoms."
