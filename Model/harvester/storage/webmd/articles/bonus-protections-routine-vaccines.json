        "Dec. 11, 2024 — Here’s a thought that may coax you toward getting the flu vaccine: Think of it as a seasonal “buy one, get one free” special. In the case of a flu shot, vaccination can bring more than just one unexpected benefit.",
        "Research shows that immunization against the flu has been linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease as well as a reduced risk of heart failure and stroke . What’s more, the shingles vaccine may lower the risk of Parkinson’s disease and stave off dementia . The rotavirus vaccine , given routinely to infants, may delay the onset of diabetes. And COVID-19 vaccines and boosters not only reduce the likelihood of getting the disease but also lower the chances of serious heart and blood-vessel complications.",
        "To be sure, Americans are increasingly distrustful of vaccinations. As many as 22% of people surveyed by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania falsely believed that it’s less dangerous to get COVID-19 than to vaccinate against it. The survey also found that skepticism extended to other vaccines too, such as those for HPV, shingles, pneumonia, and RSV. Gallup polls show, meanwhile, that the numbers of those who consider childhood vaccines as important is down from 64% in 2001 to 40% today."

        "Textbooks usually define vaccines as suspensions aimed at providing immunity against a specific germ, say, the flu virus. Yet science now shows that’s not the whole story. When measles vaccination programs were rolled out in low-income countries, the drops in childhood deaths reached as much as 50%, even though the disease accounted for just 10% of deaths.",
        "In Denmark, a recent study found that flu jabs lowered overall deaths among adults by 18% — an outcome comparable to that of a healthy diet , and which couldn’t be simply explained by fewer cases of flu. These extra effects have been “proven beyond any doubt,” said Christine Stabell Benn, MD, PhD, DMSc, an epidemiologist at the University of Southern Denmark. Researchers call these effects “nonspecific” to separate them from those that the vaccines were originally designed for. In many situations, she said, “the nonspecific effects might be even more important than the specific effects.”",
        "Higher doses may provide even more protection. A recent study in Denmark with over 12,000 participants showed that a dose four times higher than usual cut death rates almost by half compared with the standard dose. What’s more, the effects appeared even before the flu season took off. “We knew we had no flu circulating,” said Tor Biering-Sørensen , MD, PhD, MPH, a cardiology researcher at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and the study’s lead author. “Those getting boosted with a higher dose had better protection against several outcomes. It’s not just flu, it’s also the cardiovascular outcomes,” Biering-Sørensen said.",
        "Another study by Biering-Sørensen and his colleagues, which looked at the flu vaccine and cardiovascular disease in almost a quarter million people, found that it reduced the risk of death from stroke by 15% and from cardiovascular disease by 17%. And the more flu shots one gets, the better — at least for preventing heart failure. In one study, people who had accumulated more than three flu shots over the period of the study (which ranged from about two to seven years, depending on the patient), had the lowest risk of cardiovascular death. The reduction was comparable to what you might expect from following the Mediterranean diet."

Their vaccine is known as BCG, or the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. It is the most used vaccine on Earth and makes people more resistant to a plethora of germs other than tuberculosis. Studies show it lowers the risk of sepsis and fatal respiratory infections and protects against the yellow fever virus as well as the human papillomavirus.",

In one trial, after a BCG vaccination, MRI images of multiple sclerosis patients showed fewer enhancing lesions , a marker of disease activity. In a trial on type 1 diabetes , BCG vaccination helped restore blood sugars to near normal, even in patients who had the disease for years. For Crohn’s disease, some research suggests that BCG vaccination could sustain remission , and a study published in November 2024 showed that tetanus vaccination is linked to a slower progression of Parkinson’s disease."
