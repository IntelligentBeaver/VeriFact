        "Atopic dermatitis , also called eczema, is a long-term (chronic) skin condition that is caused by an overactive immune system. This weakens the skin barrier, which can cause the skin to be irritated and inflamed. It mostly affects the face, hands, arms, feet, wrists, and legs. People with atopic dermatitis commonly have very itchy ( pruritus ), dry, or sensitive skin, and red rashes.",
        "In people with atopic dermatitis, a specific protein (IL-13) is overactive, which tells your nerves to produce more signals for itching. These signals go to your brain, causing an intense urge to scratch. The scratching causes inflammation, which can lead to dry, flaky, red skin and patches. The more you scratch, the more IL-13 signals are produced, which leads to more itching and rashes. This is called the \"itch-scratch cycle.\"",
        "If you have atopic dermatitis, you may have a flare-up (or exacerbation), when your symptoms are worse and may be more noticeable. The flare-ups can last for days or weeks and may involve more itching and rashes, or lead to skin infections. Although atopic dermatitis flare-ups have many causes, some of these flare-ups are caused by some of the following triggers."
