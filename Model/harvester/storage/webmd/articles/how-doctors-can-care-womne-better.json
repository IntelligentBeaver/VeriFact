        "But Kaplan, a health coach on Long Island, NY, soon had debilitating symptoms. The mother of three, who’s now 55, felt like she was pregnant, with pelvic pressure pushing up into her ribs, and a swelling stomach that hindered her high-intensity workouts. Her menstrual flow volleyed between trickle and gush. She began peeing blood, signaling a urinary tract infection.",
