Due to significant blood loss, postpartum hemorrhage can cause a drop in your blood pressure. Your organs may not get enough blood flow which can cause you to go into shock and possibly die."

        "When you’re pregnant, your body develops a placenta — an organ that develops inside your uterus. It is a structure for your baby that provides them with the oxygen and nutrients they need to grow. It also removes waste products from your baby’s food. The placenta attaches to the wall of your uterus, and your baby's umbilical cord comes out from it.",
        "After childbirth, the uterus typically contracts to push out the placenta. These contractions can help put pressure on the bleeding vessels near where the placenta is typically attached inside your uterus. If the contractions during childbirth aren’t strong enough, the vessels bleed more. Bleeding can also happen if small pieces of the placenta don’t leave the body and stay attached."
