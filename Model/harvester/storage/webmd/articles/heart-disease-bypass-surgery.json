        "Heart bypass surgery is when a surgeon takes a blood vessel from another part of your body to go around, or bypass, a blocked artery. The result is that more blood and oxygen can flow to your heart again.",
        "Imagine you’re on a highway. An accident causes traffic to pile up ahead. Emergency crews redirect cars around the congestion. Finally, you’re able to get back on the highway and the route is clear. Heart bypass surgery is similar.",
        "It can help lower your risk for a heart attack and other problems. Once you recover, you’ll feel better and be able to get back to your regular activities.",
        "Bypass surgery is also known as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG, pronounced \"cabbage\"), c oronary artery bypass surgery, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. It’s the most common type of open heart surgery in the U.S., with nearly 400,000 procedures done every year. Most people have great results and live symptom-free for a decade or more.",
        "You’ll still need a healthy diet, exercise, and probably medicine to prevent another blockage. But first, you’ll want to know what to expect from the surgery, how to prepare, what complications can happen, and what the recovery is like.",

A surgeon takes a blood vessel from another part of your body to go around, or bypass, a blocked artery. Most people have improved symptoms for 10 years or more after the surgery. Medication and healthy lifestyle choices can help keep your arteries from becoming blocked again.",

Traditional heart bypass is a type of open-heart surgery. The procedure is also used for other kinds of heart surgery, such as valve replacements or heart transplants."
