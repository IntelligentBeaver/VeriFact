        "Mucositis is the breakdown of mucous membranes in your gastrointestinal tract, the passageway that spans from your mouth to your anus. Cancer treatment often causes it. When you have mucositis, GI tract tissue can become inflamed, and you might get painful open sores. It also puts you at risk of infection in those mucous tissues.",
        "It can affect any part of your digestive tract, but your mouth may be the most likely place for problems to crop up. When it affects your mouth or esophagus , it’s called oral mucositis.",
