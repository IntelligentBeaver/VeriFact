        "In a new analysis published in the journal Addiction , researcher Jonathan Caulkins, PhD, a cannabis policy researcher and professor at Carnegie Mellon University , analyzed survey data stretching back to 1979, which was the first time marijuana use was included in what is now called the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Daily or near-daily reported use of marijuana and alcohol have both increased in the past 30 years, but the increase has been much sharper among marijuana users.",
        "In 2022, 17.7 million people reported using marijuana anywhere from 25 to 30 days per month, compared to just 900,000 daily or near daily users in 1992. In contrast, 14.7 million people reported daily or near daily alcohol use, compared to 8.9 million using at that frequency in 1992."
