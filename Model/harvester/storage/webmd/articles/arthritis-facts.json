        "Arthritis is a general term that means inflammation in joints. Osteoarthritis, also called degenerative joint disease, is the most common type of arthritis . It is associated with a breakdown of cartilage in joints and can occur in almost any joint in the body. It most commonly occurs in the weight -bearing joints of the hips, knees , and spine. It can also affect the fingers, thumb, neck, and large toe . It is not typically common in other joints unless prior injury or excessive stress is involved."
