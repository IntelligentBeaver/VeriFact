        "Coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) have more in common than similar-sounding names. They’re both dangerous but treatable conditions that take a toll on blood vessels called arteries .",
        "CAD or PAD can happen when plaque -- a substance made of fats, cholesterol, and other stuff -- builds up in the walls of arteries. Those are the blood vessels that carry blood between your heart and the rest of your body. This buildup can narrow or block an artery, limit blood flow, and raise your risk for serious health problems.",
        "CAD affects the arteries that bring blood to your heart . It’s the main type of heart disease in the U.S. Some people don’t realize they have it until they have a heart attack. Over time, CAD can lead to heart failure, which is when your heart can’t pump enough blood to meet your body’s needs. Other possible complications include a problem with your heart’s rhythm or rate, called an arrhythmia."
