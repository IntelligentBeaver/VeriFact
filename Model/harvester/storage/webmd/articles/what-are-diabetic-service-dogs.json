        "To treat diabetes, a medicine called insulin can help keep your blood sugar levels from rising too high. But, a common side effect of insulin is hypoglycemia . This means your blood sugar level drops too low. Hypoglycemia can cause seizures and coma, so it’s important to treat it as soon as possible. ‌",

Some diabetic alert dogs are trained to paw, nudge, lick, or stare at you, while others are taught to jump, bark, or whine.
