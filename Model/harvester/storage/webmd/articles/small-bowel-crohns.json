Called a double-balloon enteroscopy, a doctor will use a long, flexible tube with a balloon on the end. They insert the scope either into your mouth or your colon or both. This makes it possible to see the entire length of your small bowel. As the scope moves, the balloon helps open parts of your small bowel that may be hard to get through because of narrowing."
