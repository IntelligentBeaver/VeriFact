        "Peripheral artery disease is when a sticky plaque made of cholesterol and fats builds up on artery walls. “Peripheral” means it forms in blood vessels outside the area of your heart or brain -- closer to your arms and legs. But it can also be in your feet, neck, hands, and belly. When these arteries narrow, it can slow down or stop blood flow to these parts of your body. You may feel no symptoms at all, or you may have pain in the affected areas. PAD raises your risk of having a heart attack or stroke .",
