        "Mirena is a small, flexible plastic, T-shaped system that slowly releases small amounts of a progestin hormone (levonorgestrel) into your uterus. It is the same hormone used in many birth control pills. It prevents pregnancy by thickening the mucus in your cervix to block sperm from reaching the uterus, affecting sperm so they cannot survive or function properly. It also causes thinning in the lining of your uterus, which can cause your menstrual bleeding to be less and make it less likely for a pregnancy to happen."

The people in the study had no history of ectopic pregnancy , no pelvic inflammatory disease in the prior 12 months, and most (70%) had used IUDs in the past.
