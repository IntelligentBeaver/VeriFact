Most people call it just dyspraxia, but the official diagnosis is developmental coordination disorder (DCD). You might also hear it called developmental dyspraxia. About 5%-6% of people in the U.S. have dyspraxia. That’s one in 20 people.",

        "Some people only find out they have dyspraxia when they’re adults. When they look back at their childhood, they might recognize symptoms that were either unnoticed or noticed but not diagnosed. However, dyspraxia in adults isn’t usually the same as it is in children. In children, dyspraxia (DCD) is a developmental disorder. In adults, the word is used more broadly. It can just mean you’re having trouble with things such as motor functions, working memory, organizing, and planning.",
        "There is also acquired dyspraxia that can affect you as an adult. This can happen when your dyspraxia symptoms begin after you have a stroke or brain injury.",
        "Dyspraxia is a condition that can affect many aspects of your child’s life, from fine motor issues (like getting dressed or writing) to gross motor functions (like walking, jumping, or balancing). There is no cure for it but early treatment could help your child adapt to having dyspraxia, lessening some symptoms. (Photo Credit: Brand X Pictures/Getty Images)"

        "Dyspraxia’s official name is developmental coordination disorder, and it can affect many aspects of your child’s life, from fine motor issues (difficulty getting dressed or writing) to gross motor functions (like walking, jumping, and keeping balance). It can even affect how your child behaves. There is no cure for it, but early intervention could help your child adapt to having dyslexia, making the symptoms less pronounced. School accommodations are also important to help children reach their potential."
