        "Crohn’s disease is a type of i nflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of your intestines. It can cause parts of your intestines to get swollen, irritated, and sore. Some people may be able to control their Crohn's disease with anti-inflammatory medicines or medicines that suppress the immune system, but some people with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease need an alternative medicine. Tremfya is a biologic medicine that can help with inflammation and other symptoms caused by Crohn's disease. Below you will find common questions and answers about Tremfya."

        "Tremfya is a type of medicine called a monoclonal antibody. It works by targeting a protein in your body called interleukin-23 (IL-23). IL-23 is a cytokine that causes inflammation in the body. Tremfya works in two ways: first by blocking IL-23 that has already been produced and second by binding to the CD-64 protein on cells and preventing it from producing more IL-23. This decreases inflammation that can cause symptoms of Crohn's disease."

        "Tremfya is a liquid that is put either under the skin (subcutaneous injection) or into a vein (intravenous injection). Your first three doses of Tremfya will be given as subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) injections every four weeks. After that, you will get one SC injection every eight weeks starting at week 16 or every four weeks starting at week 12. A health care provider, yourself, or a caregiver may inject Tremfya SC into the front of your thigh, lower stomach, or back of the upper arm. You should not inject into areas where the skin is tender, red, bruised, hard, or affected by psoriasis. You should also not inject within 2 inches of your navel (belly button). Each injection should be put into a different site. Tremfya IV must be given by a health care provider.",
        "Tremfya SC comes in three different dosage forms: a prefilled syringe, a one-press injector, and a prefilled pen. If your health care provider decides that you or a caregiver can inject Tremfya at home, you will get training on how to properly inject the medicine and your prescription should come with a “Instructions for Use” pamphlet.  All dosage forms are stored in the refrigerator and should be left at room temperature for 30 minutes before use. You can ask your health care provider or pharmacist if you have questions on how to inject Tremfya. If you miss a dose, you should take it as soon as you remember.",
        "Your health care provider may need to stop Tremya if you have problems with your liver or experience other severe side effects. Talk to your health care provider about all of your medical history so they can decide if Tremfya is right for you."
