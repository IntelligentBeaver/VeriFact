You also struggle with body image, such as believing you weigh more than you actually do. The key difference is that people with atypical anorexia have a higher body mass index (BMI) before they begin losing weight, so the signs of sudden weight loss are harder to see."

We should never make assumptions based on how someone looks.”",
