          "text": "Estrogen is a hormone that's higher in women and people assigned female at birth. Your estrogen levels go up and down around the time of your period and many people will get a migraine right before, during, or after your period. You may get fewer migraines or they may become less severe in the last trimester of pregnancy because your estrogen levels stabilize at this time. When you're in perimenopause (the time before menopause when your estrogen levels can go up and down a lot), you may get migraines more frequently and they may get more severe. Taking oral birth control pills which contain estrogen may also make your migraines worse.",
