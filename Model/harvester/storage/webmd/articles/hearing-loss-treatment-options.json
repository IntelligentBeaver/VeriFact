These bypass damaged parts of the ear and send signals directly to your auditory nerve that relays sound to the brain. A cochlear implant has a microphone that goes behind the ear and a transmitter that goes under the skin. Sound information goes to electrodes that a doctor puts in your inner ear through surgery.",
