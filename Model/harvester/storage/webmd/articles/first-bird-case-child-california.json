        "Nov. 25, 2024 — A child in California has been infected with bird flu .",
        "It’s the first case of H5N1 influenza in a minor, and the number of human infections in the U.S. this year has now reached 55, according to the CDC. The child had mild symptoms and was treated with flu antiviral medication.",
        "“There were low levels of viral material detected in the initial specimen collected, and follow-up testing of the child several days later was negative for H5 bird flu but was positive for other common respiratory viruses,” the CDC’s news release stated.",
        "All household members where the child lived had symptoms but tested negative for bird flu. Some family members tested positive for the same respiratory viruses that the child also had. An investigation is ongoing by California health officials to determine how the child may have been exposed to H5N1 influenza.",
        "California officials have documented 29 human cases of bird flu this year, mostly linked to exposure to sick cows. Bird flu was first detected in U.S. cattle in March. Since then, cases have been documented in dairy cow herds in 15 states . Other states with confirmed human bird flu cases are Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, Oregon, Texas, and Washington."
