        "Aug. 1, 2023 -- Millions of women in America don’t have adequate access to maternal health care and that number is growing, according to an annual report by the March of Dimes .",
        "“Maternity care deserts are counties where there’s limited or no access to birthing hospitals, birth centers offering obstetric care, or obstetric providers,” the report says. “Areas with low or no access to maternal care affect over 5.6 million women and nearly 350,000 births across the U.S.”",
        "The non-profit organization has released its data on maternity care access since 2018. This was the first March of Dimes report since the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the right to abortion last year.",
        "“The data consistently shows that access to maternity care continues to decline, and more resources are needed to make maternal health a priority,” it says.",
        "Since 2018, American hospitals have closed more than 300 birthing units. Hospitals in almost 10% of counties have lost obstetric services, the report says. And the number of “maternity care deserts” has grown by 4%."
