        "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) -- formerly called non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (NASLD) -- is a condition in which fat builds up in your liver. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is the late stage of MASLD when extra fat creates inflammation . This inflammation causes scarring ( cirrhosis ) that permanently damages your liver and can lead to liver failure.",
        "Once your liver stops working, a liver transplant may be the only treatment option. This surgery replaces your damaged liver with part or all of a liver from a donor. About 100 million Americans, or 25% of the population, have MASLD. MASH affects between 2%-5% of Americans overall, but up to 20% of people with obesity.",
        "MASH is the second leading cause of liver transplants in the United States, after alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Almost 1 in 3 people who needs a liver transplant has MASH.",
