        "Northern pike belongs to the family Esocidae , which consists of other fishes like pickerel, muskellunge, and mud minnows. Its scientific name is Esox lucius . Throughout the world, it's known by many other names, like American pike, common pike, snot rocket, grass pike, slough snake, gator, slough shark, water wolf, and, most commonly, jackfish.",
        "Pike fish are generally large in size, growing up to a length of 4 feet. A great way to identify them is by their flat, broad snout that looks similar to a duckbill. The color of these fish depends on where they come from. If you catch a pike from a clear lake or stream, it will usually have a light green color. In comparison, fish caught from a dark river or wetland have darker shades like dark green or brown.",
        "Northern pike, as its name suggests, is distributed throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere, including regions like Asia, Europe, North America, the Arctic, and Siberia. In North America, they can be found in great numbers in the Mississippi River basins and the Great Lakes. They're mostly seen in slow rivers or warm lakes, swimming in the weedy areas near fallen woods or log jams."

A 230 g or 8 oz serving of raw pike flesh contains about 0.5 g of omega-3s — essential fats that your body can't make on its own and that you have to get from food. Also, compared to other sources of animal protein, like chicken, duck, pork, and beef, pike has significantly lower amounts of saturated fats. These fats can raise your bad cholesterol levels and increase your chances of getting heart disease. So, the less of these fats a food has, the better."

It also plays a major role in building and repairing different tissues of your body. As a high-protein food, pike fish can help you build muscle mass, reduce muscle loss, and recover faster after injury or exercise. A protein-rich diet also controls hunger by keeping you full for a long time. So, eating pike can also help you maintain a healthy weight.",
