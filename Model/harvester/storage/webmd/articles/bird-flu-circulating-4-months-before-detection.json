        "May 3, 2024 – Bird flu was circulating in U.S. dairy cows for at least 4 months before it was discovered and confirmed to be the disease-causing H5N1 virus, according to an analysis of data by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Disease Center.",
        "It appears the virus moved from an infected bird to a dairy cow late last year or early this year, according to the study published on the bioRxiv server on Wednesday.",
        "The new analysis is another indication the bird flu strain has spread more widely than first believed. The strain has been found in cattle with no known connections to other infected herds, suggesting “there are affected herds that have not yet been identified,” the study said.",
        "The researchers came to their conclusions after analyzing a dump of genomic data by the USDA into a public repository on April 21. Researchers were concerned the data wasn’t released until almost 4 weeks after the March 25 announcement of the outbreak, according to Nature."
