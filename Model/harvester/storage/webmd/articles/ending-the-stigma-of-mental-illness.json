        "When I was in high school, the words “mental health” didn’t exist in my vocabulary. Among friends and family, there was no talk of therapy, the openness of struggle, or the vulnerability of brittle emotions. I didn’t even acknowledge the possibility of having anxiety or depression at that point in my life, instead blaming my frantic energy, constant worry, sadness, nightmares, fatigue, and irritability on the last-minute school project, the teenage fights with mom, the busy after-school activities, and the unrequited crush.",
        "In college, when I finally received a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), it felt good to have a name for the illnesses that made it increasingly difficult for me to function. But still, silence surrounded mental illness, and I didn’t see anyone publicly or personally acknowledging it. So I decided to.",
        "Through a personal blog I launched in 2015, and constant social media posts that I shared on the days I struggled with what it felt like to live with mental illness, and on my experiences through different treatment avenues, I began to connect with others who were also struggling. I came to a realization that would change the course, purpose, and passion of my life."

I wanted to be a voice for mental health advocacy. If anything would come from my intense daily emotions, it would be my words. If my depression and anxiety were meant for a greater purpose, it was for this. And in a profoundly melancholy way, this purpose gave me a beacon of hope that has lit my path toward recovery ever since.",

I think it will be a lifelong pursuit for many of us, for those of us who can share our stories and reveal the key to evaporating stigma -- believing in and sharing the sentiment that we are not alone.

In this subtle, insidious way, stigma continues to leak into our world, perpetuating the barriers to care that many people face.",
