        "A butt plug is a sex toy that goes in the anus. Butt plugs come in many shapes, sizes, and textures. They usually look like a cone – starting narrow and getting wider before narrowing again – but can also be long and ribbed. Some butt plugs vibrate or have a remote control function. They should also have a wide base to prevent the toy from going in too far.",
        "Unlike many other sexual toys, such as dildos, a butt plug is meant to remain in place during sexual play.",
        "Some people use butt plugs to prepare for anal sex. The tip of the plug stimulates nerve receptors in the anus, prostate, and vagina, which can also relax the anal muscles.",
        "It’s a common myth that only gay men like anal play. Sexual preferences vary from person to person, regardless of their sexual orientation , and any gender can enjoy using a butt plug.",
