        "Endometrial cancer is cancer of the endometrium, which is the inner lining of the uterus. This type of cancer is considered advanced when it has spread, or “advanced,” beyond the uterus and the cervix . This includes stage III and IV cancers. The places in the body affected by cancer outside the uterus are often referred to as “extrauterine sites.” The severity of the cancer depends, in part, on how many extrauterine sites are involved and how far they are from the uterus. Advanced endometrial cancers may involve only nearby tissue, such as the fallopian tubes or ovaries, or they may have spread, or “metastasized,” to more distant organs, such as the lungs."

Given that endometrial cancer cells have these hormone receptors, and hormone imbalances are often involved in endometrial cancer, experts believe estrogen and progesterone play a big part in the development of this type of cancer. Some risk factors for endometrial cancer, such as certain medications or health conditions, may cause hormone imbalances that lead to the cancer. Research also shows that certain genes that usually help prevent cancer can sometimes have defects that lead to the development of endometrial and other cancers. These defective genes can run in families, which makes some cancers hereditary. Defective genes can tell the cells in your uterus to multiply more quickly than normal and cause an overgrowth of tissue there. Cancer-promoting gene defects could also tell abnormal cells in your uterus to go on living when healthy cells would have died off. All this leads to extra cells in the uterus that can form tumors and become cancerous."

Studies show that Black women with endometrial cancer are more likely than White, Asian, or Hispanic women to have one of the more aggressive type II forms of the condition. These subtypes are more likely to become advanced cancers than type I. Black women also tend to have higher grade cancers – the ones more likely to grow fast and spread – at diagnosis than White women.",

Then they further subdivide the types based on what the cancer cells look like under the microscope. Type I Endometrioid adenocarcinoma , the most common type of endometrial cancer, is a type I cancer. This form of uterine cancer is usually connected with estrogen exposure. It’s less aggressive and has a generally good outlook. Type II This type includes several rare subtypes of endometrial cancer, such as: Serous carcinoma Clear cell carcinoma Carcinosarcoma Undifferentiated/dedifferentiated carcinoma These less common types of endometrial cancer tend to grow more quickly than type I disease and are more likely to spread to tissue outside of the uterus. Endometrial cancer grades Cancer grades are based on how different the cancer cells look from normal cells. The more they differ from normal cells, the more likely they are to grow and spread quickly. Grade I These cancer cells – also called low-grade or well differentiated – look very similar to normal cells. They usually grow slowly and are not as likely to spread as higher grade cells."

Also, cancers that have advanced to only one site beyond the uterus tend to have a better prognosis than those that have spread to multiple sites. Survival statistics for advanced endometrial cancer include all of these diverse cases, which helps explain the wide range in these numbers: 20%-60% of people diagnosed with stage III and stage IV endometrial cancer are alive five years later. 13%-65% of people survive five years after a recurrence of endometrial cancer. But the outlook may be improving. The FDA recently approved two existing immunotherapy drugs, dostarlimab (Jemperli ) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda ), to be used in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced endometrial cancer or cancer that has come back. Those drugs extended overall survival and progression-free survival in clinical trials. Other medications may be on the way. Several clinical trials to test new treatments for advanced endometrial cancer are currently recruiting and in progress at hospitals around the country and around the world.
