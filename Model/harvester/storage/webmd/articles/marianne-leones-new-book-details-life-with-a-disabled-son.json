        "When Marianne Leone learned she was pregnant in 1987, she and her husband, actor Chris Cooper -- seen in such movie hits as The Bourne Identity , Seabiscuit , and American Beauty -- were living in a tiny sixth-floor walk-up near New York City's Times Square. Money was tight, but the couple was ecstatic. \"I had a beautiful pregnancy,\" says Leone, who is best known for her role as Joanne Moltisanti, Christopher's mom, on HBO's The Sopranos . \"I didn't worry about a thing.\"",
        "But at 30 weeks, Leone went into labor and gave birth to a 3.5-pound boy, Jesse. After three days in the hospital, Jesse suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage, and doctors said he'd likely die within a week. Jesse survived, but his parents realized something was wrong when, at 4 months, he couldn't hold his head up.",
        "When Jesse was almost 2, doctors diagnosed him with cerebral palsy (CP) and seizure disorder. In her new memoir, Knowing Jesse: A Mother's Story of Grief , Grace, and Everyday Bliss , Leone tells the story of her life with Jesse, who died at 17 from a seizure. Jesse couldn't walk or talk, but he wrote poetry, swam, and inspired those around him to expand their definition of \"disabled.\""
