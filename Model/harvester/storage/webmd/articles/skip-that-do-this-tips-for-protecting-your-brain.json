        "June 24, 2025 – Not to state the obvious, but: You only get one brain. Take it for granted, and your odds of Alzheimer's and dementia increase as you age.",
        "Brain-boosting tips and products are everywhere, but most aren't backed by science. So for Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month (and the other 11 months), we asked experts: What's the most overhyped brain-protecting strategy, and what's the one more people should be using?",
        "Skip that: Taking nootropic supplements",
        "The hype: Sometimes marketed as smart drugs, memory enhancers, or brain boosters, nootropics promise to improve your thinking skills. The industry is enormous, amassing nearly $9 billion in global sales in 2022 – 40% of which came from the U.S.",
        "The reality: While prescription nootropics – like ADHD and Alzheimer's medications – are proven to work for their FDA-approved uses, evidence for over-the-counter supplements is thin, said Eva Feldman, MD, PhD, director of the NeuroNetwork for Emerging Therapies at the University of Michigan. Companies get away with vague claims of improved memory or brain function because the FDA only oversees products with specific health claims. That means most makers of these substances are never asked to prove their promises – or even that the supplement includes the ingredients on the label."
