        "Experts disagree on whether all men should get tested for prostate cancer and at what age screenings and the discussions about them should take place. Exams such as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test can help find cancer early. But there are questions about if the benefits of screening tests always outweigh the risks. Some groups suggest that men at a normal risk for prostate cancer should have prostate screening tests when they turn 50. Some men might want to get tests earlier if they have risk factors that make them more likely to get prostate cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force says that testing may be right for some men ages 55 to 69. They recommend that men talk to their doctor to discuss the potential risks and benefits of being tested. The American Cancer Society recommends starting screenings at age 50, possibly earlier for men at a high risk. But first, men should discuss the pros and cons of the PSA test with their doctor to decide if it's right for them. The American Urological Association says men ages 55 to 69 should talk to their doctor about the benefits and risks of a PSA test. The group also says: PSA screening in men under age 40 is not recommended. Routine screening in men between ages 40 and 54 at average risk is not recommended. To reduce the harms of screening, a routine screening interval of 2 years or more may be preferred over annual screening in men who have decided on screening after a discussion with their doctor. As compared to annual screening, it is expected that screening intervals of 2 years preserve the majority of the benefits and reduce over-diagnosis and false positives. Routine PSA screening is not recommended for most men over 70 or any man with less than a 10- to 15-year life expectancy. There are some men ages 70 and older who are in excellent health who may benefit from prostate cancer screening."
