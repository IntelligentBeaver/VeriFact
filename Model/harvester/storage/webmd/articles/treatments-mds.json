        "You can get supportive therapies by themselves or along with other treatments. MDS prevents young blood cells from growing into healthy mature cells in your bone marrow – the spongy tissue inside your bones. You need red blood cells to carry oxygen to your body, white blood cells to fight infections, and platelets to stop you from bleeding. A transfusion gives you the healthy blood cells your body needs. The new blood cells go into your bloodstream through a needle. After you've been getting transfusions for many years, too much iron can build up in your blood. Chelating agents are medicines that remove the extra iron. They come as a pill or as an IV you get under your skin. Growth factors Growth factors are man-made versions of hormones your body makes to increase your blood cell counts. Darbepoetin (Aranesp) and erythropoietin (Procrit) stimulate your bone marrow to make new red blood cells. Filgrastim (Neupogen), pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), and sargramostim (Leukine) help your body make new white blood cells."

One side effect of Revlimid is that it can lower white blood cell and platelet counts. Ivosidenib (Tibsovo) This is a medication for MDS with IDH1 mutations.

Chemotherapy The chemotherapy drugs azacitidine (Vidaza), decitabine (Dacogen), and decitabine-cedazuridine (Inqovi) slow the genes that help abnormal cells grow in MDS. These medicines also kill quickly dividing abnormal cells. They help your bone marrow work better. They reduce the number of unhealthy cells and increase healthy blood cells in your bone marrow. This relieves symptoms like tiredness and may help you need fewer blood transfusions. You might get other types of chemotherapy drugs if you have a lot of abnormal blood cells in your bone marrow, or if your MDS is turning into the cancer acute myeloid leukemia (AML)."
