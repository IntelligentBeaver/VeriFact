        "Cardamyst (etripamil) is a new nasal spray for treating sudden episodes of fast heartbeats, known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), and restoring a normal heart rhythm in adults. It is the first self-administered medicine approved by the FDA that can be used outside a hospital or an emergency room.",
        "PSVT affects about 2 million people in the U.S. It is a type of abnormal heart rhythm where your heart suddenly beats very fast — often over 150 beats per minute; this can lead to symptoms like chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or fainting. As PSVT episodes can occur without warning and may last from a few minutes to several hours (sometimes leading to frequent hospital visits), people with PSVT often feel anxious, which affects their daily activities.",
        "Cardamyst works by blocking certain calcium channels in the heart, which slows down electrical signals in a key part of the heart (the atrioventricular node) and relaxes blood vessels. The medicine helps return the heart to a normal rhythm by interrupting abnormal electrical signals that cause rapid heartbeats in individuals with PSVT."

        "The FDA’s approval of Cardamyst was based on clinical studies that showed it was well tolerated, safe, and effective in treating people with PSVT and helped in restoring a normal heart rhythm faster than a placebo.",
        "The FDA’s approval was also based on a large clinical trial program that included safety data from more than 1,800 participants and over 2,000 PSVT episodes. Key evidence came from a phase 3 trial comparing Cardamyst with a placebo, in which 64% of patients who used the medicine versus 31% of those on the placebo returned to a normal heart rhythm within 30 minutes. Patients using Cardamyst were about twice as likely to return to a normal heart rhythm and did so more than three times faster than those on the placebo (median conversion time, 17 minutes versus 54 minutes). By one hour, 73% of patients treated with Cardamyst had converted to a normal rhythm.",
        "Cardamyst worked well even for people already taking other heart medicines such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.",
        "The most common side effects reported in the trial were mild and temporary and included nasal discomfort, a stuffy or runny nose, throat irritation, and nosebleeds."
