        "Broken bones are more common in children than in adults. In adults, bones are stronger than ligaments (which connect bones to other bones) and tendons (which connect bones to muscles). But in children, ligaments and tendons are relatively stronger than bone or cartilage. As a result, injuries that may only cause a sprain in an adult may cause a broken bone in a child. However, a child's forefoot is generally flexible and very resilient to injuries of any kind. When metatarsal or phalangeal fractures do occur, they may be difficult to recognize, because many parts of a growing child's bone do not show up well on X-rays. For this reason, it is sometimes helpful to get X-rays of the child's other, uninjured foot to compare to the hurt foot."

        "Metatarsal fractures usually heal well. The first metatarsal (the one attached to the big toe) sometimes requires a cast or surgery and a prolonged period on crutches, but the middle 3 metatarsals can usually be treated with a rigid flat-bottom shoe and partial weight bearing. \"March fracture\" is a metatarsal stress fracture that commonly occurs in joggers and requires stopping jogging for 4-6 weeks.",
        "The fifth metatarsal (the one attached to the pinkie toe) is the most commonly broken bone in the midfoot. There are 2 general types. One type is the proximal avulsion fracture. These are very common and usually happen at the same time as a sprained ankle . They heal very well with a rigid flat-bottom shoe or elastic bandage and weight bearing as tolerated. The other type is the Jones fracture, which is much less common but does not heal as well. This fracture gets worse with time if you keep walking on it, so non-weight bearing is very important. People with this fracture are more likely to develop problems healing that require an operation.",
        "Fractures at the joint between the cuneiforms and the metatarsals are called Lisfranc fractures. These are rare, but can be difficult to diagnose and treat. Weight-bearing X-rays (taken while standing on the injured foot) are sometimes needed to look for this problem. These fractures sometimes require surgery.",
        "Navicular fractures are rare and most often represent stress fractures in young athletes. They usually heal well with a rigid flat-bottom shoe and weight bearing as tolerated. Severe fractures through navicular bone sometimes require surgery.",
        "Calcaneal fractures often occur in people who fall from a height and land on their feet. These people often have other injuries as well, so they should be examined carefully. The most common fracture of the calcaneus, the intraarticular joint depression fracture, usually requires surgery. Other fractures of the calcaneus can usually be treated with splints or casts and non-weight bearing.",
        "There are many types of Talar fractures, some of which are difficult to diagnose and treat. Lateral process fractures often occur from snowboarding injuries. Posterior process (Shepherd) fractures are found in athletes who dance or kick. The diagnosis of these injuries often cannot be made in the doctor's office or emergency department on the initial visit and require bone scans or other studies if symptoms continue. Treatments vary but often require splints or casts and a period of non-weight bearing."
