        "Are you experiencing discomfort in your upper back due to ankylosing spondylitis? Trust me, I know the feeling all too well.",
        "I remember when I worked in my finance positions, hunched over my desk, buried in mountains of paperwork, and trying my best to meet impossible deadlines. My upper back stiffness felt like it would never end, and it was an unwelcome silent work partner that drained my physical and mental energy.",
        "I’ve come a long way since then. Fortunately, I've learned a thing or two about managing upper back pain with AS. Here are 10 tips to protect your back.",
        "1. Mind Your Posture",
        "Let's start with the basics. Good posture is key to relieving and preventing upper back pain. Whether you're sitting at your desk or standing, make a conscious effort to keep your back straight and shoulders relaxed. Avoid slouching or leaning forward for extended periods.",
        "2. Take Breaks and Stretch",
        "Don't underestimate the power of a short break. Set a timer to remind yourself to stand up, stretch, and move around every 25 minutes while working. During your 5-minute break, do simple stretches like shoulder rolls or chest openers to relieve tension in your upper back."
