The latest thinking is that any single-ingredient food -- meat, fruit, vegetables, or cereal -- is a good starting point as long as it covers the bases of small, soft, and smooth. While meat might be a surprise to some parents, it's a good choice because it's high in iron that's better absorbed by babies than the iron in infant cereal.",

        "Hold off giving your baby whole milk until 1 year. When it comes to introducing yogurt, most pediatricians recommend waiting until your baby is 9 months or older. It's processed, so the milk protein is more tolerable than that in whole milk. Before this age, babies have a limited amount of lactase enzyme (which helps digest lactose).",
        "Routine, routine, routine. Feed your baby in the same place every meal, every day, while she is seated in a secured seat. Don't let your baby eat on the run -- it not only poses a choking hazard, but it also sets the stage for eating battles when she grows into toddlerhood."
