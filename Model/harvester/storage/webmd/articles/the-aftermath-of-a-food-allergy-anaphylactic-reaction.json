        "My son had a few reactions when he was a baby, during the time that we were going through the diagnosis process. He had more reactions as an adolescent and teen as he grew into additional food allergies as we navigated additional diagnosis, coupled with accidental exposure. We were very lucky to go for several years between his initial diagnosis as a toddler, and later as a teenager, with no anaphylactic reactions. The most that happened during that long stretch were minor contact reactions by way of hives when traveling or dining out.",
        "The First Anaphylactic Reaction",
        "He has experienced two anaphylactic reactions. One was to peanut that led to an ER visit, and eventual peanut diagnosis, and the other led to another ER visit and confirmation of garlic allergy.",
        "He had several “minor” reactions to peanut from about 8 months old until about 18 months old. We were young parents in early 2000, and there just wasn’t the education and awareness that exist today. We didn’t realize that food allergies are unpredictable. What caused a mild reaction in the past may cause an anaphylactic reaction in the future, and vice versa."

        "When I was introducing him to his first peanut butter and jelly sandwich as a toddler, I had given him peanut previously and never had more than hives. We were never advised to get testing done, avoid the allergen, or otherwise. At the time, we were not completely sure he even had a peanut allergy. Prior to this anaphylactic reaction, he had what many would call a “mild allergy” at best. However, when introduced to the sandwich, he suffered from hives, swelling, closing of airways, pain, and seemed to be losing consciousness.",
        "I grabbed my baby and ran to the car, no shoes, no purse, and raced to the local hospital emergency room. I ran in with him in my arms, past the check-in desk, to the first nurse I saw and frantically exclaimed that I had given him peanut. They quickly assessed my son and whisked him away; IVs and monitors and his sweet tiny little body on a large hospital gurney. They saved his life. I will be forever grateful."

        "The second anaphylactic reaction he experienced was years later when we were going through the diagnosis process of new allergies that he was “growing into.” For over 10 years, he was only allergic to peanut and shellfish. He was beginning to react to what seemed like every food. That was because he was now also allergic to garlic, which is in a good number of foods. Since it is not a top 9 allergen, it is often hidden as “natural flavor,” “spices,” and “seasonings.” Pizza, chicken nuggets, soup, potato chips, hot dogs, ketchup, barbecue sauce, sausage, macaroni and cheese, salsa, ranch dressing, teriyaki, and tacos are just a few of the foods that usually contain garlic.",

It started off as a stomachache and quickly escalated to anaphylaxis. One of his church leaders, who also happens to be anaphylactic to bee stings and familiar with epinephrine, administered epinephrine immediately. Symptoms did not subside, and he was given a second dose before being transported to the local hospital emergency room.",

However, for me as his parent, it was like ripping open what were thought to be healed wounds and reliving past trauma in addition to experiencing the more recent trauma, yet this time, all at once."

He also said that for him, surprisingly, the auto-injectors didn’t hurt, and that helped ease the fear of the auto-injector being administered that he may have previously felt."
