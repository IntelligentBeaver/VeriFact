        "Wheat is a staple in the diets of cultures all over the world. It’s known to have been cultivated in Europe and Asia as far back as 9,000 years ago. Today, people eat grains to maintain a healthy, balanced diet . Grains and cereals like wheat contain complex carbohydrates , vitamins, and minerals.",
        "The wheat plant is a long grass that has a spike at the top. The spike contains wheat berries, anywhere from 20 to 100 berries per plant. Each wheat berry has three parts: the bran , endosperm, and the germ.",
        "The bran is the skin on the outside of the wheat berry. The endosperm, what makes up most of a wheat berry, is inside the bran. The germ is the part of the wheat berry that sprouts to grow into a new plant. When wheat is being refined into white flour, usually the bran and the germ are removed.",
        "However, the germ is the healthiest part of the wheat berry. Even though it’s quite small, only about 3% of the wheat berry, it’s a nutritional powerhouse. You can add wheat germ to many different foods to experience its health benefits."
