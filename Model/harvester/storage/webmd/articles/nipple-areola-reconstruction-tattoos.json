        "After you’ve had breast reconstruction surgery following a mastectomy or lumpectomy , there’s one more possible step. You’ll need to decide if and how you’d like to have your nipple -- and areola, the colored area around it -- reconstructed. This part of the process usually comes about 3 to 4 months post-op, when the new breast mound has healed.",
        "Nipple and areola reconstruction after breast reconstruction can boost your body image and help you adjust psychologically to the many changes in your body. The goal is to make the new breast or breasts look as much like your natural breasts as possible.",
        "Nipple and areola reconstruction seeks to re-create all the features of your natural breast, including the position, size, color, shape, texture, and how far your natural nipple projects outward. Your plastic surgeon might use tissue from your new breast or graft skin from another part of your body. Or you might opt for nipple tattooing -- an effective, and increasingly popular, way to create gradients of color and a three-dimensional look to match your other breast.",
        "Most reconstruction options are outpatient, meaning you can go home the same day, whether the procedure takes place in the operating room or the surgeon’s office."
