        "Studies have shown that the rates of Crohn’s and IBD increase when people move to countries where the disease is more common. Finding out why may lead to greater understanding about how your environment contributes to IBD. Symptoms of Crohn’s can appear anywhere along the digestive tract. They can also show up outside the GI tract, affecting the skin , eyes, joints, kidneys, bones, and sometimes the liver. Data suggests that the areas of the GI tract impacted by Crohn’s and a person’s symptoms can differ among racial and ethnic groups. For example, Crohn’s inflammation appears more extensively throughout the intestines for Asian, Black, and Latino people than for white people. They also were more likely to report symptoms of Crohn’s outside the intestine, including joint pain. Latino people were more likely to have Crohn’s-related red, tender nodules under the skin called erythema nodosum . Black people were more likely to have eye complications such as irritation or swelling."
