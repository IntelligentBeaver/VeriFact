        "When you're the parent of a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, every day can bring something unexpected. Talking out of turn, arguing with their siblings, losing things, and having trouble paying attention are just some of the behaviors that go along with this common childhood developmental disorder. Kids act in these ways because ADHD affects their executive functions – the brain activities that help with skills like organization, planning, impulse control, and attention. Without these functions, kids may struggle to finish tasks, manage their time, and control their behaviors and impulses. That's where routines can help. Along with medications and therapy, routines are an important part of managing ADHD. Adding order and structure to your child's day by following an established schedule can help them feel more in control and make life easier for everyone in the family."

        "Because their brain matures differently, kids with ADHD don't respond well to sudden changes. They may get upset when you introduce something new, especially when that new thing is something they don't like to do, like homework or showering. The situation can quickly escalate into an argument or behavior problem when kids are asked to do something they didn't expect or want. Following a routine reduces pushback and arguments because the day is planned and there are no surprises. When you ask your child to take a shower at 7:30 p.m., they expect it because they have done the same thing every day. Adding a reward after the task, like reading a book together once they're showered and ready for bed, can be another incentive to reinforce positive behaviors."

Set aside time for exercise. Kids with ADHD get fidgety when they sit still for too long. They'll have an easier time focusing once they've burned off any pent-up energy. Research finds that exercise alters the same brain chemicals and structures as prescription ADHD medicines. The result is less hyperactivity and better focus.

        "Up to half of people with ADHD have trouble sleeping. A bedtime routine calms their brain activity to make it easier for them to fall asleep. You might get your child ready for sleep by reading to them, listening to relaxing music, giving them a warm bath, and turning the lights down low. Being out of school in the summertime can throw off your family's normal routine. Try to stay on schedule as much as possible. That includes waking up, going to bed, eating, and taking their medicines at the same time each day as they did during the school year. But be flexible. Your child also needs the freedom to just have fun. Let them plan some of their summertime activities and adjust the schedule from time to time. Teach routine self-management. You can set up and manage daily routines at first, but helping your child learn how to do it themselves is an important step toward independence. Gradually let your child take a more active role in managing their days. Research finds that children who are able to manage their own routines are more self-sufficient later in life."
