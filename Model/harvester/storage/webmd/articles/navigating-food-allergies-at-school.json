        "Throughout most of the day, your children are at school, not to mention any after-school or extracurricular activities. After the allergy plans are completed and the medications are at the school and up to date, we parents are thinking about the next thing: How are the kids doing? Have they been participating in class? Are they eating their food? Do they have any exciting field trips coming up?",
        "These are just a few of the many questions that cross my mind throughout the school year. I try to alleviate my concerns by actively participating in their school life as much as I can. Juggling a full-time job and caring for a new baby at home presents its challenges, but it's all manageable.",

        "While academics are certainly a crucial aspect of school, social skills and emotional intelligence also play a major part. Interaction with peers during class projects, birthday parties, holiday celebrations, or even snack time can all involve some sort of food. Here are a few ways I manage those situations:"

        "Collaborate with teachers. Establishing strong relationships with my children's teachers is crucial. Serving on the PTO board helps me form these connections. At the beginning of each school year, I send an introductory email emphasizing inclusion for my girls and my willingness to contribute to the classroom in various ways. That might include having a stash of safe treats available or ensuring that the classroom is a nut-free zone. Although my girls are outgrowing some of their food allergies, I try to send alternative snacks that do not carry the top nine allergens in case there are other kids who need alternative options.",
        "Educate classmates. I've found that children are incredibly supportive once they understand food allergies. By teaching food allergy protocols to the class, my daughters' teachers help foster awareness and inclusion, reducing the risk of accidental exposure. Encouraging frequent handwashing, especially after meals and snacks; discouraging sharing food; and making clear which food items not to bring into the classroom are a few ways that teachers can educate their students. This can go a long way in preventing cross-contamination and keeping your child safe.",
        "Check in regularly . I keep the lines of communication open, reminding teachers and school administration that I'm available to contact anytime. I also check in periodically with my children's teachers to see how things are going and address any issues promptly. This helps prevent future problems."

Since my daughters are still learning to read food labels, I emphasize that they should not share their food with others or accept food from anyone else.

I have been fortunate to be a chaperone on all field trips. However, it’s good practice to speak with the trip organizer to ensure accommodations are made."
