        "Acceptance, in the recovery community, is more of a verb than a noun. At least for anyone serious about committing to truly changing their lives, it requires action. The word has been said at least once at every 12-step meeting I've ever been to, if only in the closing prayer.",
        "When I was 6 years old, as my mother lay in a hospital bed that alcohol helped put her in, I accepted I couldn't change that, or her. Right then and there, I accepted her for who and what she was, even if she has yet to do so herself almost 30 years later.",
        "All of which is to say, I saw from an early age what a lack of acceptance does to a person. Refusing to admit you have a problem doesn't make it any less life-altering or bad. It's akin to not testing for a deadly virus in hopes of bringing the infection rate down. Not being willing to accept the truth doesn't make it any less true."

There's nothing I can do about that today.",

Now if I could only learn to genuinely accept the fact that not everyone feels that way, and that it’s a condition you have to go through yourself to truly understand, I'd be golden.",
