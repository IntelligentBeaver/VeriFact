        "Mar. 20, 2025 -- Every year on March 30th, World Bipolar Day shines a light on bipolar disorder , a condition often misunderstood. But what exactly is bipolar disorder, and how does it differ from unipolar depression? We spoke with Holly A. Swartz, MD , professor of psychiatry and president of the International Society for Bipolar Disorders, to break it all down. She explains the hallmark signs of mania and hypomania, how stressors can trigger episodes, and the latest treatment options, including therapy and medication. Plus, we explore the powerful impact of stable daily rhythms in managing mood and fostering long-term well-being.",

In this episode, we'll explore what distinguishes bipolar disorder from unipolar depression and why identifying mania or hypomania is crucial to getting the right treatment. We'll also explore the biologic underpinnings that make someone vulnerable to bipolar disorder in the first place, and why routine—even something as simple as going to bed at the same time each night—can become a powerful tool for mood stabilization. Most importantly, we'll learn about the therapies, both medical and behavioral, that can stabilize mood, build resilience, and allow people with bipolar disorder to live life on their own terms."

        "So this can be really confusing to people because the depressions themselves are pretty much the same in all three disorders. Our duration criteria for depression is two weeks—so at least two weeks of feeling down, having lower interest in things nearly every day, most of the day, and then accompanied by a bunch of symptoms, which, in my mind, are the opposite of mania.",
        "You can either have more sleep or less sleep in depression, but for folks with bipolar disorder, it's actually usually the more-sleep version of this. It can affect your appetite—having decreased or increased appetite—feeling hopeless, feeling slowed down, often accompanied by suicidal thoughts.",
        "So these are some of the symptoms that are required, in addition to low mood, to make a diagnosis of a major depressive episode. And it is, as I said, the same across those disorders, although there are some clues that might suggest that the episode is related to bipolar disorder versus major depressive disorder, which we also call unipolar disorder because it's just one pole—just the depression—not the bipolar disorder, which involves both sides of mood dysregulation."

  "meta_description": "Every year on March 30th, World Bipolar Day shines a light on bipolar disorder, a condition often misunderstood. But what exactly is bipolar disorder, and how does it differ from unipolar depression? We spoke with Holly A. Swartz, MD, professor of psychiatry and president of the International Society for Bipolar Disorders, to break it all down. She explains the hallmark signs of mania and hypomania, how stressors can trigger episodes, and the latest treatment options, including therapy and medication. Plus, we explore the powerful impact of stable daily rhythms in managing mood and fostering long-term well-being.",
