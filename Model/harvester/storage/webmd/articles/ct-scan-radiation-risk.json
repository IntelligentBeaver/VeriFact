        "May 8, 2025 – If you’ve ever hesitated before getting a CT scan , you’re not alone. A recent study linked 5% of all new cancer cases to radiation exposure from CT scans – a finding that’s raised concern among patients. But experts say avoiding a CT scan when you need one can be dangerous.",
        "“Generally, if a patient is getting a one-time CT to address a problem, the risk of that CT is very, very low,” said radiologist Mustafa Bashir, MD, associate vice chair for research in the department of radiology at Duke University Health System in North Carolina.",
        "“The times we might get concerned are in repeated screening — for example, if a patient needs repeated scans annually or more frequently over many, many years. In those cases, we would want to consider radiation-free techniques like MRI ,” said Bashir, the former director of MRI at Duke. “This is particularly true for children.”",
        "CT scan use has risen dramatically in recent years, prompting researchers to explore potential cancer risks — though these studies (including the one mentioned above) can’t prove a causal link."
