Those 10 years to 18 years old with celiac disease were almost four times more likely to have what’s known as delayed menarche, in which a girl does not begin menstruating by age 15 or within 3 years from the time adult breasts start to form. In the next age group, women 19 to 35, those with celiac disease had higher rates of polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS , endometriosis, and infertility. Women 36 to 45 with celiac disease also had higher rates of these three disorders, as well as menopausal disorders including premature menopause . Women 46 to 60 also had higher rates of menopausal disorders if they were diagnosed with celiac disease."
