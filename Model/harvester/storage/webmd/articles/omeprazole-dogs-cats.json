        "Omeprazole (GastroGard, Prilosec, UlcerGard) is a medicine classified as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).  It reduces the amount of acid that is in your pet’s stomach. It is used to treat and prevent ulcers (open sores) in the esophagus , throat, stomach, and intestines.  It is more effective for preventing ulcers than medicines called histamine-2 (H2) blockers such as famotidine (Pepcid), especially long-term.  It can also be given to dogs as part of a combination of medicine to treat bacteria called helicobacter, which can infect the stomach and cause ulcers.",
        "All uses for omeprazole in dogs and cats are considered to be “off-label” or “extra-label.” This means that there may be evidence of safe and effective use but it is not approved by the FDA for dogs or cats.",
        "There is no veterinary-specific formulation for dogs or cats. There is an oral paste that is FDA-approved for horses. The human medicine, which can be used in animals, is available in oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, and granules. Omeprazole tablets and orally disintegrating tablets are available over-the-counter (OTC) without a prescription. The granules require a veterinary prescription and are available from human pharmacies. Since none of these products are formulated specifically for dogs or cats, discuss this with your veterinarian so that you get the right amount for your pet. Contact your veterinary compounding pharmacy for alternative dosing options."
