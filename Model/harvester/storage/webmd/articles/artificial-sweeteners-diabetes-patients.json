        "Yes, they can. Artificial sweeteners are just as sweet — and sometimes, up to 700 times sweeter — than regular sugar, but they have no calories and don’t affect your blood sugar (glucose). While sugar is absorbed into your bloodstream and sent to your cells to be turned into energy, artificial sweeteners stay in your digestive tract until they pass in your stool or urine.",
        "The FDA has approved six different types of artificial sweeteners for use, and most are much sweeter than table sugar. (Credit: David Tonelson/Dreamstime)",
        "“Artificial sweeteners can help a person with diabetes reduce sugar intake without feeling suddenly deprived of foods that are sweet-tasting while having a much lower impact on glucose levels than real sugar,” says Amy Roak, MS, RDN, CCSD, LD, CDES, with Northside Hospital Diagnostic Clinic in Gainesville, Georgia.",
        "Roak says there are many sugar substitutes for people with diabetes, and you should talk to your doctor about how much of each sweetener you can safely consume."
