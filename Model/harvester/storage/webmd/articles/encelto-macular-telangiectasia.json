If this occurs, it is unknown how long the symptoms will last, and you should take some precautions. Your driving may be impaired. You may have trouble seeing objects, pedestrians, or road signs when moving from bright light to dim light. You may have trouble navigating dark environments. Consider using a flashlight, nightlight, or motion-activated lighting. Consider wearing sunglasses or tinted lenses in bright light to help you transition from light to dark.",

Your health care provider will examine the placement of Encelto six months after surgery and then every year while the capsule is in your eye. If your implant is out of position, it can be repositioned by your eye surgeon. Symptoms of implant extrusion can include: Uveitis (eye inflammation) Vitreous hemorrhage Eye pain occurring more than one year after implantation Visibility of part of the Encelto capsule",
