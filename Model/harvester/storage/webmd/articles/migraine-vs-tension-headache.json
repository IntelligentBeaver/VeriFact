You might have them every once in a while, and they may disappear within a few hours. Or they may happen more often and last all day. They can be uncomfortable and distracting but usually aren't serious enough to keep you from doing your everyday activities.",

        "The kind of symptoms you get, how long they last, and the intensity of your head pain can be very different for tension headache vs. migraine.",
