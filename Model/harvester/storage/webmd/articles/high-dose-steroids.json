        "High-dose steroids are medicines that kill B cells in your body. B cells are white blood cells that usually protect you against infections. B cells change and turn cancerous if you have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Corticosteroids, or “steroids” for short, are sometimes used for CLL. Though steroids have an effect on B cells, they don’t directly target a specific protein that’s involved in B-cell growth. That’s why they are considered “untargeted” drugs."

At most pharmacies, the average retail cost of dexamethasone 4 mg is $27.72 for a 10-tablet pack. These prices are relatively inexpensive compared to the cost of other drugs. But you may also take other pricey medications. For instance, rituximab (Rituxan), which is often taken with steroids, can cost hundreds of dollars, depending on the pharmacy you visit. This price doesn’t take insurance into account. Pharmacy coupons can help lower the cost of drugs. Also, some nonprofit organizations may offer financial assistance.

        "The price of steroids varies. The amount you pay will depend on your dose, the pharmacy you use, and your insurance coverage. Some online drug information sites estimate these costs: Without insurance, the retail cost of a 21-tablet pack of methylprednisolone 4 mg runs around $18.68. At most pharmacies, the average retail cost of dexamethasone 4 mg is $27.72 for a 10-tablet pack. These prices are relatively inexpensive compared to the cost of other drugs. But you may also take other pricey medications. For instance, rituximab (Rituxan), which is often taken with steroids, can cost hundreds of dollars, depending on the pharmacy you visit. This price doesn’t take insurance into account. Pharmacy coupons can help lower the cost of drugs. Also, some nonprofit organizations may offer financial assistance. Here are some possible resources: American Cancer Society Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Patient Advocate Foundation NeedyMeds CancerCare RxAssist"
