        "Ever hear the term \" bronchial asthma \" and wonder what it means? When people talk about bronchial asthma, they are really talking about asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that causes periodic \"attacks\" of coughing , wheezing , shortness of breath, and chest tightness.",
        "According to the CDC, more than 25 million Americans, including 6.8 million children under age 18, suffer from asthma today.",
        "Allergies are strongly linked to asthma and to other respiratory diseases such as chronic sinusitis , middle ear infections, and nasal polyps . Most interestingly, a recent analysis of people with asthma showed that those who had both allergies and asthma were much more likely to have nighttime awakening due to asthma, miss work because of asthma, and require more powerful medications to control their symptoms.",
        "Asthma is associated with mast cells, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes. Mast cells are the allergy -causing cells that release chemicals like histamine . Histamine is the substance that causes nasal stuffiness and dripping in a cold or hay fever , constriction of airways in asthma, and itchy areas in a skin allergy . Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell associated with allergic disease. T lymphocytes are also white blood cells associated with allergy and inflammation .",
        "These cells, along with other inflammatory cells, are involved in the development of airway inflammation in asthma that contributes to the airway hyperresponsiveness, airflow limitation, respiratory symptoms, and chronic disease. In certain individuals, the inflammation results in the feelings of chest tightness and breathlessness that's often felt at night ( nocturnal asthma ) or in the early morning hours. Others only feel symptoms when they exercise (called exercise -induced asthma). Because of the inflammation, the airway hyperresponsiveness occurs as a result of specific triggers."
