If you get one headache or migraine after another and over-the-counter (OTC) pain relief doesn’t help, you do have options. A headache specialist can help.",

Researchers aren't sure of all of adenosine's effects, but they do know it calms your brain's electrical activity and opens up your blood vessels. Caffeine blocks some of these actions. But if you use caffeine every day, you develop a tolerance to it, and it has less effect on your brain's electrical activity and blood vessel size. So, caffeine withdrawal may lead to a significant increase in blood flow in your brain, which can trigger a headache ."

        "Dehydration is when the amount of fluid that’s leaving your body (through sweat and urine) is more than the amount you’re taking in. When you’re dehydrated, your brain and other tissues in your body shrink. As your brain shrinks, it pulls away from the skull, which puts pressure on your nerves and causes pain. Even mild dehydration can cause a headache. The pain may be throbbing and constant. You'll usually also have other symptoms, such as dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, muscle cramps, and dark pee. The human thirst mechanism isn't very efficient, so if you're feeling thirsty, you're probably already a little dehydrated. Drink water throughout your day, not just when you're thirsty.",
        "Headaches and sleep",
        "About 50%-75% of people with headache disorder also have insomnia. Researchers aren't sure if the headache disorder causes insomnia or if it's the other way around. But it's clear that not getting enough sleep or getting too much sleep can trigger headaches, especially migraine attacks. For instance, getting too little sleep the night before can change the way your body processes pain signals. The key to avoiding sleep-related headaches is to have a regular sleep schedule that works for you. You may not need 8 hours every night, but you should aim for consistently getting enough sleep so that you feel well-rested and headache-free every day."
