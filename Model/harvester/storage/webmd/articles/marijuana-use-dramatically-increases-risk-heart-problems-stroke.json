        "Nov. 6, 2023 – Regularly using marijuana can significantly increase a person’s risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke , according to a pair of new studies that will be presented at a major upcoming medical conference.",
        "People who use marijuana daily have a 34% increased risk of heart failure, compared to people who don’t use the drug, according to one of the new studies.",
        "The new findings leverage health data from 157,000 people in the National Institutes of Health “All of Us” research program. Researchers analyzed whether marijuana users were more likely to experience heart failure than non-users over the course of nearly 4  years. The results said that coronary artery disease was behind marijuana users’ increased risk. (Coronary artery disease is the buildup of plaque on the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart.)",
        "The research was conducted by a team at Medstar Health, a large Maryland health care system that operates 10 hospitals plus hundreds of clinics. The findings will be presented next weekend at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2023 in Philadelphia."
