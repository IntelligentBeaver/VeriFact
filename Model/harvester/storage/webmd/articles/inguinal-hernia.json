        "An inguinal hernia is when tissue from inside your abdomen (your belly) pokes through a weak spot in your muscles. Your abdominal muscles protect organs such as your intestine, pancreas, and liver. They reach all the way down to your groin, which is where an inguinal hernia can form.",
        "It’s named for the inguinal canal, which is a passage in your lower abdominal wall that has blood vessels and nerves. In men, the spermatic cord (a group of nerves, vessels, and ducts that connects the testes to the abdomen) passes through the inguinal canal; in women, it holds ligaments that support the uterus.",
        "An inguinal hernia could be a serious health problem, so don't ignore symptoms such as pain in your groin when you cough or lift something heavy. A physical exam is usually all it takes to diagnose the problem. If the hernia is large, you may need surgery to fix it.",
