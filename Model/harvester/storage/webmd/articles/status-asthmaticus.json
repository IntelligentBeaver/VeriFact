        "Status asthmaticus is respiratory failure that comes with the worst form of acute severe asthma , or an asthma attack. If an attack comes on quickly and it doesn’t respond to regular treatment, it can lead to status asthmaticus, If it happens, you may have to go to the hospital to get it treated. If you have a bad asthma attack and your rescue inhaler or your nebulizer doesn't help, you need medical care right away.",
        "If you have a steroid medicine at home (such as prednisone ), you can take a dose of it on your way to the emergency room.",
        "Many people have asthma. And there are many treatments to manage it. It’s important to follow the asthma action plan that you made with your doctor, avoid your triggers, take your medicine, and keep up with your doctor appointments.",
        "Still, asthma attacks can happen, and some severe ones are an emergency.",
        "With any asthma attack, never wait to see if it goes away on its own. It could worsen so much that you need to go to a hospital.",
        "You may hear a severe asthma attack called a “severe asthma exacerbation.” In its most severe form, you may hear it called status asthmaticus."
