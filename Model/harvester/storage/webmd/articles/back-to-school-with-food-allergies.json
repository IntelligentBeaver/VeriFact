The prospect of new teachers, activities, or even new schools should be fun, but for families managing food allergies, it means an added layer of planning. It involves setting up and taking the proper precautions regarding your kids' food allergies. While navigating food allergies can be challenging, with preparation and communication, it does not have to be overwhelming.",

        "I arrange meetings with the principal, nurse, homeroom teachers, and the cafeteria manager to discuss my daughters’ food allergies. As we are now in our fourth year at the same school, I prefer to have these discussions via formal emails for written documentation and then have quick in-person follow-ups for any verbal clarifications that may be needed. Even though my daughters bring their own packed lunches and snacks, it is important that the cafeteria staff be aware of their allergies in case the girls forget their food or any unforeseen circumstances arise. This is a good time to review updated allergy action plans and the storage location for medications such as epinephrine auto-injectors, and to clarify any policies regarding food in the classroom, including parties and in-class projects involving food. It is crucial for my girls to be included in class projects, so I kindly request the teachers to contact me for additional safe treats for the classroom. This allows me to provide alternatives for my daughters so they can participate alongside their classmates."

        "Self-advocacy is a crucial skill in my household. We have been practicing since the original food allergy diagnosis. We often practice scenarios through role playing, such as what to do if another student or adult offers food. It's important to differentiate between peers and adults as they can respond differently. We also discuss recognizing allergic reaction symptoms and how to communicate them. Teaching my daughters to manage their allergies and speak up if they feel something is wrong is essential because we can't be with them all the time. I also emphasize the importance of not sharing food with others. Practicing these situations helps my daughters feel confident and prepared for school.",
        "When your child with food allergies goes back to school, it requires extra planning and precautions. However, it doesn't have to be a source of constant worry. By being proactive, communicating openly, and educating those around you, you can help ensure that your child has a safe, healthy, and enjoyable school year. Remember, you're not alone in this journey – there's a whole community of parents, teachers, and health care professionals ready to support you. So take a deep breath, trust in your preparations, and let your child thrive in the new school year!"
