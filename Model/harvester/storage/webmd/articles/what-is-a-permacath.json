        "A Permacath is a catheter, a special IV device, that medical professionals insert into a blood vessel, likely in your neck. Permacaths, aka permanent catheters, allow less interrupted access to your bloodstream over an extended period. They can be used for several medical procedures, such as administering medicines and apheresis, which is a technique for separating donated blood components to address illnesses such as leukemia, sickle cell disease, and other ailments. However, permacaths may be a good option for those needing dialysis , the treatment for those with kidney failure ."
