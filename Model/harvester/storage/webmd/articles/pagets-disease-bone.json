        "Your body constantly builds new bone to replace the old. But with Paget's disease, this happens too fast and gives your bones an odd shape. They may be bent, weak, brittle, soft, or too big. The new bones also may not fit together as tightly as they should.",
        "The disease usually affects your pelvis, skull, spine , and legs, but it can happen in any bone. It may cause your bones to break and can lead to other health problems. For example, your bones may press on nerves or lead to arthritis.",
        "Paget's disease affects people older than 40, and your chances of getting it go up as you age. About a million people in the U.S. have it -- men more often than women.",
        "Doctors don't really know what causes Paget's disease. It may be a viral infection of the bone, or it could be caused by something in the environment. In about 15% to 30% of cases, there's a family history of Paget's. Researchers have found a few genes that can make it more likely that you or a family member will get it. Smoking may also increase your chances.",
        "If you have family members with it, you should get a blood test every 2 to 3 years after age 40."
