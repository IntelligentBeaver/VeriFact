While many people think of the skull as a single structure, it’s actually made up of 22 bones that include the bones structuring the top and back of the head, as well as the separate bones that form the framework of the face.",
        "The skull protects the delicate organs that reside inside the head. In addition, the skull supports the face and facial movements. The skull is one of the first structures to develop in an embryo. It continues to grow and change, though, throughout gestation and infancy."

In addition, the skull provides the structure for the muscles, blood vessels, and connective tissue that make up the face and scalp. These soft tissue structures are crucial to functions like swallowing, breathing, and seeing.",

The components of the skull form during the first eight weeks of gestation, alongside the early development of the nervous system.

        "Neurocranium: The neurocranium is the portion of the skull that covers the brain. This is made up of bony plates with juncture points known as sutures. The sutures remain soft and flexible after birth to allow adjustment during continued brain growth. These soft spots are known as fontanelles, and they close gradually during infancy. The sutures remain somewhat flexible into early adulthood, though, to accommodate further growth before fusing completely.",
        "The top of the skull consists of several bones, which consist of the frontal bone, parietal bones, temporal bones, and occipital bone. These bones form the protective layer over the top and rear of the brain. In the back, they form the bony channel for the brainstem and spinal cord and connect with the spine. The frontal bone forms the forehead and helps to support and protect the eyes.",
        "Viscerocranium: The viscerocranium is the front portion of the skull and makes up the face. The viscerocranium contains 14 facial bones: two nasal conchae, two nasal bones, two maxilla bones, two palatine bones, two lacrimal bones, two zygomatic bones, the mandible, and the vomer. These bones give the face its shape and structure. They serve to protect the sinuses and eyes, additionally creating the support structure for the mouth. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) that connects the upper and lower jaw bones is crucial for chewing and eating."
