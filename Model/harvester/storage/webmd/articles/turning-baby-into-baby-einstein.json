        "In any given day, 8-month-old Anthony Esposito can be found clapping his hands, dancing, and chiming in to tunes pealing from his collection of videotapes. The Staten Island, N.Y., infant is apparently a big fan of the Baby Einstein series, with titles like Baby Mozart , Baby Shakespeare , and Language Nursery making regular rounds in his family's VCR.",
        "\"These tapes have a lot of colors and shapes that hold his attention,\" says Anthony's mom, Lejla. \"It's funny, because if I stand in front of him to distract him, he'll move his head to look behind me to continue watching the show.\"",
        "Across the country, in Alameda, Calif., 17-month-old Lauryn Nakamura seems to be equally riveted with her Baby Einstein products, says her mother, Lilybell. Not only does the toddler watch the Neighborhood Animals DVD, but she also responds to matching flash cards, eagerly identifying creatures and their sounds, as seen on the show.",
        "The Baby Einstein line of videos, DVDs, flash cards, software, books, CDs, and educational toys has captured the attention of many infant households. After two years under the Disney label, 27% of kids own at least one of the brand videos, according to a recent Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation survey of more than 1,000 parents."
