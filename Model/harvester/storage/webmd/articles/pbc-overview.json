        "Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a liver disease that damages the tiny canals in your liver called bile ducts, making it tough for bile to flow. Bile is a fluid your liver makes that helps your body digest fat, absorb vitamins, and get rid of cholesterol and toxins. A backup of bile harms liver tissues and leads to cirrhosis, where scar tissue replaces liver tissue. This affects how well your liver works. There are four stages of PBC: Stage 1 (portal): This stage involves changes in the bile ducts and inflammation around the portal area of the liver. Stage 2 (periportal): In this stage, scar tissue forms (fibrosis), and there’s inflammation around the structures that carry blood vessels and bile ducts. Stage 3 (septal): Here, there’s fibrosis along the thin walls (septa) within the liver and active inflammation within these walls. Stage 4 (biliary cirrhosis): This is the advanced stage, where the liver has various-sized nodules and different levels of inflammation."

        "Experts don’t fully understand what causes PBC, but they think it’s a mix of genetic and environmental factors. In PBC, white blood cells called T cells gather in the liver and mistakenly attack healthy cells lining the bile ducts. Normally, these cells defend against germs, but in PBC, they harm the liver cells instead. This inflammation spreads to other liver cells, causing damage and eventually leading to cirrhosis. Although you don’t directly inherit PBC through specific genes, the disease seems to run in families, so there may be a genetic connection. This means if one family member has PBC, others in the family may have a greater chance of getting it, too."
