        "Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a sudden, potentially deadly condition caused when an overgrowth of bacteria releases toxins into your bloodstream. Two kinds of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, are to blame for most cases. It's rare, and it usually comes from using tampons or having a cut or burn that gets infected. If you get it, you'll need immediate medical care to prevent serious complications. Depending on which kind of bacteria causes it, how quickly you get treatment, and your overall health, it can be fatal 30%-70% of the time."

A saturated tampon is a place where bacteria can grow quickly. It can then travel into the uterus through the cervix . In some cases resulting from menstrual sponges, diaphragms, and cervical caps, the device had been in the vagina for a long time—more than 30 hours. It also seems to matter what the tampon is made of. Polyester foam is worse than either cotton or rayon fibers."

Follow your doctor's instructions for taking care of a surgical incision. Call your doctor right away if you notice signs a wound is infected, like redness, pain, or swelling. If you use tampons, use them correctly. Wash your hands before putting one in. Change tampons at least every 4-8 hours. Don't use a product with a higher absorbency than you need. Use pads instead of tampons some of the time. Make sure your hands are clean before putting any other period product or birth control device into your vagina, and don't leave them in longer than recommended. If you've had TSS once, you're more likely to get it again, so your doctor may tell you not to use these kinds of products."

        "What are the warning signs of TSS? TSS starts out with mild flu-like symptoms that get worse fast. You should suspect it if you suddenly feel very sick all over your body, especially if you've been using tampons or have an infected cut or burn. What are the major criteria of TSS? According to the CDC, TSS involves a fever, a rash, a dramatic drop in blood pressure, and evidence of serious organ damage. What is TSS typically caused by? Infections from two bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (staph) and Streptococcus pyogenes ( group A strep), are responsible for most cases of TSS. They can get into your bloodstream through broken skin or mucus membranes. TSS can come from cuts, burns, or surgical incisions, or leaving tampons or other devices inside your vagina longer than recommended."
