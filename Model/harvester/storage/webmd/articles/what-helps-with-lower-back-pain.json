Fortunately, there are a number of things you can do to help relieve your lower back pain, including taking an NSAID, using a medicated ointment, practicing good posture, doing spine and abdominal exercises and stretches, or getting a massage. If these don't help, talk to your doctor; they may offer other options to help manage your pain, such as going to see a physical therapist, losing a bit of weight, or quitting smoking."
