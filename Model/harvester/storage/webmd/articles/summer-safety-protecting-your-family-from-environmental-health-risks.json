Although you may like the idea of your own kids swimming the day away, you may also have concerns. That crystal blue water may not be as clean as it seems. Water quality can be affected by biological toxins (such as bacteria) or chemical toxicants (such as chlorine). In one corner, you have recreational water illnesses. These include Cryptosporidium , Giardia, and E. coli . Many of these germs are spread by feces, and one person can contaminate an entire pool. Every summer, these infections make thousands of people sick."
