Hold the raisin to your ear. Squish it a bit. Does it make a sound? Bring it to your lips. Take note of any stray thoughts you might have, but always come back to the raisin. Place it on your tongue . When you finally swallow it, appreciate the fullness of its flavor. Now imagine that your body is exactly one raisin heavier.",

In her studies of hypnosis, Bushnell has found that people can be taught to reinterpret painful sensations, regarding them as \"warm and pleasant\" rather than \"burning and unpleasant.\""
