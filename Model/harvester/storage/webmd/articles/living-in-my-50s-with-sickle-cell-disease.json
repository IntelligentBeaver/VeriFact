        "Back when I was growing up, living into middle age with sickle cell disease (previously known as sickle cell anemia) was rarely heard of. In fact, it was commonly thought that children with sickle cell disease wouldn’t live to see their 20s. That seemed to be especially true if the child often took ill. After having my first sickle cell crisis at 6 months old, it became increasingly difficult for my mother to hold a job. Not knowing if I would make it day to day without any issues from having sickle cell was hard to predict. I would go stretches of time doing well and good. Then suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, I could become so ill that I would need emergency medical care to manage my sickle cell after she had done everything possible to care for me at home.",
        "Once I hit school age, my chances of becoming ill had the potential to increase. I remember catching the mumps in second grade and being out so long I needed a tutor to maintain my grades in school. I was doing the same work as my classmates, only I was doing it at home from the couch or from my bed. I was terribly ill. As a child, I can remember being awakened out of my sleep rather abruptly to the excruciating pain of a vaso-occlusive crisis. That’s where the red blood cells sickle and stick together, essentially blocking blood flow and oxygenated cells to the small blood vessels and capillaries of my joints and extremities or causing severe pain in my back or chest.",
        "Sometimes a warm bath, fluids, and acetaminophen were not enough, and I would have to tough it out alone in my bed, rocking from side to side, moving my body to keep the blood flowing. It seemed natural to do that. Between the pain and realizing that keeping my body warm seemed to help, I would move constantly, partly trying to avert the pain, and partly to tire myself out so that I could sleep."

        "In one episode, the pain might feel like my bones or joints were in a vise grip, being squeezed with so much pressure that it felt like my bones would break into pieces. Even the sensation of the grip releasing was painful. Another time, the pain may feel like shards of glass in my veins, or like a constant stabbing in certain areas of my body – maybe a leg, an arm, or both arms, my back, or chest. I knew it was going to be bad if my bottom jaw got numb. That seemed to be a sign for me to get prepared. I could have all-over, internal body pain so relentless, I wouldn’t know if I’d make it to the next day.",
        "As a teenager and young adult, my hospital visits seemed more frequent. Mostly because I didn’t really pay attention to my triggers so that I could help prevent sickle cell pain. I wanted to live a normal life, and in doing so, there were times when I over-exerted myself, lacked hydration, or didn’t wear proper layers of clothing for the weather. Sickle cell is extremely sensitive to the conditions of the environment. Extreme temperature changes – being too cold, or even a drop in barometric pressure – can cause bone-crushing pain. By that age, acetaminophen didn’t work very well for me anymore. I would have no other choice but to go to the hospital for the appropriate medicines and fluids to bring my body back to balance. Sometimes, that also included a blood transfusion.",
        "Most of my 20s, 30s, and 40s were great, for the most part. There were a few bumps on my path here and there along the way: cholecystectomy, pulmonary embolism, acute chest syndrome, pneumonia, pulmonary arterial hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic insomnia, blood transfusion dependence, and with that, acquired hemochromatosis. I can’t see what’s happening internally when sickle cell decides to wreak havoc on my body. How the lack of blood flow to my bones could potentially cause avascular necrosis, or how my lungs have become scarred from acute chest syndrome – infarct after infarct. The dangers of strokes and organ failure often come with the territory. Sickle cell could even be the reason for glasses in some cases. It can damage the retina. Nothing is off-limits with this disease."
