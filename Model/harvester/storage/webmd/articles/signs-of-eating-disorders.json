        "Eating disorders are a group of conditions marked by an unhealthy relationship with food . They tend to develop during the teenage and young adult years, and they are much more common in girls and women. No one knows exactly what causes eating disorders. However, mental health issues such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, trouble dealing with emotions, and substance use problems seem to increase the risk.",
        "At first, the focus on food may be a way to gain control over one aspect of a person's life. Although it may start as simply eating a bit more or less than usual, the behavior can eventually take over their life. It can be hard to spot the signs of an eating disorder, especially early on. People with eating disorders may try to hide their food restrictions or wear baggy clothes to conceal the weight loss.",
        "An eating disorder is a serious medical condition that can have long-term health consequences. That's why it's important to get help if you think that you or a loved one may have an eating disorder.",
