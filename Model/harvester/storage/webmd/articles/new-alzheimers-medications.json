        "Using powerful new drug-screening technologies, researchers are identifying dozens, perhaps hundreds of possible targets for drugs aimed at preventing, treating, or slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many of these compounds appear to work in animals with Alzheimer's-type dementia -- good news for little furry creatures.",
        "But for the estimated 25 million people worldwide with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia and the millions more who care for them, the news about drugs for Alzheimer's disease -- after the first blush of enthusiasm has faded -- has ranged from mildly promising to disheartening.",
        "Perhaps it's a measure of how difficult the problem is that one of the biggest headlines from the 9th International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders in Philadelphia came from a clinical trial of the drug Aricept . The drug appears to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease in people with mild cognitive impairment by six to perhaps 18 months, according to researcher Ronald Petersen, MD, PhD, from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Mild cognitive impairment appears to set the stage for the development of Alzheimer's dementia."

People receiving the drug combination also had a reduction in behavioral disturbances such as agitation and psychiatric symptoms that are among the most common causes of nursing-home placements among patients with AD. Studies presented at the current meeting also suggest that the drug is safe and effective at improving mental abilities and daily functioning."
