        "But first, let me take you down memory lane so you can understand how I learned enough to give this advice to you. Hint: The hard way! My oldest son began preschool in a nearby church program. It’s a darling local church, and everyone in the neighborhood sends their kids to this school. He had not even been diagnosed with food allergies as he began his 3-year-old program, so none of this was on my radar. Halfway through the year, he had his first bite of peanut butter, followed by his first allergic reaction, followed by a diagnosis of allergies to peanuts and all tree nuts. We were stunned.",

The teacher was (fairly) competent in managing nut allergy, but she commented several times about how the little girl did a better job “advocating for herself” than my son. Who was 3.

It’s crucial to understand that these first few years can be more stressful because of how young the kids are, but it is still possible to ask for accommodations to keep them safe.

        "Our biggest learning was to ask for no food IN the classroom. It’s impossible to get 3- to 5-year-olds to eat without getting food everywhere. When there was any type of food in the classroom, our youngest son was in constant reaction mode. Simply request that the class move to the cafeteria or another space outside of the classroom to eat snacks and lunch. This allows the classroom to remain an allergen-free zone and keeps teachers from having to constantly clean up. Remind the teachers that many art supplies have food ingredients (for example, Play-Doh contains wheat), and request that they read all labels before bringing new products into the classroom.",
        "If your child has a potentially life-threatening allergy, request that the class not have that food at all. For example, our youngest son had a terrifying, nearly fatal reaction to bananas as an infant, and we requested that his class not allow bananas from preschool through elementary school. (Side note, to give you a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel, he passed bananas in an oral food challenge in middle school.) I did not ask for ALL of his allergens to be removed from the class because that would have been nearly impossible for the school and other parents to manage.",

A 504 plan will not be an option in a private preschool or school, but is incredibly helpful in a public school. We never had one, so I can’t provide details, but both FARE and FAACT have extremely helpful information should you need one to receive the accommodations you deserve for your child.",

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits institutions (such as schools) that receive federal funding to discriminate against a child based on disability, including food allergies. A 504 plan will not be an option in a private preschool or school, but is incredibly helpful in a public school. We never had one, so I can’t provide details, but both FARE and FAACT have extremely helpful information should you need one to receive the accommodations you deserve for your child.",

When I look back now, I was so stressed and overwhelmed because I didn’t know what to ask for or how to manage the classroom setting. I had to learn by trial and error and by switching schools — a few times! I hope your road is much less bumpy and that this helps you navigate those early years more easily.",

Their school continues to be nut-aware, and we have slowly lifted accommodations over the years, both based on testing out of allergies and treatment with oral immunotherapy.",

And, thanks to years of practice, they have the confidence to speak up if there are any surprise situations with their allergens present. I am so proud of them. I am so proud of us!"
