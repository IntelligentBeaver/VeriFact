        "There are three types of sleep apnea:",
        "Obstructive sleep apnea . This is the most common type. It results when your airways repeatedly get completely or partially blocked as you sleep. This usually happens because the soft tissue at the back of your throat collapses when the muscles in your face and neck relax while you sleep. During these episodes, your diaphragm and chest muscles must work harder than normal to open your airways. You may start to breathe with loud gasps, and your body may jerk. This can affect your sleep, lower the flow of oxygen to your vital organs, and lead to abnormal heart rhythms.",
        "Central sleep apnea . With this type, your airway doesn't get blocked. Instead, your brain fails to tell your muscles to breathe because of issues in your respiratory control center. It's related to the function of your central nervous system. This type most often affects people with neuromuscular disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease), those who've had a stroke, or those who have heart failure or other forms of heart, kidney, or lung disease.",
        "Complex sleep apnea syndrome. With this condition, you have a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea. When you have the obstructive type but it turns into the central type after you get treatment, that's called treatment-emergent central sleep apnea."
