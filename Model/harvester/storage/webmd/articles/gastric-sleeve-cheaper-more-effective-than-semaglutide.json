        "April 12, 2024 – Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), a nonsurgical weight loss procedure, is more cost-effective over a 5-year period than using semaglutide , the active ingredient in Ozempic, Wegovy, and other weight loss drugs, a study says.",
        "ESG reduces the size of the stomach. A suturing device is put down the throat and into the stomach, where it folds and sutures the sides of the stomach . ESG is not the same as gastric sleeve surgery, which removes a large portion of the stomach.",
        "For the study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open , the researchers used a Markov cohort model, which measures the experiences of a hypothetical group of patients over a set period. The study took place from Sept. 1, 2022, to May 31, 2023, using adult patients in the U.S. health care system with a body mass index of 35 to 39.9. (A BMI of 30 or higher falls within the obesity range.)",
        "Over 1 year, ESG was not as cost-effective as semaglutide, the study said. After that, things changed."

        "The researchers projected that “the semaglutide strategy” would cost $33,583 more than the ESG strategy over a 5 -year period.

Patients after surgery can regain some weight, but generally not all the weight from before.”",
        "“When you look at a cost analysis, it's not unusual to see that weight loss surgeries over two or three years have cost recoupment or are cost neutral,” Kurian, who was not involved with the study, said."
