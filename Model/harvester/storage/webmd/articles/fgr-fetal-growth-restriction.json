One of the simplest and most common is measuring the distance from the mother's fundus (the top of the uterus) to the pubic bone. After the 20th week of pregnancy, the measure in centimeters usually corresponds with the number of weeks of pregnancy. A lower than expected measurement may mean that the baby is not growing as it should. Your doctor may suspect FGR if your baby is less than the 10th percentile for their gestational age.",
