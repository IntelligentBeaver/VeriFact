        "Whether or not the Nutritarian diet is good for you depends on your wellness goals, says registered dietitian Kathleen Zelman, MPH, RD, LD. Some of Fuhrman's claims are backed by science, but not all of them.",
        "\"There's no doubt you'll lose weight,\" she says. But the weight loss might not be easy to maintain once you stop the diet.",
        "Fuhrman claims the diet can prevent and even reverse disease. The diet is definitely good for heart health. Like other plant-based diets, it can lower blood pressure and cholesterol. It's also rich in nutrients and cancer-fighting antioxidants. All of these things might help prevent or even manage some diseases. But claiming that it can reverse disease is a stretch, says Zelman.",
        "Meanwhile, it strictly limits some foods that can be nutritious--for example, olive oil, which is a key part of the science-backed Mediterranean diet . \"There's nothing wrong with olive oil,\" Zelman says. Likewise, cheese can be very nutritious in moderation. It's a great source of calcium and vitamin D, which are crucial for preventing osteoporosis. When enjoyed in moderation, cheese, eggs, and other animal-based products can be part of a heart-healthy diet.",
        "Is it good for certain conditions?",
        "This diet could be a good fit for people who are concerned about heart health. Research suggests that plant-based diets might also be a good option for people with diabetes. The Nutritarian diet in particular focuses on low- glycemic index foods , which help keep your blood sugar stable. This means that it won't suddenly spike after meals or drop as quickly when you're hungry.",
        "Who shouldn't try the Nutritarian diet?",
        "People with irritable bowel syndrome might want to think twice about this diet. It is heavy in fiber, which might be hard on a sensitive stomach. This could lead to stomach pain.",
        "The Nutritarian diet is also quite restrictive, so it's not recommended for people with a history of eating disorders .",
        "The final word",
        "This plan has a lot of positives, like a focus on fresh fruits and vegetables. But overall, Zelman says, \"The science is just not there.\"",
        "Many of the studies on the benefits are short-term. And there aren't any randomized controlled trials, the gold standard of scientific studies. Longer-term, higher-quality research needs to be done to prove some of Dr. Fuhrman's claims.",
        "In theory, its principles are solid, Zelman says. But in practice, it's a restrictive diet that's hard to keep up.",
        "\"Your best bet, in my opinion, is to talk to your doctor, talk to your registered dietician or nutritionist,\" Zelman says. They can look at your medical history, your family history, and other concerns. If you want to follow the Nutritarian diet, they can suggest modifications so that it works better for you. They also might suggest other plans that can better fit your needs."
