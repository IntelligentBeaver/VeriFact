        "Opfolda (miglustat) is a medicine taken with another medicine for certain people with late-onset Pompe disease . Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by an abnormal gene for a protein (enzyme) called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). GAA breaks down glycogen into glucose , a form of sugar stored in muscles and other tissues. In people with Pompe disease, there is not enough GAA, so glycogen builds up in muscle cells. This causes muscle weakness and other symptoms that get worse over time.",
        "There are three types of Pompe disease, based on when symptoms first appear. Each type has slightly different symptoms, shows up at different ages, and varies in how serious it is. In some people, the GAA enzyme does not work at all, and in others, it still works to some extent."

Symptoms include muscle weakness, especially in the torso, legs, and in the diaphragm, which leads to breathing problems."
