        "Every single person who is born on this earth is born for a reason. Your life has a purpose. Your journey is unique. Your words are powerful. And your story is meant to be told.  When you are born with or diagnosed with a chronic disease, your internal voice becomes louder in your head.  You know what you’re thinking and why you make your decisions, but your words and actions might not necessarily be clear to those around you.  And, truth be told, they don’t always have to be.",
        "Let me be very clear. It’s not your responsibility in life to make others understand you or your pain. It’s not your responsibility to cater to those around you, to the extent that you ignore your health and your inner voice. When you have a chronic disease, you can absolutely love your family, friends, and loved ones while simultaneously taking care of yourself. The trouble comes when you ignore your inner needs in order to cater to the wants and needs of others around you. You have to find your inner voice and learn how to translate the internal dialogue that you have with yourself to those in your external environment."

The crazy thing is that there are times when that is exactly what you need to do. You need to sit down, listen to your body, rest, and take your medicine.  For me, my internal voice would always start out gentle. I would get this small feeling that I needed to slow down, hydrate, and take my pain medication. However, I would ignore the crap out of that and go from 0 to 100.",

In a sprint, you are running like heck until you get to a “finish line,” and then you crash."
