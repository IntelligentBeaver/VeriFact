        "An actinic keratosis is a rough, scaly patch on your skin caused by too much exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun or tanning devices. Actinic keratoses (the plural form) can also be called solar keratoses. It's important to know about them because they can turn into skin cancers called squamous cell carcinomas.",
        "It's estimated that more than 40 million Americans develop actinic keratoses each year. This condition is more common at high altitudes and in sunny countries closer to the equator. While most people who get actinic keratoses are over age 40, they can happen in younger adults who spend a lot of time outside in the sun or inside at tanning facilities.",
