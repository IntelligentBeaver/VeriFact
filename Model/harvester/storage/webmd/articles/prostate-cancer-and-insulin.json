        "One study of 100 people from Finland with prostate cancer and another 400 without it looked for links between the cancer and insulin or blood sugar levels. The researchers knew that insulin might play a role in prostate cancer. Insulin can make cells grow, but it wasn’t really clear how levels of insulin in the bloodstream could increase prostate cancer risk.",
        "To try and understand it better, they looked at levels of insulin and blood sugar 5 to 10 years before the men got prostate cancer. Their data showed that insulin levels more than 9 years before prostate cancer were 8% higher in those who got the cancer compared to those who didn’t.",
        "Their insulin levels still were in a range that was considered normal. So the men with higher insulin in this study didn’t have diabetes or another condition. But those with the highest insulin levels were more than twice as likely to get prostate cancer compared with those with the lowest insulin levels. They didn’t see the same pattern with blood sugar. Men with blood sugar levels on the higher end didn’t show more prostate cancer risk.",
        "Higher levels of insulin tend to go along with insulin resistance. When your body doesn’t respond to insulin as well, it makes more. Another study of men in China found a similar link. Men who were the most sensitive to insulin as indicated by low levels of the hormone were less likely to get prostate cancer. Men who were more resistant to insulin and had higher levels of it (but not diabetes) got prostate cancer more often."

        "It’s a good idea for anyone to take steps to keep their insulin levels low. That’s especially true if you have prostate cancer or any other cancer type , since insulin may fuel cancer’s growth. The best way to lower insulin levels whether or not you have diabetes is to exercise and eat a healthy diet. Keeping the weight off and exercising can help your body respond to insulin and prevent or delay diabetes. Taking metformin also can help. If you have prediabetes or your insulin levels are even on the higher end of the normal range, ask your doctor what they recommend.",
        "If you or a loved one has diabetes and prostate cancer, ask your doctor what you can do to improve your chances of a good outcome. Rest assured most prostate cancers are caught before they spread and generally have positive outcomes. If you are worried you might have prostate cancer or may be at higher risk, talk to your doctor about whether you should think about tests to look for it."
