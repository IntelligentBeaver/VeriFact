        "Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that you can't smell, taste, or see. It's produced from burning fuels, including natural gas, coal, kerosene, wood, propane, and oil, and is present in engine exhaust. When this gas is present in large amounts, especially in confined spaces, carbon monoxide replaces the oxygen in your red blood cells, which leads to carbon monoxide poisoning . Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause serious bodily harm or even death.",
        "Carbon monoxide vs. carbon dioxide",
        "Carbon dioxide (CO2) occurs naturally in soil and the atmosphere and also is produced by burning fossil fuels. At room temperature, it's a gas with no taste or smell. CO2 can also be found in solid form, commonly known as dry ice. Humans naturally breathe in some carbon dioxide that's in the atmosphere. The functioning cells in your body also create carbon dioxide, and you breathe it out when you exhale.",
        "CO2 is used in fire extinguishers as well as in some laboratories. Concerts and theater productions sometimes use dry ice for special effects. If there's a high amount present in the soil, CO2 can seep into houses. It also can build up when there are a lot of people in a poorly ventilated space. If you're exposed to too much CO2, you might experience health effects. They include:"
