        "The active ingredient in Farxiga is dapagliflozin. You may also hear it called a “flozin.” It belongs to the class of medicines called the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. SGLT2 proteins are found in your kidneys. These proteins help your body reabsorb sugar. Farxiga blocks the SGLT2 proteins and reduces the reabsorption of sugar. You get rid of the sugar when you pee."

You can also look at HbA1c percentages, which is more of the big picture (how your blood sugar levels have been over the last 2 to 3 months). And you can look at how many people get to a certain HbA1c level.

Talk to your health care provider about what to do. And consider these tips to lower your risk of getting a yeast infection while taking Farxiga.",

You are more likely to have hypoglycemia, especially severe hypoglycemia, if you also use insulin or take other medicines for diabetes that increase your insulin levels.

It is a serious complication of diabetes that happens when your body does not have enough insulin, the protein that helps your body use glucose (sugar) for energy. Instead of using glucose, your body breaks down fat for energy, releasing ketones. Small amounts of ketones are not harmful, as you might see with the ketogenic diet . But if your body makes too many ketones, they build up in your blood and cause damage. This makes your blood too acidic, which is called ketoacidosis. DKA can be life-threatening. Your health care provider may ask you to check for ketones in your blood or pee at home. This can help you catch things early before ketoacidosis develops."
