        "Morton’s neuroma, also called intermetatarsal neuroma, results from the thickening of tissue in your toe. This tissue is next to a nerve. So the pressure against the nerve irritates it and causes pain .",
        "You might be walking along and feel a pain near the ball of your foot , like there’s a pebble inside your shoe. The pain usually crops up between your third and fourth toes. (That’s counting the big toe as the first.)",
        "Women are more likely than men to get Morton’s neuroma. Why? You can probably guess: High-heeled shoes are often to blame, because they put pressure on the feet. The cure may be as simple as switching to shoes with lower heels.",
        "Morton's neuroma is common, affecting an estimated 1 in every 3 people during their lifetime.",
