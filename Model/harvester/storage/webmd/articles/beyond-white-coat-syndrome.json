        "1. Identify what worries you . Or as Consedine puts it, deconstruct your anxiety . \"Anxiety tends to be diffuse; people are not sure what they're really anxious about. But if you identify what it is, that makes it much easier to manage because you can evaluate your coping potential.\"",
        "2. Confront anxieties and deal with them rationally . This could be a useful way to overcome fear of screening tests, Consedine says. For example, the digital rectal exam can be important for detecting prostate cancer, and the colorectal exam is important for early detection of colorectal cancers. Studies show that many men avoid these tests because of a perceived threat to their sexuality, Consedine says.",
        "Other screenings such as the mammogram may be uncomfortable, but they are brief and can be life-saving. Surveys show that people anticipate screenings to be more painful than they actually are, Consedine says. And rationally, those brief moments of discomfort are far outweighed by the chance of having your life saved by early detection of a disease."
