        "Treatment for Parkinson’s disease often comes with side effects. One of them is dyskinesia -- strange, jerky movements you can’t control. You might sway, wriggle around, or bob your head. These movements can happen in one part of your body, like your arm or leg. Or they could spread over your whole body.",
        "Dyskinesia usually starts on the same side your Parkinson’s did. At first, it may be so mild you hardly notice it. And for some people, it’s never much of a problem. But severe symptoms can get in the way of your job, social activities, and daily life.",
        "Dyskinesia isn’t the same as tremors you have with Parkinson’s. It mainly happens when Parkinson’s symptoms like stiffness and tremors are under control. And it doesn’t happen to everyone. Talk to your doctor. There may be ways to lower your chances of getting it."

        "No one knows what causes dyskinesia. But it may have something to do with different chemicals your brain makes, like serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine . It seems to happen when you take the Parkinson’s medicine levodopa for a long time. The medicine replaces some dopamine once your brain cells stop making it. But levodopa wears off fast, so you have to take it several times a day. That means your dopamine levels go up and down a lot. Also, it’s harder to keep a steady supply of dopamine in your body when you have Parkinson’s for a long time. Rising and falling dopamine levels may play a big role in dyskinesia.",
        "Another idea is that a brain chemical called GABA could lead to dyskinesia. Here’s how that might work: Dopamine sends signals to specific brain cells, which pass those messages along to other cells using GABA. When your brain makes less dopamine, those don’t send as many messages. But they become super sensitive to dopamine. When you take levodopa, the cells get flooded with dopamine signals again and pump out way too much GABA. This could cause dyskinesia. But scientists are still studying this idea."
