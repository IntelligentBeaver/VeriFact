Supportive care treatments include: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). These drugs are also known as growth factors. Blood transfusions. More than 40% of people with MDS get regular red blood cell transfusions during their disease, according to research. Iron-chelating drugs. These medications help your body get rid of the excess Iron that frequent transfusions bring into your body. When too much iron builds up, you can have serious health problems, including organ damage. Other anemia treatments. Among these is a prescription medicine called luspatercept-aamt (Reblozyl ) for certain people with MDS who need regular blood transfusions."

A more recent study, published in 2013 in the American Journal of Blood Research , had similar numbers.

You’ll also want to consider the possible risks and benefits of treatments in light of your individual health. For example: What is your survival outlook? While there’s no sure way to predict a person’s outcome, the average survival rate for lower-risk MDS is estimated at 4 1/2-1o 10 years. The average survival rate is estimated at less than 2 years for higher-risk MDS. (Keep in mind that these numbers may not reflect the latest treatment improvements.) Do you have primary or secondary MDS? The primary form has no known cause. The secondary type develops from a known cause, such as cancer treatment . Secondary MDS is less likely to respond to treatment, and it often develops into leukemia. If you’re like most people with MDS, you’re a senior. How is your health apart from MDS? These topics aren’t easy to think about, much less discuss with your doctor. But they can be useful in guiding your treatment decisions after an MDS diagnosis.",
