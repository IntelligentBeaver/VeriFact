        "Verzenio is a type of medicine called a kinase inhibitor. Kinases are enzymes in the body that can send and receive signals to help your cells do important functions. Verzenio blocks the action of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). Kinases CDK4 and CDK6 send signals to help cancer cells grow and multiply. Verzenio blocks the activity of CDK4 and CDK6 to help stop cancer cells from growing and multiplying and to make tumors shrink in size."
