        "Body mass index (BMI) uses your height and weight measurements to estimate how much body fat you have. It’s a quick screening tool that can help find out if you are in a healthy weight range. It can also estimate your risk for weight-related illnesses such as heart disease , stroke , and type 2 diabetes .",
        "As useful as BMI can be, it has limitations. For starters, it doesn’t consider physical characteristics beyond height and weight, like how muscular you are. What’s more, white European men were the original models for the BMI formula. Research shows that race, gender, age, and ethnicity can influence how much body fat you have and what amount is healthy for you.",
        "For these reasons, the American Medical Association advises against using BMI alone to check for weight status and related health risks. They instead urge doctors to use BMI along with other health assessments — such as waist circumference, blood pressure, and blood glucose and cholesterol levels — to gain a fuller and more accurate picture of their patients’ health status."

He used this equation to pinpoint a supposedly “normal” weight range. Quetelet called his formula the Quetelet Index.

Data shows that the average US adult gains about 30 pounds by age 50 and that people in midlife today are more likely to live with obesity than any other generation.
