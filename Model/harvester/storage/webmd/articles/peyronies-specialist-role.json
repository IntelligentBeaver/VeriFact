Penile traction and vacuum therapy, which are like physical therapy for the penis, are also options. Your urologist will discuss the treatment options with you and recommend one based on your symptoms, how curved the penis is during your erection, your level of pain, and other things, like how the disease is impacting your life. Once you and your doctor have decided on the treatment, your doctor will prescribe the medication, creams, etc., and follow up to see how it is working.
