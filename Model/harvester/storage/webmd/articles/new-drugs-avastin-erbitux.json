        "Antibodies are substances produced by the immune system in response to foreign invaders such as bacteria or viruses. Antibodies can stick to the invader and help destroy it. Monoclonal antibodies are a specific type of antibody, created in a lab to find and destroy a particular target -- in this case, cancer. Because of their precision, it is hoped that treatment of a tumor with a monoclonal antibody will be more specific than chemotherapy drugs and therefore have fewer side effects."

        "Bevacizumab (Avastin) was one of the first of its kind of monoclonal antibodies that shuts down a process called angiogenesis -- the process whereby tumors grow new blood vessels to help them receive the nutrients needed to survive.

VEGF binds to certain cells to stimulate new blood vessel formation. Interfering with tumor blood vessels might slow their growth.

The drug is not a cure, but studies show that the use of Avastin along with chemotherapy increased survival of patients with metastatic colon cancer by five months.",
