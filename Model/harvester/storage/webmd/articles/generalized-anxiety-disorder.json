Eventually, anxiety can dominate your thinking so much that you find it hard to do routine things at work or school, socially, and in your relationships. But there are treatments that can help."

            "Brain chemistry. This is complex. GAD has been linked to problems with certain nerve cell pathways that connect particular brain regions involved in your thinking and emotion. These nerve cell connections depend on chemicals called neurotransmitters that send information from one nerve cell to the next. If the pathways that connect particular brain regions don't work well, problems related to mood or anxiety may result. Medicines, psychotherapies, or other treatments that are thought to work on these neurotransmitters may improve the signaling between circuits and help to improve symptoms related to anxiety or depression.",
            "Environmental factors. Trauma and stressful events such as abuse, the death of a loved one, divorce, and changing jobs or schools may contribute to GAD. The condition can also worsen when your stress feels out of hand. Use of, and withdrawal from, addictive substances (including alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine) can also worsen your anxiety.",
            "Medication side effects. If you take certain medicines or have a substance abuse disorder, you may have anxiety as a symptom. Many different medications can do this. Ask your doctor if you're concerned that your medicine is causing you anxiety.",
            "Medical conditions. Some conditions can cause anxiety too, like hyperthyroidism, because it raises hormones. Some chronic illnesses and diseases can also cause GAD."
