        "April 9, 2024 – Researchers are getting closer to being able to reliably screen for pancreatic cancer by conducting tests on a person’s blood.",
        "Preliminary results were presented this week at a cancer research conference in California and showed that a type of blood test called a “liquid biopsy” was key to achieving a 97% accuracy rate at diagnosing the most common type of pancreatic cancer during early stages.",
        "Currently, it’s difficult to diagnose pancreatic cancer during early, more treatable stages and is often only discovered after the disease has advanced, making treatment more difficult.",
        "“The results are exciting because pancreatic cancer diagnosed after it has spread significantly is devastating with a low survival rate. But if we catch it early, there is a better chance we can remove it surgically and further treat it,” said senior study author Ajay Goel, PhD, a professor at the cancer treatment and research center City of Hope in Duarte, CA, in a news release ."
