        "There’s a strong link between the most widely used and effective breast cancer treatments and heart problems. Certain drugs used for chemotherapy can weaken your heart and increase high blood pressure and the risk of blood clots. Radiation therapy to the chest or breast also increases the risk for early coronary artery disease. It can also damage the heart valves. Meds used in hormonal therapies can affect your heart, too. Some issues appear soon after treatment, while others happen years later.",
        "That doesn’t mean you should avoid the treatments, though. If you don’t get proper treatment, the chances of dying from cancer are likely much higher than the odds of dying from heart disease. And a recent study found women who have heart failure after some breast cancer treatments still have better health and brighter prognoses than those with heart failure from other causes."
