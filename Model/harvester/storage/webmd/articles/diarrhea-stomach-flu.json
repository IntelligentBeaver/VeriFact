        "The stomach flu is not a single disease. Instead, it's just a nickname for viral gastroenteritis, which is itself caused by a number of nasty viruses, such as noroviruses, rotaviruses, and adenoviruses.",
        "These viruses target the digestive tract and cause inflammation of the stomach and intestines . The most awful symptoms -- diarrhea, vomiting, and cramps -- are actually your body's defense mechanisms. Your body is trying to drive the virus out.",
        "Stomach flu can develop at any time of the year, but it's most common in the fall and winter in the U.S. Although unpleasant, stomach flu is rarely serious. Symptoms usually last for 1 to 3 days and sometimes longer. The greatest risk -- especially in babies and older people -- comes from dehydration . Untreated, dehydration can be dangerous.",
        "Despite the name, stomach flu has nothing to do with the \"true\" flu, influenza. Influenza causes body aches and fever. Diarrhea and vomiting are not common but can be seen, and are more likely to be seen in children than adults . Rarely, it can trigger vomiting in children."

Instead, ask your doctor about giving your sick child an oral rehydration solution such as CeraLyte , Infalyte , Naturalyte , Pedialyte , and generic brands. (If your baby is still nursing or using formula, keep feeding them as usual.) Adults can use oral rehydration solutions or diluted juices, diluted sports drinks, clear broth, or decaffeinated tea. Sugary, carbonated, caffeinated, or alcoholic drinks can make diarrhea worse, so be sure to dilute sugary beverages if you drink them.",

That's fine for the first day or so of stomach flu. However, doctors say that you should return to your normal diet as soon as you feel up to it. BRAT foods aren't bad. They just don't provide the fat and protein that you need. Sticking with them too long could actually slow your recovery.",
