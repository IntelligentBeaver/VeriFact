        "Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (acquired TTP, or aTTP) is a rare blood disorder that results in blood clots in small blood vessels around your body. These clots can slow the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart, brain, kidneys, and other organs.",
        "The disease affects platelets, blood cells that stick together to help your blood clot when you cut yourself. They help seal the cut and prevent bleeding.",
        "In aTTP, platelets clump together and form small clots when they shouldn't. This leaves fewer platelets in your body, which is why you may bleed more than usual. Sometimes red blood cells break apart. This causes a low red blood cell count, called anemia .",
        "Acquired TTP can be serious. But there are treatments to prevent it from coming back. You'll have the best chance if you get treated as early as possible and see your doctor after treatment for regular follow-up visits."
