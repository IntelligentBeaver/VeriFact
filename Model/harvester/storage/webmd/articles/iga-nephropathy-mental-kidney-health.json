        "IgA nephropathy can raise some big questions. Will your symptoms be so mild you hardly notice a change in daily life? Will you need dialysis one day? Should you prepare for a kidney transplant 10 or 20 years down the road? You may not get answers until you’ve lived with the disease for many years. “That uncertainty is incredibly challenging,” says Susan Rubman, PhD, a medical psychologist with Yale Medicine. She treats people who get organ transplants. You can live a long life with IgA nephropathy. But your odds of depression, anxiety, and ongoing stress are higher than someone without the condition. Along with your doctor’s help, here are steps you can take to manage your mental and kidney health."

Here are some questions to get you started: What are the chances I’ll need dialysis? Do I need to make diet or other lifestyle changes right away? Will I need medication for the rest of my life? Do you treat other people like me? Can I meet them? Can I talk to someone who’s on dialysis or had a kidney transplant? Is there a nurse educator who can tell me more? Will I need a kidney transplant? What is the prognosis? Will this get better? You’ll also need to go in for regular checkups and follow-up tests. Ongoing care leaves you in a better spot to manage changes as they come up. “And to be able to rejoice when things are stable,” Rubman says."

        "For people with IgA nephropathy, studies show regular movement may also ease symptoms of mental stress and depression, boost health-related quality of life, and help the heart and lungs work better. Yonatan Peleg, MD, is a nephrologist (kidney doctor ) with Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. Along with taking your medication, he encourages everyone with IgA nephropathy to get out and move. Choose aerobic, or cardio, exercises to target blood pressure control. Aim for at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise each week. That’s something like brisk walking 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Other good choices include bicycling, running, swimming, or dancing. You might’ve heard that working out too hard will hurt your kidneys. But heavy exercise is safe for most people with kidney disease, including IgA nephropathy. While it’s true that you may leak extra protein into your urine right after a strenuous gym session, “the blood pressure control you get from having a healthy cardiovascular lifestyle is more important,” Peleg says."

But if your symptoms last several weeks or get in the way of daily life, tell your doctor. You might think they only care about your kidneys. But that’s not necessarily true. “For one, I’m worried about [your] overall health,” Peleg says. “But if depression leads to not exercising as much or making the wrong food choices, that can lead to worsening blood pressure and worse IgA outcomes.” Poor mental health can also make it hard to get medical care when you need it or stick with treatment. It may even affect how well you do after a kidney transplant. Besides your kidney doctor, there are lots of other health professionals you can turn to if you’re having a tough time. According to Emily Duggan, PhD, a neuropsychologist and assistant professor with Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, that includes your regular doctor, social workers, nurses, or the care team at your dialysis center. “Really anybody is receptive to talking,” Duggan says."

And if you have IgA nephropathy, behavioral therapy can help you better understand the link between your illness and how you think, feel, or act. If you try therapy, don’t worry if you’re not sure what to talk about. “All you have to know is that you would like some help,” Duggan says. “And the therapist is there to help walk you through every single step from there on out.” If you think you might hurt yourself, call 988 to reach a suicide and crisis counselor 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.",
