        "First, determine whether your household can accommodate an adult dog. That means making sure that neither you nor anyone you live with is allergic to dog hair. You also need to consider the time and energy you’ll need to devote to your new adult dog daily, like housetraining them if needed, cleaning up any messes, playing in the yard, and going on walks. This is also a good time to consider house rules and confirm responsibilities, like feeding and walking, with others in your home.",
        "Next, identify what kind of dog will be the best fit for your household. Some high-energy breeds need a big yard to run around in, while others are much calmer and are generally happy inside the house. Also, some dogs tend to get along better with children than others, so if you have kids, that’s another factor to consider."
