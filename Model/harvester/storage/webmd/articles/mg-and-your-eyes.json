        "MG changed that.",
        "Double vision, or diplopia, is one of the more frustrating symptoms I’ve had. Not just because it makes everyday tasks harder, but because it’s invisible to everyone else. You’re blinking, squinting, tilting your head, closing one eye just to read a menu, and from the outside, you look completely fine.",

        "MG affects your muscles that control your eye movement. When they get weak or fatigued, your eyes stop working together as a team. They start pointing in slightly different directions, which your brain doesn’t know how to process."
