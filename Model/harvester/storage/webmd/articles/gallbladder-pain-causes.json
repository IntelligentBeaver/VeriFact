        "If your pain is severe, you should be checked as soon as possible to rule out something more serious and to make you more comfortable. The emergency room doctor will likely do an ultrasound to look for stones and to check how big your gallbladder is. If necessary, your doctor may also order other imaging tests, such as a CT scan, MRI, or hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan to get a view of what is going on inside.",
        "How do I know if my pain is from my gallbladder?",

        "What does a gallstone attack feel like?",
        "Gallstones can cause sudden and severe pain. The duration of the gallbladder pain attacks may vary, ranging from as short as 30 minutes to several hours long. You might feel the pain from gallstones in the upper mid-back (between the shoulder blades), in the right shoulder, or the upper part of the right side of your abdomen. Other symptoms include nausea and vomiting."
