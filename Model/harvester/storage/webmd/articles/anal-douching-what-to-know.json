It's called an enema when done to relieve constipation. Anal douching is done with water or saline solution, while enemas may use laxatives or other fluids.",

        "It's OK to use tap water for anal douching now and then. But don't use it every day, or it could cause an imbalance of chemicals called electrolytes in your body. Saline solution, which you can buy or make at home, is usually safest."
