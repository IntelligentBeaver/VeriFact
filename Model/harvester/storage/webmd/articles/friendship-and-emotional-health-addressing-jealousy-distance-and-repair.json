        "Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered podcast. I'm Dr Neha Pathak, WebMD's Chief Physician Editor for Health and Lifestyle Medicine. Very often on this podcast, we address the unique needs of the sandwich generation. That's the generation that's working, raising children, caring for itself, and potentially also caring for elders. In the middle of that, we're also developing and maintaining friendships. While these friendships can be the very thing that help to keep us feeling supported and connected, they're very often what falls through the cracks—often because of poor communication, life changes, or even creeping resentment. Today we'll explore this layered topic of friendship, communication, and emotional health. We'll ask tough questions like why jealousy may creep into friendships and how to spot the warning signs that a slow drift is turning into a silent goodbye. We'll explore practical tools drawn from individual therapy and group workshops to inventory and acknowledge changes in ourselves and changes that might be happening in our friendships. We'll also talk about methods for engaging our friends in moments when we might have potentially previously ghosted them or let the relationship fade away. And we'll identify potential shifts in our cultural scripts to establish and maintain a supportive community of friends as we age. To walk us through this topic is Lia Love Avellino. Lia Avellino is a licensed clinical social worker, modern love therapist, writer, commentator, and community organizer. Lia is the Director of Head and Heart at The Well, a global ecosystem for wellness. Lia is also the host of the Unprocessed podcast. Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered podcast, Lia."

        "Avellino: Yes, this is a topic that people bring into therapy and support circles a lot, and I think friendship is complex for a few different reasons. As we inch towards midlife, the first thing that people are reporting is caregivers are very taxed right now. We have responsibilities for our elder parents, especially as people choose to have children later in life. We have young children, we have jobs, and what typically happens is we tend to prioritize the \"have to’s\" over the \"want to’s.\" So we're so focused on all the things we need to check off our lists because anxiety tricks us into thinking, If I get through this list, then I'll finally feel better. However, as I'm learning—and many of my patients—we never get through that freaking list. It just continues to grow. So these \"want to’s,\" these more optional, quote-unquote, things like friendships, tend to go to the wayside."

It's a time where many of us look back and we realize, Wow, we're getting towards half of our time on this planet—if we're lucky. And we did all the things right. We may have picked the partner, picked the job, had the kids, followed all of the societal rules. And because we did that, we're now at a developmental inflection point where we can say, Wait a second—who am I? What's happening? Why am I spending time with these people? What the hell do I actually want?",
        "And so midlife in psychology is often compared to adolescence because it's this time where we notice we have an increase in needs because we feel more lost, we feel more uncertain—but we're also ambivalent about how we feel about that. A part of us is like, Ugh, I don't want to have these needs. I don't want to have to fall apart. I don't want to have to be moody all the time in this perimenopausal, angry state, right? And so we're having an increase in needs, and the old ways of being no longer work for us—but we also have all these demands on us. So we don't really have time to negotiate all of this."

        "Avellino: I love that you said that second piece, 'cause I think sometimes that's why the first piece doesn't happen, right? So if someone's asking me to hang out and I keep delaying it, there's often a reason why. Sometimes it's the realities of my life, but sometimes it's because there's something in that connection that just doesn't feel so good. So the first thing to do is look at what you value. One thing I notice about people is they'll often say to me things like, I value connection, and then I'll ask a question: So how much time do you give towards connection in a week? And what we find is they gave to their dog, they gave to their kid, they gave to their exercise. They didn't give to that nurturing connection. So really getting curious about what do I value, and am I living my life in accordance with those values? The second thing is asking yourself, what is getting in the way? If I'm not, is it a belief system where I prioritize my partner's needs and my children's needs over my own? Is it that my relationships no longer fit as I've gotten to midlife and I've just been avoiding that because it feels too hard to grieve? Is it because I'm in a different life stage than many of my friends? So I often hear, for example, that people without kids remain connected mostly to people with children and then feel isolated. And that's an opportunity to not abandon the people with children, but also add people who are living life in a similar way. So really getting curious about what's getting in the way, and then figure out how to tweak what feels misaligned and prioritize it in a way that does feel aligned. So for example, at this time in my life, nights are really hard. I don't sleep very much. I, you know, I notice my energy is really low at night. So when I'm prioritizing my friendship, I know it's gotta be after a workout class for an hour. I know it's gotta be a 7:00 AM Daybreakers dance party. I know if it's a dinner, I need a month in advance. So I'm really realistic with myself about what my capacity is, and then I'm really transparent about communicating that capacity so my friends don't take it personally."

So you've made the time, you've made space in your day, but how do you sort of then take an inventory of yourself to feel out who's going to be, or what part of your life is gonna really add that quality connection that's gonna make that hour that you're gonna spend meaningful for you?",
        "Avellino: That's a beautiful question, and one thing that I find that gets more complex in midlife is we really start to differentiate and feel the difference between socialization and connection. And socialization is something that we have a much bigger bandwidth for because we have less demands on our time when we're younger. But as we get older, if that connection doesn't feel worth it, it often doesn't get prioritized. So one question that I work with my community around is: Does this friendship feel right for this time in my life? And if it doesn't, what do I wanna do about it? And there are choices. We are a culture, which you and I talked about at another ending, that's very ending-phobic. So sometimes friendships really do have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that that friendship has run its course and that that needs to be addressed. The second piece is that sometimes this is just a reevaluation point. Maybe there's jealousy that has creeped in or envy. Maybe there's some way that that other person is living that brings up something you want, and that because you haven't shared that, you're retreating from that person. Maybe you're experiencing something called intrapsychic grief, where you were on the same path as your friend, and now you're really grieving and letting go of the way you thought it would be—where they had a child, or they got married, or they got a big job and they're no longer available. So their transition was a loss for you that you never got to grieve alongside them. So I think if it's not feeling quality, it's getting curious about why. And oftentimes we wanna withdraw from those uncomfortable conversations because we believe that friendship should be fun and easeful. But those are actually the moments that you should lean in, in my opinion—that if you don't address that discomfort, it will surely lead to an ending. It's not about if , it's just when . Whereas when you address the discomfort and normalize it, that's when new opportunities can happen and you can ask yourself: Does this friendship actually have a second shelf life?"

'Cause oftentimes when we're hurt by someone or feeling disconnected from them, we focus more on their behavior than getting clear about what's real for us. So start with you. The second thing is, oftentimes by the time a friendship doesn't feel good, you've been swallowing your feelings for some time. So what that means is that you might wanna share with that person everything that's been on your mind and the 10 things that they've done wrong and really like feel so invigorated. So before we do that, really get clear on: What is my bottom line? What do I really wanna communicate to this person? And then ask them when they have space to have a conversation about the friendship, and put out your most important point: I'm feeling like the friendship isn't feeling good anymore. I haven't been feeling close to you. So much has changed, but we haven't really talked about that. So really using I voice, being clear about what you feel and what you need, and making space to ask what the other person feels and what the other person needs. And be aware that oftentimes we have assumptions. We might think someone doesn't wanna hang out with us or is not feeling connected to us because of something personal. Meanwhile, they're going through a dark time in their life and they've just been too embarrassed to share. So just really go in with an open heart and mind."

How do you think about dealing with that grief?",
        "Avellino: Unnamed grief is one of the biggest destructions of women's relationships. I've done therapy between friends before, which is a really beautiful practice. Oftentimes people think they just have to come in with their couple, their partner, but you could bring your friend in to work through these challenges too. And so when we experience a life change that's exciting or new—like getting married or getting a new job—our friend experiences a loss. And that is something that we need to make space for because as our circumstances change, our needs change. And if that grief doesn't get expressed, it often leads to distance. So having a conversation that normalizes: I'm so happy for the wonderful things in your life, but I'm so sad that we're not having drinks every Friday at 6:00 PM anymore. And that when I'm with you, you have a baby strapped on your chest, or your attention is different, or your availability is different. So naming it actually allows it to soothe and act as a balm for the relationship. Not naming it is what leads to the disconnection. So we talked in a past episode, Dr Pathak, about a good goodbye, and I believe we have to honor our past selves in our relationships— I'm not who I was, and you're not who you were. Can we try to figure out who we are now and what we need from each other in a mutually respectful and beneficial way?",

You know, we've also talked about ghosting in friendships and relationships. So do you need to have a good goodbye in these situations because it's gonna be helpful to you in the future with other friendships, with your own feelings?

        "That's a great question. So oftentimes if a drift has happened and we've moved along with it, right, there's been enough distance in the relationship for one or more of the parties to be accepting of that fact. However, if this is a more long-term relationship, having a good goodbye and really ritualizing that ending allows us to feel better about it. Ghosting at the end is often because we feel some guilt. So if you're retreating from a friendship and you're feeling guilty, and that's the reason why you're not honoring it and saying, \"Hey, this doesn't fit for me anymore. This is what I appreciate about our time together, but I'm gonna go off on my way,\" That's allowing you to have a connected no . It's something that Priya Parker, who focuses on gathering, uses—that term of saying, no, I don't want this, but I'm gonna do it in a way that really honors the relationship by saying, I'm connected to you and I value you. I just don't want to continue this path with you. But before we get to that ending, I like to go to and through an inventory of, have I tried? If the relationship is long-term, it can be possible that this is just a stage of distance. For example, there was a time in my life where I was having multiple babies and I had a friend that was having multiple miscarriages, and we decided to take a break. There was mutual love there, but the relationship was very painful for her. So there's all different types of endings. There's breaks, there's pauses, there's full endings. There's open-door endings, there's closed-door endings when there's been more harm or hurt. And so I think it's okay to sort of check in with yourself and ask yourself: Have I invested what feels appropriate to the type of connection we had in this goodbye? And if not, when I look at my future self, how will I feel if I look back at this relationship as ended? Do I think my future self will be okay with that?"

        "Avellino: Yes. I think this is really important because oftentimes when we're blaming the person, what we're not doing is looking at the system that's bearing down on the relationships—that are making the conditions. So for example, we live in a country that really prioritizes the nuclear family. We're separated out into individual homes in many communities. We are incentivized by the state to marry. We get plus-ones to weddings, and the assumption is that you bring your romantic partner—not a friend. And so all of this has led to us deprioritizing friendship in many ways. And it might also make people with kids feel like they're the ones that don't have to be flexible. So looking at those forces allows us to get curious about what's maybe not individual fault, but what's an absorption from our culture that we can interrogate together—which reduces blame. We also live in a culture that really promotes independence, right? I've been a therapist for 10 years, and it is still shocking to me how hard it is for us as humans—because of our early experience with dependency, and it maybe disappointing us—to really own that we need people. That healing happens in connection, and pain thrives in isolation. So living in an individualistic culture may make it hard for us to pick up the phone and be like, Hey you, I need you. Get in your car and come here. I just had a breakup. No ifs, ands, or buts, right? And really owning that need can be hard in a state of individualist values."

But the way that I look at it is that anything that we feel shame about is gonna have a more destructive edge to it. So if you feel shame about your envy and you conceal it, you don't investigate it in yourself—so it doesn't point you to what you need to get from it. And you also don't talk about it with your friend, which creates that chasm. So envy to me is an indicator of something you want, something that you are longing for, and oftentimes we position that envy in the person that has the thing that we want, and we start to develop negative feelings about them. But if you bring envy back to you and get curious about it rather than shameful, it is an invitation to not settle for things the way they are—to advocate for change in your own life. So really having a more positive attitude towards envy allows you to do something with it, continue to go towards and fight for the things you want. It also can feel like a huge relief to name it out loud. So for example, when I was having a hard time conceiving my second kid, I named to a friend like, Oh, I'm just so envious that this was so easy for you. I'm so happy for you. And I just, I really wish that I was on that same path. And she gave me a huge hug and I cried and I felt closer to her.

And again, this isn’t to say that you should, but just allowing our mind to start to think of things in new ways creates new possibilities.",

They're not a luxury or an afterthought, even though most of us probably also don't invest as much time into our friendships as we should. If we don't say the hard thing, it may inevitably erode a friendship, so it's crucial to make the implicit explicit. We invest in our friendships when we check in with ourselves—our reactions, our resentments, our needs—and communicate those effectively with our friends.

  "meta_description": "Why does jealousy sometimes creep into our friendships? How can we recognize when a slow drift is turning into a silent goodbye? And how can we strengthen communication and emotional connection with our friends? We speak with Lia Love Avellino, LCSW, modern love therapist and founder of Spoke Circles in Brooklyn, about the outside pressures friendships face, the importance of renegotiating connection, breaking the jealousy-shame cycle, and clarifying our needs in supportive, mutual ways. Friendships are vital to emotional wellness, so tune in to learn how to better check in with your friends and yourself.",
