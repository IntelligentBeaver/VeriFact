        "To understand trigger finger, you need to understand the anatomy of your hand. Tendons are strong cords that connect muscles and bone. When you contract a muscle, your tendon pulls on the attached bone to make it move. Tendons are very strong, but they aren't especially stretchy. They can be injured easily from too much strain, and they can take a long time to heal.",
        "Tendons are surrounded by a tissue layer known as the synovial sheath, which allows tendons to slide easily. Surrounding both the tendon and the sheath are soft tissue structures called pulleys. When your finger is working correctly, the tendon and sheath slide easily through the pulleys. Sometimes, a tendon or the surrounding synovial sheath gets inflamed and swollen. Long-term irritation of the tendon sheath can lead to scarring and thickening that affect the tendon's motion. When this happens, bending your finger or thumb pulls the inflamed tendon through a narrowed sheath and makes it snap or pop."
