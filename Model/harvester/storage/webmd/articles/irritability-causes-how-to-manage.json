        "We know irritability when we see it or feel it, but what exactly is it? Experts differ on the exact definition, but a way to think of it is as feelings of annoyance and impatience that are out of proportion to the situation. When you’re irritable, you’re in a bad mood and more likely to get angry. It’s something almost everyone feels at times, but some people feel irritable often enough for it to affect their lives and relationships.",
        "Irritability and anger are not the same, but they often go together. When you’re feeling irritable, you’re extremely sensitive to what’s going on around you and it can boil over and lead to anger. You may not be aware of it, but frustration plays a big role in irritability, and that can go hand-in-hand with anger.",
        "Among the traits that irritable people share is having a long list of pet peeves, says clinical psychotherapist Jackson Rainer, PhD, who practices in Atlanta. There are also those who \"feel they are not getting their own way, feel unheard, feel a general sense of frustration, and feel blocked from achieving a specific goal they have set. Those are fairly common themes.\""
