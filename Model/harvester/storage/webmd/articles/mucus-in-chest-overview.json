        "Your body naturally makes mucus every day, and its presence isn’t necessarily a sign of anything unhealthy. Mucus, also known as phlegm when it’s produced by your respiratory system , lines the tissues of your body (such as your nose, mouth , throat, and lungs). It cleans your nasal passages, keeps your tissues lubricated, filters out dust and bacteria you might inhale, and helps protect you from infection.",
        "Your body makes about a liter (approximately 1 quart) of mucus a day. But too much of it, especially if it's in somewhere like your lungs, can be annoying and possibly a sign of a health problem."
