        "Osteoarthritis is a disease that makes your joints painful and stiff. Unlike many other forms of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus , osteoarthritis does not affect your organs.",
        "The most common symptom of osteoarthritis (sometimes called degenerative arthritis) is pain in a joint after you use it over and over, such as when your knees ache after a day of bending up and down while gardening. Joint pain is usually worse later in the day. Joints affected by osteoarthritis might be swollen, feel warm, and make a creaking sound. Your joints might also hurt and feel stiff after you have been inactive for a while, such as when you get up from sitting in a theater for a few hours. If you have severe osteoarthritis, the cartilage (or padding) between bones is worn down, resulting in friction that causes pain with slight movements.",
        "Symptoms of osteoarthritis vary greatly from person to person. For some people, osteoarthritis can be crippling and greatly limit their activity. On the other hand, others may have few symptoms even though their joints are badly damaged. Symptoms of osteoarthritis may come and go. It’s not unusual for people who have osteoarthritis of the hands and knees to be pain-free for years before their symptoms return."
