        "From the time you are born to around the time you turn 30, your muscles grow larger and stronger. But at some point in your 30s, you start to lose muscle mass and strength. You keep losing muscle as you age. If you lose so much strength and muscle mass that you struggle with basic daily activities, you may be diagnosed with age-related sarcopenia or sarcopenia with aging.",
        "Everyone loses muscle with age, typically about 3%-5% each decade after age 30. Inactive people lose the most. The loss can become more noticeable and start to speed up at around age 60. After age 80, studies suggest somewhere between 11% and 50% of people have sarcopenia.",
        "One reason that the estimates vary so much is that different definitions and ways of diagnosing sarcopenia are used by doctors and researchers around the world.",
        "Sarcopenia can be a serious problem. Once you've lost a lot of muscle and strength, you may struggle to do things such as getting out of chairs, opening jars, or carrying groceries. You also can become frail and have a higher risk of falls, broken bones, disability, and death.",
