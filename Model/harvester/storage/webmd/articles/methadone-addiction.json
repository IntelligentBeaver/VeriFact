        "If you or a loved one is in recovery for an opioid use disorder, methadone is one of a couple of medicines that can help you get through it without many withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Sometimes people think this means you’re trading one addiction for another. But that’s a misconception that can get in the way of recovery.",

Methadone is a Schedule II narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act. That means it has a high potential for misuse that could lead to serious psychological or physical dependence. It’s not legal to use methadone unless a doctor prescribes it for you.",
