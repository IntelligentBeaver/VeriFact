        "Scleroderma is a long-lasting autoimmune condition that can affect your skin, connective tissues, and internal organs. An autoimmune condition is when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own tissues as if they were invaders, such as bacteria. In the case of scleroderma, your immune system causes inflammation and injury to the cells in your blood vessels. The cells in your skin and connective tissues react by making too much of the protein collagen, which forms the structure in your skin, connective tissues, and internal organs.",

        "As a result, your skin gets thick and tight, and scars can form on your lungs and kidneys. Your blood vessels may thicken and stop working the way they should. This leads to tissue damage and high blood pressure .",

        "Systemic sclerosis is also called systemic scleroderma. It's another form of scleroderma that can affect many organ systems in your body. It's more serious than localized scleroderma, which tends to only affect your skin and the structures that underlie your skin, such as fat, ligaments, and tendons.",
