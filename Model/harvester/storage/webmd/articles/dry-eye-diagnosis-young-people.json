Common symptoms of dry eye include: A gritty or sandy feeling in your eyes Redness or irritation Burning or stinging sensations Sensitivity to light (photophobia ) Blurry vision , especially after reading or using a screen Discomfort when wearing contact lenses For young adults, these symptoms might be triggered by prolonged screen use, wearing contact lenses for extended periods, or spending time in air-conditioned or dry environments. Unlike older adults, young patients may not immediately know that their symptoms point to a problem with tear production or quality."

Most are painless, though some may cause slight discomfort, like the Schirmer’s test or the placement of dye drops, but it’s temporary. Your doctor will explain each test beforehand and make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. Some of most common tests for dry eye include: Slit lamp test. A slit lamp test is a basic yet powerful tool used to examine the surface of your eyes. This special microscope has a bright, narrow beam of light that allows your doctor to examine your eyes closely. During this test, they’ll look for: Redness or swelling Damage to the surface of the eye (cornea ) Signs of inflammation or irritation To make certain areas of the eye easier to see, the doctor may add a dye, such as fluorescein, to the surface of the eye. This dye highlights dry or damaged areas, making them more visible under the light. The test is painless and takes only a few minutes. If you wear contact lenses, your doctor may also check how they’re affecting the health of your eyes."

        "The Schirmer’s test measures how much tears your eyes produce. This is done using a small strip of paper. The doctor places the paper under the lower eyelid and asks you to keep your eyes closed for about 5 minutes. The paper absorbs your tears, and the doctor measures how much moisture is present on the strip. While the test is safe, you might feel a slight tickling or discomfort from the paper. It’s important because it shows whether your tear glands are producing enough tears to keep your eyes moist. If your tear production is low, this could be a sign of dry eye disease that requires treatment. Tear quality and volume tests. These tests help evaluate both the amount and the quality of your tears to pinpoint the underlying cause of dry eye symptoms. Phenol red thread test: This test is similar to the Schirmer's test but uses a small thread instead of paper. The thread changes color as it absorbs your tears, giving a quick measurement of tear production. It’s less invasive and usually more comfortable than the Schirmer's test. TearLab osmolarity test: This test checks the salt concentration in your tears. High osmolarity means your tears are too salty, which can cause dryness and irritation. The doctor collects a tiny sample of tears using a small device. The process is quick and shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Tear breakup time (TBUT): The TBUT test measures how long your tears stay on the surface of your eye before breaking up. The doctor places a dye on your eye and observes how long it takes for dry spots to appear after you blink. A short tear breakup time means your tears evaporate too quickly, which could be causing symptoms."

If these glands are blocked or damaged, your eyes may not stay lubricated. The LipiScan test uses a special camera to take detailed images of the glands. The test is painless and takes just a few minutes. By looking at the structure and function of the meibomian glands, your doctor can see if they’re contributing to your dry eye symptoms.",

The test involves collecting a small sample of your tears with a small piece of soft fabric. The swab is then tested for inflammatory markers. You can usually get the results in about 10 minutes. If the test is positive, it indicates that inflammation is playing a role in your dry eye. This helps your doctor decide whether anti-inflammatory treatments, like medicated eye drops, might be necessary. InflammaDry is fast and provides results during your visit."
