        "Throat cancer is any cancerous tumor that grows in either your throat or voice box. Your throat (pharynx) is a muscular tube that starts behind your nose and ends in your neck. Your voice box (larynx) is right under your throat. It's made of cartilage and contains vocal cords that allow you to speak.",
