        "Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the eyes. TED causes swelling, inflammation , and damage in the muscles and tissues around the eyes. “The majority of cases are mild,” says Raymond Douglas, MD, PhD, an oculoplastic and orbital surgeon practicing in Beverly Hills and director of the Thyroid Eye Disease Program at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. Symptoms can vary, but they include: Redness Dryness Discomfort Pain behind your eyes Irritation Eyelid retraction (when your eyelid doesn’t close all the way) Bulging eyes Feeling like there’s something in your eye Blurry vision Double vision Bloodshot eyes Eyelid swelling Constant watering of the eye Headaches Eye socket pressure or pain"

        "TED usually happens in people who have Graves’ disease. Graves’ disease causes your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone, a condition called hyperthyroidism . “About half of patients with Graves’ disease will develop thyroid eye disease,” Nasr says. He adds that most cases of TED happen within a year to 18 months of developing Graves’ disease. About 80% of people who come in with TED have already been diagnosed with Graves’ disease, Douglas says. Around 10% are diagnosed with TED before Graves’. Another 5% of TED cases are in people with Hashimoto disease, Nasr says. In this condition, your thyroid doesn’t make enough thyroid hormone, a condition known as hypothyroidism . Though it’s rare, Douglas says some people with TED don’t have a thyroid condition at all. Thyroid eye disease is more common in women than in men. But when men develop TED, it tends to be more severe. Douglas says cases of TED peak around ages 40-50 and again around age 60."

        "Three conditions can cause hyperthyroidism. One is Graves’ disease, the most common one. The others are thyroid nodules and toxic multinodular goiters. “Graves’ disease is the only condition where you can see thyroid eye disease associated with high levels of thyroid hormone,” Nasr says. Both thyroid eye disease and hyperthyroidism are immune system disorders. “From what we know, there are two receptors that seem to be the culprit,” Douglas says. One is the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor, which is mostly on thyroid cells. The other is the insulin -like growth factor (IGF-1) receptor, found mostly on the cells around the eyes. These two receptors sit next to each other, he says, and appear to be linked. Experts don’t understand why, but the immune system starts to attack these receptors. When it attacks the TSH receptor, this causes too much thyroid hormone. “It’s like turning up the thermostat way too high,” Douglas says. When the immune system attacks the IGF-1 receptor, it increases the amount of IGF-1. The cells around the eyes get fat, divide, and accumulate extra scar tissue, causing thyroid eye disease. If you have Graves’ disease, certain things can make your risk of developing thyroid eye disease higher. These include: Having a family history of TED Smoking Being female Getting radioactive iodine treatment Older age Stress Poorly controlled thyroid"

They can keep track of your eye pressure, check your corneas, and do tests to make sure your optic nerve is in good shape. Nasr also works with neuro-ophthalmologists to monitor the optic nerve. “Once in a while, we use strabismus specialists to work on correcting muscles to minimize double vision,” he says.",

If you notice your eyes bulging, vision changes, or your eyelids aren’t closing all the way, Douglas advises seeing your doctor. “Don’t just settle for an unsatisfactory answer,” he says. Nasr makes a point of asking all his patients who have autoimmune thyroid disease if their eyes are dry, uncomfortable, or if they have pain behind them. “Dry eyes are probably the most common symptom in patients who have thyroid eye disease,” he says. But since dryness can be subtle, it can go unnoticed."
