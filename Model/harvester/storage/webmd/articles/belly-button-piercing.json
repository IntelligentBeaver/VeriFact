If you want to get a belly button piercing, keep in mind that it only takes a few minutes to get it done, but it can take up to a year to heal. During that time--as well as after--you'll need to take extra care of this area.",

The Association of Professional Piercers advises that you avoid \"pregnancy jewelry\" as they're not made of safe materials.
