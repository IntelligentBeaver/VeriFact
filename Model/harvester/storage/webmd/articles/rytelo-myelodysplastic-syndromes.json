        "Rytelo (imetelstat) is a medicine used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) . MDS is a rare group of disorders that affect your blood cells. Most people who get MDS are 65 years of age or older, but younger people can get it too. With MDS, your bone marrow cells become abnormal and make blood cells that do not grow or work like normal cells. The syndromes are a type of cancer . Some cases are mild, and others may be serious. Symptoms include anemia , feeling very tired or weak, feeling short of breath when you are exercising or being active, bleeding, bruising, and paleness. Treatment depends on the type of MDS you have and how severe it is.",
        "Treatment may include regular checkups and lab visits to check your blood cell counts, blood or platelet transfusions , or medicines called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) that increase the number of red blood cells in your body. Lifestyle changes are also helpful, such as not smoking, regular exercise, eating healthy foods, sleep, and stress management.",
        "Rytelo is a medicine used for certain people with MDS that have low- to intermediate-1 risk MDS. It is approved to treat adults that have anemia, require red blood cell transfusions, and cannot take ESAs because these medicines are no longer working or cannot be taken due to other reasons."

        "The main ingredient in Rytelo is imetelstat, an anticancer medicine that blocks the activity of an enzyme called telomerase. Telomerase is more active in abnormal MDS cells. Rytelo binds to telomerase, which helps to stop more abnormal blood cells from forming and may cause the abnormal cells to die. This helps the bone marrow recover and make normal blood cells, which improves symptoms of anemia and reduces the need for blood transfusions."

You will likely be given medicine such as diphenhydramine (or another antihistamine ) and hydrocortisone (or another steroid) by mouth or IV about 30 minutes before your Rytelo infusion to prevent or lessen reactions. Infusion-related reactions may include headache , feeling unusually tired, muscle or joint pain, back pain , stomach pain, diarrhea , itching, redness, or hives .",
