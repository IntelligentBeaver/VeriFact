        "Fever, chills , muscle aches. These are common features of many conditions, from seasonal flu to a rare disease called tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). But you’d never mistake TRAPS for a common illness.",
        "With TRAPS, fever lasts more than a week: sometimes 3 weeks, sometimes months. It’s recurrent, which means it comes back again and again throughout your life. And those muscle aches? For a lot of people, they’re more like severe muscle pain.",
        "TRAPS is an autoinflammatory disease that causes certain white blood cells, which normally fight infection, to attack and sometimes destroy healthy cells. It happens because a faulty gene makes your body think you have an infection when you don’t. The result: Inflammatory chemicals surge inside your body (which is how your body fights an actual infection) and you feel lousy.",
        "TRAPS, which used to be called familial Hibernian fever, is quite rare. The odds of having it are literally around 1 in a million. Experts say only a thousand people around the world have ever been diagnosed with TRAPS."
