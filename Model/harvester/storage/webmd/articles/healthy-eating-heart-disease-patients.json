Improving your diet and fitness can slow the artery-clogging process, and may even stop or reverse the narrowing of arteries .

        "Get enough protein. Include a variety of protein foods (lean meat, low-fat dairy products, beans, nuts, legumes, and fish).",
        "Limit fat. Avoid eating saturated fats (butter, full-fat dairy products, fatty cuts of meats) and trans fats (found in some packaged baked goods, microwave popcorn, and deep-fried foods). Favor monounsaturated fats (canola and olive oils and some nuts, for example), and follow your doctor's guidelines about how much fat is too much.",

        "Exercise every day. Exercise strengthens your heart, improves blood flow, curbs high blood pressure, raises HDL \"good,\" cholesterol, and helps control blood sugars and body weight.",
        "Hydrate. Staying well-hydrated makes you feel energetic and eat less. Ask your doctor about how much water you should drink each day, in case you need any restrictions. And remember, foods that are rich in water count, too."
