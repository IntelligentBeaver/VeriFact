        "Better ability to talk. Dentures that slip in your mouth may cause you to mumble or slur your words. Dental implants allow you to speak without your teeth slipping around.",
        "More comfort. Your gums change shape to fill holes where you had teeth, and they continue to change shape over time, so dentures tend to become loose and shift around. Dentists recommend you get your dentures realigned every once in a while and completely replace your dentures every 5-8 years because of the way your gums change shape over time. Because they become part of you, implants can be more comfortable than dentures that slip around on top of your gums.",
        "Improved oral health . Dentures that slip and slide in your mouth can make your gums sore or even make your gums infected. Bacteria and fungi can live in any cracks and crevices of your dentures, which raises your risk of getting an infection. On the other hand, implants allow easier access between your teeth, so you can continue to floss for good gum health. Also, you may need to have some of your teeth shaved down to wear a tooth-supported bridge. With implants, you don't need to have nearby teeth altered, which can improve your long-term oral health.",

        "Protection against bone loss. The roots of your natural teeth are anchored in your jawbone. This stabilizes your jawbone, as a load-bearing wall does inside your house. When you have teeth removed without replacing them, your jawbone can get worse over time. This can change the shape of your face and mouth. Since implants are fixed in your jaw like your natural teeth, they stabilize your jawbone and prevent bone loss."
