        "Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall). Methotrexate is the chemotherapeutic drug most widely used by rheumatologists because it is effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis and certain other rheumatic diseases (such as certain forms of vasculitis , or inflammation of blood vessels), and it is relatively safe. Most patients can take methotrexate by mouth in a single, weekly dose. Some patients prefer to take it as an injection once a week. Its common side effects are relatively easy to monitor, treat, and prevent.",
        "Azathioprine (Imuran). This drug has been used for many years as an immunosuppressive drug to prevent organ rejection in patients receiving kidney transplants. Usually taken in a single or twice daily dose by mouth , it is also used to suppress the abnormal immune response in some patients with vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), and rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). This is a more powerful drug and has more side effects than methotrexate and azathioprine. It is usually given intravenously to treat the most aggressive and dangerous rheumatic diseases and their complications, such as severe lupus and some forms of vasculitis.",
        "Rapidly reproducing or growing cells, such as immune cells, are destroyed by cyclophosphamide. Other rapidly reproducing cells in the body may also be affected by cyclophosphamide and this accounts for some of its side effects. The drug also destroys good immune cells and this results in an increased risk of infection."
