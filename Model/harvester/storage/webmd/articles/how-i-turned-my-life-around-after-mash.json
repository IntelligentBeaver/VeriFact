        "When Bruce Dimmig, 68, was diagnosed with stage 3 (III) metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in 2022, he was determined to turn his life around.",
        "“I went through my entire pantry and refrigerator and measured the amount of sodium , fat, and fiber in each food,” says Dimmig, a MASH patient advocate, who lives in Surprise, Arizona. “The diagnosis itself was overwhelming. This was something I could do on my own to actively improve my health.”",
        "About a third of people in the U.S. live with some form of metabolic dysfunction associated-steatotic liver disease (MASLD). But only 5 people out of 100 have metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a more serious form of the condition.",
        "Fortunately, both MASLD and MASH can get better and even be reversible through changes in eating habits and exercise, says Amon Asgharpour, MD, a liver specialist at Virginia Commonwealth School of Medicine in Richmond.",
        "“The liver is an amazing organ,” Asgharpour says. “A lot of patients, when they are first diagnosed with MASH, blame themselves. But I stress that their liver is very forgiving.\""
