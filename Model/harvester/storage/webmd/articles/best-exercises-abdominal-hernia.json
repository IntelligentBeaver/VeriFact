        "An abdominal hernia is when an internal organ, often the intestines or bladder, pokes through the wall of muscle that usually keeps it in. Most are inguinal hernias (occurring in the lower abdominal groin area near the inguinal canal) or femoral hernias (occurring near the femoral canal, also in the groin area). However, there are also umbilical hernias, which occur near the belly button, and hiatal hernias, in the upper abdomen.",
        "Abdominal exertion or heavy exercise is one of the causes of abdominal hernias. If you already have an abdominal hernia, you must be extra careful when you exercise. After hernia surgery, there are exercises you can do to help with healing and to increase core strength to prevent a hernia from recurring.",
