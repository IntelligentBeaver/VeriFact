        "When you are exposed to an allergen -- for example, ragweed pollen -- it triggers your immune system. People with allergies have an exaggerated immune response. Immune system cells known as mast cells release a substance called histamine , which attaches to receptors in blood vessels, causing them to enlarge. Histamine also binds to other receptors causing redness, swelling, itching, and changes in secretions. By blocking histamine and keeping it from binding to receptors, antihistamines prevent these symptoms."
