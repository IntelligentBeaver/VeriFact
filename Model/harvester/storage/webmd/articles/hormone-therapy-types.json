        "Hormone therapy will likely be one of your main treatments if you have advanced prostate cancer. That’s cancer that has spread to other parts of your body or has come back after treatment. Also called androgen deprivation therapy, androgen suppression therapy, and testosterone depleting therapy, it helps stop cancer cells from growing by blocking their main source of fuel – male sex hormones called androgens. It’s not a cure, but hormone therapy can keep prostate cancer under control, sometimes for years. The most common androgens are testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Everyone has them, but you have more if you were assigned male at birth. Your testicles make most of your testosterone, and some of that gets changed into dihydrotestosterone. Hormone therapy for advanced prostate cancer works in two ways: by stopping your body from making androgens and by keeping cancer cells from using these hormones. There are several different methods and classes of drugs that can be used in this treatment."

        "LHRH agonists are drugs that block the production of testosterone where most of it begins: in your brain. When your androgen levels are low, an area of your brain called the hypothalamus sends a chemical called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) to your nearby pituitary gland. That causes this gland to make luteinizing hormone (LH), which signals your testicles to make testosterone. Taking an LHRH agonist floods your system with an imitation form of this hormone. That causes a temporary surge in your testosterone production, called a testosterone flare. But it also causes your body to stop making LHRH naturally. Soon , your pituitary gland stops responding to the LHRH agonist, and your testicles don’t get the message to make testosterone. This is called medical castration. This may be the first type of hormone therapy your doctor prescribes. Because an LHRH agonist can cause your testosterone levels to rise at first, your prostate cancer symptoms may get worse for a few weeks. Your doctor may give you another kind of drug called an antiandrogen before or while you take an LHRH agonist to prevent this."
