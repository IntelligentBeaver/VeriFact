        "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that stops your body from using insulin the right way. If you’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , it means your blood sugar (or glucose) levels are too high. Insulin is a hormone made in the pancreas. It helps carry glucose to the body’s cells. Glucose comes from many of the foods we eat. Your body uses glucose as energy to feed your brain, muscles, and heart. If glucose can’t reach the cells, it builds up in the blood, and the cells stop working the way they’re supposed to. This is why type 2 diabetes can affect the whole body."
