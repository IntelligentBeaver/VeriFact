        "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a condition that affects your eyes and spinal cord. It is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the nervous system, causing inflammation. NMOSD mainly affects nerves that control vision (optic nerves) and the spinal cord ( which helps control movement and sensation ) .",
        "NMOSD symptoms may include vision problems , weakness, hiccups, and problems with bladder or bowel control, among others. When symptoms suddenly get worse, it’s called an attack or relapse. High-dose steroids are commonly used as a rescue treatment to help stop an attack.",
        "NMOSD can cause repeated attacks, or relapses, that can be weeks or even years apart. Each attack can leave behind more damage. Over time, repeated NMOSD attacks can lead to permanent vision loss and trouble walking. Because of this, preventing future attacks is a major goal of maintenance, or ongoing, treatment. One such treatment option you may hear about is Uplizna (inebilizumab) .",
        "Uplizna may also be used for other conditions as determined by a health care provider.",
        "This article will focus on what to know about using Uplizna for NMOSD, including how it works, how it was studied, how to manage side effects, and more."

        "Autoimmune disorders happen when the body’s own defense system, which normally protects you from infections, mistakenly attacks healthy cells. B cells are a type of white blood cell in your immune system. One of their main jobs is to make antibodies, which are proteins that normally help you fight infections.",
        "In people with NMOSD, certain B cells mistakenly produce antibodies that target a protein called aquaporin-4 (AQP4).

For adults with NMOSD who are AQP4 antibody - positive, many experts recommend starting long-term immunotherapy as soon as the diagnosis is made. One option is Uplizna."
