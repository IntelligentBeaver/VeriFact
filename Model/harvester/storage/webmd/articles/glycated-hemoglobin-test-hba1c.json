        "Hemoglobin is made up of four protein chains called globins. Two of the globins are called alpha chains and two are called beta chains. Each globin has a compound with an iron molecule in the middle called a heme group. The iron molecule is what binds to oxygen to carry it through your body.",
        "What does hemoglobin do?",
        "Each heme group can hold one oxygen molecule, which means one hemoglobin molecule can hold four oxygen molecules. The alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin are arranged in a special way that helps each oxygen bind efficiently. Once one oxygen molecule binds to a heme group, the structure’s shape changes slightly so that the next oxygen molecule can attach more easily, and so on."
