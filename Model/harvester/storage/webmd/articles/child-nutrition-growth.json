        "Stick with the treatment plan. Treatment will help your child eat better. Take children who are diagnosed with Crohn's disease , says Asim Maqbool, MD. \"They’ll come in not feeling well, not eating well, and as soon as they start to get medication to treat the underlying diagnosis, you’ll find they’re able to eat more food and can gain weight.”",
        "Pick a dietitian or nutritionist who specializes in kids. It’s one thing to tell an adult what to eat. “It’s another thing to tell a picky 4-year-old,” Mukkada says.",

For example, if your child has chronic diarrhea, he may need extra zinc. Or if his condition causes blood loss, like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis , he may need more iron.",
        "Shun empty calories. Potato chips taste great, but junk food isn’t the way to help your child gain weight. Healthy fats like avocados and olive oil will do him more good. A carbohydrate or protein powder or supplement drink can also help. Ask the nutritionist or doctor about what's right for your child.",
        "Nix the added sugar. Sugar is another easy source of calories, but sugar isn’t nutritious. And too much sugar, especially from fruit juice, can cause diarrhea , especially in young children.",

Most likely, your child needs fiber when his disease isn't flaring. To find out how much he needs, add 5 to your child’s age, Driggers says. That's the number of grams of fiber he should get a day. Ask his doctor or nutritionist which kinds of fiber are best.",
        "Keep mealtimes structured. It may help your child to eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of three big ones. Make sure some meals are family events, so eating is more fun. “Set mealtimes and try to emphasize having the family eat those meals together, so it’s both a nutritional and social event,” Mukkada says."
