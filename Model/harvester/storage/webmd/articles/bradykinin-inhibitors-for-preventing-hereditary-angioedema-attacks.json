        "When you have hereditary angioedema (HAE), recurrent attacks of swelling can be not only traumatic but also life-threatening. Swelling in your face or throat can close your airways. Attacks in your stomach come with pain, nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms. Swollen hands and feet can make it hard to do many everyday activities. It can take many years to get the right diagnosis and treatment for HAE. Without the right treatment, your HAE attacks could happen often and last for days. Fortunately, there are now several medicines approved to treat HAE. Recent advances in treatment mean you can live a normal life with the right treatment plan in place. HAE medicines work to stop or prevent your attacks by reducing excess levels of the substance called bradykinin that's behind your swelling in different ways. You'll need a tailored plan to treat and prevent your attacks. Let your doctor know all the ways your HAE symptoms are affecting you. Talk to them about the best plan for you, how your current treatment plan is working, and whether it might be time to try something new."

        "When you have HAE, it's usually because of changes in a gene encoding the production of a protein in your blood. It's called C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). Another name for HAE is C1 inhibitor deficiency. Sometimes it happens because the C1-INH protein doesn't work the way it should. While rare, it's possible to have it for other reasons, too. The deficiency or abnormal functioning of that C1-INH enzyme causes your body to make and release too much of another substance, called bradykinin. Bradykinin has an important role in controlling inflammation. This substance makes your blood vessels relax and open wider to increase blood flow. When your blood vessels relax too much, they can become leaky, leading to swelling, or edema, in your hands, feet, stomach, intestines, airways, and throat. Medicines in different drug classes treat HAE in different ways, but they all block or lower excess levels of bradykinin to stop or prevent your swelling."

        "HAE treatments generally work well to stop or prevent attacks. For example, one trial found the bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant helped with symptoms in five minutes to two hours. Complete resolution of symptoms typically happened within 48 hours. A clinical trial of the kallikrein inhibitor ecallantide found it helped with attacks in 72.5% of cases. That's compared to 25% of people who got a placebo instead. By comparison, a clinical trial of lanadelumab showed it led to an 87% reduction in attacks. Most people taking it in the study didn't have any attacks. A study of one C1 esterase inhibitor found that 75% of those who took it had relief of symptoms within an hour. In a clinical trial, the factor XIIa inhibitor garadacimab reduced HAE attacks by more than 99% in most people. It also helped people avoid on-demand treatment for attacks. More than half of those taking the medicine were attack-free while on the treatment. Some treatments are approved only for adults, while others are approved for younger people with HAE.
