        "Search “ brain exercises for older adults” online, and you’ll find suggestions for everything from sudoku to chess. You’ll also find dedicated brain training programs or apps that promise to boost memory, attention, and more, with the goal to keep you mentally sharp no matter your age. They often claim to be backed by science. But does brain exercise or “brain training” actually work?",
        "“As a scientist, it’s not a black-and-white, yes-or no-answer,” says Susanne Jaeggi, PhD, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, Irvine. “I’d say it depends. It can be useful as part of your general set of things you do as you get older, along with physical exercise , good diet , good sleep schedule, and in general keeping active, cognitively or mentally speaking. There’s a lot you can do to keep in shape, and brain exercise can be part of it.”",
        "That said, many apps promise that if you do their exercises for even a few minutes a day, “it will prevent dementia ,” she says. The reality is more subtle and complicated."

Researchers designed it to test whether different kinds of brain training could help people stay independent with age by improving their mental abilities.",

So, those who trained to do visual searches quickly got faster at them. Those who worked on problem-solving usually improved in that area. Memory training led to some improvements, too, though less often.",

It’s possible that’s because people in the study didn’t have any cognitive impairment to start with."
