        "Bullying happens at school, in neighborhoods, and online. Both children and adults can be victims of bullying, but most often you hear about children bullying other children. It is a serious issue that can lead to many mental health problems or worse if not handled well. If you think you or someone you know is being bullied, seek help from various resources available in your community.",
        "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines bullying among youths as aggression from an individual or group of five to 18-year-olds toward another youth. Bullying involves an imbalance of power that’s repeated or likely to be repeated.",
        "Aggression means unwanted, harmful behavior or threats of harm. Sibling violence and teen dating violence can involve similar behaviors but are considered separate issues. An imbalance of power means that the person being bullied doesn’t feel they can stop the aggression. The bully is physically stronger than them or has others’ support."
