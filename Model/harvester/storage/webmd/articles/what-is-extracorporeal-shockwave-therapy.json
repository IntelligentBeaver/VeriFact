While it has gained popularity as a method for treating foot- and ankle -related injuries, it has also been used in treating kidney stones. ESWT was first developed as a method to treat kidney stones and gallstones and has been successful in treating those conditions for two decades.",

        "Shockwave therapy helps to accelerate the body’s normal healing process. It helps speed up the recovery of injured joints and tissue while diminishing pain and discomfort.",
        "Extracorporeal shockwave therapy works in two ways, either through focused shockwaves or radial pressure waves. Both methods are outpatient, and several treatments may be required to treat your specific condition.",
        "The focused shockwave method uses a very focused impulse to target affected areas through an extracorporeal shockwave therapy machine. There is no need for anesthesia since the shockwave used is low energy. The patient lies down with the affected area exposed. The doctor applies a special gel to the affected area, which helps deliver the impulses deeper into the skin .",
        "The ESTW machine is turned on and the instrument, or shockwave gun, is pressed against the affected area. Rapid impulses are then delivered to the patient. Treatment typically lasts between 5 and 15 minutes. While this treatment can be uncomfortable for some, most do not experience any pain."
