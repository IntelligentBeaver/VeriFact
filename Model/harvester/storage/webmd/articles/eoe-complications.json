        "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) causes inflammation and swelling in your esophagus . It shouldn't change the length of your life, but it could affect your quality of life. Over time, EoE can leave permanent damage and scars in your esophagus that make it hard to eat. The stress of living with a chronic disease can be hard on your emotional health, too. There’s no cure for EoE, but proper treatment, which usually includes medicine and changes to your diet, can keep it under control. Because EoE is a lifelong condition, it's important to stick to your treatment plan. When you do, you can avoid potential physical and emotional complications."

This thick, tough tissue narrows the passage that food and drinks travel from your mouth to your stomach and makes it difficult for them to get through. When this happens, it might feel like food is stuck in your throat and make it uncomfortable to eat. If you can't eat much, you won't get the nutrients you need to stay healthy. Severe swelling can narrow your esophagus so much that food gets stuck inside. This is called an impaction. It's an emergency that needs medical attention right away. A lot of swelling in your esophagus or throwing up from EoE can damage the esophagus so much that holes form in the lining. The name for this is perforation. Holes in the esophagus are also a complication of endoscopy , a test that helps your doctor diagnose EoE and monitor the disease."
