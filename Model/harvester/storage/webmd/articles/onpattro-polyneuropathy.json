        "People with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) have a change in a gene (mutation) that causes the liver to make abnormal forms of a protein called transthyretin (TTR). Transthyretin helps move vitamin A and thyroxine (a thyroid hormone) throughout the body.",
        "In hATTR, the abnormal transthyretin proteins clump together and form deposits called amyloids. These amyloid deposits can build up and damage tissues, nerves, and organs, which can lead to serious problems and death.",
        "When the deposits build up and damage the nerves (polyneuropathy), it can affect your ability to sense or feel things. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including trouble walking, seeing, hearing, or feeling. It can also affect other important body functions, such as going to the bathroom, digestion, sweating, and blood pressure or heart rate.",
        "Onpattro is called an RNA interference medicine based on how it works. You may also hear it called a small interfering RNA (siRNA). As these terms suggest, Onpattro interferes with and causes the breakdown of messenger RNA (mRNA) that the body needs to make transthyretin proteins. By doing this, Onpattro helps lower the amount of both normal and abnormal transthyretin proteins. This can help lower the buildup of amyloid deposits. You may also hear Onpattro called a “gene silencer” medicine because it breaks down the RNA genetic template used to make transthyretin proteins.",
        "Onpattro is also a “lipid complex.” This means the medicine (patisiran) is in a fat (lipid) complex, or carrier. This helps the medicine better reach and get into the liver cells where it needs to work."

The amount of vitamin A you should get each day (the recommended daily amount ) depends on your age and sex assigned at birth. Vitamin A is found in several foods, such as fish, liver, dairy, and some fruits and vegetables. You can also get vitamin A from vitamin A supplements . You should not take doses of vitamin A higher than the recommended daily amount. Talk with your health care provider about how much vitamin A to get through your diet and whether to take a vitamin A supplement. Too much vitamin A can cause problems, so be sure to tell your health care provider about everything that you take, such as a multivitamin.",

Skin problems, such as itching, dryness, or scaling, can also happen with low vitamin A levels, and you may also have a higher risk of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have any of these symptoms."
