        "Anterior ankle impingement (footballer's ankle) is a painful pinching or compression of either the soft or the bony tissue at the front of your ankle joint. It happens when the tissue of the joint swells from repetitive motion and stretches beyond its maximum point. As a result, the ligaments thicken and get caught between your lower leg bone ( tibia ) and upper foot (talus). As a natural response, your body starts to build up extra bone tissue called bone spurs (osteophytes) in the injured area.",
        "Because this type of ankle impingement most commonly affects soccer players, it's known colloquially as footballer's ankle. These athletes engage in repetitive motions using their legs, ankles, and feet. Repeating these same ankle motions over and over causes small traumas, which eventually result in more serious injuries."
