        "July 16, 2001 -- Sandra Allen was a young pharmacist , with five years' experience under her belt, when she made her first mistake: Instead of giving a customer the correct dose for his medication , she misread the prescription and gave him 10 times the proper amount. The man ended up in the emergency room and had to undergo detox treatment to clear the medication from his system.",
        "\"The following week he came into the pharmacy and told me what happened,\" the now-retired pharmacist from Wisconsin tells WebMD. \"I apologized profusely and asked him if there was anything I could do. He told me the trip to the emergency room cost $60; I happened to have enough cash in my pocket, so I gave it to him.\"",
