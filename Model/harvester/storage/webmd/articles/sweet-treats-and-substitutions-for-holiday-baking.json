        "The winter holiday season is synonymous with sugar. Cookies for Santa, hot chocolate by the fire, gingerbread house decorating, and lots of desserts after festive meals. Rather than being a treat, these sweets can be a lot to control when you are also managing food allergies.",
        "Dessert recipes typically call for many of the top nine food allergens, including wheat, dairy, egg, and nuts. I’m not a professional baker, but I’m an experienced food allergy mom who has learned how to work my way around a kitchen, including around those pesky allergens. I’m delighted to share some of my favorite allergy-friendly packaged saviors, my own go-to holiday confections, and a list of easy substitutions for your baking this season and beyond.",

        "When my boys were diagnosed over a decade ago, the allergy-friendly packaged food scene was grim. There were simply very few options, leaving parents like me to figure out on my own how to make everything from scratch. This is not my strong suit, so I am so grateful that there has been an explosion over the years of “free-from” products that are available in grocery stores and online. Of course, everyone has different allergens and comfort levels with cross-contamination, so please read every label carefully to decide if it’s safe for your family.",

I cook them according to the directions on the package, and then we decorate them with our own dairy-free icing. I mix one container of Violife dairy-free cream cheese (contains coconut) with one bag of powdered sugar and mix until smooth. The more powdered sugar you add, the thicker the icing will be. We then top the cookies and icing with either Supernatural Sprinkles or crushed YumEarth candy canes. I love that my family gets to enjoy the tradition of making holiday cookies without having to create everything from scratch or worry about allergens."

Make the cake according to the directions on the box, but then add ½ tablespoon of vanilla extract, one heaping tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice, and an additional teaspoon each of cloves and ginger if you want extra spice. I like to make this in a Bundt pan so it looks pretty, then sprinkle with powdered sugar through a mesh sieve to decorate it. This is particularly delicious with coffee for a breakfast treat.",
