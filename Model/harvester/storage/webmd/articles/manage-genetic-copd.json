        "By Wissam Chatila, MD, PhD, as told to Kara Meyer Robinson When you learn you have genetic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD ), the first step is to educate yourself about your diagnosis. If you have genetic COPD, also called alpha-1, it means you have low levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT). That's a protein made in the liver that travels through your bloodstream and protects your lungs . If there's too little AAT circulating in your blood, you can get liver disease or lung disease. It’s important to be aware of treatments and other resources that are available to you. Since this is a genetic condition, you may want to consider screening your family members, too."

        "I use a variety of strategies to help patients manage alpha-1. First, I do blood tests to establish their genotype, or type of genetic defect. This helps me see whether they meet the criteria for augmentation therapy. Augmentation therapy, or replacement therapy, uses AAT from donors to increase AAT in your lungs and prevent more damage. It may be good for certain patients, but not others."

For example, certain therapies such as inhalers and anti-inflammatory drugs, or procedures such as placing valves in the airways, may work better under certain circumstances. Next, I educate my patients. I tell them how important it is to stick with their treatment plan and avoid triggers. This is essential to prevent rapid lung decline and permanent loss of lung function. I teach my patients about how serious their COPD is. I also tell them about illnesses that often occur along with alpha-1, including liver disease, vascular disease, and inflammation of vessels and skin. Other diseases linked to COPD include: Diabetes Kidney disease Heart disease Depression Anxiety I emphasize how important it is to take care of their health in general. This includes age-appropriate screenings like colonoscopies, mammograms, and prostate exams. It also includes low-dose CT scans for lung cancer screening, testing for lipid and blood sugar levels , and mental health and sleep screenings."
