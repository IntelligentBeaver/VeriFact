        "When you have hand eczema, it can cause chronic problems. The itching and irritation may have serious consequences for your everyday life. You may find it hard to work or go to school. You may be missing too many days or struggling to enjoy life. When hand eczema symptoms are severe, they can be debilitating. The goal of treating your hand eczema is to improve your symptoms, so you will get relief. By treating your hand eczema and avoiding triggers when you can, you may be able to get your condition under control. The best treatment option for you will depend on what’s causing your hand eczema. It also will depend on how severe and debilitating your hand eczema symptoms are. For a long time, treatment for hand eczema focused mainly on moisturizing creams or emollients. Topical steroids are another medication that’s long been used for hand eczema. But now there are other medicines you can try to tackle the underlying processes in your body that are causing the itchy or painful inflammation on your hands."

        "While you will have options to consider, there haven’t been many medicines approved specifically to treat hand eczema. Doctors have often used treatments approved for atopic dermatitis, sometimes referred to as eczema, when topical treatments haven’t worked. But chronic hand eczema isn’t always related to atopic dermatitis, which is an autoimmune condition that affects many parts of your body. Some basic things you might buy over-the-counter or try at home to help with your hand eczema include: Ice packs or cold compresses Petroleum jelly Moisturizing creams containing more oil than water Bleach baths Wet wraps Trigger avoidance, including wearing gloves when doing wet work or handling irritants Medication options for hand eczema Existing treatments doctors may use for hand eczema include: Topical steroids (corticosteroids) Topical calcineurin inhibitors Topical phosphodiesterase inhibitors Topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) modulators Oral steroids Retinoids IL inhibitors JAK inhibitors Biologics The best choice of medication for you may depend on whether you have signs of eczema or atopic dermatitis on other parts of your body or not. It may depend on what’s causing or triggering your chronic hand eczema and its symptoms. It also will depend on whether your hand eczema symptoms are mild, moderate, or more severe, and how much they’re impacting your life and ability to work or do other everyday activities. You’ll likely start with basic steps you can take at home or at work and topical therapies first. If topical therapies and other steps you can take to protect your hands aren’t working, talk to your doctor about systemic medicines you could try for your hand eczema."

Talk to your primary care doctor or dermatologist about what kind of topical corticosteroid to use. Corticosteroids come in different: Types Strengths or potencies Concentrations of active steroid Formulations It’s usually best to choose a stronger ointment for hand eczema. Ointments will lubricate your skin more. Ointments also do a better job compared to creams in creating a barrier on your skin that will help to hold moisture in. Depending on the type of hand eczema you have, it might also help to wrap plastic dressings around your hands to help the topical steroid soak into your skin better. Talk to your doctor about potential side effects of topical corticosteroids and ways to make them less likely. For example, topical steroids can damage your skin barrier over time or cause your skin to atrophy. Talk to them also about how many times per day you should apply topical corticosteroids to your hands."

Two calcineurin inhibitors are approved for atopic dermatitis. They’re called pimecrolimus and tacrolimus. But these medicines aren’t approved specifically for hand eczema. There’s some evidence from studies that tacrolimus might help with hand eczema. But the data is limited. There’s very little evidence showing how well pimecrolimus works for hand eczema. Still, doctors may recommend you use a calcineurin inhibitor if topical steroids aren’t working for you. Calcineurin inhibitors also might be a better option if you need to use a topical treatment for your hand eczema for a long time. That’s because calcineurin inhibitors don’t have some of the side effects that come with topical corticosteroids. In some cases, you might use a topical steroid or calcineurin inhibitor a couple times a week to prevent your hand eczema from flaring back up. If basic steps to manage your hand eczema together with topical moisturizers and steroids haven’t resolved your hand eczema symptoms, ask your primary care doctor or dermatologist if you should think about a topical calcineurin inhibitor."

But the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib is a topical treatment that works in the same targeted way for treating mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in people 12 and up. Delgocitinib is a topical pan-JAK inhibitor. That means it blocks all enzymes in the JAK family. Delgocitinib ointment is approved in some countries for atopic dermatitis. The FDA approved it for hand eczema in 2025 under the brand name of Anzupgo.
