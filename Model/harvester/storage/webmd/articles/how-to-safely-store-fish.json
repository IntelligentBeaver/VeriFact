When you’re shopping for fish, check to make sure that it’s either displayed on a bed of ice or in a refrigerator with a temperature no higher than 40℉. Fresh fish shouldn’t have a fishy or stinky smell, and the eyes should be clear and shiny. The fish’s skin should be firm, and the gills should be red. If the fish is already cut into fillets, there shouldn’t be any discoloration around the edges.",
        "If you’re buying frozen seafood, check to make sure that it’s packaged tightly, with no rips or tears. If you can see through the package, check to make sure that the fish doesn’t have any ice crystals attached to it. This is a sign that the fish has been thawed and then frozen again.",
        "Freshly caught fish starts to deteriorate as soon as it's killed. If you’re catching your own fish, make sure to store it on ice immediately after you catch it. The best option is to place it in an ice slurry to keep it as fresh as possible until you return home."

The skin should be firm and shouldn’t be too soft. Shellfish, like shrimp and scallops, shouldn’t have any odor and should have a pearly color. Discoloration or smell is a sign that the seafood has gone off.",

Scombroid poisoning is a type of food poisoning from eating certain kinds of fish that weren’t properly handled and stored. Symptoms usually begin within 15 minutes to two hours after eating the contaminated seafood. Most people recover within 12 to 24 hours without treatment but experience uncomfortable symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea , and abdominal cramps."
