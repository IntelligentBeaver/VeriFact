        "When it comes to keeping healthy, medical experts always talk about diet and exercise. They don’t talk about sleep, but in my experience, sleep has been among the best medicines. When I sleep well, I don’t get sick as often, I think better, and I have more energy. Studies confirm that insomnia (difficulty sleeping) is a big problem for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is closely connected with one of the worst symptoms, fatigue.",
        "I’ve written about sleep frequently for diabetes publications, because poor sleep worsens blood sugar control. I find a night of poor sleep leaves me a little depressed and anxious, which studies show is a common pattern in people with MS.",
        "They say MS is caused by our immune systems, and sleep is vital for good immune function. Sleep is when the immune system can get to work without all the demands of waking life. People with insomnia have higher levels of inflammatory immune system proteins such as tumor necrosis factor, and inflammation is a major part of MS. So most of us can benefit from more sleep."

(No caffeine!)",

Some studies have shown shift work can affect many people’s immune systems. Now I try to get into a sleep pattern, going to bed at the same time, turning off the light after 30 or 60 minutes of reading. I try to get outside every day, especially on sunny days, because daytime sun helps people sleep.",

        "What about naps? Nap time is a ritual in many cultures, and for people with MS, napping may be unavoidable. Short naps (so-called power naps) are great, and you may even be able do them on a lunch break at work. I like longer naps, too, but some scientists say long naps can interfere with nighttime sleep. I haven’t noticed that problem, but maybe you can see how they work for you."
