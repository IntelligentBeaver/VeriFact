When you take your medicine correctly, you also help ensure that your drugs will continue to work to control your HIV. If you don’t take your medications exactly as directed, not only can your viral load increase, but your body can also become resistant to these medicines. That means they stop working.",
        "For those whose viral load is undetectable and who may prefer a bi-monthly injection to daily pill taking, CABENUVA (two injections--one for each of the two drugs in this combination drug ) is now available. Consult your doctor about whether it might be an option.",
