        "Some medical experts say Morgellons is a physical illness. But most suggest it is a type of psychosis called “delusional parasitosis,” but it does affect people physically because a person thinks parasites have infected their skin.",
        "“The condition is both a physical illness and a type of psychosis. It’s a physical manifestation of a psychiatric disease,” says Brian Toy, MD, an attending dermatologist at Providence Mission Hospital and a clinical professor in the School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. “The skin lesions seen in this condition are self-inflicted due to a symptom called formication — the tactile sensation of bugs crawling under the skin.”",
        "Your doctor may call it an “unexplained dermopathy,” which means a skin condition that occurs without a known reason.",
