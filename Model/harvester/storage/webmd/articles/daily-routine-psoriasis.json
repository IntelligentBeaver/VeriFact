        "Another great way to avoid stress is to prepare for anything. That means, every night before work or school, make sure you have everything you need to help you avoid your individual triggers. You can also pack the things you need in a bag that stays in your car or next to the front door. Your flare-up-causing triggers are unique to you, so you know them best. But here are a few tips on common triggers you might need to prepare for and how to avoid them if they apply to you: Bug bites: Double-check that you have bug spray before heading out each day. If needed, write in reminders to use it on your schedule. Sunburn: Pack a hat, UV-resistant clothes, and sunscreen. If needed, write reminders on your schedule to reapply sunscreen throughout the day. Cold, dry air: If you’ll be in a building with cold, dry air, pack a mini-humidifier and your moisturizers. Food triggers: Plan out, and pack if needed, your meals and snacks for the next day to ensure you always have access to something you can eat that won’t trigger a flare. Allergies: Take allergy medication with you wherever you go. On the days you need to take it, because you know you might be around allergy triggers, add medication reminders to your written schedule. Finally, be sure to work in time to rest if you do have a flare-up. Your schedule might be filled with deadlines and your new, carefully crafted routine, but sometimes flare-ups happen. Include a little wiggle room in your routine for rest. Plan to complete essential tasks ahead of schedule. That way, your daily routine makes it easy to push something back when you need to take some time off to feel better."
