        "HIV has a number it’s important to know. That’s your viral load, an indication of how much of the virus is found in your blood. The lower the number, the better. That’s because HIV breaks down your immune system. You can get your viral load so low, it’s below detectable levels. (This is called undetectable.) When you’re undetectable, you can’t transmit the virus sexually. But the higher your viral load number is, the more you may be contagious or sick.",

You can’t transmit it, you’re not susceptible to opportunistic diseases or illnesses, and you can live a long, healthy, dignified, and productive life. Isn’t that a “functional cure”?",
