        "The type of stroke most people have likely heard of affects the brain. It’s also called a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The cause of a CVA is the same as a spinal stroke — either blood flow is blocked or there’s a break or tear in a blood vessel, causing bleeding. The difference between the two types of strokes is where the blockage or bleeding takes place in the body and how common they are.",
        "With brain strokes, a blood vessel in your brain becomes blocked or broken. With a spinal stroke, the block or break happens in your spinal cord.",
        "Brain strokes are much more common than spinal strokes. Every year, almost 800,000 people in the U.S. have a brain stroke, and almost 90% of them are ischemic strokes.",

Katsafanas, DO, neurologist and director of the Neurology Residency Program at Marcus Neuroscience Institute. “In my years of practice, I’ve seen a handful of them, definitely less than 10,” she says."
