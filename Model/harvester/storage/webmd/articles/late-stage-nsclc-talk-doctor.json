        "Your doctor can share details about your cancer and talk about your treatment options. They also can tell you how effective treatment may be, possible side effects, and how that treatment might affect your quality of life. “Late-stage, or metastatic, NSCLC means that cancer cells have spread beyond an initial primary tumor in one of the lungs,” says Jeffrey Ward, MD, a medical oncologist at Siteman Cancer Center in St. Louis. Your doctor may explain where the cancer has spread and recommend next steps, which may involve more testing and appointments with a specialist. “It’s incredibly important that you feel comfortable having an open and honest discussion with your medical oncologist about your treatment goals,” Ward says. An oncologist is a doctor who specializes in cancer."

        "With late-stage NSCLC, a positive outcome is possible. “There’s been an incredible explosion of novel treatments for patients with advanced NSCLC in just the last few years,” Ward says. Immunotherapy, which helps your immune system control cancer, and targeted inhibitors, which are usually given as pills, may keep your cancer at bay for years, he says. The key is to know which of these treatments is your best option. Specialized testing will help your doctor choose what’s best for you. “Unfortunately, these treatment approaches will not be successful for all patients, so it’s critically important to have an honest discussion with your oncologist about what to expect,” Ward says. “Metastatic NSCLC isn’t a disease we consider curable. The goal of treatment is to prevent cancer from progressing and to control your symptoms.”"

You may become less able to care for yourself. “Usually, these are things a caregiver will want to be aware of,” Fish-Steagall says. Your doctor may tell you what to expect when treatment is unlikely to help. “Once a patient is in a bed or chair for more than 50% of the day and needs help with dressing, going to the bathroom, or getting something to drink, it’s less likely to be of benefit,” says Fish-Steagall."
