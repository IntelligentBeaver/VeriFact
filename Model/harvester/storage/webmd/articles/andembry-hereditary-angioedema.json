        "Andembry (garadacimab-gxii) is a biologic medicine used to prevent hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in adults and adolescents. During an HAE attack, swelling under the skin happens in different areas of the body. While swelling in the throat area is not particularly common, when throat swelling does occur, it can be deadly since it can close off your airway. Certain situations or triggers can cause these attacks to happen. Common triggers for attacks include stress, surgery, medical or dental procedures, infections, and tiredness. People with HAE have to take medicine to prevent these attacks from occurring and also need to have a rescue medicine readily available to treat any breakthrough attacks.",
        "Andembry was approved in June 2025 to prevent HAE attacks in people 12 and older. It is the only activated factor XII (factor XIIa) inhibitor on the market used to prevent HAE attacks. Andembry is not used as a rescue medicine to treat breakthrough HAE attacks, but it can lower the number of attacks that happen."

Bradykinin is linked to inflammation and swelling in HAE attacks. Lowering the amount of inflammatory bradykinin in the body helps to lower the number of HAE attacks that people have."
