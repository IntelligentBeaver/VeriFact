        "Stroke (also called a \"cerebrovascular accident,\" or CVA) is a disease of the blood vessels in and around the brain . It occurs when part of the brain does not receive enough blood to function normally (called \"ischemia\") and the cells die (infarction), or when a blood vessel ruptures (hemorrhagic stroke ). Ischemia is more common than hemorrhage and can be caused when a vessel (artery) supplying blood to the brain becomes narrowed by a fatty deposit called plaque. This is also called atherosclerosis. This plaque can rupture and form a blood clot that along with pieces of plaque can travel to blood vessels further in the brain and block them causing a stroke. In addition, clots can arise in the heart (called a \"thrombus\") and travel to the brain (called an \"embolus\"). Permanent damage to brain cells can result.",
