        "Moyamoya disease is a rare disease in which a blockage to the carotid artery in your head reduces how much blood can get to your brain. As a result, your body creates tiny blood vessels (called collaterals ) in a desperate attempt to try to get blood to your brain. You may have strokes, ministrokes, or bleeding in the brain . It can also affect how your brain works. Moyamoya disease mostly affects children, though adults can get it, too.",
        "In addition to strokes, ministrokes, and brain bleeding, moyamoya disease can impair your brain function. It can lead to disability as well as cognitive and developmental delays.",
        "Though the collateral blood vessels may help in the short term, they eventually stop working. Without treatment, moyamoya disease can be fatal -- but there are ways to treat it."
