        "I drink a lot of water daily as a way of managing fatigue. Typically, I feel like my “tubes” and my insides in general overheat, meaning my esophagus, my tongue, etc., feel hot. I know; it’s weird. So, I find that drinking ice-cold water all day as I need minimizes those symptoms. That’s why I keep with me an insulated bottle of water filled with ice and I refill it as I go.",
        "Fatigue is always present, so there’s no way out of drinking rivers of water for me. Which takes me to my next point. I have to use the restroom many times a day. I also feel overheated while I’m sleeping. It literally wakes me up. So, the strategy to stop drinking water by 6 p.m. and to prevent using the bathroom at night doesn’t work for me because I’m constantly needing water.",
        "I thought that I just needed to use the bathroom all the time because of my excessive water intake, but no. I just found out through my urogynecologist that I have an overactive (spastic) bladder . My bladder can’t hold urine as long as normal, and I feel a frequent urge to urinate. This is caused by the interruption of signals sent from my brain to my bladder, due to MS."

Another thing I get with this is the hesitancy to start urination. This is nothing more than having to push when trying to urinate. It’s kind of a double standard: I feel the urge to go even if it’s just a little bit, but then I have trouble urinating and I have to push.",
