        "Your seventh-grade son wants to join a social network to swap skateboarding tips with his pals. Your daughter in high school doesn't hang out at the mall with her girlfriends like you once did -- she's too busy posting selfies with them on Instagram.",
        "Should you put a stop to this digital dependence ? Is it a good idea to instill your fears in your kids about the dangers of sexual predators on the Internet, and the possibility of permanently writing their adolescent wrongs, searchable forever, online? And what about the perils of sexting -- texting with sexual overtones and often imagery?",
        "Kids need to understand online safety issues and learn the dos and don'ts of \"cyberdating.\" But researcher and author Danah Boyd, PhD, says it's just as important that they tackle technology now. Especially, she adds, since today's children have been denied some of the freedoms previous generations took for granted as they grew up.",
        "\"These technologies are not going away,\" says Boyd, whose book, It's Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens , cites her 10 years of fieldwork documenting teens on Internet usage. \"This is how public life is now constructed. We need young people to learn to navigate these environments responsibly. We do our youth a disservice when we simply exclude them from these dynamics and then expect them to figure it all out when they're off in college.\""
