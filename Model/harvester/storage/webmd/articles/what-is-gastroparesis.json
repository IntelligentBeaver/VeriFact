        "Gastroparesis is a disorder that affects the nerves and muscles in your stomach and stalls the movement of food to the small intestine. Under normal conditions, muscles in your stomach help to break down food into smaller pieces. These same muscles also push the food farther along, moving them to the small intestine for more digestion. In gastroparesis, food can remain in your stomach for too long and cause problems.",
        "Who’s at Risk for Gastroparesis?",
        "Gastroparesis affects about four times as many women as men, but overall, the condition isn’t common. However, if you have diabetes, you’re more likely to develop gastroparesis; about 1/3 of all cases are related to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Gastroparesis caused by diabetes happens because consistently elevated blood glucose levels damage the nerves in the stomach. In addition, high blood glucose concentrations also harm the blood vessels that transport oxygen and nutrients to stomach muscles.",
        "There are other reasons for gastroparesis. People with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), those who’ve had surgery on their stomach, small intestine, or esophagus, those with certain nervous system disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis, or people who have had radiation therapy for cancer to their stomach or chest areas are more likely to have gastroparesis."

If you have gastroparesis, work with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) who’s an expert in gastrointestinal issues. An RDN can help you adjust your diet and lifestyle to help manage symptoms and avoid complications related to poor nutrition, dehydration, and abnormally high or low blood glucose levels. Avoiding alcohol, smoking and tobacco in any form, and recreational drugs can help your discomfort. Everyone’s approach to managing gastroparesis will be different, but it may help to avoid eating large meals. Consuming modest amounts of dietary fat and fiber can also be beneficial. Fat and fiber take longer to digest and contribute to slower stomach emptying."
