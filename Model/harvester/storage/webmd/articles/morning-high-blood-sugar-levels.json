        "It occurs because diabetes interferes with your body’s ability to respond to normal hormonal changes that happen in the early hours. Between 3 a.m. and 8 a.m., your body releases hormones that are designed to boost your blood sugar and give you energy to start your day when you get up. That happens whether you have diabetes or not. If you don’t, your body produces more insulin , which allows your cells to use blood sugar for energy. You don’t even notice that it’s happening."
