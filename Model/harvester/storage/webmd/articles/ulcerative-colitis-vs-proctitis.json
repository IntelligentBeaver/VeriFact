        "Proctitis is inflammation of the rectum, the last part of the large intestine that connects the colon to the anus. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It causes inflammation in the inner lining of both the rectum and colon. The \"-itis\" in both proctitis and ulcerative colitis (UC) refers to inflammation.",
        "Proctitis can be its own condition when the cause is an infection or something else. Or it can be a form of ulcerative colitis that's only in the rectum, which is called ulcerative proctitis and is the most common type of proctitis. About 30% of people with UC have ulcerative proctitis. In 27% to 54% of people who are diagnosed with ulcerative proctitis, the inflammation spreads up the colon and progresses to ulcerative colitis.",
