        "Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, or EPI, is a digestive condition in which your pancreas does not produce enough enzymes to properly break down food. Without adequate enzymes, the body struggles to absorb fat, protein, and key vitamins, leading to digestive symptoms and malnutrition over time. Although EPI is often underdiagnosed, early recognition and treatment can dramatically improve symptoms and your quality of life.",
