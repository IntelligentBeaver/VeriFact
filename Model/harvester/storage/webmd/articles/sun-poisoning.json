        "Sun poisoning doesn't mean you've been poisoned. It's not a formal medical term, but when people talk about sun poisoning, they're usually talking about a severe sunburn that seems similar to an allergic reaction. It's a burn that doesn't just redden or darken your skin — it makes you feel sick and intensely uncomfortable. In some other cases, people might use the term sun poisoning to refer to actual allergic reactions to sunlight, which are rarer.",
