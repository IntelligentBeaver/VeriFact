        "Elle Lee found herself in the emergency room with kidney failure at the age of 26. She was told she had a rare kidney disease and needed dialysis . “I thought they were going to give me a pill or some medication, and I was going home,” says Lee. “So you can imagine my emotional experience when I was told, ‘You’re going to need a machine to live.’ I couldn’t process it.” Lee immediately went into “survival mode,” quitting her job, moving back in with her mom, and starting dialysis. Like Lee, half of the people who go on dialysis find out in the emergency room. “It’s a devastating surprise,” says Paul Conway, vice president of the American Association of Kidney Patients (AAKP), who went on dialysis when he was 29 years old. “It’s confusing. You’re told by doctors we wish we had seen you earlier, and you sometimes feel guilt and anger that it wasn’t detected early enough.” For Lee, her first order of business was staying alive — the effects on her mental health came later."

If you are able to do dialysis at home, it may make it easier for you to keep your employment, work part time, or do other things that are important to you. Edwards eventually transitioned to home dialysis and credits it with keeping her healthy while she continues to wait for a transplant. Lee says home dialysis was “life-changing because I was in control of my treatments. I felt better, and that gave me some confidence like, I can figure this out.” Like Edwards and Lee, you can always ask about other dialysis options later in treatment. “Diagnosis can be a really overwhelming time for patients,” says Cukor. “There's so much information, and it's really hard to figure out what you need to put in place.” If you later decide you would like to try home dialysis, ask your doctor."

It wasn't even really talked about at all.” She decided to help herself and others by going to school to become a therapist and now runs an online practice specializing in supporting people with kidney disease. “I recommend that people be proactive,” says Cukor, “because it’s easier to head off an episode of depression than dig your way out of it.” He urges patients to be honest when they fill out the depression screening given to them each year. “That’s an opportunity to gauge if your depression is getting to the point where treatment should be initiated,” he says."

        "“Psychotherapy and medication are the two cornerstone treatments of depression treatment in the general public and for people with medical illnesses,” says Cukor. “Some people like to talk and enjoy that experience. Some people really don't. If you feel like you don't, then try medication.” Whichever sounds better, Cukor recommends trying it to “see if it lightens the load a bit.” Cognitive behavioral therapy is a specific form of therapy focused on helping you change thoughts and behaviors to improve your mood. It can be especially helpful for someone living with chronic kidney disease, says Cukor, because CKD changes your routine and behaviors significantly. CBT therapists work with you to identify thoughts and behaviors that are not helpful, then increase supportive thoughts and behaviors. Together, you can work to maintain parts of your life that bring you happiness and feel rewarding that have nothing to do with your illness. Acceptance and commitment therapy is one of the main approaches Lee takes with her clients. The focus is on figuring out your values — what matters to you — and then taking action on those things you can control. For folks on dialysis, “there is so much that is out of our control,” says Lee. ACT is focused on answering the questions: What do you care about? What kind of life do you want to lead? Because there are still things to live for. Antidepressant medication acts directly on your brain to increase the brain chemicals associated with positive mood, which can lessen symptoms of anxiety and depression. “Largely, these medications don’t interact with the other medications prescribed for kidney patients,” says Cukor. “They are not metabolized in the kidney, are not dialyzed out, and, in general, they work.” Lee also works with her clients to find out if other treatments such as physical therapy, acupuncture, or yoga might help. “I really encourage people to open that door to therapy and get started. Look for a therapist with a background in chronic illness.”"
