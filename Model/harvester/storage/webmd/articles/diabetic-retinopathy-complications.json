        "If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes , you probably already know that you have a greater chance of developing eye problems. One of the most common ones is diabetic retinopathy. This is a condition that affects the blood vessels in your retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of your eye. If you have too much sugar in your blood, there’s damage to the tiny blood vessels that provide oxygen and other nutrients to the retina. As a result, your eyes can’t work properly, and you get blurry vision.",

        "Diabetic macular edema (DME). Over time, about half of people with diabetic retinopathy will develop DME. When you have diabetic retinopathy, the walls of the blood vessels in your retina weaken. They can leak fluid and blood into the central part of your retina, known as your macula. This is the part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed central vision. The macula swells and causes symptoms like blurriness, double vision, and a sudden increase in eye floaters."
