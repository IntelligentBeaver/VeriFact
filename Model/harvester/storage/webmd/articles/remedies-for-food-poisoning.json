        "Stomach flu usually results from a virus that you get from someone who is infected with it. In contrast, you usually get food poisoning when you eat food that wasn't cooked long enough or that sat out of the fridge for too long.",
        "Both cause symptoms such as nausea, throwing up, and diarrhea. But there are a couple of different clues about which is causing your symptoms. One way is by how quickly your symptoms start. Food poisoning usually starts about 2-6 hours after you eat the contaminated food. Whereas, stomach flu generally starts about 1-2 days after you get exposed to the virus. Another way is by how fast you get over it. Food poisoning symptoms are usually short and intense, but stomach flu lasts a few days or longer. Also, stomach flu is less likely to cause symptoms such as fever and chills compared to food poisoning."
