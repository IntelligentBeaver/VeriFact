That's how he learned that African American people, like his father and himself, were more likely than Americans of any other large racial or ethnic group to die of heart disease.",
        "\"My business partner and I had an epiphany,\" Suggs says. \"We knew African American men didn't trust the health system for a number of historical reasons, but they are going to the barbershop every 2 weeks, so why couldn't we be the bridge between the barbershop and African American men's health?\"",
