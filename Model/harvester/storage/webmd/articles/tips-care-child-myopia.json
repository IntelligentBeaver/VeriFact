Work with your child to come up with rules that work for both of you. Talk about the following and let your child voice their opinion: Where can your child use digital technology? Set aside certain areas as off-limits for electronic devices, such as the car or their room at bedtime. When can your child use the technology? Allow your child to decide when they want to use their computer, phone, or tablet. Let them voice how they want to handle their digital technology session times. If you negotiate these rules with your child, they will likely take responsibility for them. What other activities does your child enjoy? Have a conversation about other activities they enjoy: taking part in a sport, playing a musical instrument, baking, or working on a craft. Spending time on other interests is a great way for your child to naturally cut down on screen time. When is outdoor time scheduled? One of the best ways to balance screen time is to go outside. Make it clear that outside time is required, and have your child decide how they want to spend it."
