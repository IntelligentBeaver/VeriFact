        "A parasitic twin is a rare condition where a baby is born with an underdeveloped twin attached to its body. Also known as “vestigial twins,” this condition is closely related to conjoined twins — babies that are connected at birth and share organs. The main difference is that conjoined twins present two developed babies, while parasitic twins require one of them to be severely underdeveloped and non-functional.",
        "The developed, functional twin is medically known as the autositic or dominant twin, while the underdeveloped one is simply referred to as the parasitic twin. The dominant twin is usually healthy in most aspects but may have extra tissue, organs, or limbs from the parasitic conjoined twin.",
        "The parasitic twin may be attached to the dominant one in one of several places. They commonly join at the head, torso, abdomen, chest, pelvis, buttocks, or back. It’s important to remember that the parasitic twin isn’t alive — they almost always die during birth or even while in the womb."

While this may sound too harsh for a newborn baby, leaving a parasitic twin untreated can cause many complications.

In some cases where the parasitic twin causes deformities, your baby may also need surgical reconstruction of specific body parts.",
