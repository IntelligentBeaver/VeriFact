        "When you are living with diabetes , the hallmark of disease management is the tracking of your blood glucose levels. Blood glucose tracking will tell you how much insulin is needed by your body. Variable blood sugar levels can cause damage to your body. Blood sugar that is too high or extremely low is bad and, if not treated rapidly, can even be life-threatening.",
        "Several things can affect blood sugar management, and diabetes will affect different people in different ways. Diet and medication may affect one person's glucose level in one way and cause a different outcome for someone else. That is why you should always properly monitor your glucose levels. Your body can be unpredictable, and this can make diabetes management challenging.",
        "Many people choose to regularly use a fingerstick blood check and glucose monitor to check glucose levels. A fingerstick check, though, will only measure the glucose level of the blood at that particular time, so performing additional checks at different intervals will produce a more comprehensive picture of your day."
