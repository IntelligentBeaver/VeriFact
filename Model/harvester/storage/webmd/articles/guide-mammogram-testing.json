        "A mammogram is a screening test for breast cancer which uses special X-ray images to detect abnormal growths or changes in breast tissue.",

This set of images is called a mammogram. Breast tissue appears white and opaque and fatty tissue appears darker and translucent. Many centers also do 3-D mammography . This is similar to regular mammograms but many more pictures of the breast are taken at various angles to produce a 3-D picture for the radiologist to check.",
