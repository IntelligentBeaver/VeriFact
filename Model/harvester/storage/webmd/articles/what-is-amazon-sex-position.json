The main version is with the top partner squatting over the bottom partner who has their knees pulled into their chest. The kneeling version lets the top partner kneel on their shins, which can take some pressure off their legs. In the reverse position, the top partner turns around facing away from the bottom partner. This version is best for anal sex.",
