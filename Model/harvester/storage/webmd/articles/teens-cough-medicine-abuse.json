        "Over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicines are safe and effective when they’re used as directed. But taking too much of them -- on purpose or by accident -- can make you feel high. That can lead some people to abuse them.",
        "Before the FDA outlawed codeine in cough medicines in the 1970s, OTC cough medicines created a cheap and effective high. A drug called dextromethorphan (DXM) replaced codeine in cough medicines. At very high doses, it can mimic the effects of illegal drugs like PCP and ketamine .",
        "More than 125 OTC medicines sold to treat the symptoms of cough and colds have DXM. It’s in common brands such as Coricidin, Dimetapp DM, Nyquil, Robitussin DM, Robitussin CF, and Robitussin Cough and Cold, as well as store brands for cough and cold medicines.",
        "You might not think twice if you find these meds in your teen’s book bag, but you should be aware of their potential for abuse.",
        "Teens are more likely to abuse cough medicines because they can get them easily and without a prescription. Kids can also learn online where to buy the drug and how to use it to get high.",
