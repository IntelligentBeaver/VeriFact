It may sound like a contradiction, but the best way to nurture your preschooler's independence and self-confidence is to keep their life fairly structured.

When they ask to do something you know isn't a good idea, hold firm and consider offering a safer alternative . Being allowed choices within a structured framework will help to boost their self-confidence while at the same time letting them know they are safe and secure."
