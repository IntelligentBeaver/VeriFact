        "Oct. 30, 2000 -- Deep in the wilds of your local sewer system, a microscopic drama is unfolding. Invisible to the naked eye , a virus with a bulbous head, spindly neck, and spidery legs glides toward a plump bacterial cell. After alighting, the bacteriophage punctures the cell's membrane and injects its own genes, which force the cell to mass produce viruses. In less than an hour, the victim cell explodes, scattering a brood of 200 newborn viruses. Each of them immediately begins prowling the sewage for more prey.",
        "Bacteriophages, or phages for short, do nothing but attack and destroy bacteria. They thrive anywhere bacteria are abundant -- in sewage, on food, in water, even in your body -- and they've honed their killing technique for more than a billion years. Now some scientists in the United States and Europe hope to deploy these expert assassins to battle outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",
        "For nearly 70 years, this approach, known as phage therapy, has been a standard treatment for bacterial infections in the former Soviet Union. In the West, phage therapy was dismissed as a failure decades ago. Now scientists in Europe and North America are turning once again to the tiny predators."

        "Around the world, patients are dying from bacteria that were once easily tamed with antibiotics . So scientists are scrambling for new treatments. Phages look promising for a number of reasons, starting with their prolific reproduction. With conventional antibiotics, the concentration in the blood peaks after each dose and then dwindles. Not so with phages -- their numbers actually keep pace with the number of bacteria, says microbiologist Mike DuBow, PhD, of McGill University in Montreal. \"It's the only drug that makes more of itself.\"",
        "Also, each kind of phage usually attacks only one species of bacterium. That means that phages are extremely unlikely to turn on us -- they don't have a taste for human cells -- and they won't mow down the helpful bacteria that live in our intestines , as antibiotics often do. This pickiness also explains why the phages within your body don't automatically kill off invading bacteria before you get sick. With so many kinds of phages around, you probably don't have the right kind to fight that particular bug."
