        "Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss in people older than 50. When you have this condition – also known as AMD – a part of your retina called the macula is damaged. You slowly lose the central part of your sight, although your peripheral, or side, vision isn’t affected."

Any type of vision loss can cause depression, but research shows that people with AMD may have a higher chance of having depression than people with other eye conditions such as glaucoma.",
        "Though not as common as depression, anxiety is another mental health issue that affects people with low vision. If your eyesight is weak, you may become especially anxious about social situations such as eating in a restaurant or traveling somewhere unfamiliar. Treatment for one type of AMD involves injections into the eye. These shots made some patients more anxious, studies show."
