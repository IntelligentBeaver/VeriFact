            "Oral medicines. Your doctor may consider an androgen receptor blocker to block androgen hormones from glands that make oil. One example is spironolactone (Aldactone). Your doctor may suggest an oral contraceptive (birth control) that helps with your acne if you need to prevent pregnancy as well.
