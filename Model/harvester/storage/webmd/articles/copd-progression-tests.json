Using computer technology, it creates detailed images of your bones, blood vessels, and soft tissues, offering more information than regular X-rays. Doctors do this test to find out if you have emphysema or chronic bronchitis, two types of COPD. A CT scan also gives your doctor a closer look at how your COPD is progressing. It helps them see if the disease is getting worse or staying the same. By using this detailed picture, the doctor can figure out the best way to help you feel better."

According to recent research, COPD is not accurately diagnosed or measured in many Black and Asian people when spirometry is the main diagnostic tool used. Researchers are working to find better ways to test for this condition in people in these communities. In the meantime, doctors should use spirometry in combination with other tests to be sure of accurate results."
