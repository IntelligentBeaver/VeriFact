        "When I was 23 years old, I thought my life was perfect. I was studying for a nursing school, had a good job, a beautiful girlfriend, amazing family and friends. I went traveling everywhere. All of a sudden at the end of 2016, I started feeling dizzy, nauseous, and tired all the time. I also had stomach pain, headaches, and mood swings. I felt altogether unwell, but cancer was the last thing I thought it was.",
        "When the symptoms didn't go away, I went to a local hospital for some scans and tests. They said I had appendicitis, and I went in for emergency surgery for an appendectomy. They took out my appendix before it could rupture (and potentially kill me), and I set a follow-up appointment for two weeks later. One week passed and I felt even worse. I was nauseous, vomiting, and fainting.",
        "At that point, my parents made a difficult decision and removed me from that small hospital. They took me to the best hospital they knew of, which was NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia in Manhattan."

Still, I tried to do my part to get well, which meant getting up, walking in the hallways of the hospital, trying to move even if I had IV poles connected to my veins all day or if I was tired. I prayed, did my best to remain positive, and I tried not to stay in bed all the time. Thank God for my family. I had the people closest to me – my mom, my dad, cousins, friends – always making sure I had anything I needed. They helped me get through those tough times.
