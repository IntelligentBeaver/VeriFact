I don’t want to be all \"judgy\" because if coffee was ever restricted in certain areas, I would lose it! However, I’m so glad that most indoor establishments are nonsmoking. It’s only when I accidentally step outside near a smoking area that I’m reminded of how sensitive I am to it. I’ve also had a tough time traveling to countries in Europe where smoking here, there, and everywhere is so in vogue. My poor lungs take a beating."

Add to that a love for all types of music and dancing is my happy place. Unfortunately, dancing in a hot room or any type of vigorous exercise can kick-start some wheezing for me. It’s so unfair at times. I could see if I were an introvert or professional wallflower, but I’m kind of the life of the party! There’s been more than one occasion where I’ve gone from dancing one minute to wheezing in the bathroom the next. Party pooped. I’ve found relief by taking a puff of my inhaler before an intense workout, which could also include a robust cupid shuffle."

        "If you gave me $10, I’d use it for coffee, a cute office supply, or some type of new scented household cleaner. Weird, I know. I enjoy cleaning. It’s a stress reliever to me and it’s often something I have to do before I’ll allow myself to relax. I get it from both my parents – the oldest of large families with healthy doses of type A personality. I took the whole ‘cleanliness is next to godliness’ thing seriously. Do you mean I could wipe my way to angel wings? Well, let’s go! Unfortunately, the harsh chemicals and smells haven’t been so saintly to my lungs. I didn’t always make the connection between a cleaning spree and some difficulty breathing shortly afterward. The whole reason I was cleaning was probably to ensure a dust-free, mite-free breathing space. These days, I use nontoxic cleaners as much as possible. I love my subscription to The Grove Company. I crack a window or two when I’m cleaning, and I will often wear a mask as well."
