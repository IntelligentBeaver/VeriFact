        "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes your central vision to get worse as you get older. An estimated 19.6 million people over 40 live with AMD, and nearly 1.5 million of them have their vision threatened by the condition. There are two forms of AMD: dry and wet. Both involve damage to the macula, or the part of the eye that helps you see what's right in front of you. Wet AMD is the rarer, more serious form of the condition. It happens when new blood vessels form in the back of your eye that leak fluid and damage your macula. When it gets worse, wet AMD can cause blurred vision in the central part of your eyesight. While you’ll still be able to see from the sides of your eye, wet AMD may make it harder to do everyday tasks like driving, cooking, and reading. There are a couple of types of treatments that can help slow or prevent vision loss from wet AMD: injected medications and laser procedures."

        "Shots to the eye are by far the most common way to treat wet AMD. They're the only type of wet AMD treatment most people get. Eye injections may sound scary, but your doctor can make it so you don’t feel the procedure at all. Your doctor will put a numbing medicine into your eye. Then they’ll clean the area with an iodine solution to guard against infection. Finally, your doctor will use a very small needle to inject medicine into your eye. These medicines belong to a class of drugs called anti-angiogenics, which work by stopping the growth of new blood vessels – in this case, those that threaten your macula. Injectable macular degeneration drugs block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein, which is involved in creating new blood vessels. These medications can reduce vision loss and sometimes even improve vision. Injectable anti-VEGF medications include: Aflibercept (Eylea ) Bevacizumab (Avastin ) Brolucizumab (Beovu) Ranibizumab (Lucentis ) Another type of injectable antiangiogenic medication, faricimab-svoa (Vabysmo ), not only blocks VEGF but also stops another protein involved in forming blood vessels called angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2). People on this medication may be able to go longer between shots."
