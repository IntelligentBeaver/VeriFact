Taking care of your feet and properly distributing your weight is incredibly important for the rest of your body to be correctly aligned. If you have issues with your feet, you will feel the effects spread to the rest of your body. Foot supination happens for different reasons. It causes most of your weight to transfer to the outer edge of your foot, which can create structural problems and pain."

        "Foot supination happens when you don’t use the proper muscles to walk correctly. People who develop this issue struggle with pushing or activating the right muscles in their feet as they walk. It could be due to a number of factors, but usually, it’s caused by a muscle imbalance in the feet. If some muscles are weaker and some are tighter, you could be putting more weight on some parts of your feet than others. Supinated feet can also cause pain in the pelvis and lower part of the spine (lumbar spine). The plantar fascia is a band of tissue that runs through the foot and attaches to the heel. People who have high arches and inflexible feet are likely to have a tight plantar fascia . These people are very likely to have or develop supinated feet."

        "Your feet need to be flexible to operate effectively and healthily. There are three stages to taking a proper step: Your foot adapts to the surface you’re walking on. Your muscles absorb any shock from the step. Your foot acts as a lever that pushes you forward to take the next step. When your feet are supinated, they become rigid and inflexible. A key, S-shaped joint in your foot, the midtarsal joint, locks to provide stability for your foot. This can also affect the lower part of your leg (calves). If you have supinated feet, you’re more likely to develop these painful foot and leg problems:‌ Plantar fasciitis. Inflammation of the plantar fascia muscle. Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS). A shin injury caused by repeated stress, also known as shin splints. Metatarsalgia . Inflammation of the ball of the foot. Achilles tendinopathy. The Achilles tendon that joins your foot to your calf muscles becomes inflamed, swollen, and stiff. Sprained ankles. Stress fractures . Supinated feet can also cause your outer leg muscles and tendons to become very tight. It can also lead to hip and lower back issues."
