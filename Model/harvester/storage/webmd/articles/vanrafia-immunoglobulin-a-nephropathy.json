        "Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) , also called Berger's disease, is an autoimmune disease that damages your kidneys. This condition happens when antibodies (specifically IgA) build up and form clumps in your kidneys. These clumps of antibodies can activate different pathways in your body, causing inflammation that damages the kidneys (nephropathy) over time.",
        "Atrasentan (Vanrafia) was approved in 2025 for the treatment of IgAN in people who are at risk of their disease getting worse quickly. It belongs to a class of medicines called endothelin receptor antagonists, which work by blocking receptors (endothelin receptors) that cause inflammation and kidney damage, thus slowing down the disease. Vanrafia is currently the only endothelin receptor antagonist approved to treat IgAN that does not have a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program in place. REMS programs are put in place by the FDA for medicines that have serious safety concerns to help make sure they are used safely."
