        "B irth control pills have become one of the most popular and effective forms of birth control in the U.S. since they were introduced in the 1960s. But an association between estrogen in birth control pills and an increased risk of breast cancer has led to an ongoing debate about the role they may play. The results of recent studies are more inconsistent but seem to suggest a slight hike in breast cancer risk for current or recent users of progestin-only pills.",
        "For most people, especially those younger than 45, experts say the benefits of birth control pills far outweigh the dangers. Talk to your doctor about which options might be best for you. There are nonhormonal choices -- including the copper IUD , contraceptive gel, and multiple barrier methods -- if you want to avoid hormones.",
