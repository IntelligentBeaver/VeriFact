        "Pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGGs) are a group of tumors that affect children, teenagers, and young adults. They are the most common tumors of the brain and spinal cord in young people. About 1 in 3 nervous system tumors in kids and teens are this type. Tumors are groups of cells that grow when the body doesn't need them. Some tumors are cancer. They can spread to other places. Others are benign, meaning they're not cancer. pLGGs rarely spread to other parts of a child's body. Because these tumors usually don’t spread past their original site, surgery can, in some cases, cure pLGGs. If it's not safe to remove the tumor with surgery, then chemotherapy, targeted medicines, and radiation can shrink them or keep them from growing. Gliomas are tumors that grow from cells called glia. These cells help to support the nerve cells that carry messages through the brain and spinal cord. Doctors divide gliomas into four grades. Grades 1 and 2 are low-grade gliomas. Low-grade means the tumors grow slowly. Grades 3 and 4 are high-grade gliomas that grow faster."

Radiation is an option for older children who have no other surgical or other treatments (such as chemotherapy or targeted therapies) available.  While newer techniques like proton beam or guided intensity photon therapy are effective, they may have long-term side effects such as secondary cancers. Targeted therapies can be used to treat pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGGs). These therapies may be used as single agents or in combination.
