        "Macular retinal dystrophy is a rare genetic eye disorder that causes vision loss. Macular retinal dystrophy affects the back of your eye, or retina . It leads to cell damage in an area called the macula, which controls how you see what’s out in front of you. When it happens, you have trouble seeing straight ahead. This makes it tough to read, drive, or do other daily activities that require you to look straight ahead.",
        "It’s caused by a pigment that builds up in the macula’s cells. Over time, this substance can damage cells that play a key role in clear central vision. Your sight gets blurry or warped. But your side, or peripheral, vision isn’t harmed. So you won’t be totally blind.",
        "Macular corneal dystrophy, is an unrelated and separate, rare genetic condition, affects the cornea , the transparent layer on the front of the eye. Cloudy areas form on the cornea, leading to severe visual impairment, usually when a person is in their 50s."
