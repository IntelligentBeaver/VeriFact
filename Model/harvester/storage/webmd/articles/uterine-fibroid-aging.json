Any of these could signal uterine fibroids. Also known as leiomyomas, or myomas, fibroids are generally benign growths in the muscle of the uterus. They’re also very common. Roughly 70% to 80% of women are diagnosed with one or more fibroids by age 50.",

But depending on the size and location of fibroids, you might not even know they’re there. Even a 10-centimeter fibroid can go unnoticed, explained Louie."
