You’re also going to gain some of the flavors of the fruit,” Roberson says. This swap works well for some but not all recipes. To use applesauce as an egg substitute, swap in 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce for each egg. For best results, add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to your dry ingredients.
