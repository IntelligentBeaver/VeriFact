        "If you have a newborn in the family, you may be tempted by a new type of baby monitor designed to check vital signs while the child sleeps. Some of these devices are worn on the infant's foot or ankle and feature a pulse oximeter that monitors heart rate and oxygen level, sending the information to the parent's smartphone. An alarm sounds if the readings are abnormal.",
        "As good as this may sound to anxious parents hoping to cut the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) warns against using these devices. The AAP has reviewed research on apnea monitors and found no evidence that they impact the prevention of SIDS in healthy babies. And a recent study found the new wearable monitors are often inaccurate, sending panicked parents and their babies to the hospital for unnecessary procedures.",
        "The study suggests that the technology in these monitors isn't reliable. One of the brands tested detected low oxygen levels sometimes, but not consistently, while another brand missed all instances of low oxygen. False alarms about pulse rate were common. \"These consumer devices aren't held to the same regulatory standard as medical care devices,\" says Liz Foglia, MD, a neonatologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, who co-authored the study."
