You could also try a bit of low-intensity exercise, as long as your blood sugar isn't over 270 mg/dL. Exercise helps your body use insulin better, which can lower your blood sugar level. However, exercise, especially weight-lifting or high-intensity interval training, can temporarily raise your blood sugar. If your blood sugar goes too high, your body may start to make chemicals called ketones. A lot of ketones in your body can make you go into a potentially life-threatening condition called ketoacidosis. You can buy ketone testing strips to test your pee for ketones before you work out. Don't work out if you've got ketones in your pee."

        "Which foods can lower blood sugar quickly?",
        "No food can lower your blood sugar quickly. Drinking plenty of water can help your kidneys flush the extra sugar out of your body. You could also try a bit of low-intensity exercise, as long as your blood sugar isn't over 270 mg/dL. Exercise helps your body use insulin better, which can lower your blood sugar level. However, exercise, especially weight-lifting or high-intensity interval training, can temporarily raise your blood sugar. If your blood sugar goes too high, your body may start to make chemicals called ketones. A lot of ketones in your body can make you go into a potentially life-threatening condition called ketoacidosis. You can buy ketone testing strips to test your pee for ketones before you work out. Don't work out if you've got ketones in your pee."
