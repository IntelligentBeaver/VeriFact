        "If your doctor tells you that you've got a carcinoid tumor, there's a lot to take in. The condition is a type of cancer, but unlike some other kinds, there's more than one part of the body where it might start. And depending on where you get it, you could have a bunch of different symptoms, from pain in your belly to a bad cough .",

        "It's not as common, but sometimes the tumors start in your pancreas, your testicles if you're a man, or ovaries if you're a woman.",
        "Keep in mind that these tumors often grow slowly. And doctors often find them when they're at an early stage, which makes them easier to treat.",
        "Learn as much as you can about this condition so you can work with your doctor to get a treatment that's best for you. And keep an open line to your friends and family so you can get the backup and support you need to tackle things with confidence and a positive attitude."
