        "Back in 2014, Belle Gibson was riding high. The story of how this young Australian wellness blogger had overcome inoperable brain cancer through healthy eating and alternative medicine drew worldwide attention, and her Apple app, The Whole Pantry, racked up 300,000 downloads. A Whole Pantry cookbook, to be published by Penguin, was on the way. Then came the bombshell dropped on her 200,000-plus Instagram followers: Gibson’s brain cancer had returned – and spread to her blood, spleen , uterus, and liver.",
        "The next year, an even bigger bombshell: Gibson had made the whole thing up. She’d never had cancer. “None of it’s true,” she admitted to The Australian Women’s Weekly . Also false was her promise to give a chunk of the proceeds from her app to charity. In 2017, a federal court fined the social media star once called “the queen bee of wellness” $410,000, and last year, in an effort to collect the overdue fine, sheriff’s department officers raided her Melbourne home, just weeks before the BBC released its 2021 documentary Bad influencer: The Great Insta Con .",
        "If all this sounds like a cautionary tale, it hasn’t had much effect. Since Gibson’s story unraveled – and especially since the rise of TikTok – the faking of illness on social media has only increased. Follow # malingering on TikTok, and you’ll find countless teenagers calling out their peers for pretending to be sick. Another TikTok hashtag, #illness, has generated roughly 400 million views. Granted, many of the people in those videos aren’t faking, but experts say a growing number of them show signs of factitious disorder , defined by the Mayo Clinic as “a serious mental disorder in which someone deceives others by appearing sick, by purposely getting sick or by self-injury.” Munchausen syndrome is a severe and chronic form of factitious disorder, though the two terms are often used interchangeably."

Feldman, MD, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and the author of Dying to Be Ill . Also known as digital factitious disorder, Munchausen by internet refers to medical deception that happens completely online, and it has come a long way since Feldman coined the term in 2000. The widespread posting of “videos and still photos that purport to show medical signs and/or medical paraphernalia” – what some call “medical porn” – marked a turning point, according to the doctor. “In 2000, posts to social media were largely through words, with videos being particularly unusual,” he explains. “This change opens the door to very dramatic presentations that are even more engaging than those posted with words only.”"

Most of the people with signs of MBI are in their teens, while factitious disorder patients outside the internet are often in their 30s and 40s. A significant number of those on social media also show symptoms of a personality disorder such as narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder , according to Feldman. “I think that depression and personality disorders … are salient as underlying factors in almost all medical deception cases,” he says."
