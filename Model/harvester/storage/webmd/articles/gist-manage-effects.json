        "How your doctors treat GISTs depends on several things – the tumor’s size, its location, its genetic profile, and how quickly it is growing. Standard treatment for GISTs includes: Monitoring without treatment, also called “watchful waiting” Surgery Targeted drug therapies Palliative (supportive) care Monitoring Some small GISTs do not grow or cause you any trouble. For these types of tumors, your doctor may advise watching the tumor closely but not treating it unless something changes. Some doctors disagree and think these small tumors should be removed. Surgery If your GIST is confined to one area and can be safely operated on, your doctor will usually remove it with surgery. Doctors are careful to take out GISTs completely. They don’t respond well to standard cancer surgery follow-up treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. If your tumor is small (fewer than 5 centimeters), then the surgery may be laparoscopic, which means a series of tiny cuts to your belly that allow doctors to insert surgical tools and remove the cancer."

        "If after surgery your cancer returns or has already spread at diagnosis – as in about 10%-25% of cases – then your treatment will likely consist of a class of drugs that target cancer-causing gene mutations. These drugs, called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), work by blocking the cell changes that allow tumors to grow. TKIs come in the form of pills, which you’d normally take once a day. They are often given as long as they work and don’t cause serious side effects. TKIs used to treat GISTs can vary in how well they work against certain cancer-causing mutations. They can also stop working if you get more types of mutations. Palliative care Palliative, or supportive, care can be given at any time during your treatment if you have side effects or if your condition gets worse. Palliative care treats medical symptoms but can also help you manage the emotional and social sides of your cancer. This is also one of the rare times when radiation therapy is used with GIST, to ease symptoms such as bone pain."

        "Imatinib (Gleevec ) Most people with advanced GIST take imatinib at some point in their treatment. Imatinib is usually the first targeted therapy drug doctors use to treat GIST. Imatinib works by blocking the KIT and PDGFRA proteins from helping cancer cells grow and divide. How it’s used: If you had surgery, imatinib might be used to target cancer cells left around the edges of your removed tumor. Unless there’s a very low risk of your cancer returning, doctors usually recommend taking the drug for a year. Imatinib also may work to shrink GISTs to a size where they can be removed by surgery. If your advanced GISTs have spread too far from their original site, imatinib probably won’t cure your cancer. But it may shrink tumors or stop them from growing for several years. Possible side effects of imatinib include mild stomach discomfort, diarrhea , muscle pain, rashes, and fluid retention. You can help ease stomach discomfort by taking the drug with food. Fluid retention mostly appears in the face or ankles and rarely appears in a more serious place such as the lungs or belly. Imatinib can also cause heart problems in some people."

Because of this possible side effect, your doctors will watch you very closely when you first start imatinib treatment. Doctors turn to sunitinib if imatinib stops working or you are no longer able to tolerate it. Like imatinib, it targets KIT/PDGFRA mutations but also targets some additional ones as well. Sunitinib works by shrinking the tumor or stopping its growth. You may feel really tired when you take this drug and have nausea , diarrhea, a sore mouth, or changes in skin and hair color. High blood pressure, bleeding risk, swelling, and heart and liver problems are its more serious side effects. Regorafenib (Stivarga ) If both imatinib and sunitinib stop working, your doctor may try regorafenib. It also targets multiple proteins on the cancer cell.
