Your new boyfriend does not call you as promised before a business trip, and you spend the week convinced he's breaking up with you. Reality check: You know he's busy. Besides, it will take you both a few more months to get to know each other and decide if you're a good match.",

You feel you ought to help a co-worker with his project -- even though it will make you fall behind in your work. Reality check: Your co-worker has an assistant who might be glad to pick up some overtime. You can suggest that he ask his assistant for help."
