        "April 3, 2023 – The contaminated deadly and blindness-causing eyedrops that were recalled earlier this year were made in India at a factory not inspected by the FDA, according to a new report.",

        "In January, EzriCare and Delsam Pharma artificial tears and ointment products were recalled after being linked to the bacterium P. aeruginosa . The bacteria have caused at least 68 infections, including three deaths and at least eight cases of blindness.The eyedrops were imported to the U.S. from India, and many of the cases occurred after the bacteria spread person-to-person at a long-term care facility in Connecticut, according to the Times , which cited FDA and CDC lead investigator Maroya Walters, PhD. Walters said the cases that caused death or blindness were traced to the EzriCare artificial tears product."
