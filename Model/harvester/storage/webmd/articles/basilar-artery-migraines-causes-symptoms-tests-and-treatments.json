You might take pain relievers such as acetaminophen ( Anacin , Panadol, Tylenol ), ibuprofen ( Advil , Motrin ), and naproxen ( Aleve , Anaprox , Naprosyn ). For more severe symptoms or nausea, your doctor may prescribe medicines such as celecoxib (Celebrex, Elyxyb), ketorolac, metoclopramide ( Reglan) , and prochlorperazine ( Compro ). Newer treatments include the CGRP antagonists atogepant (Qulipta) and rimegepant (Nurtec ) and the serotonin 1F receptor agonist lasmiditan (Reyvow). Acute migraine medicines like triptans and ergotamines will not be given because of the possible risk of stroke."
