        "Since I married my husband, this will be the first time that I'll be able to have dinner with him at night. It's a great schedule. The ladies are fantastic. The crew, everybody involved. There could not be any nicer people on the planet. It's a dream job!",
        "2. What are you most looking forward to talking about?",
        "That's the thing that's wonderful about the show -- they talk about everything, which is fun. And they include the audience. We're very different people, but we respect each other's opinions.",
        "3. Why did you decide to record an opera/Broadway album with the City of Prague Orchestra?",
        "I continually like to challenge myself. … Throughout my life, I've done country, I've done pop, I've done various genres, but this is the first time I've done an opera with soprano vocals. I'm singing in Italian, French, and German. It's just another fun opportunity before my voice will not be able to do it. … My son who passed away, Michael -- it was his favorite way that I sing. This album will be dedicated to him."
