        "Beta-blockers (also called beta-adrenergic blockers) are drugs that are used to lower blood pressure (among other things). They do this by blocking the effects of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline in your cardiovascular system (your heart and blood vessels).",

        "Adrenaline triggers your body's fight-or-flight response. Noradrenaline works with adrenaline to increase your heart rate and the amount of blood that your heart is pumping to help you get ready to fight or flee if you're attacked. When you block the effects of these hormones with beta-blockers, your heart rate slows, the force your heart uses to pump blood through your body eases, and your blood vessels relax. So, your heart doesn't work as hard and your blood pressure goes down."
