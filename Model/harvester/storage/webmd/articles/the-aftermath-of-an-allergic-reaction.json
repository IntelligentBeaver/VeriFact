        "After you have an allergic reaction, it can sometimes feel like you no longer have the confidence to eat out and the anxiety is getting the better of you. Honestly, this happens to the best of us. An allergic reaction can so quickly and easily shatter the confidence you have built up, and it’s not so easy to start putting the pieces back together.",
        "If this happens to you, I would definitely look into seeking a therapist with experience with food allergies to give you professional advice and the tools to manage it. Reactions can be traumatizing, and the effect they have on your mental health can be devastating.",
        "Mental Health Concerns Are Common",
        "A study involving 1,680 allergy patients and caregivers who took part in the Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) Patient Registry showed that about two-thirds (62%) of patients reported mental health concerns related to food allergies. These concerns included anxiety after an allergic reaction, anxiety about living with food allergies, and concerns about food avoidance. I have experienced this firsthand, so hopefully I can give some insight to help you get back on your feet and gain your confidence again!"

        "One of the worst reactions I had was when I was 15 years old. The reaction occurred shortly after I ate chips from a takeaway restaurant, not knowing they were cooked in peanut oil. The immediate step after having a severe allergic reaction would be to take an antihistamine to see if the hives calm down. In my case, hives actually didn’t appear straight away. That was surprising, as they are usually my first red flag that I’m reacting to something.",
        "This is something I’ve learned about my body as I’ve gotten older and gained an understanding of what happens to me during a reaction. If hives occur, I look out for tingling on my lips. From there, well, it’s kind of a beeline to throat swelling and anaphylaxis.",
        "Looking back at this reaction, I think my mum could have administered the epinephrine pen earlier. However, at the time in the '90s, there was a lack of understanding about allergies as compared to now. In my case, by the time I got to the hospital, they put me straight on an IV drip  so the medication could enter my bloodstream faster. My advice would be don’t hesitate to use the pen if your reaction gets worse. It's always best to use it earlier than too late. There is no harm to using it, and don’t ever feel scared to use it in a potential life-and-death situation."

        "I ended up having therapy before my 6-month trip around South America to gain a better understanding of my allergy anxiety and how I could manage it effectively on the trip. I knew I would have fewer resources there and be in more rural environments. Coincidentally, my therapist had children who had food allergies, so she had a good understanding about how I was feeling! This wasn’t something I was aware of until we spoke in our sessions. I actually struggled to find a therapist who specializes in food allergies. Frustratingly, there aren’t that many of them. But don’t let this get you down, as other therapists can still give you tools to better manage your mental health."
