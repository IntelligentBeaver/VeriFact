Approximately 15 to 30 percent of males and 10 to 15 percent of females in the U.S. between 30 and 70 have OSA, and many haven’t been diagnosed with it.",
        "If you’re African-American, Asian, or Hispanic,  you are also more likely to have OSA.",

That makes your hormone systems go into overdrive, which boosts your blood pressure levels. Also, the level of oxygen in your blood drops when you can’t breathe well, which may add to the problem."
