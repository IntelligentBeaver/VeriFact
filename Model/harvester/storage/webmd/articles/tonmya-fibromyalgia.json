        "People in all three studies were randomly selected to take either Tonmya (735 people) or a placebo (739 people). The placebo looked like Tonmya but didn’t contain any medicine. Neither the people in the studies nor the doctors knew who took Tonmya or the placebo until the study was over.",
        "The main question these studies wanted to answer was how well Tonmya could reduce fibromyalgia pain. To find out, researchers measured the changes in patients’ pain using an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). Each day, patients recorded their pain over the past 24 hours in a diary, rating it from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The researchers then calculated a weekly average of these daily scores and tracked how the average changed over 14 weeks from the start of the study. To be in the studies, people had to have an average daily pain score of at least 4 on the NRS."

Mouth symptoms started a few minutes after using Tonmya, and most went away within an hour. A few patients had more serious mouth symptoms, but most of them went away a few days after stopping Tonmya. Stay away from hot, cold, or acidic drinks until morning because these can irritate your mouth. If your mouth is numb, you may hurt yourself because you will not feel the pain or irritation.",

Be careful when driving or operating machines that require alertness or concentration until you know how Tonmya affects you. If you need to get out of bed in the middle of the night, do so slowly.",
