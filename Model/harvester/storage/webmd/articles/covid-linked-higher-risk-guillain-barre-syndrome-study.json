        "Oct. 19, 2023 – A large new study links COVID-19 with an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Vaccination against COVID appeared to reduce the risk of GBS, which is a rare illness that can leave people paralyzed.",
        "The findings were published Wednesday by the American Academy of Neurology in its journal Neurology .",
        "Researchers analyzed health data from January 2021 to July 2022 for more than 3 million people in Israel ages 16 years and older not diagnosed with GBS before. They found that people with a recent COVID infection were six times more likely to have GBS, compared to people without a recent infection. But the disease remains very rare. Of the 3 million people in the study, 76 got GBS.",
        "The increased risk of GBS was measured within the 6 weeks after a person had COVID. People who had recently received an mRNA-based COVID vaccine were 50% less likely to get GBS, compared to people who had not been recently vaccinated."
