        "There are two types of stroke .",
        "Ischemic stroke is similar to a heart attack , except it occurs in the blood vessels of the brain. Clots can form in the brain's blood vessels, in blood vessels leading to the brain, or even in blood vessels elsewhere in the body and then travel to the brain. These clots block blood flow to the brain's cells.",
        "Ischemic stroke can also happen when too much plaque (fatty deposits and cholesterol ) clogs the brain's blood vessels. Atrial fibrillation (Afib) is an irregular heart rhythm that causes clots to form in the heart. Those clots can get loose and travel to the brain. Less commonly, ischemic strokes happen because of a clotting disorder that people are either born with or develop. Almost 90% of all strokes are ischemic.",
        "Hemorrhagic (heh-more-raj-ik) strokes occur when a blood vessel in the brain breaks or ruptures. The result is blood seeping into the brain tissue and damage to brain cells. The most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke are high blood pressure and brain aneurysms. An aneurysm is a weakness or thinness in the blood vessel wall. A brain tumor or cancer that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the brain is another cause of hemorrhagic strokes."
