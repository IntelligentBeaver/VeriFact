Perhaps they can assign someone to cover for a few minutes.",

First try simple methods for minimizing their effects, says Curtis W. Reisinger, PhD, corporate director of the employee assistance program with the New York-based Physicians Resource Network. Put an anti-glare screen protector on your computer screen.
