        "I’m 30 days into working with a functional nutritionist, and that alone is a miracle. I’ve tried working with nutritionists and dietitians in the past. First, what the heck is the difference? I always thought one made you eat nothing all day and the other was OK with you eating, just as long as it was lettuce.",

That meant being a connoisseur of BBQ ribs and a person who could recognize a good hoagie (sandwich) when I tasted one. I grew up watching my mom and aunts cook healthy food, but also traditional Southern delicacies. I learned to cook -- even snagging my now-husband because I made homemade vs. boxed mashed potatoes!",
        "As I got older and started working full-time, I embraced the “single in the city” lifestyle. Part of my work attire included a cup of coffee in one hand and a bagel in the other. If I were ever to be a writer in Manhattan, I was going to have to look the part."

So I kept noshing away. But as my migraines increased and my research expanded, I began to face the reality that food and our health are connected. There’s no denying it. If I wanted to see a decrease in migraines and other health improvements, then I’d have to watch what I ate. Uggghhhh! Life is supposed to be enjoyed, right?",

First, I did my research and found someone (through a friend) who looks at the connection between food and gut health, hormonal balance, and overall wellness. Yes, please! I was nervous, but I took the leap. In my first session, I talked about all of the things I didn’t want to give up. “I don’t want to stop drinking coffee!”"

        "Ryah (my nutritionist) smiled and asked me about my health goals. By the end of our conversation, I realized that what I wanted to change -- including a reduction in migraines -- was much more important than my morning and sometimes afternoon cup of coffee. That said, she didn’t say I’d need to stop completely -- at least not right away. Rather, she walked me through how choices can impact my day.",

        "Wait, what? I said the same thing. If you asked me, I was already gorging myself. In addition to reducing migraine, I want to lose weight. The last thing I wanted to hear about was putting more food in my face. But after ripping my food diary from my clenched hands (figuratively), Ryah noted that I had been skipping breakfast (opting for just a cup of coffee) and going long stretches without a meal at all. She reminded me how this can send your blood sugar topsy-turvy and lead to headaches. Since then, I’ve been working hard to eat three healthy meals, no longer than 3 to 4 hours apart, and I’ve seen a huge difference. Life can get busy, so if I end up going over the 4 hours, I eat a healthy snack. Because I’m nourishing myself throughout the day, I haven’t had the need to run to a cup of coffee for the afternoon slump."

        "People have always called me sweet and because you are what you eat, I thought I should maintain my brand! Craving sugar is not just a thing. Many experts consider it an addiction as strong as one to drugs. I know when I’m ripping and running -- between work, errands, and other commitments -- sometimes there’s nothing and no one stopping me from grabbing and inhaling a candy bar. I am learning that those sugar cravings for me are often signs that I’m stressed out and overwhelmed. Again, eating consistently throughout the day has helped me crave sugar less. My sudden desire to bake (and eat) a cake might be a signal to chill out a bit. And since it’s well-reported that stress can trigger migraines, it’s in my best interest to just say “no.” So I figure, if I handle the root (stress), maybe I won’t need a root canal. So far, migraine episodes have come around less frequently as well."

        "When Ryah suggested I try to eat veggies with each meal, I silently rolled my eyes. I mean, sure – veggies for dinner and lunch, but breakfast too? Unless I’m doing a spinach smoothie, I thought, no way. But sometimes your eyes can be opened with the right guidance. It may seem weird to some, but I’ve recently started doing things like adding a side salad with my omelet or some sliced red peppers with egg bites.  She suggested some pureed veggies in my pancake mix. I haven’t tried this one, but I’m planning to. As I’ve increased my veggies, I’ve started to have more energy, feel less sluggish, and have had fewer sugar and carb cravings. I needed to add a digestive enzyme to help my tummy get used to all the raw, fresh food, but it has been worth it.",
        "So what’s next? We’ll be looking at any food allergies or sensitivities and migraine triggers as well as where supplements (like magnesium) might play a role in helping me. I’m on a journey and I’m enjoying the ride. Food choices can lead you further down the path toward your why. For me, it’s decreased migraines and improved quality of life. Happy eating to all!"
