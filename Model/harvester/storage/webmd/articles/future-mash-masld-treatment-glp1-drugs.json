        "Over the past few years, glucagon -like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs like semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy) have become a “go-to” medication. They’ve been part of breakthroughs in the treatment of conditions that range from overweight and obesity to type 2 diabetes to heart and kidney disease . These medications are now widely used to manage obesity and diabetes, and their potential for treating fatty liver disease is still being discovered.",
        "GLP-1 drugs such as semaglutide (branded as Ozempic, Rybelsus, or Wegovy) were originally approved for type 2 diabetes but quickly gained popularity for weight loss. More recently, tirzepatide — a dual agonist sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound — has shown even greater weight loss benefits. These medications are now widely used to manage obesity and diabetes. But their potential for treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) or its more advanced form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), is still being discovered.",
        "These medications don’t just help you lose weight. They may also support your liver health in several important ways, including cutting down on liver fat, improving insulin sensitivity, lowering inflammation and scarring (fibrosis), and potentially reversing MASH or preventing it from advancing."
