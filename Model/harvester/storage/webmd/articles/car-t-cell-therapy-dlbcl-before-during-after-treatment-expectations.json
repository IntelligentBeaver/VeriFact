CAR T is for people whose cancer hasn't responded to one or two other treatments or has stopped responding to treatment. CAR T isn't like other cancer medicines you might take. It's a “living” drug that changes your immune cells to help them find and attack your cancer. This treatment takes time. The process involves many steps: Collecting your T cells, changing them in a lab, infusing them back into your body, and waiting for them to work against your cancer."

CAR T therapies that are FDA-approved for DLBCL are: Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) Lisocabtagene maraleucel (Breyanzi) Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) Each company's process to make CAR T cells is a little different. In general, the first step is to separate the T cells from your other white blood cells. Then the lab uses a virus to deliver the genetic material (DNA) to turn your T cells into cancer-fighting cells. \"Viruses are a really good way of putting things into cells because they infect the cells,\" Jain says. The new genes instruct the T cell to make proteins called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their surface. Then the lab multiplies the CAR T cells until there are millions of them. Finally, the lab tests the CAR T cells to make sure there are no germs in them and they meet FDA requirements. \"For example, a certain percentage of the cells have to still be alive after manufacturing and a certain percentage of them have to express the CAR T cell,\" Jain says. The lab freezes the CAR T cells and sends them back to your hospital, ready to be infused into you. How long this whole process takes varies from one center to another. It should take the lab 2 to 4 weeks to process your CAR T cells and return them to your cancer hospital or treatment center."

Your doctor calls this treatment lymphodepletion chemotherapy. \"Giving lymphodepletion chemotherapy allows the CAR T cells to expand and work better,\" Iqbal says. Basically, the chemo makes room for your new CAR T cells to grow. Then the countdown starts. You'll get chemo on days -5, -4, and -3. Day -2 is a rest day when you don't get any treatment. Day -1 you'll go into the hospital if you're staying there overnight. On day zero, you get the CAR T cell infusion through an IV or central line placed into a vein. The infusion takes about 30 minutes.",

How many times they multiply is unique to you and depends on the size of your cancer. \"Patients who have very large lymphomas going into CAR T-cell therapy, their CAR T cells tend to expand more. They need more expansion to be able to overcome the amount of tumor that's there,\" Jain says. CAR T cells act like guided missiles. They seek out CD19, an antigen on the surface of lymphoma cells. Antigens are proteins that trigger an immune response in your body. When the CAR T cells attach to CD19, they release chemicals that kill the lymphoma cells. The CAR T cells can keep working in your body for months or years. How long they stay in your body doesn't affect your outcome. Some people stay in remission long after their CAR T cells are gone. Other people relapse while they still have working T cells, Iqbal says. How your cancer responds to the CAR T cells is unique to you."
