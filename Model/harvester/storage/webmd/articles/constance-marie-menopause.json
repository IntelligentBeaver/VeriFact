        "Last year in the middle of a crowded party, Constance Marie, a seasoned television actress known for her longtime role on George Lopez and, most recently, Hulu’s How I Met Your Father, stood chatting with friends when a woman approached her, flushed and slightly bashful. But the partygoer wasn’t there to ask the actress for an autograph. She wanted advice.",
        "“She said, ‘I'm so sorry, you don't know me, but I’m having hot flashes , and your friend said that if anyone here would know what to tell me, it would be you.’ I said, ‘Girl, I’m an open book. Let's talk about this.’” Marie led her outside (where the air was much cooler) and shared her experience, along with some of the resources and doctors who had helped her through her menopause journey.",
        "“A few months later, I got a text from her. She said, ‘You may not remember me, but I just want to thank you so much.’ And I think that’s really what I’m here for. A lot of light gets shined on you when you’re an actor and celebrity. I can take that light and shine it onto things that we don’t typically deal with and keep in the dark.”"
