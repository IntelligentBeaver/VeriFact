You usually keep the new position. For example, if the doctor raises one of your arms or legs, you’ll stay that way for a while. That’s called catalepsy.",

Catatonic symptoms are most often linked to schizophrenia . But that’s only one of many causes. You can get them if you have another medical condition or serious mental illness, like bipolar disorder.",
