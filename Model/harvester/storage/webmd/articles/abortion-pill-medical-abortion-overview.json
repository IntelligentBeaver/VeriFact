        "A medical abortion (also called a medication abortion) uses doctor-prescribed drugs to end an early pregnancy. You might have heard people liken this to “taking an abortion pill” in conversation, but that term is a bit misleading.",
        "A medical abortion usually involves taking two medications, the first pill by mouth , the second pill by mouth or through the vagina. It’s an option for those who are less than 11 weeks into their pregnancy – meaning up to 11 weeks (or 77 days) since the first day of your last period. Some doctors who do abortions only offer the procedure up to the ninth week of pregnancy.",
        "Unlike a surgical abortion, a medical abortion doesn’t involve getting surgery or anesthesia (pain-numbing medicine). Instead, you take the abortive medications in a health care setting (like a doctor’s office) or at home. You’ll need to follow your health care provider's instructions to make sure the drugs are effective."
