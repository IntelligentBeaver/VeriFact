Repatha is also approved in adults and children over 10 who have high LDL, or genetic high cholesterol conditions called heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia .

        "People can have high cholesterol for a number of reasons, including their diet, exercise habits, or genetic conditions. Keeping your cholesterol low, specifically the LDL, is one of the most important ways to prevent and treat heart disease and strokes. Repatha works by attaching to a protein in the body called PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9). PCSK9 normally acts on the liver’s LDL receptors by lowering the liver’s ability to remove LDL from the blood. Repatha is a PCSK9 inhibitor, which means that it blocks the action of the PCSK9 protein, therefore allowing the liver to remove LDL from the bloodstream."

In one study, the effects of Repatha on major events like death from heart disease, heart attack, or stroke were studied among people with heart disease.

Injecting in a different spot each time and taking Repatha out of the refrigerator 30 to 45 minutes (depending on which injection device you have) before giving your dose helps prevent these skin reactions.
