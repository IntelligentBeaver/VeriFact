        "When I was younger, I remember people saying that when I choked (temporarily) on food that it “went down the wrong pipe.” To me, this meant the food I chewed entered a fork in the road where my morsels went down my esophagus and air went down another tube to my lungs. As a little girl, I thought food did food things and air did air things and never the two should meet.",
        "When I was diagnosed with asthma in my 30s, the last thing I was thinking about was food. Then, I caught a terrible case of the flu and bronchitis, and someone (likely my dad) told me to go easy on the dairy as it could increase the mucus in my lungs. After 4 weeks of illness, I would have tried anything. I figured I could give up milk in my cereal (swapping for almond milk) and skip the ice cream and even the cheese for a while. I noticed the difference almost immediately. My cough wasn’t as productive, and I could breathe so much better. That was more than 15 years ago, and I still keep my distance from dairy. Sure, I’ll have the occasional small, kid-sized cup of ice cream and my tacos aren’t complete without a little sprinkle of cheese, but in general I steer clear of all things dairy. I feel my lungs have been grateful."

        "Fast forward to just a few years ago and I became super interested in how inflammation in your body can cause a number of health issues. I made the connection between increased inflammation and asthma, which in laymen’s terms is essentially inflamed lungs. Most asthma medications work by reducing inflammation in the lungs, easing the airways to help you breathe. I wasn’t ready to accept that food could cure my asthma, but I was hopeful it could help. I went on a journey to find inflammation-fighting foods and was pleasantly surprised to see a list of some of my favorite things.",

But for now, I put it on salads, cook with it on low temperatures, and add it to other hot foods when I need a little healthy fat in my life. I brought my dad an olive tree for his birthday recently. Here’s hoping for unlimited olives one day.",
