        "Hemophilia is a rare genetic condition that keeps your blood from clotting, leading to bleeding problems. Bleeding can happen at any time (spontaneous) or as a result of trauma (injury, cut, or fall). People with hemophilia A do not have enough of a protein called factor VIII, and people with hemophilia B do not have enough of a protein called factor IX. These factors are needed to make clots and stop bleeding. Regular treatment to prevent bleeding, called “prophylaxis,” may be needed, and if bleeding happens, you may need “on-demand” therapy. Factor replacement therapy given into a vein (intravenous) with factor VIII or factor XI is used to control hemophilia. In some people, the body develops inhibitors (antibodies against factor replacement products), which reduces the effectiveness of factor products.",
        "Alhemo (concizumab-mtci) is approved to prevent or reduce bleeding problems in people with hemophilia A with or without factor VIII inhibitors or hemophilia B with or without factor IX inhibitors. It is given once a day as a shot under the skin."

Your health care provider or pharmacist may recommend an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, or an OTC antihistamine for itching.
