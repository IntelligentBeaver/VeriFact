            "Try a gel or a spray. Many men dislike the feel of lotions or creams and prefer gels or sprays for their ease of application, Tung says.",
            "Don't forget your bald spot. Use a hat, or put on plenty of sunscreen.",
            "Cover up. Think hats, long pants, or long-sleeved shirts. Tightly-knit fabrics afford more protection, and special sun-protective clothing is also available.",
            "Consider buying a \"tan in a can.\" Miss that bronze glow? The American Academy of Dermatology calls self-tanning lotions and sprays \"a safe alternative to tanning.\" The active ingredient, known as DHA, produces a tan color that does not wash off. A sunless tan doesn't protect you from the sun, so you will still need a broad spectrum sunscreen of at least SPF 15.",
            "Avoid tanning beds. They're no safer than sunlight; most salons use bulbs in their tanning beds that emit a significant amount UVA and UVB radiation, says the American Academy of Dermatology."

And for many men they provide a welcome \" microdermabrasion \" that removes dead layers of skin, notes Suzan Obagi, director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Cosmetic Surgery and Skin Care Center. But for African-American men and other men with very curly hair, the blades are more likely to cause painful razor bumps resulting from ingrown hairs . These men may prefer a single-blade or electric razor. They may also seek out more soothing shaving creams or gels.",
