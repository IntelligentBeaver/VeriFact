        "When her skin symptoms started in high school, Abby Cramond, 24, of New Orleans, chalked it up to dry, sensitive skin, something she’d lived with for years. “I played a bunch of sports, and whenever I would sweat, what I now know are eczema patches would appear,” she says. One day, when she went to work in what she now knows was a flare. Cramond knew something had to change when her boss sent her home from work as a waitress. “He told me I couldn’t serve his tables looking how I did,” she says. “My boss told me to go to the ER immediately.” So she did. At the ER, the doctors said it looked like atopic dermatitis , or eczema, but instructed her to see a dermatologist to know for sure. “The dermatologist confirmed it was eczema in 2019, but it still didn’t hit me,” she says. “It can be really hard when you’re first diagnosed, but don’t give up.”"

If your skin is not responding to home treatments, it may be time to see a doctor and get a diagnosis and a new treatment plan. Dry skin can also come and go. Atopic dermatitis is known as a chronic condition. This means it may be better or worse at times, but you have it for your lifetime."

Or some patients live in areas without a dermatologist nearby. Check out organizations like the National Eczema Association for a list of dermatologists in your area. Psychological barriers also play a crucial role, with patients feeling embarrassed about their skin's appearance or believing skin conditions are merely cosmetic. “When COVID hit, I was grateful to wear the mask.

        "Experts are still learning about atopic dermatitis, and that goes for the treatments as well. But, this doesn’t mean there aren’t options. Until recently, doctors relied on over-the-counter medications and creams. Now, there are FDA-approved medications. Light therapy. Special lightbulbs or a laser can treat all ages of people with atopic dermatitis; you can receive treatment in a doctor’s office or do them yourself at home. You may need two to three treatments per week for it to work. How does it work? An appropriate amount of UV rays from natural sunlight or phototherapy has been shown to decrease inflammation. But too much of a good thing can be harmful.  Be careful if you spend too much time in the sun or use tanning beds while getting light therapy as it can cause a flare. Oral medications. Doctors don’t know everything about atopic dermatitis, but they do know it involves your immune system . For AD and other conditions like it, your immune system is overactive and attacks healthy tissues. Your dermatologist might prescribe an immunosuppressant medication to calm your immune system. Or they may prescribe something called a JAK inhibitor. These medications work by blocking signals in your body that cause inflammation — both a cause and symptom of AD. Topicals. Medications applied to your skin are called “topicals.” There are different types of topicals, but the most common are corticosteroids or steroids. These medications reduce inflammation or itching and may be prescribed with other medications. Biologics. The newest type of medication for AD is called a biologic. It works throughout the body to treat the symptoms. It is given by injection under the skin. Your doctor will show you how to use these at home. Cramond says her eczema is well managed on her biological medication. But she says her healing has also been through community. “Find a space where others have been through similar experiences with eczema like the National Eczema Association. I’ve found some lifelong friends through the community.”"
