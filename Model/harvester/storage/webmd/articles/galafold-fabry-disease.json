        "Fabry disease is a rare inherited condition that is passed down from parents to their children. In people with Fabry disease, a specific enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-gal) does not work the way that it should. This is because there is a mutation in the gene that codes for alpha-gal.",
        "Alpha-gal is an important enzyme found in many cells in the body. It breaks down a fatty substance called GL-3. When the enzyme does not work the way that it should, GL-3 builds up in the body’s cells. Over time, this can cause serious health issues in many parts of the body, including the kidneys, heart, skin, brain, and nervous system.",

Some of these symptoms include burning and tingling pain in the hands and feet, issues with the stomach and gut, and red-purple spots on the skin between the bellybutton and the knees. Some people may also not sweat as much as they should, which can cause dry skin and make them very sensitive to heat. Many people with this condition also get gray, brown, or yellow streaks over the eye.",
        "Late-onset: This is the most common form of Fabry disease. It is a milder form than classic disease. Even though Fabry disease is present at birth, people with this form of the condition usually do not have symptoms as children. Instead, they may not have symptoms until they are in their 30s or even later."
