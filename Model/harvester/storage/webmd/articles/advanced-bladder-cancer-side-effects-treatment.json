You might feel tired after a good night's rest, or feel rundown when you wake from a nap. If you're like many people, midafternoon may be when your energy drops to its lowest point. The kind of treatment you have can affect how long your fatigue lasts. Chemotherapy causes fatigue that lasts a few days. Radiation therapy causes fatigue that gets worse over time. It can last two to three months after you stop treatment. Immunotherapy (drugs that use your immune system to attack cancer cells) can lead to fatigue that may last up to a year."
