As he delivered the verdict I had expected, I felt a curious mixture of fear, uncertainty and -- strangely -- gratitude and guilt.",

One suffered from a glioblastoma, a brain tumor that always kills. Another had stage IV esophageal cancer that had spread to his liver. In the end, neither survived.",
