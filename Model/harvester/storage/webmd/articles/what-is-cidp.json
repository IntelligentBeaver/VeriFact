        "CIDP is closely related to Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), but they're not the same. Both are nerve problems, and both cause symptoms such as weakness and numbness. But GBS usually comes on days or weeks after you have an illness, such as a stomach bug. CIDP isn’t linked to illness. With GBS, once treated, you usually recover fairly quickly. CIDP, on the other hand, tends to be a longer-term problem. In rare cases, if you don’t recover from GBS, you may develop CIDP."
