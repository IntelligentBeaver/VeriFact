        "It started with her child complaining each morning of what Edenburgh described as “vague ailments,” like stomachaches and headaches. But she soon noticed that these symptoms only seemed to appear on school days. Edenburgh’s daughter was 11 at the time and was transitioning from elementary to middle school.",
        "“I also saw a sudden drop in enthusiasm for things my child used to love, like interacting with friends or going on school trips, said Edenburgh, who lives in San Diego. She quickly realized her child was actively trying to avoid going to school.",
        "Scolionophobia , or fear of school, affects about 1 in 20 children at different points of childhood, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The condition, which is also referred to as school avoidance or school refusal, often happens at times of stressful change, such as when a child enters first grade, middle school, or high school."

        "“If a child struggles to stay in school, either by not showing up or by not staying through the day, this could be related to anxiety, depression , OCD , or bullying, or others,” said Jacqueline Sperling, PhD , director of the Anxiety Mastery Program at McLean Hospital in Cambridge, MA, and an assistant professor of psychology in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.",
        "In younger children, dependency on a parent may make going to school frightening. “Anxiety-based school absenteeism in younger kids may be related to separation anxiety from caregivers,” says Christopher Kearney, PhD , chair of psychology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and a clinical child psychologist who studies school absenteeism.",
        "A recent study from Spanish and Italian researchers found that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased adolescents’ school anxiety due to stress, academic struggles, and lack of social interaction. Like the pandemic, other circumstances beyond a child’s control may spur scolionophobia.",
        "“Oftentimes, school avoidance starts with a triggering event that serves as a last straw,” said Felicia Wolf, PsyD , a staff psychologist at the Menninger Clinic in Houston and an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Baylor College of Medicine. Causes can include the stress of returning to school after a prolonged illness, living in an unsafe neighborhood, or having a learning disability. School avoidance can also start after the death of a loved one, or if a child has to change schools, or even has a change of teacher, she said."
