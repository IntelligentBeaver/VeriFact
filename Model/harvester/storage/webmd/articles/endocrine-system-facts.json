        "Pituitary gland. This is your endocrine system’s master gland. It uses information it gets from your brain to tell other glands in your body what to do. It makes many important hormones, including growth hormone; prolactin, which helps breastfeeding moms make milk; antidiuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin), which controls blood pressure and helps control body water balance through its effect on the kidneys; adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal gland to make certain hormones; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which stimulates the production and secretion of thyroid hormones; oxytocin , which helps in milk ejection during breastfeeding; and luteinizing hormone, which manages estrogen in women and testosterone in men.",
        "Pineal gland. It makes a chemical called melatonin that helps your body get ready to go to sleep.",
        "Thyroid gland. This gland makes thyroid hormone, which controls your growth and metabolism. If this gland doesn't make enough (a condition called hypothyroidism), everything happens more slowly. Your heart rate might slow down. You could get constipated. And you might gain weight. If it makes too much ( hyperthyroidism ), everything speeds up. Your heart might race. You could have diarrhea . And you might lose weight without trying. The thyroid gland also produces the hormone calcitonin, which may contribute to bone strength by helping calcium get incorporated into bone.",

        "Testes. In men, the testes make testosterone. It helps them grow facial and body hair at puberty. It also tells the penis to grow larger and plays a role in making sperm."
