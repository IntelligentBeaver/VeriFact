        "Having treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common type of lung cancer, can be complicated. While the treatment may address the cancer itself, it may leave out other physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. That's why people with NSCLC at all stages may benefit from palliative care. Palliative care is a broad range of services aimed at relieving pain, easing stress, and other services that can improve your quality of life. It can be delivered during cancer treatment or at any stage of the disease. Research shows it can improve outcomes such as health care delivery, quality of life, and use of hospice. The services can include medical care such as nutritional counseling and procedures to open airways. It can go beyond caring for your body to include mental health counseling or massage. Palliative care is used at any phase of your illness. It's not the same as hospice care, which is only for the end of life. \"If patients think about palliative care, they might think about death and dying. But, really, palliative care is for living,\" says Toby Campbell, MD, a thoracic medical oncologist at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. \"Our job is to help people find ways to live well. Our whole focus is on the living part of the equation, not the dying part, so people might be surprised that we ask so many questions about living.\""

        "Late-stage NSCLC is cancer that has spread to certain lymph nodes or to other parts of your body. It includes stages III and IV cancers – specifically stage IIIB to stage IVB. From 2018 to 2022, about 44% of all lung cancers were diagnosed in the late stage, according to the CDC. During late-stage cancers, it's usually not possible to remove all of the cancer. Instead, you'll likely focus on managing symptoms. The latter stages may present different challenges than earlier stages of the disease. \"Symptoms in late-stage cancer are more burdensome,\" Campbell said, adding that there may be more symptoms at the same time, or they may be more severe. Whether you or a loved one has adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma – all are the main types of NSCLC – palliative care may be able to improve quality of life."

On the flip side, doctors may not refer them for palliative care services because they have concerns about the services interrupting medical care, the authors wrote. Many people with lung cancer aren't referred for palliative care until later in their disease, or not at all, even though the benefits of using palliative care early on are well documented, authors of a 2024 study in Journal of Pain and Symptom Management reported. When people were referred soon after their diagnosis, they had longer times in hospice, less frequent aggressive care at the end of their lives, and lower rates of dying in a hospital, the study showed. Palliative care should be started within eight weeks of diagnosis, according to a report in the ASCO Educational Book. Palliative care may be more accessible when it can be delivered remotely, if needed.
