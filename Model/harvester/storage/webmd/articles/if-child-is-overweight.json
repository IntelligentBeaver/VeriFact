        "June 12, 2000 -- Issues of weight and dieting are common causes for concern in households with teenage children. Many parents worry because teens are dieting all the time or even showing signs of eating disorders . Other parents may needlessly worry because their children aren't stick-thin.",
        "But some parents may indeed have reason to be concerned. Federal studies have documented an increase in the percentage of children who are significantly overweight, a factor that could adversely affect their health. Dietitians say the causes are two-fold: eating too many calories and moving around too little.",
        "If parents are concerned, the first step is to have a pediatrician or family physician assess the child's weight based on a number of factors -- including body type and body mass index -- and compare it with charts that indicate national height and weight averages for various age groups. If a child is seriously overweight , doctors also may administer a blood sugar test to find out if the child is diabetic or pre-diabetic -- because excessive weight is a risk factor for diabetes."
