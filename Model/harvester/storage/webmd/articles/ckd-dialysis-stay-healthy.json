        "By the time your doctor recommends dialysis, your kidneys are too damaged to filter enough fluids and wastes out of your body. Dialysis does the work for your kidneys, but it's not a cure for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The machine can only do about 10% to 15% of the job your own kidneys used to do. You can't reverse kidney disease, but while you're on dialysis you can take steps to slow the damage and prevent kidney failure. A well-balanced diet, regular exercise, and other lifestyle changes will help your dialysis work better and preserve the kidney function you still have. Taking these actions will also help you feel better during treatment."
