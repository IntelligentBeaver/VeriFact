Cancer is defined as the uncontrollable growth of cells that invade and cause damage to surrounding tissue. Oral cancer appears as a growth or sore in the mouth that does not go away. Oral cancer, which includes cancers of the lips, tongue , cheeks, floor of the mouth, and hard palate, can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated early. This cancer accounts for less than 5% of all cancers in the United States."
