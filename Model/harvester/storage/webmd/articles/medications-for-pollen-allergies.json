        "When you get allergy shots, your doctor gives you small, gradually increasing amounts of the pollens that are causing your symptoms. Over time, your body builds up a resistance to them. The shots are a long-term commitment, likely taking 3 to 5 years. After that, your doctor will see if you still need them.",
        "Instead of getting shots at the doctor’s office, there are also under-the-tongue tablets that you can take at home. The FDA has approved three of these products: Grastek, Oralair, and Ragwitek. They work the same way as shots. The goal is to boost your tolerance of allergy triggers.",
        "The tablets can cause an allergic reaction in some people, so you will need to take your first one at your doctor’s office to make sure it’s safe for you. Even if you don’t have a reaction, you may feel itching or burning in your mouth or lips or have stomach troubles. These problems usually go away after a few days."
