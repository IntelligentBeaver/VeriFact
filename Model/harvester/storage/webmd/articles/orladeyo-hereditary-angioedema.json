        "HAE is a rare, inherited condition that is passed down from parents to their children. People with HAE do not have enough of a certain protein called complement component C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 inhibitor) in their bodies. This is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for this protein.",
        "C1 inhibitor helps to control how much fluid flows in and out of the body’s cells. When there isn’t enough C1 inhibitor present, fluid can build up outside of the blood vessels. This can block the normal flow of blood and fluid and lead to rapid and severe swelling. In people with HAE, this causes severe swelling attacks that happen without any warning and can last for a few days. On average, these swelling attacks happen about every 2 weeks, although some people may only experience them one or two times per year."
