        "Researchers aren’t sure why the Lazarus phenomenon happens, but they have theories. For instance, some think it could be due to a delayed effect of ventilation procedures or drugs given to someone during CPR. They also say some cases may have a link to conditions like having too much potassium in your blood ( hyperkalemia ) or a heart problem called myocardial stunning. This is when the heart doesn’t get enough blood and doesn’t function correctly even though blood flow is normal.",
        "Some researchers think medical workers don’t always report cases of the Lazarus phenomenon. They say that might be partly due to fear of the legal consequences that could stem from declaring someone dead when they’re not, especially after stopping CPR. It could open a medical team up to being accused of negligence and incompetence, as well as lawsuits.",
        "Why might a health worker accidentally diagnose death too soon? One study points out that “death is not an event, but a process.” That’s why researchers recommend that health workers keep close tabs on a patient for several minutes even after CPR appears to have failed."
