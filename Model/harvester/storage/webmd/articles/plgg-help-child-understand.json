        "Danielle Leach has experienced childhood cancer conversations from both sides. When Leach was in fifth grade, her sister was diagnosed with a form of sarcoma, and she navigated life as a sibling of a childhood cancer survivor. Years later, when Leach’s second son Mason was 3, he was diagnosed with a (non-pLGG) brain tumor. He lived until just after his fifth birthday. “When Mason was sick, he knew what was going on,” Leach says. “A couple of weeks before he died, he was asking what heaven was like. I had never talked about that to him directly, but he brought it up. It was so important to let him have the space to have the conversations he needed to have.” Leach’s experiences propelled her into a career in childhood cancer prevention, detection, program development, and advocacy. She’s now a volunteer and parent advocate for the American Childhood Cancer Organization (ACCO). She has also served as chief of government relations and advocacy for the National Brain Tumor Society. No parent wants to be in the position to have conversations with their child about cancer. But when you’re living the reality of your child’s pLGG diagnosis, you’re their best guide to what’s happening."

        "Every child reacts to a cancer diagnosis in their own way. But Ty Jackson, child life specialist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, says he sees some themes in what kids want to know after finding out they have brain cancer. “Some of the most common questions I hear kids asking here at the hospital are, ‘What is cancer? How did I get it? Why did I get it? Can I give it to someone else?’” he says. Jackson also says that because brain tumors can often affect kids’ ability to do their everyday activities, they’re eager to know when they can get back to “normal” and go to school, play sports, or do dance again. Many of the answers you give your child will feel disappointing or even scary to them. But you can guide them through their concerns with gentle understanding, even while staying honest."

Your cancer clinic, especially if it’s a pediatric-focused facility, likely has a wealth of resources available to you, so start there. Connect with child life specialists, social workers, and any mental health support available to talk through how to communicate with your child, their siblings, and other family members. “The goal of a child life specialist is to decrease trauma and anxiety surrounding the hospital environment,” Jackson says. “Often we do that by providing education about a diagnosis or an illness, providing preparation for procedures and other things a child may experience in the hospital environment, and making sure that they feel prepared.” Meet them at their level. Your child may do well with only a conversation, but some children learn and process best in other ways, such as reading a book with you or watching a video. Some kids click best with tools they can touch and manipulate."

But it’s OK to say “I don’t know” if it’s the truth. “In those situations that I encourage caregivers to respond with, ‘I don't have the answer to that question right now, but that's a really great question, and I want you to keep asking those questions,’” Jackson says. “It takes some of the pressure off.
