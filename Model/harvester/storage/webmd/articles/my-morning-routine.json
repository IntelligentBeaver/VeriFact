        "Let’s be real: Mornings can be rough when you are someone dealing with a chronic, often unpredictable condition like PsA. I find it so important to have a morning routine that allows me to take my time in the mornings and ease into my day. A well-structured morning routine for someone with arthritis should focus on a few major things! My morning routine consists of gently easing stiffness, reducing pain, and preparing my body and mind for the day.",
        "Here's a guide to a practical and manageable routine for your mornings:"
      ],
      "bullets": [
        "Wake up ritual: Make sure to set an alarm the night before (or three if you like to hit snooze!). Be sure to allow yourself enough time to get up and get ready for your day. I love giving myself extra time so I don’t have to rush around and get ready for work. You can even allow yourself to stay in bed a few extra minutes and begin with slow, gentle range-of-motion exercises like: wiggling your fingers and toes, rotating your wrists and ankles, bending your knees slowly (if comfortable) and stretching your arms over your head. You can do these movements in bed, before you get up. I find these small movements help reduce stiffness before getting up each morning.",
        "Warm-up therapy: If I feel stiff in the morning (which can definitely happen with PsA), I will use a heating pad or warm towel on my stiff joints (hands, knees, or back) for about 10-15 minutes. It really helps to get things moving and much less stiff. Sometimes I will take a warm shower to help loosen joints and relax muscles.",
        "Gentle stretching or mobility exercises: If you have the time, I highly suggest doing some stretching out of bed to start your day! You can focus on low-impact movements like shoulder rolls, neck tilts, seated leg lifts, or even gentle yoga or tai chi routines (even from a chair). Believe it or not, just doing some gentle stretching can really help to loosen up your tight and stiff joints!",
        "Medications and supplements: All of my medications and supplements are organized in pill containers that tell me which day to take what. If you’re like me, you have a routine for when you take them. I always take my morning medications and vitamins at the same time, with a big glass of water. On the days where I do my arthritis injections in the morning, I allow myself some time to let the injection get to room temperature before injecting my medication. This alleviates the pain or burning sensation that can come from injecting medicine straight from the refrigerator.",
        "Have an anti-inflammatory breakfast: I try to choose foods that fight inflammation and are super easy to prepare, like oatmeal with berries and flaxseeds, Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts, whole-grain toast with avocado or nut butter, herbal tea (ginger or green), or coffee. These are my go-to breakfast meals, or sometimes I will take a breakfast bar to go. I try to avoid sugary cereals or processed foods, which can increase my inflammation levels.",
        "Don’t forget your topicals: Sometimes my skin is angry when I wake up and I need to put on some cream for my psoriasis patches or moisturizer. I like to do this before getting dressed or putting my makeup on for work. Moisturizing will help keep skin hydrated and avoid irritation throughout the day. Don’t forget sunblock if you work outside! If you have pain in your joints, you can also apply your topical pain reliever cream as well before getting dressed for the day.",
        "Get dressed with ease: I love to lay my clothes out the night before so I don’t even have to think about what to wear in the morning. Sometimes I will even lay out two choices so I have options! I find hanging the outfit up on a hanger so I don’t have to bend makes life so much easier. Don’t forget to pick something comfortable, easy to put on (no buttons or zippers), and pick practical, easy-to-walk-in shoes.",
        "Mental mantra boost : I love to say a few positive affirmations in the morning to help get my day started with a little extra boost! Some of my favorites include: “I am more than my illness.” “Today, I will focus on what I can control and let go of what I cannot.” “My body may struggle, but my spirit remains strong.” “It’s OK to rest because healing is not a race.” “I honor my limits and celebrate my efforts.” “Each small step forward is progress.” “I am deserving of kindness, especially from myself.” “Pain is part of my journey, not everything.” “I breathe in calm, I breathe out tension.” “I am resilient, and I will face today with courage.” “I got this, I can do anything.” “I have to keep fighting the fight!” And last but certainly not least, “I am a psoriatic arthritis warrior!”"
