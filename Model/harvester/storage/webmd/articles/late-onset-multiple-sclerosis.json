        "When you have multiple sclerosis (MS), your immune system attacks nerve cells and fibers called axons in your brain. When this happens, your brain can’t send electrical messages to your body as well as it should. That changes the way your body moves and operates. Most people start to get MS symptoms between 20 and 40 years of age. But sometimes, you won’t have any MS symptoms until you’re 50 or older. When this happens, doctors call it late-onset multiple sclerosis (LOMS)."
