As usual, I consumed a lowish number of healthy carbs, enough to fuel my hour-a-day exercise plan and keep my weight in a good range. Of course, there may have been a slice or two of carrot cake with sugary cream cheese icing for my son’s 33 rd birthday. And a little more cake on Mother’s Day. Plus a glass or two of prosecco."
