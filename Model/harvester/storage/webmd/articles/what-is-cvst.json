        "Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST) is a type of rare blood clot that forms in the venous sinuses in your brain. This is a system of veins found between the layers of the dura mater -- the tough outer layer of your brain that lies directly under your skull.",
        "The clot can block the blood in your brain from draining out toward your heart. When this happens, blood cells may break from the pressure, cross the blood-brain barrier, and seep into nearby brain tissue. This can cause a hemorrhage, a type of stroke that stems from internal bleeding . CVST can be life-threatening. You’ll need immediate medical attention.",
        "CVST affects about 5,000 people in the U.S. each year. It makes up about 0.5% of all strokes and can affect both adults and children. It can even happen to newborns or babies while they’re still in the womb. The risk for new mothers is especially high during the first few weeks after delivery."
