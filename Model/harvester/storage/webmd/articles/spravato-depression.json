        "Four clinical studies were conducted to test if Spravato was safe and effective for adults with treatment resistant depression and major depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. The scoring system used to measure the severity and improvement in depression symptoms was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). This is a 10-item questionnaire that assesses depression symptoms through questions about mood, guilt, sleep quality, and suicidal thoughts. The total score ranges from zero to 60, with higher scores meaning more severe depression symptoms. A larger decrease in MADRS score shows a bigger improvement in depression symptoms. The effectiveness of Spravato was measured with MADRS scores at the beginning and end of the study. The studies included adults aged 18 to 64. The studies included people who were White, Black, Asian, and other races."
