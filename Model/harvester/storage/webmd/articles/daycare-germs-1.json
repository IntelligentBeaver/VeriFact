        "Aseelah El-Amin is a self-proclaimed germaphobe. When the Atlanta mom was looking for daycare for her 18-month-old daughter, she visited many child-care centers, always asking the directors lots of questions. She asked how they kept toys clean, what the policy was about sick kids, mask-wearing, and how they worked to fight germs.",
        "\"I knew that when children start daycare, they get sick a lot,\" she says, \"so I was really picky.\"",
        "She found a place near her home where germ fighting was a top priority. The staff had children take off their shoes in a small room before coming inside. Toys were cleaned every day with natural cleaning products. Parents were given a list of symptoms -- such as diarrhea and pinkeye -- that meant sick kids had to stay home.",
        "Like El-Amin, you may be concerned about germs, hygiene, and sanitation when choosing a daycare center, particularly in the age of COVID-19. Then your worries may surface again when cold and flu season starts. That's when you may notice kids with runny noses and coughs playing side by side with your child.",
        "These concerns are valid, pediatricians say. With so many small kids together in a small place, daycare can be a festering ground for bacteria and viruses."
