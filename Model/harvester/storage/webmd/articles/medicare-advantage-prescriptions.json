Sometimes it’s right away, like when the FDA decides a drug isn’t safe. Otherwise, if the change affects a drug you’re currently taking, the plan must let you know. It can either: Give you 30-day notice Give you written notification and at least a 30-day supply of your medication at its current cost. This happens when you refill your prescription."
