        "Although they're frequently called insects, spiders belong to a closely related class called arachnids. Spiders are helpful to people because they feed on harmful insects. Spiders aren't aggressive or dangerous to humans, and spider bites are rare. But many people fear spiders .",
        "Spiders have eight legs and two body sections, as opposed to the six legs and three body sections that insects have. They have six to eight eyes that are usually arranged in two rows.",
        "Why do spiders spin webs?",
        "Usually, spiders build webs to capture their food. But some spiders use web silk for different reasons. For example, tarantulas line their burrows with silk that has pointy hairs to protect against potential invaders.",
        "Silk is also helpful for making egg sacs. Female spiders lay clusters of eggs and usually cover them with a thick sheet of sticky material that can be attached to almost any surface. The egg sacs are often found around the web. When the eggs hatch, spiderlings emerge and may crawl to the top of a nearby object and spin a thin strand of silk. The wind will catch the silk and carry the spiderling away. This process is called ballooning and can carry the spiderlings a great distance."
