        "Hand osteoarthritis is swelling and irritation -- called inflammation -- that causes pain and stiffness in the joints of your hands. Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It happens when the connective tissue (cartilage) at the ends of your bones wears away. This causes your bones to rub together.",

A tendon is a thick, flexible band of tissue that connects your muscle to your bone. You can get tendonitis in your hand, wrist, and thumb, as well as other parts of your body. Because tendonitis causes pain near your joints, it is sometimes mistaken for arthritis."
