        "“High-functioning autism” isn’t an official medical term or diagnosis. It’s an informal term some people use when they talk about people with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD). This usually means people on this end of the autism spectrum can speak, read, write, and handle basic life skills such as eating and getting dressed. But having these abilities doesn’t necessarily mean that their autism symptoms don’t seriously affect their lives.",
        "Making assumptions about someone’s needs based on a label isn’t always helpful. Not everyone with autism is the same. Using the “high-functioning autism” label can hurt someone’s feelings or even offend them. Instead, many autistic people use the terms “low support needs” and “high support needs” to describe where they fall on the spectrum. Someone with low support needs may not need a lot of day-to-day help. But someone with high support needs might need help with daily activities."
