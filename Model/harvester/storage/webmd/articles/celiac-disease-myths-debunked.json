        "If you have celiac disease, you’ve probably come across some frustrating misconceptions about your condition and the gluten-free diet required to manage it. But as a dietitian in gastroenterology, I’ve learned that many myths continue to plague the celiac disease community.",
        "Both newly diagnosed patients and those living with the condition for years and years often hold some misconceptions. Below are the top myths I hear that can lead to poor disease management and extra challenges navigating a gluten-free lifestyle.",
        "Myth No. 1: Celiac disease can be managed with medications or supplements.",
        "The only treatment for celiac disease is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. There are no medications or supplements that cure celiac disease or make gluten safe to eat for people with celiac disease.",
        "This includes taking supplements for accidental or intentional exposure. Products like activated charcoal or those marketed as “gluten digesting” or “gluten degrading” enzymes can’t make gluten tolerable if you have celiac disease or effectively treat symptoms from eating gluten. Avoiding gluten is the only proven way to maintain good health with celiac disease, but fortunately, it’s a highly effective strategy."

        "The risks of gluten exposure with celiac disease are limited to eating gluten, not external contact. There is no evidence that gluten gets absorbed through the skin, making topical products like bath soaps, shampoos, hair gels, and body lotion low risk.",
        "But products that may be ingested or come into contact with the mouth – such as chapstick, lipsticks, toothpaste, and mouthwash – should be checked for gluten. Otherwise, washing your hands after using a product can help prevent accidental ingestion.",
        "Myth No. 3: Your home kitchen should be strictly gluten-free.",
        "Most people with celiac disease live with family members or roommates who are not gluten-free but can safely share the kitchen and eating space regardless. The key is safe food storage and preparation rather than eliminating gluten from your home entirely.",
        "Best practices include thoroughly washing all equipment such as pots, pans, cutting boards, countertops, and knives before preparing gluten-free food. Separate equipment is not strictly necessary as long as items are cleaned with soap and water. Cross-contamination can be avoided by using labels, airtight containers, resealable bags, and designated shelves and storage bins. The presence of gluten-containing food in the kitchen or eating space is not an automatic hazard."

Eating foods with more gluten than this, even infrequently and in small amounts, can still cause inflammation and damage to the small intestine.
