        "Varicose veins are swollen or enlarged veins that run just under the skin's surface, usually on the legs and feet. They form when the valves on the veins become weak or damaged. This condition affects about 25% of women and 15% of men.",
        "You may be at a higher risk for varicose veins if you are older, lead an inactive lifestyle, or sit or stand for long periods, or if you have obesity. Varicose veins can also be hereditary, or they can develop after a trauma or an injury. They are also common for many women during pregnancy . Being physically active can help improve blood flow and vein health.",
        "With any type of exercise, it's best to start slowly, then increase your activity when you feel comfortable. High-impact exercises like jogging and jumping can increase blood pressure in the legs, which can feel uncomfortable. If you begin carefully and work up to incorporate more activity, exercises can both reduce your risk of developing, or developing more, varicose veins, and it can improve your overall circulation, which should help with the pain associated with varicose veins."

        "If you have varicose veins, exercise can’t cure them, but it can ease your discomfort. While there is no way to completely prevent varicose veins, exercise will improve circulation and tone your muscles, which may reduce your likelihood of developing them. Getting rid of existing varicose veins can be trickier. While in some cases, more advanced treatments — ranging from minimally invasive to more complicated surgeries to remove the veins — may be needed, beginning with self-care treatments, including compression stockings and regular exercise, is a great place to start to ease pain and keep existing varicose veins from getting worse.",

        "Swimming",
        "The movements in swimming push your legs up and stop blood from pooling in them. Swimming is a great low-impact cardio exercise, because it doesn’t require your joints and bones to bear your weight. If you’re new to swimming but have access to a pool, you can start easy by trading off 30 seconds of activity and 30 seconds of rest. You can shake things up by focusing on your kicking with a kickboard or trying out full strokes. As you get more comfortable, you can increase your time swimming or the number of laps you’re doing, but try these increases in small inverals — no more than a 10% increase week to week."
