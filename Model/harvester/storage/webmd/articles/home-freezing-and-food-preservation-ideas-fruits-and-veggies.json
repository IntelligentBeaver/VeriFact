Whether you had a great harvest from your garden or found a good deal at the supermarket, your extra food doesn’t have to go to waste if you can’t finish it all. If you're wondering how to freeze different foods, know that there can be some differences to keep in mind. Freezer burn is avoidable, frozen food is just as nutritious, and food prep and preservation can be as simple as preparing your meals for the freezer."
