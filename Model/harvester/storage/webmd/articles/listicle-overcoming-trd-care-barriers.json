        "You deserve quality mental health care for your treatment-resistant depression (TRD). But if you face barriers to that care, you’re far from alone. Studies show less than half of U.S. adults with mental health struggles get the care they need. Here are some of the most common hurdles and strategies to address them.",
        "A care team who understands your background can make a world of difference in the quality of care you receive. Asking people in your community for recommendations is one way to connect with care that’s a good fit, but you can also use resources like the National Alliance on Mental Illness’s “Sharing Hope” program. And Therapy for Black Girls, Latinx Therapy, and the Asian Mental Health Collective can also help you find culturally competent care that respects your identity and experience near you.",
        "If you face challenges like transportation, child care, or job scheduling, tell your care team. There may be solutions they can offer if they know the problems you face. Many clinics can offer telehealth visits, medication delivery, or other support tools to help you get the care you need. The National Helpline from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (800-662-4357) or FindTreatment.gov can help.",
        "Financial barriers are a reality for many Americans who need mental health care. Ask your care team about patient assistance programs for TRD medications, sliding-scale therapy, or community mental health centers. Free or low-cost clinics (search “Federally Qualified Health Centers”) can also help you access high-quality care without major financial strain. Try the Health Resources and Services Administration search engine to find a health center near you. Tools like NeedyMeds.org can also help you afford medications.",
        "You may be part of a community where talking about mental health isn’t common. Know that taking medication or going to therapy for depression doesn’t make you weak – it shows courage. It may help you to connect online with others dealing with depression. You can take part anonymously, if that is easier for you. Try the Anxiety and Depression Association of America’s Free & Anonymous Online Mental Health Support Communities or the National Alliance on Mental Illness’s Connection Support Group.",
        "History is full of examples of mistreatment toward many different groups by the medical community. A fear or mistrust of medical professionals is understandable. Recognize it and use it to help you find someone you feel comfortable with and trust. Bring a friend or family member with you to appointments to be an extra set of ears and advocate as you seek care. Ask questions and request clear explanations about your treatment.",
        "You need to understand what your care team is telling you – and they need to understand you when you’re describing your symptoms and needs. If English isn’t your first language, try searching for a bilingual clinic. Or you can also ask for an interpreter or translator. Many community clinics offer translation services. At FindTreatment.gov, put a location into the “Find a Treatment Facility” field, and then filter by “language services.”",
        "TRD often requires a multi-step, trial-and-error approach. If multiple medications haven’t worked for you, persist. Ask your care team for referrals to specialists who have experience with TRD and other types of procedures, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or infusion or intranasal ketamine that might help."
