        "Ten years ago, a woman suffering a heart attack was too often misdiagnosed. Without the chest pains commonly seen in men, her symptoms of dizziness or back pain were often dismissed as unimportant.",

        "Today, however, a woman in cardiac arrest is more likely to be diagnosed properly and live to tell about it. In fact, thanks in large part to an unprecedented national focus on women's health, women are being more effectively screened and treated for a whole host of diseases.",

        "\"Now we're going beyond screening, to improving management and treatment of diseases,\" says Rios. Women are being diagnosed earlier and living longer. But, she stresses, the way women are educated and treated once they are diagnosed still needs improvement."
