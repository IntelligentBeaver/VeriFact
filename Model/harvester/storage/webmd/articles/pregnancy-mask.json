You're more likely to get these marks if you have a dark complexion . They appear when hormonal changes during pregnancy increase your body's production of melanin, brownish skin pigment. Being in the sun makes the blotches worse. You don't need to treat them because they're harmless. They will likely fade within a few months after your baby is born."
