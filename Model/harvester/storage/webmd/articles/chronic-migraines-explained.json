        "Can chronic migraine be cured?",
        "It can't be cured, but it can be eased. If you keep a headache diary and recognize your triggers, you can lessen the number of headaches you get. Also, taking medication will relieve the pain and prevent some headaches from returning. As you get older, you usually get fewer migraine episodes.",

        "For many women with chronic migraine (and most of the people who get migraine are women), it tends to ease after age 50 and may even disappear. That's because women over 50 usually enter menopause, a time when they stop having periods and their bodies produce less of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone . Migraine is linked to female hormones ."

For a migraine to be considered chronic, you must get it for at least 15 days in a month for at least 3 months. Chronic migraine can be triggered by stress, lack of sleep, loud sounds, flashing lights, and certain foods and drinks, among other things. Treatment involves pain relievers and anti-nausea medicine, plus home remedies like lying down in a quiet dark room and applying a compress."
