        "NSAIDs and colchicine The standard treatment for pericarditis is a combination of NSAIDs and colchicine. Over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin help ease swelling and inflammation. Your doctor may also prescribe other pain relievers. When used alone or in combination with NSAIDs, colchicine lessens symptoms and makes it less likely that your symptoms will come back. Studies show this drug combination works well to treat pericarditis. But it can cause side effects. You could have stomach problems and weakness. These medications may also hinder other drugs you may be taking. You should also avoid colchicine if you have liver or kidney disease. Share your health history with your doctor so they’ll know if colchicine is safe for you to take. Corticosteroids If NSAIDs and colchicine don’t soothe your symptoms or you can’t take one of these medications, your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid such as prednisone . This is a powerful drug that combats inflammation. With steroids, some studies show there’s a higher chance of your symptoms coming back or lasting longer than usual. You could also have side effects like weight gain and muscle loss."

Your doctor could keep your immune system in check by prescribing: IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) Azathioprine IL-1 blockers Interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors treat recurrent pericarditis. They work by blocking inflammation of the pericardium and can also lower your odds of the symptoms returning. The IL-1 inhibitor anakinra (Kineret) is used for treating pericarditis. Rilonacept (Arcalyst) is approved to treat recurrent pericarditis. These are used for at least 6 months, but often for more than a year. After that, your doctor will slowly taper your dose if you're taking anakinra, a process that can also take a year or more. If you're taking rilonacept, your doctor may end your treatment without a tapering off period."
