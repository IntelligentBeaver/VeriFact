        "They are your best source of information about TED. They’ve treated other people with TED and kept up-to-date on the latest research. They can answer most of your questions about this condition and how to manage it. They know your history. Your doctor knows your family history, medical conditions, typical test results, risk factors, and other things that can affect your thyroid and eye health. For example, radioactive iodine therapy is a treatment that can help with most Graves’ symptoms but can worsen TED. If you already have eye problems, your doctor can prescribe a form of treatment that is less likely to affect your eyes. They can help you manage symptoms. TED can cause one or both of your eyes to be red, swollen, dry, or watery. Your doctor can suggest ways to help with these symptoms. If you have mild symptoms, they might recommend at-home strategies like using a cold compress, wearing sunglasses, or using eyedrops."

        "They also can prescribe steroids or other treatments. For example, steroids can help with pain, redness, and swelling caused by TED. A new drug called teprotumumab can help with double vision, inflammation around the eye, and eye bulging. About 1 in 20 people with TED develop severe symptoms. You might not be able to fully close your eyes, develop eye ulcers, or lose your vision. Treatment can help preserve your vision and stop TED from getting worse. Your doctor is an expert on your condition, but you know your body best. Be honest about your symptoms and how you’re feeling. Learn more about your condition. If you have questions, ask. You and your doctor can work together to find the best treatment plan for you. They can connect you with support. TED symptoms can be uncomfortable and change the way your eyes look. Eyes are an important part of your appearance and how you express emotions and connect to others. For some people, these changes can be upsetting. They might affect your self-esteem or social life. But you don’t have to go through TED alone. Your doctor can provide advice, point you to online resources, and connect you with local support groups and nonprofits."
