        "General anesthesia is medicine you get before surgeries that require you to be in a deep sleep-like state. It is given in stages – just before the surgery begins and then throughout the surgery to keep you in that sleep state. When you are in this state, you can’t feel what the surgeon is doing. This deep sleep is usually used if you have a major surgery but might be used for other purposes. For example, children who are unable to lay still for long periods or cooperate during an involved dental procedure may need a general anesthetic.",
        "General anesthesia is given by an anesthesiologist -- a doctor who specializes in anesthesiology -- or a certified nurse anesthetist. They remain in the operating room with you throughout the surgical procedure to make sure you stay in the sleep state and to give you medication to reverse the anesthetic when the procedure is over.",

Although you are not asleep as with a general anesthetic, typically the doctor will give you a medication that relaxes you while you have a regional anesthetic."
