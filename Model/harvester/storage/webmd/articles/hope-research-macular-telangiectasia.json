        "Macular telangiectasia (MacTel) type 2 is a disease that damages cells in your eyes that detect light (your retina). When you have MacTel, your central vision slowly gets worse over time because certain cells in your retina break down and blood vessels there change. These changes can make it much harder to see with your central vision, the sight that helps you read and drive.",
        "Diana Do, MD, professor of ophthalmology and vice chair for clinical affairs at Stanford University’s Byers Eye Institute, is a retina surgeon who treats a variety of vision loss conditions including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic eye disease. She’s drawn to investigate conditions with unanswered questions that need further scientific study to find effective treatments. She’s spent much of her career on MacTel research.",
        "“Early in my career at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, I spent significant time investigating MacTel,” she says. “With the collaboration of many colleagues, we looked at the natural history of the condition, and in addition, we conducted a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, also known as VEGF, for MacTel.”"
