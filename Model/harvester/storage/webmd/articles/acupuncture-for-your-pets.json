        "If your pet has arthritis , allergies, digestive issues, hip dysplasia, or certain neurological disorders, your vet may recommend acupuncture.",

        "Research shows that acupuncture can help reduce pain and inflammation and improve a pet's quality of life.",
        "During a session, a veterinary acupuncturist will insert thin needles into areas such as muscles, tendons, fascia, and nerve fibers to ease symptoms by altering the perception of pain or stimulating neurotransmitters in the brain.",
        "The alternative therapy, while effective, is not right for every pet. Munsterman doesn't recommend it for acute conditions such as infections and admits that some pets might not cooperate when an acupuncturist wants to insert needles and remain still during the 20-minute sessions.",
        "\"We'll actually feel along the meridians to see if the animal is sensitive to touch,\" says Munsterman. \"If they're not even letting you touch them, it's going to be really difficult to get needles into them.\""
