        "Released in its 15th edition, the report from U.S. News & World Report also evaluates 12 new categories and introduces 13 new diets, but the Mediterranean diet continues to dominate, placing highly across several categories.",
        "This year’s edition looks at 38 diets in 21 categories. That reflects consumer needs, with new categories added to evaluate plans that focus on conditions such as gut health, high blood pressure, high cholesterol , and arthritis , said Shanley Chien, a senior editor at U.S. News.",

This approach considers a wider range of health and lifestyle factors, meant to give consumers a more personalized assessment of various plans. So, if you have gut issues, arthritis, high blood pressure, or other conditions, the report has some suggestions for you."

        "The flexitarian diet was rated best as a plant-based diet. “What’s interesting is that they included diets [in that category] that include meat,” Cassetty said. That could undo the myth that plant-based diets must always exclude meat, she said. The flexitarian diet, also known as the semi-vegetarian diet, allows meat to be included. Cassetty advises people that “the closer you can get to eating more plants and reducing reliance on heavily processed food and foods with added sugar, the better.”",
