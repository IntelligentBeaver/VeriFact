Healthy arteries have smooth inner walls and blood flows through them easily. Some people, however, develop clogged arteries . Clogged arteries result from a buildup of a substance called plaque on the inner walls of the arteries. Arterial plaque can reduce blood flow or, in some instances, block it altogether.",
