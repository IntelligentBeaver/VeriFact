        "Diana was a 40-year-old wife and mother embarking on a real estate career when her pelvic pain began. She woke up one morning feeling pressure in her bladder and burning pain when she used the bathroom. Weeks passed with no improvement in her symptoms––and no signs of infection or other causes. She was referred to a urologist who diagnosed her with painful bladder syndrome or interstitial cystitis (IC).",
        "Diana’s pain continued to spread. As months passed, she developed rectal and vaginal burning, bloating, and cramps. The urologist sent Diana to gynecology to be checked for endometriosis, since many women with IC also have endometriosis. He referred to the two conditions as the “evil twins” of chronic pelvic pain. The gynecologist confirmed endometriosis.",
