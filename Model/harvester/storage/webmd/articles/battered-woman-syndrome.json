        "All too often, when people hear of a woman who has been repeatedly beaten by her partner, someone asks, “Why does she stay with them?”",
        "If you are in immediate danger, call 911. For anonymous, confidential help, 24/7, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-7233 (SAFE) or 800-787-3224 (TTY).",
        "The answer is extremely complicated, but some answers can be found by understanding a condition known as battered woman syndrome, which is considered a type of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ). Psychologist Lenore Walker, EdD, coined the term in her groundbreaking 1979 book, The Battered Woman .",
        "“Battered woman’s syndrome is the psychological effects of living with intimate partner violence,” Walker says. She notes that battered woman’s syndrome is not a mental illness, but the result of what happens when you live day in and day out with trauma. However, PTSD, which people with battered woman syndrome often also have, is considered to be a mental illness .",
        "The physical, sexual, and psychological abuse happens in cycles, Walker says. The tension builds, then there is an outburst of violence, followed by the abuser apologizing and promising to do better. And then the cycle starts all over again.",
        "Battered woman syndrome also involves “coercive control,” in which the partner needs to know where she is at all times, cuts her off from friends and family, and retains financial control so she doesn’t have the money to leave. Partners may not only threaten to kill the woman and her children, other relatives, or pets if she leaves, but also threaten to kill themselves."
