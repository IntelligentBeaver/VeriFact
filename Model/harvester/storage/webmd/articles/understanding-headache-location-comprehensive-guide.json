It usually affects people over 50.",

Common causes are stress, fatigue, shoulder or neck muscle pain, or jaw pain. Three in four adults get this type, some as often as three to four times a week. Usually, it lasts anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours.",

        "Thunderclap headache. This is a sudden, intense headache that strikes you like a thunderclap. It usually only lasts about a minute. It's rare and often a warning sign of something dangerous like a brain bleed due to a burst blood vessel or tumor. Get medical attention right away if this happens to you.",

If your headaches are triggered by a tumor, you'll likely have other symptoms like confusion, balance issues, speech problems, and numbness on one side of your body.
