        "If you’ve ever had hives, you know that these red, itchy welts can be very uncomfortable. Most of the time, hives -- also known as urticaria -- go away on their own. But sometimes, they last weeks or months and doctors can’t figure out a cause. When this happens, it’s known as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). “It can be very frustrating for patients because unlike other types of hives, we can’t just tell them to avoid a certain allergen or specific triggers like cold or sun exposure,” says Jeffrey Cohen, MD, a dermatologist at the Yale School of Medicine. “CSU can last for months or even years -- although most of the time, it does eventually clear up on its own.” Hives themselves are common. An estimated 20% of all Americans will get them at some point. CSU is much rarer. Less than half of 1% of all people in the United States have ever had it. It happens most often in adults between the ages of 20 and 40, and women are twice as likely to have CSU than men."

        "CSU looks like any other hives: batches of red or skin-colored welts (wheals) that can appear anywhere on the body, says Michael Cameron, MD, an assistant professor of dermatology at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. They usually itch and can vary in size and shape. They typically disappear within 24 hours. But unlike acute hives, they come back frequently, with entire episodes lasting more than 6 weeks. There’s also no known trigger. “Sometimes, when providers take a careful history, the patients may realize that their hives are due to sun exposure or water or due to the pressure from a heavy bag or seatbelt for several hours,” Cameron says. “But for patients with CSU, the source of their hives is a mystery.” Many people with CSU also get a condition called angioedema, which is puffiness and swelling in places like your lips, cheeks, eyelids, hands, or feet."
