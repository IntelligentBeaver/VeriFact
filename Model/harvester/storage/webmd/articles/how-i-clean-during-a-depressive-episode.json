        "There’s a reason the term “depression room” is popular. When you’re struggling with depression it seems impossible to take care of yourself or your environment. It’s difficult to keep your home clean when it’s a struggle to get out of bed. There’s not much energy to do anything else.",
        "Living in a messy and cluttered space only makes your depression worse. It’s hard to motivate yourself to get up and be productive when your living area is full of unneeded items that take up space.",
        "When your living space is clean, it helps ease stress and clear your mind. The clutter in your room is affecting you whether you realize it or not. This happens to me, and I feel a weight lifted off my shoulders when I declutter my space. It’s a weight I’m not even fully aware of until it’s gone.",
        "Make cleaning as “fun” as you can. I’m not one who loves cleaning. However, I do try to make it more enjoyable since it’s a necessary part of life. I like to either listen to music, a podcast, or talk to a friend on the phone while I’m cleaning. Listening to a funny or intriguing podcast takes my mind off how much cleaning I’m doing. I also open my windows when I’m cleaning if the weather is nice. This way I’m getting fresh air while moving around my house cleaning."

Plus, if you set a timer, you’re less likely to be on your phone because you’re on a time limit.",

Now you have a flat surface to set things on if need be. Take out all the trash in your room. Just grab a bag and go around your room collecting anything that can be thrown away. Any dirty dishes/cups in your room, bring them into your kitchen. Lastly, pick up any clothes off your floor. After doing these simple but impactful tasks, your room should already feel cleaner."
