        "June 26, 2025 -- What does it mean to age with dignity in today’s healthcare system? What will it take to truly transform how we care for older adults in America? In this episode, the first of a six-part series, we explored the documentary Aging in America: Survive or Thrive , created by The John A. Hartford Foundation . We spoke with Terry Fulmer, PhD, RN, FAAN , president of The John A. Hartford Foundation, to explore the legacy of Dr. Robert Butler and how hospitals are utilizing the “4 Ms” framework (What Matters, Medication, Mentation, Mobility) to enhance care for older adults. We dive into the stark disparities based on income, race, and geography, and highlight programs working to close those gaps. From dementia care models to creative workforce solutions and caregiver support, this conversation offers a hopeful, practical look at reimagining aging in America.",

        "Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered Podcast. I'm Dr. Neha Pathak, WebMD's Chief Physician Editor for Health and Lifestyle Medicine. Today is part one of a six-episode podcast miniseries we're launching over the next year to highlight the needs of an aging population and the evidence-based models that can dramatically accelerate care improvement for older adults—which benefits all of us. Improving care for older adults to better meet their needs and maintain their independence and dignity has a positive impact on individuals, families, communities, and society as a whole, as we all benefit from the continuing contribution of older adults and from overall reductions in healthcare spending. This week, we'll discuss the documentary Aging in America: Survive or Thrive , created by The John A. Hartford Foundation and watchable on PBS. The documentary explores the many ways our healthcare system can better serve older adults, particularly because in its current form, our healthcare system was built for 25-year-olds with broken bones, not older adults with multiple healthcare needs. We'll unpack the science and the stakes behind the 4M Framework that's transforming healthcare across the country. We'll tackle the confusion and questions that families whisper about in waiting rooms: Who actually pays when long-term rehab tops over a hundred thousand dollars a year? How do income, zip code, and race still dictate whether an older adult thrives or declines? Why is ageism the last acceptable “ism” in healthcare? You'll hear practical strategies so you can insist on evidence-based, dignity-driven treatment the next time an older loved one—or you—walks through the hospital door. In today’s episode, we’re taking you inside America’s age care paradox, where life-saving technology can add years to our calendar, but outdated care models can steal quality from those years. First, let me introduce my guest, Dr. Terry Fulmer. Terry Fulmer, a nurse scientist, is the president of The John A. Hartford Foundation in New York City, a foundation dedicated to improving the care of older adults. Dr. Fulmer serves as the chief strategist for the foundation, and her vision for better care of older adults is catalyzing the Age-Friendly Health Systems social movement. She’s an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine and an inductee as a Living Legend in the American Academy of Nursing. Welcome to the WebMD Health Discovered Podcast, Dr. Fulmer."

They had pressure ulcers. They became incontinent. They had episodes of delirium. And in that moment, I knew what my practice was gonna be. I saw that that was the work.

        "Wow, that's beautiful. To start off, Dr. Robert Butler’s book, Why Survive , is really highlighted throughout the film that we’re gonna be talking about today, and it really exposes viewers to the disparity in care for older adults—because we’re really seeing that the U.S. healthcare system is designed, as you said, really for acute care needs, particularly for the young, rather than really the complex chronic disease needs of older adults. In 1982, Dr. Butler founded the first department of geriatrics in a U.S. medical school. So can you help us take a step back and explain to us what was Dr. Butler’s vision for geriatrics?",
        "Fulmer: Sure. So Bob Butler—I had the great privilege of knowing him—he was a visionary. He knew that in order to improve care for older adults, we really needed to change policies, change funding streams, and change education. And he did that. His Pulitzer Prize–winning book, Why Survive? Growing Old in America , was inspirational to all of us because he just said: What is the state of care for older adults? One chapter that stands out to me is he talked about “houses of death,” and he was talking about nursing homes. He talked about delirium. He talked about the sequelae of sarcopenia—which your audience will know is muscle wasting—and he was telling us that if you don’t get it right, people will lose all their function. His vision was to make sure that the field was using a comprehensive, humanistic, and transformative approach to geriatric care. And he knew that geriatric medicine should be recognized as a distinct specialty, and he believed that good geriatric care required good science. So the National Institute on Aging—which he founded and was the founding director—was brought forth to make sure that we had the science for: Why do older people get dementia? And you know how much we've advanced in our knowledge and care of dementia. Why are older people incontinent? There's a science to it. It's not just that you're getting older and it happens to everybody—no. That’s not true. And there are treatments, for example. So he really saw geriatric care as inherently interdisciplinary as well. He knew that you needed a team-based approach. And if ever there’s a team-based approach, it’s geriatrics."

        "What kind?",
        "Fulmer: Exactly. What arrhythmia? So if you tell me “confusion,” I’m gonna say, “What kind of confusion?” Is it acute? Is it chronic? Is it acute delirium superimposed on dementia? We know the science of this, and so we have to get this right. So our foundation has really spent—since the 1980s—dedicated to making sure that we funded the workforce development and then models of care. And in thinking about models of care, we know that there are some very effective models. For example, you might have been in an institution that had an ACE unit—that means Acute Care for the Elderly. Maybe they had a NICHE program—Nurses Improving Care for Health System Elders. Those are funded by The John A. Hartford Foundation. I’m very proud of that. I wasn’t the head of the foundation at that time. They were absolutely visionary in thinking about what needed to happen. So when we started thinking about that, we said, “Wait a minute. We have the evidence. We have the science. It’s been funded by NIA. We’ve published the papers. Why aren’t people doing it?” And we know that there’s a great lag between science and implementation. So we went to implementation science groups—IHI—and said, “You know, can you help us?” And so, in meetings with them, we got together experts and wanted to really help overcome that know-do gap. And at first, we identified 90 care features in all the models that we took a look at, and then realized that we needed to distill from those 90 care features in the models—got to 13—and finally, in a room of experts, we got it down to the four essential 4Ms. And that’s how we have come to that. It wasn’t that we decided those were good ideas—it was all science-based. So you mentioned the What Matters—your goals and preferences, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility. And this set has evidence.

And if we were diving into that, you'd say, well, one of the things we need to make sure everybody knows is that dementia is not a part of normal aging. That when people's cognition changes, and if there's a delirium event, we should treat it as emergently as if a person had an arrhythmia, by the way. And so it's that critical that we assess, understand, make the correct diagnosis, and then get the right care plan going in concert with the goals and preferences of that older person and family. And don't think of cognition simply as delirium, dementia, and depression. Think about whether or not someone is lonely and how that's affecting them, and whether or not they are suffering from ageism—and that's affecting their cognition and their wellbeing. So I think that we're seeing a lot of progress. There is a model called the GUIDE Model , which we have helped support over time and is now a part of the way in which the government is funding care, which is a 10-year opportunity to study which programs for dementia are the most successful. But I'm very worried about delirium, because it is transient, it's easy to miss, and it can lead to a number of very detrimental outcomes—like falls, like depression, like medication problems. For example, if you have a delirium or if you have a dementia, are you taking your medications properly? Are you thinking carefully when you go out and go for a walk about your safety and what potentially could happen? The four M's is a set, and that's because each interacts with the other. If you are having changes in your mentation , you're likely to begin to have problems with your medication, with your mobility, and with your mentation as well.

Great care for older adults revolves around what matters, medications, mentation, and mobility. Whether you're a clinician or a family member, make these four pillars the agenda for hospital rounds, primary care visits, rehab check-ins, and even home health conversations. It's really important to think proactively, not just reactively. That can be something as simple as mobility promotion—not just falls prevention. We also learned that Medicare is not a long-term care solution. Medicare covers only short rehab stays. Ongoing nursing home care or in-home support is largely out of pocket or Medicaid-based. That's why we talked about why it's so important to have difficult conversations with our family and loved ones early.

In this episode, the first of a six-part series, we explored the documentary Aging in America: Survive or Thrive, created by The John A. Hartford Foundation. We spoke with Terry Fulmer, PhD, RN, FAAN, president of The John A. Hartford Foundation, to explore the legacy of Dr. Robert Butler and how hospitals are utilizing the “4 Ms” framework (What Matters, Medication, Mentation, Mobility) to enhance care for older adults. We dive into the stark disparities based on income, race, and geography, and highlight programs working to close those gaps. From dementia care models to creative workforce solutions and caregiver support, this conversation offers a hopeful, practical look at reimagining aging in America.",
