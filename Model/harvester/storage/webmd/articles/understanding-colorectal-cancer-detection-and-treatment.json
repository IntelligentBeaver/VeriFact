        "In the U.S., about 72% of colorectal cancer cases start in the colon and 28% in the rectum.",
        "The colon is also called the large intestine, which is part of your digestive system . It absorbs water and nutrients from food after it moves through your stomach and small intestine. Solid waste ( poop or stool) is stored in your colon before moving to the rectum. This 8-inch tube holds the waste until it leaves your body through the anus .",
        "Most colorectal cancers are \"silent\" tumors. They grow slowly, and you may not notice any symptoms until they’re large. But you can take some steps to prevent colorectal cancer , and you can cure it if you find it early. It’s important to have regular screening exams to spot cancer or precancerous areas, especially if you have a high risk of getting it."

This strategy involves giving larger amounts of these substances by injection or infusion in the hope of stimulating the cells of the immune system to act more effectively.",
            "Colony-stimulating factors. These things signal your body to make bone marrow cells (the soft, sponge-like material inside bones), which include both red and white blood cells and platelets. White blood cells fight infection; red blood cells carry oxygen to and carbon dioxide from organs and tissues; platelets are cell fragments that help the blood clot. Often, other cancer treatments cause decreases in these cells. Thus, colony-stimulating factors don’t directly affect tumors, but they can help support your immune system during cancer treatment .",
            "Monoclonal antibodies . These lab-made things find and bind to cancer cells wherever they are in the body. They can be used to see where the tumor is in the body (detection of cancer) and call in other immune system cells to destroy them, or as therapy to deliver drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to a tumor. Monoclonal antibodies for colorectal cancer include bevacizumab ( Avastin ), cetuximab ( Erbitux ), panitumumab ( Vectibix ), and ramucirumab ( Cyramza ).",
            "Immune checkpoint inhibitors . These are drugs that take the “brakes” off of checkpoint proteins in the immune system, which helps these proteins recognize and attack cancer cells. They include ipilimumab ( Yervoy ), pembrolizumab , ( Keytruda ), and nivolumab ( Opdivo ).",
            "Tumor vaccines . Researchers are developing vaccines that may encourage the immune system to better recognize cancer cells. In theory, they would work in a similar way as vaccines for measles , mumps, and other infections. The difference in cancer treatment is that vaccines are used after someone has cancer, rather than to prevent the disease. There are also ongoing studies involving possible vaccines to prevent breast and prostate cancers."
