Food intolerances, on the other hand, are less severe and usually don't involve the immune system.

IgE-mediated allergies are the most common. With this type, your immune system produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies that react to specific allergens. Non-IgE-mediated food allergies involve other parts of your immune system."
