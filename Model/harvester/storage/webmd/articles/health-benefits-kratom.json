        "Kratom is a tree from the coffee family native to Southeast Asia. Also known as Mitragyna speciosa, it's grown in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Its leaves are dried and used to make tea or put into capsules for sale as a supplement. Kratom leaves can also be smoked like tobacco.",
        "You can find kratom leaves, powder, and capsules in some health food stores, vape shops, and online specialty stores. The most common uses of it are to relieve pain, depression , and opioid addiction. The two most active compounds found in kratom — mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine — work on opioid receptors but with fewer side effects.",

        "Though modern science has lent some support to these and other traditional medicine claims, much more research is needed.",
        "Experts consider kratom an opioid-like substance because it affects your brain's opioid receptors. In low doses, it’s a stimulant. But in high doses, it can relieve pain like opioids do. Just like opioids, kratom can be addictive."
