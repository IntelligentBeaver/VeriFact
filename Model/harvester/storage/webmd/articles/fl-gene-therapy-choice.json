        "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is one of the newer treatment choices available for certain cancers. CAR T-cell therapy treats your cancer by using your own immune cells -- white blood cells called T cells. Scientists modify them in a lab so they can find and kill cancer cells.",

        "The FDA has approved CAR T-cell therapy as a treatment for transformed follicular lymphoma, a rare situation where follicular lymphoma changes into a faster-growing, more aggressive type of lymphoma such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This only happens in 2-3 cases out of every 100. CAR T-cell therapy has also been approved for the treatment of follicular lymphoma that has relapsed or has not responded to at least two previous lines of therapy.",
        "Doctors don’t yet use CAR T-cell therapy as a first-line treatment. But if your cancer hasn’t responded to two systemic therapies (treatments that go through your bloodstream) first, it may be the next logical step."
