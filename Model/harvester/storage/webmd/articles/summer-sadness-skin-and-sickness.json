        "And I only preface the feeling of summer and sadness and skin and sickness with this abstractness -- with this sense of having a body in theory -- to understand the things I noticed. Because I have been back home for a good 2 to 3 months and come face to face with my eczema triggers. A change in weather, extreme changes in weather, very fragrant scents, chafing in the most unbearable heat known to man, summers without chill, grass sometimes. These are details I’ve accumulated over the years. I’ve known this because I live here.",
        "But now, I’ve experienced heat exhaustion and succumbed to a cold during the summer, and I have a rash around my eyes because my baby sister palmed my face with Nutella on her hands. I hate being sick and I’m allergic to hazelnut chocolate, among other things. The learning curve between what constitutes a rash as eczema and what is just an allergic reaction was a huge gap. Now it’s a parabola, a Venn diagram, some scientific term that requires a hypothesis and now I have cause for research."

I’m feeling all kinds of things: the readiness to leave home because I have been here for far too long, which contrasts with my unpreparedness for equal measure. My summer months are long -- longer than what’s to be expected of a usual academic calendar (thank you, art college!), but that also lends itself to a disproportionate amount of time where I am doing, quite literally, nothing.",

The one thing you have to account for during the long summers is all the time you have to dedicate to yourself. I’m not traveling or going somewhere every day. My professional job is remote, and my familial job feels like something akin to house arrest. This is to say that I am not (often) alone. The case is that I’m constantly nowhere."

        "Most people experience waves of sadness -- or seasonal depression -- during winter. The cold seasons have long nights. Less exposure to sunlight and watching as the sun sets before you’re ready is enough to affect the mood of anyone. But the summer is when it gets harder for me, mentally and physically, because it doesn’t feel like I have much control over my skin.",
        "Controlling flare-ups in a state of excessive heat advisory is for some reason harder than I remember. Is it because I’m older? Because having heat exhaustion once has changed the way my body reacts to the state-mandated weather I’ve been living in for 8 years? I’ve always known that hot weather proves itself a discomfort for skin conditions. Itching sweaty skin just feels sickly. Rotting in the heat without any kind of relief (or without an AC) is just as bad.",
