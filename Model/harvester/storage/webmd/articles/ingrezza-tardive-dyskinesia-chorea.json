        "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a condition that causes stiff, jerky movements that you cannot control and can affect your face and body. Certain medicines, such as antipsychotics or medicines for your stomach, can increase your chances of developing TD.",
        "Chorea is a movement disorder caused by a hereditary condition called Huntington’s disease . Chorea can cause uncontrolled movements of the hands, feet, and face. A hereditary condition is a condition that is passed down from your parents. Huntington’s disease causes nerve cells in the brain to break down and cause thinking, emotional, and movement problems. Ingrezza helps manage uncontrolled movement due to chorea. It does not treat other symptoms of Huntington’s disease.",
        "Ingrezza works to regulate the amount of dopamine signaling in your brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that sends chemical messages between the cells in your brain and helps to control movement. Too much dopamine signaling in the brain is believed to cause uncontrolled movement. Ingrezza targets a protein called vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), which helps to release dopamine. This in turn reduces dopamine signaling and causes fewer uncontrolled movements."
