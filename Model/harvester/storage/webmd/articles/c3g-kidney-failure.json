        "When you have complement 3 (C3) glomerulopathy, a problem with your immune system can damage your kidneys. You’ll take medicine to control your immune system and protect your kidneys. But eventually, about half of people with this condition develop end-stage renal disease. Your kidneys remove wastes and extra fluid from your blood. These two bean-shaped organs also help control your blood pressure and make important hormones. Kidney failure is when your kidneys don't work well enough to do these jobs. It's a serious condition because wastes and fluid build up in your body and cause all sorts of problems. You can still live an active, normal life with kidney failure. But you will need treatment to take over the jobs your kidneys used to do."

Hemodialysis filters your blood through a machine called a dialyzer. You can get this treatment at a dialysis center or hospital about three times a week, or you can do it at home more frequently. During each hemodialysis treatment, your blood flows into the machine through a soft tube placed into a blood vessel in your arm. The blood goes into a filter before returning to the body. A solution inside the machine called dialysate contains water, salt, and other substances that pull wastes out of your blood. Blood cells, protein, and other things you need go back into your body. The whole process takes about 4 hours if you are doing it at a center. Home treatments can be shorter and more frequent."
