        "Primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a kidney disease that happens when an antibody, called IgA, builds up in the kidneys. This can make your kidneys swell and not work well. The kidneys become scarred and damaged, leading to kidney failure. IgAN is a long-term (chronic) disease, so your health care provider will help manage symptoms through blood pressure control, changes in your diet, and medicines like immunosuppressants and corticosteroids. Tarpeyo is a corticosteroid medicine that helps protect kidney function. It is the only FDA-approved medicine to work directly where the IgA is formed."

        "Kidney disease from IgAN starts when the body creates abnormal IgA antibodies (IgA1). Antibodies are made by your immune system. When they are normal, they help your immune system protect you from bacteria and viruses. When the IgA antibodies are abnormal, like in IgAN, they stick together, forming larger groups. The immune system sees these groups as foreign, causing inflammation in the kidney. Over time, the inflammation scars the filtering units in the kidneys, called glomeruli. This kidney damage allows blood and proteins to leak into your pee (urine). Over time, this damage can lead to kidney failure, requiring dialysis or kidney transplant."
