Cassava is a native vegetable of South America and grows in tropical and subtropical regions. It's a source of daily nutrition for millions of people around the globe and has become a popular swap for wheat flour in gluten-free baking. You can find tapioca starch (also called tapioca flour) in the gluten-free section of grocery and health food stores.",
