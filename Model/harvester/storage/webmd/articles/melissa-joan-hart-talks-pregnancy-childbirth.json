Last April, she and her husband Mark Wilkerson announced they were expecting their third child. Hart talked to WebMD the Magazine about how the third pregnancy is different, whether she wants to know the baby's gender, and how her two young sons feel about their new sibling.",
        "You're mom to Mason, 6, and Braydon, 4. How is pregnancy with baby No. 3 different?",
        "I was pretty scared the first two times. I'm not as scared this time around, which is a relief. I'm so excited. And somehow, I'm much more secure that we can handle it.",
        "You're in your third trimester -- how are you feeling?",
        "I can't complain because I've had totally healthy pregnancies every time, but I'm just massively uncomfortable. This one is a little bit more hormonal. There was a lot more nausea in the beginning. I got really big really quickly. At three months I felt like I was in my ninth month."
