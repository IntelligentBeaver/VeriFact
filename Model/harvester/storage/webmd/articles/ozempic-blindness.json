        "Ozempic blindness isn’t a real diagnosis. It’s a nickname used to describe sudden vision loss that may be linked to the weight loss drugs semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound).",
        "The main concern is a rare, serious condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). It can cause permanent vision loss, ranging from mild to severe.",
        "Talk to your doctor right away if you take Ozempic or other weight loss drugs and notice changes in your vision. (Photo Credit: iStock/Getty Images)",
        "NAION isn’t new. But it’s getting more attention because some people on GLP-1 drugs developed the condition. The numbers are small, but a few recent studies show a possible connection.",
        "Experts say the exact amount of risk isn't known, though it's very low. But there's reason for concern. In one small study, 7 out of 9 people who developed vision problems while taking semaglutide or tirzepatide were diagnosed with NAION. Other research found a slightly higher rate of NAION in people using semaglutide, both for type 2 diabetes and weight loss.",
        "These studies show a possible link between the drugs and vision loss. “They found that the two are related, but that doesn’t mean we understand why,” says Vicente Diaz, MD, Yale Medicine ophthalmologist and assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual science at Yale School of Medicine.",
        "Experts still think most people should take the drugs if needed. The chance of vision loss is very small. And since they may lower your risk of heart disease and other life-threatening conditions, “it makes sense to keep the recommendations as they are,” Diaz says."
