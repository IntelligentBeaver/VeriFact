If using a spray, avoid the face and spray each arm, each leg, and the trunk evenly, making sure the skin is evenly coated. Apply it to the front of the body then the back of the body, making sure to get the sides of the body too. Always remember to apply it under swim suit straps because they have a tendency to move around during swimming and other activities. Areas that are often missed include the scalp -- especially the area where you part your hair -- and the tops and backs of ears , feet , and neck. So don’t forget them."
