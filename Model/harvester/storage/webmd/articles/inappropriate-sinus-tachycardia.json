        "Sinus tachycardia is when your body sends out electrical signals to make your heart beat faster. Hard exercise , anxiety , certain drugs, or a fever can spark it. When it happens without any clear reason, it’s called inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST).",
        "Your heart rate might shoot up with just a little movement or stress. It might be high even when you’re doing nothing. IST is most common in women and people assigned female at birth who are in their 30s. Symptoms can last for months or years. You might not notice it at first.",
        "As a general rule, you can be diagnosed with IST if your heart beats more than 100 times a minute when you are at rest or an average of at least 90 times a minute throughout the day.",
        "While a racing heart beat with no clear cause can be unsettling, it's rarely the sign of a serious health threat. Still, it's important to get it checked out if it happens a lot. (Photo Credit: DigitalVision/Getty Images)",
        "Inappropriate sinus tachycardia vs. POTS",
        "Another condition that can cause spikes in your heart rate is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). The biggest difference between POTS and IST is that people with POTS get symptoms only when they stand up, while people with IST can have a racing heart while sitting, lying down, or standing. In both conditions, a fast heart rate can start even if you're not moving much."
