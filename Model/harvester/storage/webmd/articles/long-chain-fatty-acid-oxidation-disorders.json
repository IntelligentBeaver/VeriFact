        "Long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAODs) are a group of rare inherited conditions that affect metabolism, or how your body converts food into energy. Fatty acids are made from chains of carbon atoms, and long-chain fatty acids have at least 14 carbon atoms. They're in foods like olive oil, fish, avocado, and meat.",
        "People born with LC-FAODs are missing an enzyme that their body needs to break down long-chain fatty acids into energy. As a result, their body doesn't make enough energy to power organs like their heart, muscles, and liver. When fatty acids aren't broken down, they build up in organs and damage them.",
        "LC-FAODs can lead to serious complications like muscle damage, liver failure, severely low blood sugar, high levels of ammonia in the blood, and heart muscle disease. Early diagnosis and dietary changes are essential to managing these conditions."
