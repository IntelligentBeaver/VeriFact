        "Kidney stones are hard, pebble-like masses or crystals that can form inside your kidneys . They can result from the minerals and salts that are dissolved in your pee, especially if you haven't been drinking enough water. You might hear your doctor call them renal calculi, nephrolithiasis, or urolithiasis.",

People who are assigned male at birth (AMAB) have about double the risk of developing them as people who are assigned female at birth (AFAB). People who are AMAB and in their 30s-40s are most likely to get them. They also seem to be more common in non-Hispanic white people.",

        "The most common symptom is sharp flank pain , which is pain between your lower ribs and hip on the same side you have the stone. The pain may spread to your lower back, belly, or groin. Your doctor might refer to this symptom as renal colic. This is pain that happens when a stone has moved out of your kidneys and into your urinary tract, where it's gotten stuck. Depending on the size of the stone and where it's stuck, your pain may be mild or severe. The pain may come in waves or range in severity. It may hurt when you pee if the stone has made it further down into your urethra before getting stuck."

You may or may not have symptoms. If you do, the most common symptom is flank pain, which can be severe. Most kidney stones pass on their own, but if they don't, your doctor can use a few techniques to help break up the stones so you can pass them more easily. One of the best ways to prevent stones is to drink enough water every day."
