While the shoe should have some bend, the front shouldn't be able to touch the back of the shoe. Make sure it's well made. While this can be a little trickier, one test is to make sure that you can take the insole – the layer of material that rests against the bottom of your foot inside your shoe – out. \"Poorly made shoes often don't have insoles, or glue them in the shoe,\" Parthasarathy says. Don't rely on just size. \"You may be a size 7½ in one shoe brand, a size 8 in another,\" Parthasarathy says. You should be able to wiggle your toes in the shoe, and still feel like you have enough room. \"There should also be about a thumb's width between your longest toe and the edge of the shoe,\" Parthasarathy says."

        "Think about what workouts you do, and pair your shoes accordingly. While a cross training sneaker may be OK for general exercise, they don't provide enough support if your main activity is a specific sport like running, basketball, or cycling. Running shoes, for example, provide heel cushioning and toe flexibility for maximum support, while walking shoes have a shock absorbing heel and are flexible at the ball of the foot. Opt for laces rather than slip-ons. Laces help to hold your foot in place so it doesn't slip and slide inside your shoe. \"Oftentimes, slip-on shoes tend to be lighter and don't provide as much support,\" Peden says. He also recommends that you avoid ballet flats and flip-flops, both of which offer little arch support and cushioning. Pick thicker heels. It's OK to wear heels, but try to reserve them for short periods of time, like going out to dinner or a special event, Parthasarathy says. Try to steer clear of those stilettos and opt for a wedge heel that's under 3 inches, she says. \"Platform-style heels are in style now, which is great because they help to take pressure off of the ball of your foot,\" Parthasarathy says. Ankle straps provide extra support, too. Don't cut costs. It's better to have two to three pairs of good-quality shoes, rather than many cheap ones, Peden says. \"The more expensive the shoe, the higher-quality materials, and the better it will hold up,\" he says. \"The salespeople at these stores are also more likely to know how to measure your feet correctly, to ensure you don't buy a shoe that's the wrong size or doesn't provide enough support.\""

          "text": "Not all foot pain is created equal. The type of shoe you need may depend on your foot injury or foot condition, Peden says. But here are some general guidelines. Flat feet. Flat feet are very common – some studies show that over a third of people have them. \"People with flat feet need more shoe support than others,\" Peden says. Look for a shoe with a thick, stiff sole and good arch support. \"Shoelaces are a good idea, to help hold your foot in place and provide more support,\" he says. High arches. About half of us have high arched feet. \"High arched feet are less flexible, so they are more prone to certain injuries, like stress fractures,\" Peden says. \"You want a shoe that's relatively neutral, which means that it has little support in the arch but more cushioning in the heel. This helps to take pressure off of the arch of your foot.\" Plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis happens when the plantar fascia , the strong band of tissue that supports your foot arch, gets irritated and inflamed. \"You want a thick, stiff sole that still has a lot of cushion in it,\" Cody says. \"The shoe shouldn't be able to bend too much, but it should still feel very comfortable and cushioned when you walk in it.\"",

        "This condition, where the large tendon that runs down the back of your lower leg becomes inflamed, can cause heel pain. Look for a shoe with a cushioned heel that places it higher than the ball of your foot, Peden says. \"This will reduce tension on your Achilles tendon when you walk,\" he says. These are painful, bony bumps that develop at your big toe joint . \"This usually happens due to shoe irritation, usually a tight toe box,\" Cody says. She recommended that you look for a shoe with a wide toe box, good arch support, and plenty of cushioning. \"Ideally, there will be soft, flexible material over the toe box to ease pressure on your bunion ,\" she says. Morton's neuroma. Morton's neuroma is a thickening of nerve tissue that can develop between your third and fourth toes. It can cause pain at the ball of your foot, as if you stepped on a marble. Look for a thick, stiff shoe with a rounded bottom to take stress off of the sole of your foot, Cody says. Some shoes also provide metatarsal support, which helps to take stress off of the neuroma, she says."
