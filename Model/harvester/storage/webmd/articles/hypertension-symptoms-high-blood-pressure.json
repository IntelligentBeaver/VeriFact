Most people with high blood pressure don't have any symptoms until it's severe. Instead of relying on symptoms to alert you, have your blood pressure checked regularly. You may want to learn how to monitor your blood pressure at home. If you do experience symptoms such as headaches or nosebleeds and your BP reading is above 180/120, you could be having a hypertensive crisis. That's a medical emergency. Wait 5 minutes, double-check your blood pressure reading, and if it's still extremely high, call 911."
