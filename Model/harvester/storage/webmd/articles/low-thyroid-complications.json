It makes hormones that control your metabolism , the process that turns food into energy. It also has a hand in just about every other function in your body. Brain, muscles, digestion -- your thyroid makes them all run smoothly.",
        "When you don’t have enough thyroid hormone, a condition called hypothyroidism or low thyroid, your system slows down. Over time, you might forget things, feel cold, tired , or depressed, or you may put on a few pounds -- though most weight gain isn’t due to a sluggish thyroid.",

Man-made thyroid hormone works just like your own and can help get your body back on track. But if low levels aren't treated -- or you stop taking the medicine -- other conditions may pop up."
