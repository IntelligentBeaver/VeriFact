        "The Japanese beetle ( Popillia japonica ) is a type of scarab beetle native to northern Japan. It came to the U.S. in the early 1900s, likely through the soil that came with imported plants. Since then, the Japanese beetle has spread throughout much of the Eastern and Central U.S., reaching just past the Mississippi River.",
        "The invasive Japanese beetle is destructive and very tough to manage. (Photo Credit: Framed1/Dreamstime)",
        "Are Japanese beetles invasive?",
        "Yes. In the U.S., they're an invasive pest that can damage crops, landscape plants, and lawns. They're very difficult and costly to control.",
        "What does the Japanese beetle look like?",
        "Japanese beetles have shiny, metallic green bodies and six legs. Adults are about 1/2 inch long. The tips of their antennae (feelers) can open like a fan. Along each side of their bodies, under the wing shields, Japanese beetles have tiny patches of white hair that look like spots or stripes from a distance. This helps distinguish them from other beetles.",
        "Young Japanese beetles are called larvae or grubs. Their bodies are about an inch long and curled into a C shape. Japanese beetle larvae have brown heads, white bodies, and six legs."
