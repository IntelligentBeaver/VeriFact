        "If you have type 2 diabetes and take multiple insulin shots, you may want to ask your doctor about the insulin pump.",
        "Insulin pumps are small, computerized devices (about the size of a small cell phone) that allow for a continuous flow of rapid-acting insulin to be released into your body. The pumps have a small, flexible tube (called a catheter ) with a fine needle on the end, which is inserted under the skin of your abdomen and taped in place. The devices can be worn on a belt or placed in a pocket.",
        "The insulin pump is designed to deliver a continuous amount of insulin, 24 hours a day according to a programmed plan unique to each pump wearer. The user can change the amount of insulin delivered.",
        "Between meals and overnights, a small amount of insulin is constantly delivered to keep the blood sugar in the target range. This is called the basal rate. When food is eaten, a bolus dose of insulin can be programmed into the pump. You can measure how much of a bolus you need using calculations based on the grams of carbohydrates consumed.",
        "When using an insulin pump, you must monitor your blood glucose level at least four times a day. You set the doses of your insulin and make adjustments to the dose depending on your food intake and exercise program."
