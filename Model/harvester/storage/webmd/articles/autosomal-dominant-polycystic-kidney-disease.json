        "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) causes a lot of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, to grow in your kidneys . The cysts keep your kidneys from working as they should. That can cause health problems like high blood pressure, infections, and kidney stones. It can also cause kidney failure, although that doesn't happen to everyone.",
        "You can have ADPKD and not know it for many years. It’s often called “adult PKD,” because the symptoms don't usually appear until people reach ages 30 to 40.",
        "Over time, ADPKD can start to damage your kidneys.",
        "You can slow the damage and prevent some of the complications by making healthy habits (especially those that help you lower and then maintain your blood pressure ) part of your life and taking medications as necessary. Depending on the type of ADPKD you have, you can lead an active life for many years by managing your symptoms and working with your doctor. There’s not a cure, but scientists are doing research to look for new treatments."
