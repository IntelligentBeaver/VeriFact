        "When you have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), you need to take extra care with what and how you eat. The condition means your pancreas doesn’t make enough of the enzymes you need to properly break down the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in your food. You may not get enough nutrients. But it is possible for you to eat and feel well when you have EPI. Work with a dietitian so you can know exactly how to get proper nutrition in your meals and snacks without making your symptoms worse. And keep a few basic tips in mind. With EPI, it may be hard to make yourself eat, much less sit down for three big meals a day. Try eating a little at a time five or six times a day. It can help you feel more comfortable. Stick with a low-fat diet. Your body has an especially tough time digesting fat, so you need to avoid getting too much. It’s especially important to avoid saturated and trans fats. In general, you shouldn’t eat more than 20 grams of fat each day or more than 10 grams of fat at one meal. Find ways to cut it out of your diet, like eating grilled or baked foods instead of fried, using cooking spray instead of oil or butter, and choosing low-fat or fat-free dairy."
