        "A dentigerous cyst , also called a follicular cyst, is the second most common type of jaw (odontogenic) cyst. It's a fluid-filled sac that develops in your jawbone over a tooth. The cyst forms around the crown of an unerupted or impacted tooth. In fact, the term \"dentigerous\" means \"containing a tooth.\"",
        "Your dentigerous cyst looks like a dark circle near your tooth on the X-ray. You may also see a faint, white semicircle around the outer border of your cyst. (Photo Credit: Coronation Dental Specialty Group/Wikipedia)",
        "Dentigerous cysts can happen anytime, anywhere. But they're usually found between 10 and 30 years of age. That's because almost three-quarters of dentigerous cysts happen over an impacted, bottom wisdom tooth. And about a quarter happen over an upper wisdom tooth that's impacted.",
        "If you get a dentigerous cyst, it's usually on one side. Cysts on both sides are very rare. The fluid sac forms around the trapped tooth in your jawbone. The cyst balloons out from the neck of the tooth (where the top of the tooth meets the root).",
        "On an X-ray, the fluid appears like a dark, irregular-shaped bubble with a faint white line. This fluid can sometimes press on the nerves (roots) of other teeth. The noncancerous cyst is usually mild. And with treatment, you can avoid complications. Learn more about dentigerous cyst symptoms, the causes, and how your dentist treats these jaw cysts."
