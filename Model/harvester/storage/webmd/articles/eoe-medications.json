        "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a rare inflammatory disease of the esophagus , the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. If you have EoE, a type of white blood cell known as an eosinophil builds up in your esophagus, causing injury and inflammation . This may make it hard for you to eat and swallow. EoE can make it hard for kids to get proper nutrition and lead to poor growth. It can also cause chronic pain . While there’s no cure for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), there are several medications doctors prescribe to control symptoms, ease inflammation, and prevent further damage. These often work best if they’re used along with dietary changes to avoid foods that may worsen the condition. Here’s a look at what’s available, as well as a peek into what treatments may emerge in the future. These are often the first medications doctors use to treat EoE. Their main use is to keep stomach acid out of the esophagus in people who have acid reflux , but they can also reduce inflammation. This may be because the disease is similar to reflux – or often comes along with it."

        "To start, you’ll take a full dose of a PPI once a day for 8 weeks. If your symptoms aren’t better after about a month, you take a full dose twice a day. When 2 months are up, your doctor will check again to see if your symptoms have improved. The doctor may do a follow-up test called an upper endoscopy to check the number of eosinophils and the level of inflammation. They’ll use a camera on the end of a long tube to take a look at the inside of your esophagus. Or they may just ask you about your symptoms to decide if the PPIs have worked. Most of the time, if you feel like you’ve improved, your doctor will continue the PPI at the lowest dose possible to control your symptoms. These meds help control the inflammation that may worsen the condition. Most patients respond well to this treatment."

People usually take about four to eight sprays over the course of the day."

In studies, about 60% percent of people with EoE who took it responded to treatment. It led to a significant reduction in common EoE symptoms like trouble swallowing.
