        "Anyone that I have ever met with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has spoken about how traumatic it was during their search for a diagnosis. I don’t think I know a single person who did not have a delayed diagnosis due to something that the medical profession missed or wasn’t educated about. Everyone that I have met in my AS community has had to wait 5 to 10 years or more from their first symptoms to finally getting the AS diagnosis. I have to ask myself why that is. AS is not a new disease and has a long history, but it still eludes the medical community and delays diagnosis for many people.",
        "When we think of AS, we think of all those people who go to the doctor first with back pain caused by inflammation of the spine. The medical community delays referring these patients to rheumatologists, and therefore under-diagnoses AS because the symptoms are not being recognized. The doctors, etc., are not looking at the AS-associated symptoms like uveitis, osteoporosis, and even peripheral arthritis aside from the main complaint of back pain."

        "The big question -- the main question – is: “How can they diagnose patients earlier?” Well, the delay of diagnosis is not just because of the symptoms being missed. The diagnostic methods used and when they are used also cause a delay. For a definitive AS diagnosis for many of the people I know, they needed to have the structural changes shown radiographically. The delay there occurred because those structural changes were not visible radiographically for years from their symptom onset.",
        "Although the criteria changed more recently, many doctors still do not know there has been a change. The medical profession was already behind in what they knew were AS-associated symptoms, and now, on top of that, the new criteria for diagnosis are not known. The concept of axial spondyloarthritis came about in recent years, and in my AS community, few of them have doctors who are familiar with that term. The new concept of axial spondyloarthritis was supposed to make it easier to diagnose people in the preliminary stages of AS. Finally, there was a criteria that included symptoms of AS without structural changes radiographically as well as those with the classic presentation of symptoms and radiographic changes of AS. Axial spondyloarthritis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis are now the “preferred” terms. Of course, the medical community seems to be slow to learn the terms and the new criteria. Discussing this in my AS community, most of their doctors do not use the updated terms. Most seem to still be slow to understand the early findings of AS and to know the AS-associated symptoms."

        "When I talk to my local AS community, which consists of mostly 40- to 50-year-olds and some older, we talk about how we all went through so many years of waiting and wondering what was wrong with us. Many of us had radiographic tests that did not show any structural changes that would have led to a diagnosis of AS years ago. Instead, as a community, the overall delay in diagnosis and treatment led to a lot of suffering. It was very traumatic to keep going from doctor to doctor and not finding out what is wrong with you and how to treat the pain, stiffness, and decreased mobility. Because this AS community suffered for 5 to 10 years or more before getting a diagnosis, there is an agreement that the stress awaiting a diagnosis was indeed traumatic. For many of us, the diagnosis was suggested by ophthalmologists due to our back pain and our having uveitis. It seems that if any of us had uveitis, there was more of a push to diagnose or to keep doing radiographic testing in hopes that at some point there would be some structural change radiographically. I personally have been diagnosed with uveitis many times. I was first diagnosed at 20. I have a sibling who also has had uveitis many times, so we were both watched carefully by our doctors."

All of us have struggled with weakness and numbness in our legs that got worse over time. All of us have had sciatic pain on both sides of the body. Some of us have had psoriasis. Most of us have dealt with inflammatory bowel disease -- pain, cramping, swelling of our bellies, diarrhea, and fatigue."

I can say from my own history, I have had so much pain that I have endured. I have been ignored, treated like a liar, treated like my pain was likely from something else, etc. In my first stages of pain, I was treated like it was all in my head. There was no radiographic proof of the pain that I was experiencing. The treatment that I endured should have never happened. I now have medical PTSD due to what I went through on my road to a diagnosis. I was sent to a neurologist who performed an MRI on my brain to rule out MS lesions.",
        "When I had no lesions, he sent me to psychiatry due to depression. He told me that I had depression that was making me believe I was in pain. I was given antidepressants to which I had a reaction, and I was then diagnosed with bipolar disorder because of my reaction to the antidepressants. I was put on antipsychotics and was still not doing better. The psychiatrist went as far as to order electroconvulsive therapy. I received it five times. I was doing so poorly that I ended up in a psych hospital on suicide watch. This was the most traumatic experience that I went through because when we moved to another state and I was no longer taking any psych meds, I felt better mentally. My head was finally clear. But I had intense pain in my lower back and legs. I was suffering from pain in my sacroiliac area, but there was no radiographic proof that there were no structural changes. I later had uveitis, and the ophthalmologist noticed that it wasn’t the first time. I had it many times. He referred me to rheumatology. I was well on my way to a diagnosis, but it was still another 5 years from that moment that I was diagnosed with AS. I finally started showing changes radiographically."
