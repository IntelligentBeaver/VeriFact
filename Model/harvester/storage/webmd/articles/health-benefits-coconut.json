        "A coconut is the fruit of the coconut tree. The coconut has three layers. The outermost layer, usually smooth and green in color, is called the exocarp. The next layer is a husk with fibers called the mesocarp. The inner layer, called the endocarp, is hard and brown with three spots or \"eyes\" on the shell. In the U.S., only the endocarp is sold in grocery stores. It takes 11-12 months for a coconut to fully mature into an endocarp.",
