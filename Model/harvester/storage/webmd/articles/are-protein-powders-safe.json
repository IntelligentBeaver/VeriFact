        "There’s so much hype around protein to help lose weight and build muscle, it’s easy to see why people turn to powders to bulk up their morning smoothies and shakes. I’ve tried a few protein powders over the years myself. While they can be a convenient way to boost nutrition, it’s important to consider the potential drawbacks before using them.",
        "Industry experts and nutritionists have debated the overall safety of protein powders for years (F-Factor 20/20 Fiber/Protein Powder being the most recent product to come under scrutiny ). A 2018 report from a nonprofit called Clean Label Project found heavy metals like arsenic and lead in many leading protein powders. Plant-based powders had more contamination than those with whey and egg protein, and organic powders actually had higher levels of contamination than conventional. (It’s important to note that the Clean Label Project sells “approved” products from their site.) Tests done in 2010 by Consumer Reports showed similar results."

        "Know the facts about supplements. Many protein powders are considered supplements, which aren’t regulated in the same way that foods and drugs are. According to the FDA , they don’t have to be proven safe before they’re marketed. Supplements also don’t have to prove they contain what they claim, and it’s up to consumers to raise red flags about adverse effects. It’s also up to companies to handle and address those complaints when they get them. (Consumers can also report complaints about any supplement directly to the FDA .)",
        "Read the ingredients. Be sure you note not only the protein source (such as whey, egg, or pea protein), but also the other ingredients to make sure you aren't sensitive to any of them. Some have a lengthy list including non-nutritive sweeteners like stevia and monk fruit or added fiber like inulin that can cause gas and bloating in some people."
