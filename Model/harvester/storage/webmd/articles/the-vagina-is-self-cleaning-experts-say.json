With these products being sold at major US retailers – like Amazon, Target and Ulta Beauty – experts like Adams and Irobunda are bringing opposing views on just how safe, effective, and necessary these sweet-as-candy supplements are in getting your vagina in its \"most favorable state” – a controversial earmark in itself."
