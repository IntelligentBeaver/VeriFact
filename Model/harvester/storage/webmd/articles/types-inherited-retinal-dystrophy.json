        "Your retina is the lining that covers the inner wall of the back of your eye. The cells in your retina are sensitive to light. They send signals to your brain so you can see. When you have an inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD), a mutation in your genes changes the way your retina is able to work. While these disorders are considered to be rare, there are many different kinds. “‘Retinal dystrophy’ is a big term that encompasses possibly hundreds of different types of conditions and subcategories of conditions,\" says Mandeep Singh, MD, PhD, retinal specialist and co-director of the Wilmer Eye Institute Genetic Eye Diseases (GEDi) Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. Different types of IRDs show up at different ages and cause different types of symptoms. But all IRDs cause symptoms that affect your sight. Some IRDs can even cause symptoms in other places in your body. These are called syndromic retinal dystrophies. Most IRDs are degenerative, meaning they get worse over time."

        "Retinitis pigmentosa. This is the most common group of IRD conditions. More than 1 in 3,000 people have them. The genetic mutation that causes retinitis pigmentosa happens in the rod cells of your eyes. “Rod cells are active when you need vision in low light, like at nighttime or in a dim restaurant or movie theater,” Singh says. That’s why the most common symptom involves trouble with your night vision, he says. In addition, you might lose your peripheral (side), central, or color vision. There are more than 100 genes that can cause retinitis pigmentosa, so doctors don’t use one single treatment for it. If your retinas are swollen, you may need medicated eye drops . Surgery can help with cataracts you may get. Specialists can help you with devices and tools to help you function with low vision. Vitamin A may help with some forms, although you may need genetic testing to confirm you have retinitis pigmentosa before you try this treatment, since it can make other forms of IRD worse. Stargardt disease. Symptoms of Stargardt disease usually show up in childhood. This condition affects a specific part of your retina called the macula. Your macula is what helps you have sharp central vision. A mutation in a gene called ABCA4 causes fatty buildup around your macula, affecting how well you see."

There aren’t any treatments for Stargardt disease yet, but you can slow down your vision loss if you take steps like avoiding vitamin A and secondhand smoke. “Sunglasses and avoidance of very bright lights is also helpful since it’s common to have a difficult time adjusting to bright-light environments,” says Jose S.

You can also use magnifying devices to help you see fine print or other detailed objects.

It helps you understand more about your disease and make choices with respect to your family and their personal health.”"

The therapy can help improve eyesight in people with LCA2. Only 6% of people with LCA have this type."
