          "text": "Experts recommend that you tell your children what’s going on in simple terms. Focus only on what they need to know. By talking to them, you will make it easier for them to talk to you and get the help they need to cope with your diagnosis. You may want to seek counseling for yourself and other members of your family, including your children. After any cancer diagnosis , it helps to keep the lines of communication open so that your loved ones can support you and get the support they also will need. It often helps to talk to other people who are in a similar situation and can help you feel less alone. At the same time, keep in mind that what helps you cope may be different from what works for someone else. Be patient with yourself as you work through this difficult time. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.",
