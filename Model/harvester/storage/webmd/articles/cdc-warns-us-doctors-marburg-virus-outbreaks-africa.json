        "April 7, 2023 – The CDC  has issued a health advisory about an outbreak of the Marburg virus disease in two African nations, Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania. While it has not been found in the United States, doctors \"should be aware of the potential for imported cases,” the agency warned.",
        "Infection from the virus is rare but can be fatal. If U.S. health officials think somebody is infected with the Marburg virus, they should check the person’s travel history and isolate the person until a negative test comes back, the CDC said.",

        "The illness is spread through contact with blood and other bodily fluids of an infected person, not through the air. It has a mortality rate of 23% to 90%, though these rates may go down with intensive supportive care, according to the CDC."
