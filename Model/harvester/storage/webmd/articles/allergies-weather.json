        "If you have seasonal allergies, you might have noticed that your symptoms get worse – or better – depending on the weather. That runny nose , congestion, and sneezing are a reaction to things like pollens, molds, and dust. You might come across more of them depending on what’s happening outside. “Weather can impact seasonal allergies by the way it affects the spread of allergens,” says Michele Pham, MD, an allergist and immunologist at University of California San Francisco Health. “The weather also changes the way we behave, so that can affect our exposure level to allergens as well.”"

Similarly, humidity can make dust and mold worse. But it can also keep pollen weighed down and on the ground. Dry weather without rain can mean higher pollen counts as allergens blow around. Weather also affects the severity of the next allergy season. A wet and rainy fall and winter can lead to more pollination in the spring and summer, Ziaie says."
