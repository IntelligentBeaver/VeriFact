Compared to the options of over-the-counter allergy medications , such as nasal corticosteroid sprays and antihistamines, which only provide symptomatic relief, and immunotherapy treatments that can require regular visits to the allergist, honey can seem appealing.

        "Local honey as a treatment “sounds good in theory. It sounds kind of scientific-y,” says Zachary Rubin, MD, an allergist in the Chicago area and a spokesperson for the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. It’s even pitched as a riff on the very real medical practice of allergy immunotherapy. Patients who ask him about the strategy, Rubin says, generally believe that because honey contains pollen, eating a bit every single day as a series of “tiny little exposures” will, over months, train the body to become desensitized to the allergen."

Allergy immunotherapy has a low rate of follow-through, given that a full course of treatment can take 3 years. But it also has a high success rate. Research shows that 90% of people who receive some form of allergy immunotherapy see significant improvement, and the results can last nearly a decade. You can even be treated for a truly personalized collection of pollens.",
