        "HypoPT can be genetic or brought on by things that occur later in life, such as neck or thyroid surgery. It can also happen when you have certain autoimmune disorders like Addison’s disease or pernicious anemia , which results from lower levels of hormones from the adrenal glands. People of all ages are at risk for hypoPT. But the leading cause is surgery complications, which typically occur in adults. Here are a few of the main causes of hypoPT. Genetics. Genetics only play a role in about 10% of hypoPT cases, but you may have it if you were born without parathyroid glands. Without these, your body cannot make PTH  hormones, leading to many other problems later in life. Surgery. If you developed hypoPT from neck or thyroid surgery, you are among the roughly 75% of people who have hypoPT. Fortunately, most of these cases don’t last forever and can recovery can happen within days or months; less commonly, permanent damage to the parathyroid glands after surgery can occur. Radiation treatment to the neck for conditions like cancer can also damage the parathyroid glands in rare situations. Autoimmunity. Your immune system may mistakenly attack the parathyroid glands and  damage them permanently  This is known as polyglandular autoimmune syndrome. Magnesium deficiency. One other way you can develop hypoPT is through lower magnesium levels in your blood. The good thing about this condition is that the disease can go away once your body gets enough magnesium back in the bloodstream."
