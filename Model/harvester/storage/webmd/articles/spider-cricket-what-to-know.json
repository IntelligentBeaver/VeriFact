        "The spider cricket is a common American pest. This insect gets its name from its spindly, spider-like legs, but it’s not a true spider. This pest typically lives in caves and forests, but it can invade dark and damp indoor spaces. Inside, it may munch on cardboard, fabric, and other items. Here’s what you need to know about spider cricket traits, why they may be attracted to your home, and how to get rid of them."
