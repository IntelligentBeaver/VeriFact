        "Take advantage of your most energetic time of day to get exercise in. Not only is it good for overall health, but a brisk walk, bike ride, swim, or other aerobic activity can help reduce feelings of fatigue and boost your energy reserves. Don’t rely on caffeine as a crutch for tired times, either. Caffeine can disrupt nighttime sleep, robbing you of the rest you need."
