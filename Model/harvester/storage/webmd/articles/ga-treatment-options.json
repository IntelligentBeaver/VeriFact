        "Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced type of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye condition that can cause the loss of your central vision. It’s sometimes called the “dry” version of AMD. GA occurs when a part of your retina – the macula – grows thinner and loses its ability to function. It’s most common in people older than 60. Age-related macular degeneration is the No. 1 cause of vision loss among older people. The loss of central vision can make it hard to see what’s in front of you. It can affect your ability to drive, read, watch television, or even recognize faces, but it virtually never causes total blindness. GA typically affects both eyes (known as bilateral GA) though you can get it in only one. There is no cure for this condition, but there are treatment options that can slow progression."

        "One of the newer treatments for geographic atrophy is light therapy, also called photobiomodulation. Light therapy was tested in clinical trials on people with early to intermediate dry AMD who didn’t have much vision loss yet. The Valeda Light Delivery System is one type of photobiomodulation device that can stimulate the cells in your eye to make more energy. Small parts of those cells – called mitochondria – generate energy. You’ll sit at a machine at your ophthalmologist’s office for this treatment. Special red and infrared lights shine into your eyes when they are open and closed. But the process is painless and you won’t need dilating drops either. Light therapy takes about four minutes per eye. Because the device doesn’t touch your eye, it’s called noninvasive. Photobiomodulation doesn’t typically affect your vision, and you can go back to normal activities right away, including driving."
