        "Eat for one. You need to add only about 300 calories a day to your diet, starting in the second trimester , according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). \"It's really not that much,\" says Anna Maria Siega-Riz, PhD, RD, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the University of North Carolina's Gillings School of Global Public Health.",
        "Take your vitamins . When you're pregnant, you need increased amounts of certain vitamins and minerals, such as folic acid and iron, says Siega-Riz. Prenatal supplements ensure you're getting the 400 to 800 micrograms of folic acid needed to help prevent neural tube birth defects like spina bifida , as well as extra iron for your increased blood volume."
