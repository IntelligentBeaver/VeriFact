Those assigned male at birth should have an HDL of 40 mg/dL or higher, while those assigned female at birth, 50 mg/dL or higher.",
            "How do I read my cholesterol test results? Cholesterol levels are measured by the amount of cholesterol in a unit of blood. In the U.S., this is the number of milligrams (mg) in a deciliter (dL) of blood. So an LDL level may look like 100 mg/dL on your test results.",
            "What is the normal range for HDL and LDL? The normal, or average, range for HDL is above 40 mg/dL for people who are assigned male at birth, and above 50 for those assigned female at birth. For all healthy adults, the average LDL range should be below 110 mg/dL.",
            "Is 7 a good cholesterol level? The number 7 for a cholesterol level would not be a measurement in mg/dL, used in the U.S., but it may be in a measurement used in other countries. Canada, for example, uses millimoles per liter, or mmol/L, for cholesterol tests. 7 mmol/L is a very high LDL level.",
