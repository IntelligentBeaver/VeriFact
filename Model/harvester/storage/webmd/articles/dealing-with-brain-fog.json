        "What was I saying? What am I looking for? What’s your name? What’s that called? Does this sound familiar? I bet you’ve been in this position before. It’s called brain fog or cog fog (cognitive fog). More than half of the people living with multiple sclerosis struggle with brain fog. It can affect many aspects of our lives.",
        "When cog fog strikes, you can feel embarrassed and frustrated when you lose your train of thought, or you can’t remember somebody’s name, or you can’t find the words to describe something you know very well, but the right words just won’t come out.",
        "Although there’s no current medical treatment for brain fog, aerobic exercise and a healthy diet are some of the ways to manage this common MS symptom. Fatigue and lack of sleep can trigger brain fog, so not overdoing it and napping throughout the day can help prevent it.",
        "Most MSers stop working or retire early, not because they can’t walk or move around, but because they can’t think, and they feel overwhelmed at work. Retaining information, learning new skills, using language, concentrating, calculating, processing, problem-solving, become more challenging over time. Especially during an MS exacerbation, cog fog is very likely to happen."

        "I was a medical interpreter for many years. My job depended on my memory 100%. Once I was diagnosed with MS and I was forced to stay away from work for 4 months to recover, my memory started to decline. Once I returned to work, it was like magic. I was sharp, on point, and I could think and process faster. It didn’t happen from one day to the next, but I could definitely see a big change in my cognitive functions.",
        "My point is that if we keep our brain “in check” or busy, we can overcome brain fog. Learning a new skill -- a new language, for instance -- challenges your brain to process and retain new information. It also requires that you associate images with the new words you’re learning to remember their meaning. This only can retrain areas of your brain in charge of memory."

I know, it’s easier said than done. Be wise and choose your battles.  Let others solve their own problems. The world won’t end if you take care of it tomorrow.",

It’s been researched and proven through imaging testing that breathing exercises done during a meditation session show positive changes in the brain. It releases the primary driver of the brain’s reward system, the “happy hormone” dopamine, in charge of feelings of well-being.",
        "Also, don’t saturate yourself with too many things to do, much less try to do them all at once. Try your best to organize your day by priorities. Do the most important things or the things that require immediate attention early during the day, when your levels of energy and alertness are higher. This way, if you forget to do something, at least it’s not one of the very important things."
