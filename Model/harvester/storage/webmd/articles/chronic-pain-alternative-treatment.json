        "For decades, Mary Sienkiewicz, now 42, could barely get out of bed in the morning because of the severe lower back pain that radiated down her legs. This past summer, however, she was able to Rollerblade through her hometown of Schererville, Ind.",
        "Sienkiewicz's pain, which she describes as a \"deep aching and weakness with pulsating and throbbing,\" began after a car accident in 1986. \"I lost my 20s and 30s because of this pain. If I ever did anything active, I suffered for three to four days afterward,\" says the financial planner, who recently returned to work after years of disability.",
