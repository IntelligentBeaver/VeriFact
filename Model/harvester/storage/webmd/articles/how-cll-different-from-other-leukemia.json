        "CLL and ALL begin in the bone marrow, where blood cells are usually made. Specifically, it starts in a type of bone marrow cell called lymphocytes.

Blood tests often show a higher number of white blood cells or lymphocytes than normal. You’ll likely get more tests to find out if this is leukemia. Two other types of leukemia — acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) — start in myeloid stem cells found in your bone marrow. This type of stem cell can change into: White blood cells like monocytes, granulocytes, and neutrophils Red blood cells, which carry oxygen Platelets, which form clots to help stop bleeding"

People with these types are usually very sick and need treatment right away. If, like most people with CLL, you have the slow-growing kind, you might not notice any symptoms for years. A routine blood test might be the first clue that something’s wrong. You may not need treatment right away. Your doctor will closely follow your health, of course.
