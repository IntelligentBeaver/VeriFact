In January 2021, one of those moments involved her daughter, now 4, who was scratched by a feral cat, raising concerns about tetanus . Her daughter had been bitten by a dog when she was just 1, and Simpson turned down advice then to get a tetanus shot . \"I was convinced the tetanus shot would kill her faster than the tetanus.\" After the cat incident, the anxiety was so exhausting, she listened to the nurse practitioner at the clinic, whom she trusted. The nurse gently reassured Simpson that the shot was less risky than the possibility of tetanus -- but did not bombard her with statistics -- and that won over Simpson and triggered an overall rethinking of her vaccine stance."
