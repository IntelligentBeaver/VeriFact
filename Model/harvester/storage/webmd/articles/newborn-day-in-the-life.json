They may make sucking motions, put their hands or fingers in their mouths, or you may notice that your baby turns their head toward you and opens their mouth if you gently stroke their cheek. Babies do cry when they want to eat, but it’s usually a late sign of hunger .",
        "Try to get your baby to burp during and after their feeding. If they stop eating and falls asleep, or turns their head away from the bottle, those are good signs they have had enough. If they cry toward the end, that may mean they are hungry for more. And keep the burp cloth handy -- most newborns spit up after feedings every once in a while."
