        "Voltaren gel belongs to a group of medicines called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) . When your body is injured, as with cartilage breakdown in your joints from osteoarthritis, it makes substances called prostaglandins that cause warmth, pain, and swelling. Voltaren gel works by blocking an enzyme called cyclooxygenase (COX). This enzyme helps make prostaglandins. There are two main types of this enzyme, COX-1 and COX-2. Voltaren gel blocks both of them. By reducing the activity of these enzymes, Voltaren gel lowers prostaglandin levels in the area where it is applied. This helps decrease pain and inflammation in the muscles, joints, or tissues beneath the skin to make the painful or swollen area feel better and move more comfortably. Unlike other topical medicines that seem to provide quick relief, it may take a few days before you start to feel relief from Voltaren gel."
