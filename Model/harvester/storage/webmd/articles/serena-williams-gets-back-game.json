Williams took home gold at the 2000 Sydney              Olympics for women's doubles (sharing the honor with her sister, tennis champ              Venus) and earned four straight Open titles (nicknamed the \"Serena Slam\") by              early 2004.",

She also suffered from a stress fracture to              her right ankle , which added more pressure to her knee, in 2005; in 2006, her              ranking fell from the top 100 for the first time in more than a decade."

        "Compared with some of her will-o'-the-wisp rivals, including her 125-pound              archnemesis, Belgian player Justine Henin, Williams is physically, well,              impressive. But does she get tired of having her fitness level questioned              simply because she has curves, strength, and mass? Does she suffer from weight              issues and insecurities like so many other American women? Or does Williams              view her body as a machine, something to be nourished and trained for maximum              performance?",

You always want              what you don't have.\" (This is the same woman who was once quoted as saying              that no matter what her weight, she'd have a large bosom and backside --              although admittedly, she described her backside with a less printable              word.)",
