        "A diagnosis of cancer is hard enough. But if you have lung cancer , you’re also likely to face lung cancer stigma. Stigma refers to disapproval or discrimination that’s based on your diagnosis. The main reason for the stigma surrounding lung cancer is that the disease often – but not always – is related to a person’s smoking history. More than 80% of lung cancers happen in people who smoke or smoked in the past. But that means about 20% happen in people who’ve never smoked.",
        "Whether you have a history of smoking or not, you're not responsible for your cancer and you don’t deserve it. But lung cancer stigma also is complicated. Even when others around you don’t blame you for the cancer, you may still feel it. One study found 95% of people with lung cancer face stigma. Stigma has even affected research funding. Lung cancer gets much less research funding than other common cancers ."
