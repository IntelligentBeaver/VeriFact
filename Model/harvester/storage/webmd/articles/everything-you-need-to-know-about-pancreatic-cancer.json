        "Nov. 16, 2023 -- In 2023 alone, an estimated 64,050 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer , accounting for 3% of all cancers in the U.S. and 7% of all cancer deaths. The most concerning thing about pancreatic cancer is that detection often occurs in later stages when it has spread beyond the pancreas. For this reason, pancreatic cancer is often referred to as the \"silent killer.\" To explore the myths and facts of pancreatic cancer, we spoke with Malini D. Sur, MD, FACS , a board-certified surgical oncologist. Dr. Sur explains the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer, current treatment options available, and the best way for patients to advocate for themselves while navigating this diagnosis."
