        "Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) with polyneuropathy is a rare, progressive, and life-threatening disease that runs in families. It happens with mutations, or changes, in the transthyretin (TTR) gene that causes a protein called amyloid to build up in the body, leading to issues with the nervous system, heart, and other areas in your body. hATTR with polyneuropathy affects about 50,000 people worldwide. But experts suggest the number may be higher because the symptoms of this disease are like those of other conditions: Tingling, pain, and numbness in your extremities Weakness Dizziness Sexual problems Unexplained weight loss Urinary tract infections that keep coming back These symptoms can show up around ages 30 to 70. After they start, people with hATTR may live up to 3 to 5 years, but some estimates say people can survive as long as 15 years. Genetic testing for the TTR gene mutation that causes the disease may allow for early diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling for you and your family. But it may also be emotionally troubling. It can cause: Worry Anxiety Survivor guilt Depression Denial For this reason, experts suggest that everyone involved should get emotional support during the genetic testing process. That includes anyone with the gene mutation, people who haven’t taken the test, anyone who has received a negative result, the person showing symptoms, and their family members."

        "Doctors recommend genetic testing for people over 18 who have been diagnosed with the disease or are thought to have it and for family members at risk who are showing no symptoms. You can also get genetic testing if you have symptoms that might mean you have hATTR. Because hATTR with polyneuropathy is an aggressive condition that can get worse over time to the point that it's life-threatening, doing genetic testing to know whether you’re carrying the gene causing the disease can be a difficult decision. Knowing whether you have the mutation can help you get diagnosed and treated early. That can slow down the rate at which the disease gets worse. Still, deciding whether to take the test is up to you. If you don’t, you can still ask your doctor to monitor you for any serious changes in your health. You can also see a genetic counselor and not take the test. Or do the test but not get the results until you need them or feel ready, says Paul Wicks, vice president of neuroscience at Sano Genetics."

Aaron Baldwin, MS, LCGC, a genetic counselor in the Department of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania, says getting a result that might explain symptoms you’ve been having, and that other family members may have had, for a long time can be a lot to process emotionally. That’s especially true if you’ve seen many doctors in the past who couldn’t figure out what was causing the symptoms.
