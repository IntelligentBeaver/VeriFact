        "Dec. 18, 2000 -- When her son David was just 1 year old, Linda Van Meenen saw the first signs of decay on his teeth . But when she took him to the dentist, she was told he was too young to be treated, that he wouldn't sit still, and that she should bring him back when he was 2. A year later, she took David to the same dentist, who looked in his mouth and said she had waited too long, and that the teeth were in such bad condition, he wouldn't be able to treat him.",
        "David eventually was referred to another dentist and diagnosed with an uncommon problem: he had been born with no enamel on his teeth . This caused them to start decaying almost from the moment he began to eat. Before he was 5, the boy had received root canals , had all eight front teeth removed, and had most of the remaining others either capped or filled. With both parents unemployed at the time, David's treatments -- costing thousands of dollars -- would have caused them untold financial hardship if not for a state insurance program covering pediatric dentistry. \"We could never have afforded all of that if not for the help,\" says the Lewisville, Ohio, mother."
