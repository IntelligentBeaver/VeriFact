        "The chloride blood test, sometimes called a Cl test or serum chloride test, is a simple blood test that measures your chloride levels.",
        "Why do chloride levels matter? You may have heard of electrolytes and their role in keeping you hydrated and healthy. One of the most important of these electrically charged minerals is chloride.",
        "Chloride works with other electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium , to balance acids and bases (pH levels) in your body. It also helps move fluid and nutrients into and out of your cells. So, if your chloride levels drop, you can become sick and dehydrated. If your levels are too high, it may mean your kidneys aren’t working properly. That’s because your kidneys help control chloride levels in your blood.",
        "The results of a chloride blood test can tell if your levels are normal or out of balance. This will help your doctor figure out where to look for the condition or medication that might be causing your imbalance.",
