Claims include that these ingredients break up gallstones in your gallbladder and stimulate your body to pass them in your stool when you use the bathroom.",

If you look at your stool following an olive oil cleanse, you may see lumps in your stool that you suspect are gallstones. Instead, they are globs of olive oil, juice, and other food from your digestive tract."
