        "The chief symptom of TGA is anterograde amnesia, or not being able to form and hold new memories. “[TGA patients] can only hold the world in their brain for 5 minutes or so,” explains Nancy Sicotte, MD, chair of the Department of Neurology at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. “They’re very confused. The hallmark is repeatedly asking, ‘Where am I? What’s happening? What’s going on?’” Some people with TGA lose back-dated memories as well, though they retain knowledge of their own identities and are able to walk, speak, and do other tasks. “They may not recognize somebody they’ve been married to for only 2 or 3 years,” Sicotte says.",
        "The episodes typically last between 4 and 6 hours, though they may endure as long as 24 hours. They get better on their own, with older memories returning first. Only the actual period of the TGA remains a cipher."
