        "Cephalexin (Keflex, Rilexine) is a medicine used to treat dogs and cats for skin infections caused by certain bacteria , especially staph infections. It’s also used extra-label or off-label to treat them for other skin infections and urinary tract infections. Extra-label or off-label means a drug is used to treat something for which it’s not FDA-approved, but it’s safe and effective. Cephalexin can also be used extra-label in ferrets, reptiles, birds, and horses.",
        "Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It’s good at killing most gram-positive bacteria, some gram-negative bacteria, and most anaerobic bacteria, which are bacteria that can live without oxygen.",
        "When cephalexin is a good choice for treating an infection, it’s best to use it first, saving more broad-spectrum antibiotics for harder-to-kill infections. This helps limit antibiotic resistance, which makes some bacteria harder to kill. That can lead to more serious or life-threatening infections.",
        "Cephalexin is FDA-approved for treating skin infections caused by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius bacteria in dogs. It’s also used in the extra-label treatment of other bacterial infections (skin and urinary) in dogs and cats.",
        "You can get it with a prescription from your vet, an online pharmacy, or human pharmacy. It comes as chewable tablets, tablets, capsules, and by-mouth liquid. Contact your veterinary compounding pharmacy for other dosing options."
