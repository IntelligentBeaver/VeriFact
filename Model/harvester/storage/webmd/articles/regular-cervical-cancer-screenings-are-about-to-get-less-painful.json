        "The key to the self-collection and at-home options is that samples from the vagina, rather than the much deeper cervix , can now be analyzed. For a Pap smear, a medical professional inserts a speculum into the vagina to widen it and then a brush that is often more than 7 inches in length is inserted to collect a sample. The swabs used for self-administered vaginal tests are similar to those used for COVID testing and inserted about 3 inches.",
        "Currently, women ages 21 to 65 are advised to be screened for cervical cancer every 3 to 5 years using one or both of two methods. The Pap test involves collecting a sample from the cervix that is examined to detect abnormal cells. Another screening procedure is the HPV test, which can detect infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is responsible for nearly all cases of cervical cancer, and specialized testing can detect whether a person is infected with any of the strains that are considered high risk.",
        "In May, the FDA approved HPV self-collection kits in the U.S. to be used in health care settings, making it possible for women to swab their own vaginas to collect samples. Those kits should begin shipping to medical facilities this fall, the Times reported."
