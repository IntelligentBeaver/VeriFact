        "Heat damages the skin’s surface and blood vessels , causing them to expand and become inflamed. This leads to redness. Over time, it also causes the deposition of chemicals like hemosiderin (a brown molecule that carries iron) and melanin (the dark-colored molecule that plays a role in skin, hair, and eye color), turning your skin a reddish-brown. The skin damage can lead to changes in skin thickness or blistering.",

Central heating has made it less common because people don’t spend as much time near heat stoves or coal fires. Today, it is often caused by exposure to laptops (and other electronics), space heaters, heating pads, and heated seats in cars."
