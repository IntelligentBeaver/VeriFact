        "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe mental disorder that affects the way a person thinks, acts, expresses emotions, perceives reality, and relates to others. Schizophrenia isn’t as common as other major mental illnesses, affecting less than 1% of the U.S. adult population, but it can be one of the most chronic and disabling.",
        "Schizophrenia typically starts in the teenage years or early 20s. The disorder can be treated with a combination of medication, therapy, and other forms of behavioral support. (Photo Credit: E+/Getty Images)",
        "People with schizophrenia often have problems functioning in society, work, school, and relationships. They might feel scared and withdrawn or appear to have lost touch with reality. This lifelong disease doesn’t have a cure, but it can be controlled with proper treatment.",
        "Contrary to popular belief, schizophrenia is not a split or multiple personality. Schizophrenia involves psychosis , a type of mental illness in which you can’t tell what’s real from what’s imagined. At times, people with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia lose touch with reality. Their world may blend confusing thoughts, images, and sounds together. Because of their distorted reality, people with this condition may show strange and even shocking behavior. A sudden change in their personality or behavior is called a psychotic episode.",
        "The severity of schizophrenia varies from person to person. Some people have only one psychotic episode, while others have many episodes during their lifetime. In between psychotic episodes, you may lead a relatively normal life. Still, others may have more trouble functioning over time, with little improvement between full-blown psychotic episodes. Schizophrenia symptoms seem to worsen, then improve, in cycles known as relapses and remissions."
