        "Alexander Haselkorn, MD, has been in private practice in Paterson, N.J., for\nmore than 31 years. Originally he was trained as a general surgeon at Albert\nEinstein/Bronx Municipal Hospital and Beth Israel Hospital in New York City. He\nalso had the opportunity to train with Alfred Swanson, a pioneer in hand\nsurgery, who developed most of the techniques in reconstructive hand surgery.\nHaselkorn was a Swanson Hand Fellow at Blodget Memorial Hospital in Grand\nRapids, Mich.",
        "Haselkorn’s practice is primarily devoted to the evaluation and treatment of\nhand and wrist problems. He has extensive experience treating hand injuries and\ndeformities associated with arthritis, congenital anomalies, and nerve\nproblems. At present, he is the chief of the Louis and Edith Haselkorn Hand\nService at Barnert Hospital in Paterson. Haselkorn is capable of performing\ncomplex reconstructive procedures, joint replacements, and microscopic nerve\nrepairs.",
        "He also treats a large number of job-related injuries, including repetitive\nstrain injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, stenosing tenosynivitis\n(trigger fingers), and de Quervain’s disease (compression of tendons in the\nfirst dorsal compartment of the wrist).",
