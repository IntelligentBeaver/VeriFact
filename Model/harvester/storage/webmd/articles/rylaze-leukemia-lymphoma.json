        "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) are types of blood cancer. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a fast-growing type of blood cancer. It happens when the body makes too many lymphoblasts, which are immature white blood cells, in the bone marrow and blood. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a fast-growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It happens when large numbers of lymphoblasts build up in the lymph nodes and thymus gland, and these abnormal cells can spread to other parts of the body.",
        "One of the medicines that is often used to treat ALL and LBL is called asparaginase. Two forms of this medicine exist: one made from a bacteria called E. coli, and the other, called Rylaze , which is a different form of asparginase called asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi. Rylaze is for ALL or LBL in adults and children as young as one month old who have developed allergic-reactions to E. coli -derived asparaginase."

        "Rylaze works by breaking down a substance in the body called L-asparagine into smaller parts, aspartic acid and ammonia. Asparagine is an amino acid that the body can make on its own. It is needed to build proteins and support normal cell growth. Some cancer cells cannot make enough of their own asparagine, so they rely on getting it from the blood. By lowering asparagine levels, Rylaze starves and kills these cancer cells, while most healthy cells can still survive."
