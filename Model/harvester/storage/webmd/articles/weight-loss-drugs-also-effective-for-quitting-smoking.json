        "July 30, 2024 – Drugs for diabetes and weight loss like Ozempic and Wegovy show promise in helping people quit smoking , offering a surprising extra benefit for users.",
        "Compared to people who took other anti-diabetes drugs, like insulin, those who took semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic) were up to 32% less likely to have medical visits that have to do with tobacco use disorder, according to results published Tuesday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine . Tobacco use disorder is the scientific term for a pattern of tobacco use that indicates dependence or addiction.",
        "For the study, researchers analyzed electronic health records of about 6,000 people with type 2 diabetes taking semaglutide, which is marketed under the brand name Ozempic to treat type 2 diabetes, and under the name Wegovy for overweight and obesity-related conditions. To gauge semaglutide’s impact on tobacco addiction, the researchers looked at whether people were diagnosed with tobacco use disorder during medical visits, were prescribed medication for smoking cessation, or whether they were referred to smoking cessation counseling."
