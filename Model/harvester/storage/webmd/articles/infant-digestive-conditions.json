        "At just 2 weeks old, baby Madilyn spent most of her waking hours wailing. “She cried all day. If she wasn’t nursing or sleeping, she was crying , screaming, or just unhappy,” recalls the 31-year-old mother of two from Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada.",
        "“I was told by pretty much everyone, from medical professionals to other moms, that it was just colic ,” she says.",
        "Up to 40% of infants get colic -- high-pitched screaming and crying that lasts for over 3 hours a day on more than 3 days a week. It begins between 3 and 6 weeks of age and usually ends when the baby is 3 or 4 months old.",
        "But most babies who have it fit a typical profile, and Madilyn didn’t match it.",
        "Colicky babies normally have predictable periods of fussiness and crying, says Stan Spinner, MD, chief medical officer of Texas Children’s Pediatrics and Urgent Care in Houston. For example, they may cry from 10 at night until 3 in the morning on most days, so parents know when it’s coming, he says."
