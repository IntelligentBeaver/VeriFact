        "When you’re pregnant and your water breaks, it means that the fluid-filled sac around your baby has ruptured. This sac of amniotic fluid holds your little one snug and safe in your belly. Also called a bag of waters, it makes room for your baby to grow, keeps them in a steady temperature, and cushions the umbilical cord so it won’t get squeezed.",
        "When your body gets ready to deliver the baby, your water breaks and drains through your vagina. This can happen before or during your labor . That’s when you start feeling contractions and your cervix thins and widens so your baby can pass through.",
        "If your water breaks before contractions start, it’s called prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM). Along with cravings for pickles and ice cream , a pregnant woman whose water breaks suddenly before their contractions start is a cliché you may have seen many times on TV. In real life, about 10% of full-term labors start this way. Usually it’s more like a trickle than a geyser. It also can happen long after labor starts. Still, it’s important for you to know the signs."
