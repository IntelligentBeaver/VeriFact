        "Larkspurs are a group of purple and blue wildflowers from the family Delphinium . There are many varieties of larkspur, and they’re divided into three groups: tall larkspurs, low larkspurs, and plains larkspurs.",
        "Tall larkspur. Tall larkspurs get their name from their height, as the plants often grow three to six feet tall. They most often grow in deep, moist soil at elevations above 7000 feet. Tall larkspurs are often found in the Rocky Mountain region in mountain valleys and meadows and along streams and springs. They usually start to grow once the snow melts but don’t reach their full height until July.",
