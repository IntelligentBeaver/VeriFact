        "What Does Aspirin Do?",
        "Aspirin is an amazing medication with many benefits. It can be used to reduce fever, pain, and inflammation, but the reason it is beneficial in heart disease is because it blocks platelets from joining together. This “anti-platelet” effect of aspirin decreases the ability of blood to form blood clots and makes it useful in treating and preventing heart attacks and strokes."

The better – and more complicated – question is, “Do the benefits of aspirin outweigh the increased risk of bleeding?”",
