This is the first new first-line treatment for this aggressive type of breast cancer in more than 10 years.

HER2-positive breast cancer makes up about 1 in 5 cases of breast cancer and tends to grow and spread faster than other types. Each year, about 10,000 people in the U.S. start first-line treatment for this condition, but despite targeted therapies, most patients experience disease progression within two years."
