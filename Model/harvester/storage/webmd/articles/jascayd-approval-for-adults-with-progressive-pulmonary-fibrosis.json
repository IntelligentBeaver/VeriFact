        "Jascayd (nerandomilast) is now approved for treating adults with progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) that causes gradual and permanent scarring in the lungs, making it harder to breathe over time. Jascayd was previously approved to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in October 2025.",
        "PPF affects up to 5.6 million people worldwide, including about 100,000 in the U.S. PPF is a broad term used to describe a gradual worsening of lung scarring, causing a progressive loss in lung function. PPF is linked to different interstitial lung diseases that may be caused by autoimmune disorders; allergic reactions; exposure to harmful substances such as asbestos or silica; or, sometimes, unknown causes. The diagnosis of PPF is often delayed by up to two years, with many patients not receiving treatment.",
        "Jascayd is the first medicine of its kind approved for PPF. It works by blocking a specific enzyme called phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) that drives inflammation and scarring in the lungs. By blocking PDE4B, Jascayd prevents the \"signals\" that tell your body to create more scar tissue and inflammation. Reduced inflammation and scarring slows down the progression of the disease and helps preserve lung function.",
        "This approval matters as Jascayd's unique way of working and oral form may make it a helpful option for some people, adding to existing treatments such as nintedanib and pirfenidone."

        "Jascayd was approved after clinical studies showed that it helped slow down lung damage in adults with PPF. In the study, patients taking Jascayd lost significantly less lung capacity – about half as much – as those taking a placebo over one year. Lung function was measured using a test called forced vital capacity (FVC) that shows the maximum amount of air you can breathe out after taking the deepest possible breath.",
        "In the trial, patients taking Jascayd 18 mg or 9 mg twice a day, over 52 weeks, lost 86 mL and 69 mL of lung capacity (FVC), compared to 152 mL with the placebo, representing treatment differences of 65 mL and 83 mL, respectively. In longer-term follow-up (up to 109 weeks), Jascayd 18 mg lowered the risk of lung flare-ups by about 40% and may also reduce hospital visits by around 18%, compared to the placebo. While the study suggested Jascayd might help people live longer, this was not the main goal of the study. Because the research was not specifically designed to measure survival, these results are considered preliminary and do not prove that the medicine will extend life.",
        "The most common side effects included mild to moderate diarrhea (within first three months of therapy), weight loss, low appetite, nausea, vomiting, headaches, tiredness, dizziness, depression, backaches, and upper respiratory infections. Diarrhea was especially common in people who were also taking another lung medicine called nintedanib."
