        "If you find that you’re not losing weight on Ozempic or other GLP-1 medications, your metabolism , or how quickly your body burns calories, may be the cause. It’s sometimes called the “Ozempic plateau,” but it can happen with any weight loss program.",
        "Ozempic is often used to mean any one of a class of drugs called glucagon -like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists. It’s approved as a type 2 diabetes medication, but doctors also prescribe it off-label for obesity when you have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. Other GLP-1s for diabetes that are sometimes prescribed for weight loss include Bydureon, Byetta, Mounjaro , Rybelsus, and Victoza. GLP-1 medications that are approved for weight loss include Saxenda, Wegovy , and Zepbound .",
        "“A weight loss plateau doesn’t automatically mean the medication isn’t working or that you need a higher dose. It may mean your body is adjusting, and that’s normal,” says Wesley McWhorter, DrPH, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.",
        "Stalling out on the way to your target weight is frustrating but common. Here’s why weight loss plateaus happen with Ozempic and other GLP-1 medications, and how to move past them."
