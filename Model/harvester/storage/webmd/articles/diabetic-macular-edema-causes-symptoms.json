        "DME starts when your blood sugar isn't well controlled. Consistently high blood sugar harms blood vessels throughout your body, like in your heart, as well as the small blood vessels in your retina – the tissue at the back of your eye that sends images to your brain. Without healthy blood vessels, your retina can't work the way it's supposed to. Your body tries to help out by making more of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. In a healthy eye, this is not a problem. But in some conditions, too much of it weakens those blood vessels. In time, they can tear and leak blood and fluid into your retina. Your retina will swell and get thicker, a condition called diabetic retinopathy . The leaking fluid also causes swelling in the macula, the place in the center of the retina that gives you sharp, clear vision."
