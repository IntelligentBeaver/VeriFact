        "Many conditions can cause you to lose weight, but cachexia affects you regardless of how much you eat. Normally, if you don't eat enough food, you'll lose fat and a small amount of muscle.  Your body will try to hold onto your skeletal muscle mass, which you need for basic life function.  But in cachexia,  you'll lose a substantial amount of both fat and muscle early on.",
        "A big difference between cachexia and regular weight loss is that it happens without trying. In this case, you don’t lose weight because you want to, but because of factors beyond your control. At the same time, your metabolism changes, causing the body to break down too much muscle. Inflammation affects your appetite and makes your body burn more calories than it should."
