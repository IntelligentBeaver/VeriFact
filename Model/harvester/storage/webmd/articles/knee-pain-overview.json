        "Knee pain is the most common muscle and joint ailment that brings people to the doctor. It affects about 25% of U.S. adults. Knee pain may be the result of an injury, overuse, or medical conditions such as arthritis. It may vary from mild discomfort to severe pain that makes it hard to move. You may be able to manage it with self-care measures, but some knee pain may require medical treatments such as physical therapy, medications, or even surgery."
