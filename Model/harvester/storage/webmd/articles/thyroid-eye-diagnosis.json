Also, issues like eye redness and pain can be hard to tell apart from other eye problems. But thyroid eye disease can be very uncomfortable, and sometimes it can affect your vision. It’s important to get the right diagnosis."

Eye problems often appear within 6 months of a Graves' disease diagnosis. Once you know you have Graves’ disease, it's important to keep up with your eye doctor visits. It might be in a routine visit with your eye doctor that the path towards a diagnosis of thyroid eye disease begins. Your eye doctor will do regular exams. During these checkups, they will ask whether you've had any vision problems and will look for symptoms such as: Swelling in and around your eyes Eyelid openings that are wider than normal Bulging eyes Misaligned eyes that don’t seem to focus on the same object at once"

        "A thyroid eye disease diagnosis often involves a joint effort between an eye doctor, a primary care doctor, and an endocrinologist -- a specialist who treats thyroid disease. The eye doctor will ask whether you've ever had thyroid problems or have an autoimmune disease. Your endocrinologist might ask if you have any eye symptoms. Your endocrinologist or primary care doctor can do blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels and confirm the diagnosis. Graves' disease causes higher-than-normal thyroid hormone levels, but it is possible to have normal thyroid hormone levels and still have eye problems."
