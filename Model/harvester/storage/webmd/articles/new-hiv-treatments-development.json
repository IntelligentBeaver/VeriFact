        "When you have HIV, you go on a treatment called antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible after your diagnosis. ART generally includes three different HIV medicines from at least three different drug classes. This may mean that you take multiple pills per day, although there are several one pill per day or two pills per day regimens.",
        "Some people struggle to keep up with these pills, especially if they have substance use or mental health disorders. Others develop resistance to these drugs. That means the virus changes and the medicine no longer keeps it under control.",

You take it as an injection once a month or once every two months at your doctor’s office. It makes it a much easier option for people who find it hard to remember to take their pills every day. This drug is approved only for persons who have achieved undetectable virus on existing therapies."
