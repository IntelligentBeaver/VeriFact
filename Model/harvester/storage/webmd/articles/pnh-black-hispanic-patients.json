        "You know the basics: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired blood disorder with fewer than 500 cases diagnosed each year in the United States. The condition causes red blood cells to break apart, releasing hemoglobin, which leads to symptoms like fatigue, racing heart, stomach contractions , trouble swallowing, and headaches. PNH is diagnosed in all races and genders and at all ages. While there are no links between your race or ethnicity and your likelihood of developing the blood disease, your race does affect the risk of complications with PNH. Specifically, if you’re Black or Hispanic, you’re at a greater risk of thrombosis."

Clots can also break free and travel to other parts of your body, which can cause complications like heart attack , stroke , or pulmonary embolism. It can cause several symptoms, including: Throbbing pain in the one leg, typically in your calf or inner thigh Swelling in your leg or arm Chest pain Skin that’s paler than other areas or cool to the touch Weakness, numbness, or tingling in your arms or legs Sharp chest pain Trouble breathing Slurred or garbled speech Dizziness"

        "There are two main types of thrombosis: arterial thrombosis and venous thrombosis. Arterial thrombosis is when a blood clot forms in an artery. This is the most common cause of heart attacks and strokes. Venous thrombosis is when a blood clot forms in a vein. It can cause pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in your lung. With PNH, venous thrombosis is more common than arterial thrombosis. And the most common site for clots is the hepatic vein in your liver."

Black people with PNH have a 73% risk while Hispanic people have a 50% risk. This is compared with a risk of just 36% among those who are White or Asian.

Here are some tips to doing so: Reduce your risk. Some risks of thrombosis, like PNH, can’t be controlled, but there are lifestyle factors that increase the risks. These include your weight (obesity is a risk factor for thrombosis), tobacco use, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol . Ask your doctor about ways to manage these risks. Understand treatment options. Seek emergency care if you experience any of the symptoms of thrombosis. Immediate treatment with anticoagulants (blood thinners ) won’t get rid of the clot, but can prevent it from getting bigger. New medications, called C5 complement inhibitors, have helped decrease the number of life-threatening thrombosis events in those with PNH. Connect to the community. Support groups of peers with PNH can provide you with comfort and compassion when dealing with a rare disease. Connect with others who have PNH through organizations like the Aplastic Anemia and MDS International Foundation to feel less isolated in your disease-related challenges."
