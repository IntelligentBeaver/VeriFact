        "Normally, maternal and fetal blood supplies don't mix during pregnancy, but during childbirth , some fetal blood may enter the mother's system. If the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive, the woman's immune system responds with antibodies to the Rh factor. The chances of responding, and the strength of the response, increase with each Rh-positive pregnancy. In a subsequent pregnancy these antibodies cross the placenta and enter fetal circulation. If the next fetus is also Rh-positive, the mother's antibodies destroy fetal red blood cells . The baby may be born anemic or jaundiced, and in severe cases many fetuses have died.",
