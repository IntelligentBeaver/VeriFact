        "If you become seriously ill and are suddenly unable to speak for yourself, will other people know what kind of health care you want? Advance care planning -- the process of letting others know your values, care preferences, and what matters most in your life -- can bring security to you and those who care about you. Despite all of us knowing that we should identify our care preferences and make them known long before facing a serious illness, not enough of us do it. In many ways, the severe illness that suddenly develops among some COVID-19 patients highlights the importance of advance care planning. You may know someone who was otherwise healthy but contracted COVID-19 and fell seriously ill or even passed away. One critical lesson from the pandemic we should all take away is that advance care planning is important. More than 60 percent of adults do not have their wishes for care at the end of life adequately documented. This means decisions about care are left to family and medical professionals at a time when highly consequential choices must be made quickly. The number of people with an advance directive, the documentation of your wishes, is especially low in the Black and Latino communities."
