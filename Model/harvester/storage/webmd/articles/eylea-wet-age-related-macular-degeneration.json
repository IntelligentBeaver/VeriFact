        "People with a condition called wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) often receive eye injections. These shots can help improve vision and also stop the damage that causes vision to get worse. Most of these medicines are called anti-VEGF therapies because they block a substance in the eye called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). One of these medicines, eylea , also blocks another substance called placental growth factor (PlGF) and may be an option for people with wet AMD ."

        "As you age, you may develop a condition that causes your vision to change. One of the most common eye conditions in older people is called age-related macular degeneration (AMD) . This condition affects the retina , which is the layer of the eye that processes the images that you see. The center portion of the retina is called the macula. This portion processes the images in the center of your vision (right in front of you). In AMD, the macula becomes worn down and stops working as well."

        "When AMD first develops, you may not notice any symptoms. Over time, though, it may cause blurry vision and/or change the appearance of colors. Some people may also develop dark areas in the center of their vision. In dry AMD, which is the most common type of AMD, vision slowly gets worse over time as the cells in the macula wear out and die off. This can eventually lead to blind spots in the center of your vision.",
        "The most serious type of AMD is called wet AMD. In this form of AMD, small blood vessels begin to leak blood and fluid into the macula. The eye may also begin to grow new blood vessels to replace the leaky ones. These new blood vessels may also be unstable and leaky. This can cause a person’s vision to get worse very quickly. If wet AMD is not treated, you can lose your central vision.",
        "The key to treating wet AMD is to limit or stop the damage to the macula that is being caused by the leaky blood vessels. Stopping the damage can help improve vision and may also help stop vision problems from getting much worse.",
        "Eylea, which is injected into the eye, can help to stop this eye damage. The active ingredient in Eylea is a medicine called aflibercept , which blocks two substances in the body from working. These substances, called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF), play an important part in forming new blood vessels in the eye. By blocking these two substances, Eylea can slow down the formation of new, unstable blood vessels, reducing the leakiness and fluid buildup that causes vision issues in people with wet AMD."
