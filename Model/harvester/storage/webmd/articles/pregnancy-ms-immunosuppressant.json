        "For many years, women with multiple sclerosis (MS) were advised not to become pregnant because of concerns about relapses after childbirth. But research now shows that pregnancy doesn't make MS worse, says Mary Ann Picone, MD, a board-certified neurologist and medical director at Holy Name Medical Center. “In fact, most women with MS often feel better during pregnancy.”",

          "text": "During pregnancy, you’ll likely have fewer MS relapses, especially in the third trimester. This happens due to hormonal changes that calm your immune system. You might notice some symptoms, such as fatigue and bladder issues, getting worse because of normal pregnancy changes. After your baby is born, your relapse risk may temporarily go up. So, it’s important to plan ahead with your neurologist and get support in place. Overall, having a baby doesn’t change the long-term course of MS.",
