        "Addiction is a disease that affects your brain, body, and behavior. It can make it hard to stop using a substance, even when it starts to cause problems in your life. The sooner you get help for addiction (also called substance use disorder), the better your chances of avoiding more serious health or life problems.",
        "“We know that addiction is a chronic condition. And we know that people get better with treatment,” says Jeanette Tetrault, MD, professor of medicine and public health and associate director for training and education for the Program in Addiction Medicine at Yale School of Medicine.",
        "Addiction doesn’t only involve illegal drugs such as heroin or cocaine. You can also develop a substance use disorder with legal substances such as alcohol, nicotine, sleep aids, or antianxiety medications.",
        "Prescription pain medications — especially opioids — can also lead to addiction. You can get these drugs legally through prescription or illegally. Opioid misuse remains a major public health concern in the U.S. In 2018, opioids played a role in about two-thirds of all drug overdose deaths.",
        "For many people, drug use begins as a choice. You might take something to feel better, ease pain, or manage stress. At first, you may feel in control. But over time, substances can change how your brain functions. These changes can last well beyond the drug’s effects and may make it harder to stop using — even when you want to.",
        "The drugs that may be addictive target your brain’s reward system. They flood your brain with a chemical called dopamine. This triggers a feeling of intense pleasure. You keep taking the drug to chase that high."
