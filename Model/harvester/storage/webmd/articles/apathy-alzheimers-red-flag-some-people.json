        "April 7, 2023 -- Michael K, a retired salesman, developed memory problems when he was in his late 60s. At first it was small things, like misplacing his keys or forgetting where he had parked the car. “Senior moments,” he called them. But his wife was concerned and asked him to consult a doctor, who diagnosed him with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI.",
