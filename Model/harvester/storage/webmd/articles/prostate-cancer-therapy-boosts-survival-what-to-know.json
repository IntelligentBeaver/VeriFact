        "Oct. 21, 2025 – A new drug combination cuts the risk of death in people with advanced prostate cancer by 40% over eight years, according to unprecedented results of a drug treatment trial in men whose prostate cancer had returned.",
        "That means a 70-year-old man whose prostate cancer recurs could live about another 15 years, said study author Stephen Freedland, MD, a professor of urology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \"For many of these patients, I think we are turning [prostate cancer] into a chronic disease, which is really exciting.\"",
        "Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men, behind lung cancer. About 1 in 3 men treated with surgery or radiation for prostate cancer have what doctors call a \"biochemical recurrence,\" meaning their PSA levels double in nine months or less but imaging can't detect a tumor. This was the population involved in the new study.",
        "The combination treatment included enzalutamide (marketed under the brand name Xtandi ) and leuprolide , a hormone therapy that lowers testosterone . Among those who took the drug combination, 79% were still alive after eight years, compared to 73% for enzalutamide alone and 70% for leuprolide alone."
