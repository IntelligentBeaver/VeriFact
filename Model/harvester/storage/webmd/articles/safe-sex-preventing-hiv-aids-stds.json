            "Use only water-based lubricants, such as K-Y Jelly, with latex condoms. Don't use oil- or petroleum-based lubricants such as Vaseline or hand lotion; they can cause the rubber to break.",
            "Keep condoms in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Don't keep a condom in your wallet for more than a few hours at a time.",
            "Never use a condom that’s brittle, sticky, discolored, or in a damaged package.",
            "During oral sex, cover the entire genital or anal area with a barrier. You can use a \"dental dam\" (latex squares that you can buy at medical supply stores or adult shops), a large piece of plastic wrap, or an unused condom cut lengthwise.",
            "If you and your partner have HIV, use latex surgical gloves when exploring each other sexually. Small cuts on your hands could get infected with or spread HIV."
