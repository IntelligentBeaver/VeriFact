I wish I had learned back then what I’m writing in this article now. After years of MS progression , there came a time when I couldn’t get up from a fall without help. Aging and living in chairs most of the time, my bones weren’t bearing weight, and they got thin.",
        "In 2019, my mobility scooter tipped over, and I crashed to the floor. This time, it was serious. Thin bones led to a fractured pelvis that kept me in bed for 2 weeks. Now, I take falls much more seriously, and not falling has improved my life.",

Foot drop, when our toes drag on the ground, sets up falls over carpets or any tiny obstacle. Spasticity (stiffness) makes it harder to keep balance or negotiate stairs, and numbness can make it hard to feel a fall coming on."
