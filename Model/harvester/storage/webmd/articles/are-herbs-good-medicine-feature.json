        "May 14, 2001 -- The results of a recent Vanderbilt University study showing that St. John's wort does not help people with deep depression has dealt a blow to proponents of herbal remedies.",
        "The study, published last month in The Journal of the American Medical Association , tested 200 people suffering from serious depression . At the end of the eight-week trial, doctors concluded that St. John's wort was basically useless in helping them.",
        "But, counter proponents of herbal remedies, no one ever said the mood-boosting herb would be of benefit to people with deep depression .",
        "\"Nobody is out there making claims that St. John's wort is for people with major or severe depression,\" says Mark Blumenthal, founder and executive director of the American Botanical Council (ABC), a nonprofit research and education organization based in Austin, Texas. \"You can't take the results of that study and extrapolate it to people with mild to moderate depression.\"",
        "And you would be wrong if you did, according to the results of several earlier studies that found the herbal product to be effective in people milder forms of depression.",
        "Confused by such seemingly conflicting reports, consumers aren't sure what to do. In the case of St. John's wort they've apparently decided to back off for a while. In just the past year, sales of the herb have fallen by almost half."
