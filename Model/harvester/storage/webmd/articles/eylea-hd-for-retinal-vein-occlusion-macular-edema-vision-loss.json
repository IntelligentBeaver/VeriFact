      "content": [
        "Eylea HD (aflibercept) is an injectable medicine used to treat certain eye conditions that can lead to vision loss. It works by blocking a protein called VEGF, which can cause abnormal blood vessels to grow and leak in the eye. This leakage can lead to swelling in the retina – the part of your eye that helps you see clearly and is termed macular edema.",
        "The FDA has now approved Eylea HD to treat macular edema from retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a common cause of vision loss affecting over 28 million people worldwide. RVO happens when a vein in the retina is blocked, leading to swelling driven by the protein VEGF. Anti-VEGF injections like Eylea HD reduce the swelling and help protect vision.",
        "Eylea HD is the first treatment for RVO that may be given every eight weeks after a period of monthly injections. This could mean fewer trips to the clinic and fewer injections for many people, making treatment easier. Eylea HD was already approved in 2011 for several common eye conditions that cause vision loss, and the FDA has now added a monthly dosing option across all approved uses for patients who need it, including wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic eye swelling, diabetic retinopathy, and RVO."
