        "When choosing a topical OTC treatment for plaque psoriasis, look for products that contain the following ingredients shown to soften skin, reduce flaking, and soothe itchiness: Corticosteroids. If you have mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, a topical corticosteroid will very likely be part of your treatment plan: It’s the most-often prescribed medication for both adults and children. It may even be the only medication you need. Corticosteroids are generally safe, but there are some things you need to remember as you use them: Different corticosteroids work best on certain areas of the body. Using one on an area it isn’t designed for can cause worse side effects. Steroids range in strength from very weak (least potent) to very strong (most potent), and the risk of side effects goes up with the strength. Use the weakest potency you need for your symptoms. Don’t use a corticosteroid for longer than 3 weeks without your doctor’s OK. Use the smallest amount you need to cover affected areas. Don’t stop using a corticosteroid suddenly. This could cause you to have a flare."

Choose a moisturizer that comes as an ointment, oil, or heavy creams. These tend to work better than lotions in treating plaque psoriasis. Use it at least once a day and even more often if your skin is very dry. Look for a moisturizer that contains one of more of these ingredients: Dimethicone Glycerin Hyaluronic acid Jojoba oil Lanolin Mineral oil Petrolatum Shea butter",

Steer clear of products that contain dyes, fragrances, and alcohol that can further irritate your skin. Although a variety of OTC treatments are available to treat plaque psoriasis, most are recommended for mild to moderate cases of the disease. If your plaque psoriasis is severe, your doctor may suggest that you combine an OTC topical treatment with a prescription medication to suppress your immune system.
