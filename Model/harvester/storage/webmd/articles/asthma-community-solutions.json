        "Nearly 28 million adults and children live with asthma in the U.S., making it one of the most common chronic conditions in the country. But asthma rates are higher in some populations than others. “We know based on multiple studies that there are disparities that exist within the asthmatic population, specifically the Black community,” says Lauren Fill, DO, an allergist /immunologist at Allergy/Immunology Associates in Cleveland. “They’re two to five times more likely than other groups to be hospitalized due to asthma, and have a higher associated mortality rate as well.” The burden of asthma is also heaviest on Indigenous and Puerto Rican populations. The reasons for this imbalance are complex, says Lynne Bosma, health equity and outreach program manager with the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America . “Asthma can be affected by genetics or ancestry,” she says, ”and interactions between genetic factors and environmental triggers such as air pollution – which (these communities) are more likely to be burdened by – may also impact asthma.”"

        "Treating asthma on a personal level involves working with your doctor, taking medications, and adopting specific lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms. But addressing the community burden of asthma requires a step back to troubleshoot the larger issues that are involved, research shows. “Many actions are needed to improve racial and ethnic asthma disparities, including expanded health insurance coverage, better access to asthma specialists and appropriate medications, increased inclusion and diversity in the medical community, and environmental justice solutions to reduce the unequal burden of exposure to asthma risk factors,” says Bosma. Socioeconomic factors are a key piece of the puzzle. Studies show living in inner-city environments and having a lower income increase your risk of getting asthma. That’s partly due to air pollution, substandard housing, and exposure to pests, mold, and other allergens. Lack of health insurance coverage and access to health care also play a major role. “This all plays into why these populations don’t seek care as compared to someone else that may have more resources,” says Fill. “For non-English speakers, the language difference between them and their provider can be a huge barrier to care, too.”"

        "The results of the study linked to this program “were pretty staggering,” says Fill. “Patients had improved significantly as a result of their initiative and as a result of what they did to intervene in their care. Several other national programs have since been based off of that successful model.” The Allergy and Asthma Foundation of America's Health Equity Advancement and Leadership (HEAL) program is an example of a local approach. HEAL is a multiyear project that aims to  build and support community-based interventions to address asthma inequities. The foundation partners with local organizations that educate people on how to manage asthma, help them connect with asthma specialists, provide home visits to help them reduce asthma triggers, and more. The programs often use health workers from the communities they serve, which helps to build trust. “This model of care has been proven to achieve better health in communities with an asthma burden,” says Bosma. “In 2024, HEAL served over 250 people who are now managing their asthma better in communities like Detroit, L.A., Chicago, N.Y., St. Louis, and more.” After six months in the program, says Bosma, people in HEAL report better asthma control as well as more confidence in managing their asthma and in identifying and reducing triggers. They have fewer emergency room visits, better use of quick-relief asthma medicine, and fewer daytime and nighttime asthma symptoms ."
