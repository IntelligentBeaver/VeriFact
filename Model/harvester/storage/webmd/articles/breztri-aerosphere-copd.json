        "COPD is a long-term (or chronic) condition of the lungs that can make it hard to breathe. COPD is an umbrella term that includes two conditions: emphysema and chronic bronchitis . Some people with COPD have emphysema, some have chronic bronchitis, and some have both conditions. In emphysema, the air sacs in the lungs become damaged and are less able to pass oxygen into the bloodstream. Air can also become trapped in the damaged air sacs, making it harder to breathe over time. In chronic bronchitis, swelling (inflammation) causes the airways to become narrowed. It also causes mucus to build up, clogging the airways."
