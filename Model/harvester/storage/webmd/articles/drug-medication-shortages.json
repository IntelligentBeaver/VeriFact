        "Have you ever tried to fill a prescription only to be turned away by your pharmacy because it’s out of stock? Drug shortages happen when there’s not enough supply of a drug to meet current or expected demand. Cancer drugs, painkillers, ADHD medications , and other common drugs are among those in short supply. And the problem is getting worse. At the end of 2023, 323 drugs were in ongoing and active shortage – the highest number since recordkeeping began in 2001 – according to the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP)."
