        "More than 15 million Americans, usually adults but also children, have GERD. Many of these people deal with heartburn, its most common symptom, two or more times a week. The root cause of the disease is a faulty valve between the esophagus and the stomach , called the lower esophageal sphincter, that relaxes more often than it should. The result is that juice from the stomach -- made up of acid, digestive enzymes, and other unpleasant substances -- sneaks back up into the esophagus and damages its lining.",
        "Why this happens isn't always clear, but doctors do know that the valve may stop working properly if a person:",
        "GERD can be just heartburn or heartburn plus other symptoms, including excessive clearing of the throat, problems swallowing, the feeling that food is stuck in your throat, burning in the mouth , and burning pain in the chest. Untreated, GERD can lead to serious health problems, so it needs to be taken seriously and managed with both medication and smart lifestyle choices, starting with maintaining a healthy weight ."
