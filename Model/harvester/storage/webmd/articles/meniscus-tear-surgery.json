        "You have two c-shaped disks of cartilage (soft tissue) that connect your thigh bone to your shinbone. These are called menisci. They’re like shock absorbers for your bones. They also help to keep your knee stable.",
        "A meniscus tear is a pretty common knee injury. Athletes who play contact sports such as football and hockey are prone to meniscus tears. This tear is most likely to happen when you turn your upper leg, but your foot stays planted on the ground. But you can also get this injury when you kneel, squat, or lift something heavy. The risk of injury increases as you get older, when bones and tissues around the knee begin to wear down.",
        "If you tear your meniscus, your leg might swell and feel stiff, and you may have to limp when you walk. You might feel pain when twisting your knee, be unable to straighten your leg fully, or feel the joint catch when you move it.",
