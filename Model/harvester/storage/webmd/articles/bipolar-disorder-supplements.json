Alternative medicine views the body and mind as an integrated system, which means they influence each other. With alternative medicine, your commitment to living a balanced life plays a key role in your health and healing. However, it is important to recognize that dietary or health supplements and \"nutraceuticals\" are not recognized by the medical community as comparably effective substitutes for traditional medications used to treat bipolar disorder.",

In addition, always discuss any alternative remedy or dietary supplement with your doctor to avoid an herb/drug interaction, which could be medically dangerous. It is important to recognize that the efficacy of dietary supplements is not overseen by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] in the same way that the FDA regulates conventional medicines and food products, and they may not be recognized by the medical community as relevant or scientifically valid methods for treating bipolar disorder ."

Melatonin is a hormone produced in the brain (that is itself controlled by a master clock in the brain) that regulates circadian rhythms, including the sleep-wake cycle.",

Drugs such as quetiapine, olanzapine-fluoxetine and lurasidone are the only FDA-approved treatments for bipolar depression, while mood stabilizers such as divalproex, lamotrigine, or lithium, may also have value. Antidepressants have not been proven to help bipolar depression, and may also sometimes carry a risk of causing or worsening manic symptoms. Doctors advise caution and monitoring when using any antidepressant , including St. John’s wort, for the treatment of bipolar depression. In addition, St. John’s wort may cause serious herb-drug reactions if taken with other SSRI medications such as Prozac."
