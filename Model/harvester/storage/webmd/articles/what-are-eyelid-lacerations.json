        "Eyelid lacerations are a type of facial trauma injury in which the eyelid is physically damaged. Eyelid lacerations are deeper than superficial scratches and usually involve a tearing of the skin and underlying flesh.",
        "Your eyelid is unique because it has the thinnest layer of the body’s skin without any underlying fat. Because it is so delicate, depending on the location and severity of the eyelid laceration, the corresponding part of your eye, such as your eyeball or tear duct , may also be damaged. Eyelid lacerations may also involve the immediately underlying muscle layer, thus affecting the opening and closure of eyelids.",
        "You can prevent many eyelid lacerations by taking certain safety measures like the use of helmets and protective eyewear while traveling, playing sports, and navigating hazardous workplace environments. It is often best to supervise children and older adults at all times because they are at a higher risk of falling or bumping into things, leading to facial injuries like eyelid lacerations."
