        "A vaccination schedule is a plan with recommendations for which vaccines your children should get and when they should get them. Vaccines are one of the most important ways to prevent children from getting some dangerous diseases. By exposing you to a germ in a controlled way, vaccines teach your body to recognize and fight it.",
        "Government vaccine recommendations are just that -- recommendations. You aren’t forced to get them. But state laws require your kids to have certain vaccines before they can go to daycare, school, or college, with some exceptions. Vaccines protect not just your child, but everyone they come in contact with. The more people who get vaccinated, the harder it is for a disease to spread.",
        "Before they’re approved for use and added to the schedule, vaccines go through years of testing to make sure they work and that they’re safe. The government keeps track of any reports of side effects to make sure no problems come up."

The second dose comes at 1 or 2 months, and the third between 6 and 18 months. The CDC recommends consulting your doctor about this vaccine schedule.*",
        "Getting vaccinated for rotavirus protects against the most common cause of diarrhea , vomiting , and dehydration in babies. It’s recommended at 2 and 4 months.",
        "Diphtheria, tetanus , and pertussis (DTaP) is a combo vaccine that protects against three very serious diseases. Diphtheria swells up the throat, tetanus painfully tightens the muscles, and pertussis ( whooping cough ) makes it hard for kids to breathe. It’s a five-dose series that comes at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, between 15 and 18 months, and between 4 and 6 years. Kids get a booster shot with a different formulation (Tdap) at age 11 or 12, and then every 10 years as an adult.",
        "Hib vaccine protects against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), a type of bacteria that causes an infection in the brain and spinal cord that can damage a baby's brain and hearing. Babies need four doses, at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and between 12 and 15 months.",
        "Pneumococcal vaccine protects against Streptococcus pneumoniae , which causes meningitis , pneumonia, and some ear infections . It’s also a four-dose series, coming at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12 to 15 months.",
        "Polio is a disease that used to paralyze more than 25,000 people each year before the polio vaccine was invented. Now children are vaccinated against it at 2 months, 4 months, between 6 and 18 months, and between 4 and 6 years.",
        "MMR is another combo vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. Measles gives you a rash and in rare cases, can lead to dangerous brain swelling. Mumps causes painful, swollen salivary glands. And rubella, also called German measles, can cause serious birth defects or miscarriage if a pregnant woman is infected. The MMR vaccine is recommended between 12 and 15 months and between 4 and 6 years.",
        "Chickenpox used to be an itchy childhood rite of passage. It too, can have serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis.  But the varicella vaccine has made it much less common. It comes between 12 and 15 months and between 4 and 6 years.",
        "Hepatitis A is a serious liver disease. The vaccine against it comes in two doses, given at least 6 months apart, starting at 12 months.",
        "Meningococcal conjugate vaccine guards against four different strains of bacteria that cause potentially deadly infections of the brain and bloodstream. Kids get it between ages 11 and 12, with a booster at age 16. A vaccine against an extra bacteria strain, meningococcal B, is available for older teens and young adults at high risk.",
        "The human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) protects against a group of viruses that cause nearly all  cases of cervical cancer and most cancers of the vulva, penis, anus, rectum, and throat. It’s recommended for children aged 11 to 12 in two doses, 6 to 12 months apart. Teens older than 15 who haven’t gotten it need three doses.",
