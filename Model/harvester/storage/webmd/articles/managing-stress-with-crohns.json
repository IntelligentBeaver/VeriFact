        "The constant stress and anxiety that come along with Crohn’s disease is multifaceted. You’re worried not only about what may happen because of it, but also about the painful symptoms that you’re having now. It’s a constant battle of trying to relieve your stress while not adding anxiety by thinking about the future.",
        "For me, the hardest part about my Crohn’s diagnosis was losing control. I’ve always had control over every aspect of my life. I’ve taken a lot of pride in the fact that I’m independent and take care of things on my own. A lot of my inner peace and ability to push through hard times came from feeling like I was in charge of my fate in any circumstance.",
        "When I was diagnosed with something as unpredictable as Crohn’s disease, I felt that sense of control be utterly ripped away. At that point there was not much I could do. I had to learn how to relieve stress and anxiety by some way other than taking control, which is all I’d ever known how to do."

I knew I couldn’t get rid of Crohn’s completely. But I thought maybe if I tried hard enough to eat the right things, get enough exercise, and stay as healthy as possible, I might be able to go into remission and never even know I had Crohn’s to begin with.",
