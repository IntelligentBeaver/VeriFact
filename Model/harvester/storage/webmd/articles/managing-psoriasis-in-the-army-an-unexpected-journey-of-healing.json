        "My experience in the Army was a defining chapter in my life, providing me with unexpected insights into the management of my psoriasis. I attended a monthlong training session in the middle of the desert, and while the environment was tough, it ultimately offered a brighter perspective on my condition.",
        "The training was intense, surrounded by sandy landscapes, operating special equipment, and living on MREs. With limited access to amenities, including showers, my hygiene routine relied heavily on \"baby wipe\" showers and quick cleanups. As I became covered in dust during exercises and training, my psoriasis began to flare up. It started on my legs and quickly spread to my scalp, causing intense irritation and bleeding from excessive scratching. The situation grew progressively worse, but I kept my condition to myself, not wanting to appear weak or give up on my training.",
        "Despite my struggles, I completed the entire training without seeking medical attention or reporting my condition. Upon entering the medical tent after training, the medics were surprised by my severe psoriasis flare-ups, from head to toe. Yet my determination and pride in persevering through the challenge overshadowed my discomfort. Was it worth it? Maybe not, but I am proud of myself for being resilient and not letting it affect the way I ran my squad."

        "This experience taught me valuable lessons about managing psoriasis in adverse conditions. Firstly, the importance of maintaining proper hygiene, especially when access to showers is limited. A daily shower, sometimes even twice a day, became essential in controlling my symptoms. The temperature of the water was also crucial, keeping it around medium to medium-hot rather than scalding hot helped prevent skin from drying out further.",
        "Additionally, I found that consistent use of lotions and prescribed creams after showering provided significant relief. Applying these products to clean skin allowed them to work more effectively, especially in removing any dirt that may exacerbate irritation. On most nights, present-day, I don’t use much else besides Lubriderm lotion and an Aveeno face moisturizer. Sometimes less is more depending on the person."

        "Perhaps the most eye-opening aspect of my Army experience was the positive impact of being exposed to a warmer climate and regular sunlight. During my deployment, I worked on construction projects and operated heavy equipment outdoors nearly every day. The consistent exposure to sunlight and warmer temperatures seemed to have a soothing effect on my psoriasis. My skin responded remarkably well, and the regular sun exposure helped me manage the condition more effectively than ever before."

By staying outdoors and physically engaged in my work, I inadvertently supported my skin's healing process. It was astonishing how well my skin healed during this time, to the point where I almost forgot about my psoriasis altogether.",

The Army uniforms, while not necessarily designed with skin conditions in mind, offered a layer of protection that helped me cope with my flares. Although my journey with psoriasis hasn't always been easy, my time in the Army provided me with invaluable lessons on how to better manage my condition in a warmer climate with regular sunlight and outdoor activity.",

It highlighted the importance of adapting to different environments and finding new ways to manage my psoriasis effectively. My journey has given me hope and confidence that with the right conditions, I can keep my psoriasis in check and live a fulfilling life."
