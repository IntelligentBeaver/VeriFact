        "Living with generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) can be difficult because painful flare-ups can happen suddenly and symptoms may stick around between flares. All of this can have a large impact on your mental health. It’s normal to be fearful when living with GPP. Though the disorder is rare, GPP (also called von Zumbusch psoriasis) is the most serious form of pustular psoriasis. A flare can require immediate medical care, as it can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. The flare can last for a few weeks and then clear up quickly. In other cases, people develop pain and other symptoms for months if they’re not in an active flare. GPP causes redness or discoloration on skin with bumps or pustules on top. The pustules can be on top of psoriasis plaques, or scales, and are filled with pus. In other situations, pus is usually a sign of an infection. But the pus in GPP bumps isn’t from an infection. If you have GPP, you aren’t contagious."

It can present alongside plaque psoriasis, the most common form of psoriasis, which also involves neutrophil buildup. GPP is different from plaque psoriasis because it looks like bumps of pus while plaque psoriasis looks like raised plaques from the skin. The pus-filled bumps with GPP can appear throughout the body or only on certain spots depending on the type of GPP. The disorder tends to be painful and potentially serious; plaque psoriasis is known to be more itchy and not life-threatening."

Of the people in the study, 59% were misdiagnosed and 51% had to see multiple health care professionals. Your doctor will look at the rash and may take a biopsy or sample of your skin. A biopsy involves shaving off a small amount of the skin, punching it to get a sample of cells beneath the surface, or cutting a small piece out of your skin. Your doctor can numb the area so the procedure is less painful. Your doctor may also order a blood test. Your doctor will ask about other symptoms you may have had such as swelling, pain, fever, fatigue, body aches, and headaches. This skin disorder can appear differently based on the color or tone of your skin. On lighter tones, it may look reddish. The skin color may not change in darker tones, but there may be a purplish tone or darker tone."

        "A GPP flare can be serious. It causes systemic inflammation that can lead to serious problems if not treated. A 2024 analysis of 30 studies on GPP showed that people with the disorder had flares once a year and the flares lasted from two weeks to three months. More than 80% of people had issues with daily activities even after a flare ended. Complications can include the following: Sudden drop in blood pressure Gastrointestinal discomfort Delirium Tetany (involuntary muscle contractions) Cardiac failure Renal injury or failure Respiratory failure Hair loss Jaundice Hypoalbuminemia (low albumin) Sepsis Death A 2024 analysis found that people with GPP were prescribed more medication, had more comorbidities, and used inpatient and outpatient visits than in those with plaque psoriasis and those without psoriasis. Flares often required inpatient hospital treatment, the report showed. Even when not in flare-up mode, many people with GPP experienced moderate or severe pain when their symptoms were under control, a 2022 report found."

        "There is no cure for GPP. After a flare, it can take weeks or a few months for your skin to recover. GPP can occur repeatedly during the course of your life. In addition to symptoms that affect the skin, it may make you feel ill with symptoms such as fever, rapid pulse, fatigue, nausea, muscle weakness, joint pain, and headache. While you may not be able to prevent a flare, knowing what sets off an episode may help you avoid triggers. Keep track of possible triggers in a journal and discuss them with your doctor. Not everyone has identified their triggers, as a 2024 analysis found that anywhere from about 15% to 62% of people with GP are unaware of what sets off a GPP flare. A type of pustular psoriasis called acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau, which causes pus-filled bumps on the toes, fingertips, or underneath nails, seems to have the worst prognosis among all types of pustular psoriasis.

On top of that, the fact that it can pop up at any time can add more stress to your life. One small study found people were concerned about whether or not other people could see their affected skin, felt helpless about their disorder, felt like others avoided them, and didn’t feel they could participate in activities due to their disorder. All of these concerns can impact mental health. Other mental health impacts of psoriasis The uncertainty of a flare can cause mental health issues, but not being able to work may contribute as well. That same 2022 study found that 20% with GPP were disabled compared to 7.6% with plaque psoriasis. A 2022 survey on Americans living with GPP showed that emotional stress was the most common cause of flares. Of respondents, 67% had fear and anxiety about their disorder and 71% had a fear of flares. The survey also revealed that 65% feared that their current medication would stop working, 59% said they had feelings of hopelessness and depression, and 56% worried that their GPP would get worse with age."
