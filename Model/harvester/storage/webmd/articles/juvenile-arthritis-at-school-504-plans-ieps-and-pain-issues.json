        "Sam Williams and his parents knew something was wrong when it hurt for the 8-year-old to grip a baseball bat, but they never considered juvenile arthritis .",
        "It hurt to write, giving Sam a sound excuse for not wanting to do his homework -- or even his work at school. After several weeks, Sam's pain grew worse -- and moved into his knees. He also had pain in his jaw and had trouble walking.",
        "\"His brother had to carry him piggyback up the stairs,\" says Rose Williams, Sam's mother.",
        "After several months, Sam was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , a disease of the immune system that causes pain and swelling in the joints, among other problems.",
        "Although medication and physical therapy can help, kids with arthritis often have problems in school. Because joint pain and stiffness are often worse in the morning, students may often be tardy or miss school days. They may not be able to perform well in physical education or other physical activities. For many children with juvenile arthritis it may be difficult for them to even carry their books.",
        "But because juvenile arthritis is often misunderstood, it is sometimes hard for children to get the support they need at school, says Harry Gewanter, MD, a pediatric rheumatologist in Richmond, Va. He says it's important for parents to talk to their children's teachers and school officials about a special support plan for children called a 504 plan, named after section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973."

Because morning swelling and pain are often problems, children with juvenile arthritis often have difficulty in the morning with the simplest of tasks, such as getting out of bed or walking downstairs. Because the child may look and act fine once he or she is at school, teachers sometimes don't understand why the child was tardy. Having a \"tardy protection plan\" can not only shelter your child from penalties, but it can also take away from stigma associated with the illness.",
        "An extra set of textbooks for home can be a boost, Williams and Gewanter say. That way, a child won't have to lug home a set of books every day, which may be very challenging at the end of a school day for a child with juvenile arthritis.",
        "Additional bathroom breaks may be needed for students with juvenile arthritis, says Williams, so discuss this with your child and a doctor. The medication that Sam takes irritates his stomach, causing him the need to go to the bathroom often. Having that stipulated in his 504 plan helps decrease worry and embarrassment, Williams says.",
        "Consider asking whether your child should be excused from copying from the board. Often, writing can be very painful, even in a child whose case of juvenile arthritis is typically under control. If he or she complains of hand or finger pain because of holding a pencil, you may want to ask for an accommodation for that.",

        "Talk to your doctor and your child's PE instructor about physical education needs. While exercise is encouraged for most children with arthritis, it needs to be exercise geared to the child.",
        "Talk to your child's teacher, guidance counselor, and principal to get everyone's understanding and backing for your child.
