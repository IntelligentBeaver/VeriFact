Many people who have depression and problems with drugs or alcohol still benefit from standard medicines for depression.

While there’s a strong association between substance use and treatment-resistant depression, scientists can’t say for sure that one causes the other. They do know that the two conditions share common risk factors. It’s also possible that ongoing depression can drive a person to substance use and that ongoing substance use can have a negative effect on depression treatment."
