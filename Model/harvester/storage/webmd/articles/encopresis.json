The examiner may insert a gloved finger into your child's rectum to feel for stool and make sure their anal opening and rectum are normal sized and that their anal muscles are of normal strength.",

Occasionally, a barium enema is performed. This is a special type of X-ray. A small tube is inserted into your child's rectum, and their colon is slowly filled with a radiopaque dye (barium). X-rays are taken throughout the procedure to see if any areas in the lower intestine are narrowing, twisting, or kinking, which may be the cause of your child's symptoms."
