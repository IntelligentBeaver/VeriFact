        "If you’re having symptoms like muscle cramps, twitching, and tingling, it could behypoparathyroidism (hypoPT). It happens when your body doesn’t make enough parathyroid hormone (PTH) or has undetected amounts of PTH . As a result, you have low levels of calcium in your blood, too much phosphorus in your blood, and extra calcium in your urine. This can cause a wide range of problems. You’ll need an accurate diagnosis because hypoparathyroidism symptoms can be similar to those in a lot of other diseases and conditions. It’s important to know if you have hypoPT so you can treat it properly. Your doctor will use some simple tests to see if you have hypoparathyroidism. They may want to rule out other possible factors, so your doctor may use a variety of tests."

Your doctor will want to determine if your body is producing low levels of PTH or none at all. A physical exam and medical history review will also be part of the diagnosis process.

        "Your doctor may use the following tests to see if you have hypoPT: Blood test . A health care professional will check your blood to determine your levels of: Calcium PTH Phosphorus Magnesium Albumin The doctor may also want to use bloodwork to look at your: Thyroid, liver, and kidney function Bone health Vitamin D level Urine calcium test . A urine test will let the doctor know how much calcium the kidneys are releasing. Ask what kind of urine test it is, as your doctor will likely want to collect all of your urine over the course of a day (also called a 24-hour urine calcium test). To do a 24-hour urine calcium test, you will pee in the toilet after you wake up. Then you’ll collect all of your urine in a separate container for the rest of the day. On the next day, collect your first batch of urine in a sample container as well. Then you’ll submit it to the lab so they can analyze it."

The machine views the electrical activity going on in your heart. It’s painless and takes about 10 minutes. Computed tomography (CT) scan . Your doctor may order this test to see if you have calcium built up in your brain. You may have a contrast dye injected into your vein to help the doctor get a better view.
