I wasn't able to manage some of the stuff that I had been doing before,\" says Shorr, speaking slowly and carefully. \"I found that people were seeing what was going on with me. As that went on, it came to a head. I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's .\"",
        "Shorr and his wife, Kim, went to The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center for treatment. People who have Alzheimer's disease receive medications to ease some of the symptoms, but there is no proven treatment that will cure the disease or slow its progress. \"They asked us from the beginning if we were interested in clinical trials ,\" says Kim. This year, they found a match. But the treatment, Kim says, sounded intense.",

The blood-brain barrier mostly keeps the brain healthy by keeping infection out. But when a disease like Alzheimer's is in the brain, that barrier can prevent helpful medicine from getting in."
