        "Essential oils have been used for thousands of years and are revered around the world for their numerous benefits. From medicinal to spiritual uses, essential oils offer multipurpose options for self-expression and usefulness. With the popularity of complementary and alternative medicine, many people are looking to incorporate more natural products into their lifestyle, skin, and hair routines.",
        "Whether it is a useful option for hair growth is a common question I get from my patients. Most dermatologists have varying opinions regarding the use of essential oils, as it has the potential to cause skin irritation and allergic reactions. In 2007, the American Contact Dermatitis Society named fragrance as Allergen of the Year, to raise awareness.",
        "Essential oils fall under the category of cosmeceuticals, which have no direct FDA supervision or regulation. The product’s specific formula has not been studied, so efficacy is not validated before reaching the shelves. There is also great variability in the products offered, including the concentration of oil, additional ingredients, and different types of carrier oils used. While I typically do not recommend it for skin application due to the potential for significant irritation and allergic reactions, I believe this can be a safe option for applying to the scalp and hair. For this reason, I try to provide as much guidance, including specific product recommendations for patients who desire alternate treatments."
