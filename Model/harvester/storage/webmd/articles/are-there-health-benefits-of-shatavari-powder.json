        "Shatavari, also called kurilo, is a spiky plant with thick roots. It’s part of the asparagus family and grows in warm places such as Nepal, India, Australia, and Africa. People have used it for hundreds of years in traditional medicine, such as Ayurveda, to help with different health problems.",
        "Shatavari is an adaptogenic herb. Although there isn’t much scientific research to support these claims, adaptogenic herbs are used to help your body manage stress and improve your overall health. Researchers believe adaptogens affect your hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis helps keep your body’s stress response in check.",
