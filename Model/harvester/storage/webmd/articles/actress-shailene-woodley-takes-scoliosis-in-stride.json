        "When treated in a timely and effective manner, scoliosis -- or curvature of the spine -- can be almost invisible. Shailene Woodley, 17, for instance who stars as the pregnant Amy Juergens in ABC Family’s hit The Secret Life of the American Teenager , has spent much of her life in the spotlight. The California native broke into the business at age 5 and later played young Jordan in Crossing Jordan and Kaitlin Cooper in the first season of The O.C . What her fans may not know is that she just wrapped up two years of wearing a chest-to-hips plastic brace -- ever since she was diagnosed with scoliosis the summer she was 15.",
        "“We were getting ready to go swimming and I was in a bikini. ... My best friend was like, ‘Shai, your spine is weird,’” Woodley says. With scoliosis, the spine can look like an “S” or a “C” from behind. Other indicators include uneven shoulders, a prominent shoulder blade, or an uneven waist.",
        "Her mom took her to the doctor for a diagnosis. “I laugh under pressure,” says Woodley, whose spine had a 38-degree curvature (if it had been more than 45 degrees, she would have been a candidate for surgery). “So I was OK. It wasn’t until the fourth week of wearing a brace that I said, ‘Whoa, this is a bummer.’” But in the end, the treatment was successful, and she took the brace off for good in December."

        "Scoliosis affects roughly 2% of the population. Most cases are minor enough to require no treatment. Woodley’s scoliosis, called idiopathic, is the most common type, for which there is no known cause -- though it runs in families and researchers are trying to pinpoint the origins. About 20% of scoliosis cases are associated with birth defects, illness, or traumatic injury. And no one knows why, but girls are more likely to get the condition."
