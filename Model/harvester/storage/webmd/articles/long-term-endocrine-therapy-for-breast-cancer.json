She’s also on Lupron, a prescription hormone therapy that suppresses estrogen and has put her in temporary menopause , so that she can take exemestane. She plans to be on both drugs for 5-10 years.",

        "About two-thirds of all breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive breast cancers. This means they grow in response to hormones such as estrogen and progesterone . Your breast cancer cells have receptors that attach to these hormones, which helps them grow, says Rachel Layman, MD, a breast medical oncologist at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.",
        "Endocrine therapy prevents this from happening.",
        "“It’s sometimes known as hormone therapy, which is confusing because we’re not giving patients hormones, but rather manipulating the hormones they do have. It’s really a form of antiestrogen therapy,” Layman says.",
        "“Almost every breast cancer patient with this type of breast cancer is offered it because it’s been shown to help at all stages of disease, including what we call stage 0, or ductal carcinoma in situ,” says Layman. It doesn’t help women whose tumors don’t have hormone receptors (also known as hormone receptor-negative breast cancer).",
        "You usually start hormone therapy right after breast cancer surgery, notes Layman. And it’s taken for 5-10 years. “We offer treatment longer than five years to women who are at higher risk of recurrence,” explains Layman. A test called the Breast Cancer Index can help you and your doctor figure out if you will benefit from more than five years of hormone therapy."
