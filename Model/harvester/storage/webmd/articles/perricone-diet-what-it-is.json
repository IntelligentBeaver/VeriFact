        "Getting to a healthy weight, and keeping it, is important to help prevent chronic disease. We need to feed our bodies, but eating too much can lead to inflammation . So why not try a diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids? This diet seems to have the ingredients for a healthy diet and can be a good fit for those with heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure. Exactly how inflammation relates to chronic conditions or extra weight is not exactly known, but weight loss does lower inflammation.",
        "Does It Work?",
        "While this is not for everyone, it does work. A diet high in fiber can help keep you full, yet the emphasis on fish as the \"go-to\" protein source isn’t easy. Fish is a major source of healthy fats , vitamin D , and selenium , but some people shy away from it, either because of its taste or they just aren’t confident in how to cook it.",
        "Remember, weight loss comes down to how many calories you take in and how many you burn off.",
        "Going for the types of foods that Perricone recommends is good for you, but to lose weight, you'll probably also need to be more active and limit your portion sizes and calories.",
        "Is It Good for Certain Conditions?",
        "As with any diet, it’s vitally important to get the right amount of protein. People with conditions that affect the kidneys , such as diabetes or high blood pressure , may need to be careful that they don't get too much protein. So discuss this with your doctor.",
        "The diet takes into account vegetarians and others that avoid animal-based proteins, but it may still be a bit restrictive for this group. Fish is an important part of a healthy diet and gives you high-quality protein, essential nutrients, and omega-3 fatty acids. But fish also can contain mercury. The FDA advises some groups to limit some types of fish that can be high in contaminants.",
        "The Final Word",
        "This program challenges you to eat healthy foods and restore the nutritional value of foods. It represents a lifelong change in eating, so it may be appropriate for weight loss and weight maintenance."
