        "The FDA has only approved one biologic, sotatercept-csrk (Winrevair ), for the treatment of PAH. To understand how this drug works, you first need to understand what happens in your pulmonary arteries when you have PAH. The condition leads to high blood pressure in the arteries in your lungs and the right side of your heart. That’s because the blood vessels in your lungs have become too narrow for blood to flow easily. This happened because changes in the cells that line the arteries in your lungs caused the artery walls to get thick, stiff and narrow."
