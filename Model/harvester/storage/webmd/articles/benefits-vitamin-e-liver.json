        "Vitamin E is a nutrient found in everyday foods like olive oil, almonds, leafy greens, and dairy. In addition to supporting your eyesight, reproductive system, and the health of your blood, brain, and skin, there’s a growing amount of research showing it can also improve the health of your liver.",
        "Chiti Parikh, MD, an internist and executive director of the Integrative Health and Wellbeing Program at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, explains that your liver is sensitive to damage caused by oxidative stress. This type of damage happens if there’s an imbalance of molecules in your body. Things like exposure to pollution, smoking, radiation, and stress can cause your body to produce harmful molecules called free radicals, which can damage other cells. Antioxidants, on the other hand, are molecules that help protect cells.",
        "“Vitamin E is a very powerful antioxidant,” she says. “Think about it as a sort of neutralizer that can protect the liver cells from inflammation and damage.”",

        "Vitamin E offers many benefits for liver health. Here are a few other ways it can support and protect your liver:",
        "Prevents oxidative stress: Oxidative stress happens when your body has too many free radicals and not enough antioxidants to counteract their harmful effects. Over time, this imbalance can damage your cells and tissues, leading to all sorts of health problems — including liver issues. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, helping to lower the number of free radicals in your body. By protecting your cells from oxidative stress, it helps prevent the inflammation and fat buildup that can harm the liver.",
        "Helps liver regeneration: Vitamin E creates a healthier environment for liver cells to be able to repair themselves in a few different ways. If SLD causes damage that leads to scarring, the scar tissue can keep new liver cells from forming. By helping prevent this scarring, vitamin E can help keep your liver working properly. In addition to protecting cells, vitamin E  may also help damaged cells recover. Some research suggests that vitamin E may influence how some genes are turned on or off, which can guide the body’s healing and repair processes.",
        "Improves insulin sensitivity: Your body uses the hormone insulin to turn sugar into energy. If your cells become resistant to it, they can’t process the sugar, so it builds up in your blood. This can lead to health problems like type 2 diabetes or obesity, both of which are closely linked to SLD disease (an estimated 70% to 80% of people with obesity and diabetes also have MASLD). Over time, inflammation caused by fat can lead to insulin resistance. Since vitamin E helps lower inflammation, it may also help with insulin sensitivity. A review of studies that looked at whether vitamin E could help with insulin resistance in people with diabetes found that it offered benefits for both insulin resistance and blood sugar levels."
