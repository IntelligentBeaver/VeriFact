        "Cirrhosis is a condition in which scar tissue gradually replaces your healthy liver cells. It usually happens over a long period, often due to hepatitis, alcohol use disorder, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Most of the time, you can't fix the damage to your liver. But if you catch it early, some treatments can keep problems in check.",
        "Your liver is an organ about the size of a football that has an important job. It filters toxins from your blood, makes enzymes that help you digest food, stores sugar and nutrients, and helps you fight infections.",
        "Each time your liver gets hurt, it repairs itself and forms tough scar tissue. When too much scar tissue builds up, the organ can't work the way it should. Your doctor might call this condition cirrhosis of the liver.",
        "“The liver is essentially the factory of the body, so it is central to many processes in the liver,” says Grace L. Su, MD, professor of internal medicine and surgery at the University of Michigan Medical School and chief of the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Section at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System."
