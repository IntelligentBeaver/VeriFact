        "Sept. 4, 2000 -- When Seattle pharmacist Jennifer Erickson returned to work in late July one day after filing a headline-grabbing lawsuit against her employer, the Bartell Drug Co., her female co-workers were ecstatic. \"It was all high fives and 'You go, girl!' \" Erickson says with a laugh. Her customers thanked her. Strangers who recognized her from interviews in the local and national media stopped her on the street.",
        "So why is this 26-year old suing her own employer -- and getting so much attention and support from her co-workers and customers? Erickson is challenging one of the longest-standing disparities in medicine. She thinks it's wrong that the health insurance plans offered by so many companies across the country provide coverage for drugs like Viagra for men but don't cover birth control pills and other contraceptives . And she thinks changes are long overdue.",
        "To try to close this gender gap, Erickson volunteered to be the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit filed last month by Planned Parenthood -- the first case ever seeking to force an employer to include contraceptives in its health plan. While the lawsuit targets only Bartell, it could pave the way for similar suits against every company in the United States that provides similar prescription coverage to its employees but fails to cover contraceptives."

Contraception is far cheaper than the cost of either a pregnancy or an abortion . In 1996, the Health Insurance Association of America estimated it would cost about $16 per person to provide birth control coverage for members of group plans. Compare that to the average cost of an abortion: $316."

Because self-insured companies account for half of all employer-sponsored health insurance, that leaves a large gap. And that, Riley says, was one reason Planned Parenthood decided it was time to go to court."
