        "A few things happen in your body that result in Barrett's esophagus. Between the esophagus and the stomach, there is a valve called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). It keeps stomach contents from rising up into the esophagus and prevents a back flow (reflux) of stomach acid. Over time, the LES can begin to stop working and lead to acid and chemical damage of the esophagus, called gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ).",

        "Because there are often no specific symptoms linked to Barrett's esophagus, it can only be diagnosed with an upper endoscopy and biopsy. Guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association recommend screening in people who have multiple risk factors for Barrett’s esophagus.",
        "To perform an endoscopy, a doctor called a gastroenterologist inserts a long flexible tube with a camera attached down the throat into the esophagus after giving the patient a sedative. The process may feel a little uncomfortable, but it isn't painful. Most people have little or no problem with it.",
        "Once the tube is inserted, the doctor can visually inspect the lining of the esophagus. Barrett's esophagus, if it's there, is visible on camera, but the diagnosis requires a biopsy . The doctor will remove a small sample of tissue to be examined under a microscope in the laboratory to confirm a diagnosis.",
        "The sample will also be examined for the presence of precancerous cells or cancer. If the biopsy confirms the presence of Barrett's esophagus, your doctor will probably recommend a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy to examine more tissue for early signs of cancer.",
        "If you have Barrett's esophagus but no cancer or precancerous cells are found, the doctor will still most likely recommend that you have periodic endoscopies. This is a precaution, because cancer can develop in tissue years after Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed. If precancerous cells are present in the biopsy, your doctor will discuss treatment options with you."
