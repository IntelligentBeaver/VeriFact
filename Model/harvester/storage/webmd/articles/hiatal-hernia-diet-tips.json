        "Many people with hiatal hernia , a condition in which part of the stomach bulges upward through an opening in the diaphragm, have no symptoms. For those who do, what they eat may make a difference between a good day (or night) and a bad one. Diet can play an important role in controlling the symptoms of hiatal hernia , namely heartburn and acid indigestion .",
        "When you have a hiatal hernia , it is easier for stomach acids to come up into the esophagus , the tube that carries food from your throat to your stomach. This causes a burning feeling in your throat and chest. Certain foods can make these symptoms worse for some people. Fortunately, heartburn symptoms associated with hiatal hernia often can be controlled with diet and lifestyle changes."
