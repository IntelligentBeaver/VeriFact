        "What Does Vitamin D Do?",
        "Vitamin D increases the gut’s absorption of calcium from food and supplements. Calcium is needed for strong bones that resist breaking. Most of the body’s calcium is stored in bones, but it’s often “borrowed” to maintain a balance of calcium in the bloodstream. Vitamin D oversees the movement of calcium in and out of bones.",
        "When it comes to the gut, vitamin D has several roles. It promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria while reducing the types that can cause inflammation in gut tissue.",
        "Vitamin D helps maintain a strong gut barrier to prevent bacteria from getting into the bloodstream. Bacteria that leak into the blood from the gut can cause inflammation elsewhere in the body."

        "Vitamin D is involved in regulating the immune system, most of which is located in the gut. It helps the immune system to destroy healthy tissue, which is what happens in autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). People with IBD may have low vitamin D, but experts don’t know if this is a cause or an effect of the condition.",
        "How to Get Enough Vitamin D",
        "Gut balance is complex. Fiber, probiotic foods, such as yogurt and kefir, vitamin D, and many others work together for gut health. However, it’s easy to fall short of vitamin D, especially in the winter months.",
        "The body makes vitamin D in response to strong ultraviolet (UV) rays and stores it for future use. Vitamin D production in the body helps satisfy vitamin D needs, and suggested daily intakes include minimal sun exposure. However, people may not produce enough vitamin D for several reasons, including avoiding the sun, wearing sunscreen strong enough to block UV rays, and living in the northern part of the country. In addition, people with dark skin are at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency."
