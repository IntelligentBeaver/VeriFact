        "Alopecia areata is a skin disease that makes you lose patches or large sections of hair on your scalp and body. It's not life-threatening, but it can be life-altering. Hair is a part of your identity. Losing your hair could change the way other people see you and how you see yourself. Alopecia areata can affect your emotional well-being and your quality of life. Some people even think about suicide. It's normal to be sad or angry when you have a condition that affects your self-confidence and self-esteem. While you treat the physical symptoms of alopecia , it's important to also care for your emotional health . Getting the right kind of support can make a big difference in how you feel."

        "Living with a chronic condition can be stressful. And stress might worsen hair loss. Some people with alopecia areata say their stress levels are higher before their symptoms appear. Here are a few ways to manage stress before its effects show up on your scalp: Get active. Any kind of exercise is good for your mental health , whether it's a walk, bike ride, or swim. Physical activity boosts mood and eases anxiety. If hair loss makes you too embarrassed to exercise in front of other people, wear a cap or wig, or work out at home. Meditate. During this practice, you breathe deeply and focus to quiet your mind. Meditation is a good tool to help you relax. If you have trouble quieting your mind, try yoga , deep breathing, or whatever other stress-relief method works best for you. Stick with your treatments. You'll feel more in control when you do everything you can to manage alopecia. Follow the treatment plan that your doctor prescribed. There are a few medicines that regrow hair, but you might need to try a few different medicines to find the one that helps. The process can be frustrating, especially if your hair falls out again after it grew back in. Don't give up. If one treatment doesn't work or stops working, ask your doctor about other options."
