        "Jan. 30, 2025 -- When he isn’t performing cardiac stress tests on heart and lung disease patients, Brian Clevan is training for his 14th Ironman competition. A clinical exercise physiologist at Bellin Health in Marinette, Wisconsin, Clevan has run at least 1 continuous mile daily since July 2, 2010, (that’s more than 5,300 running days and counting) and has his eye on the World Marathon Challenge (seven marathons on seven continents in seven days).",
        "Like many, Clevan relies on his smartwatch and chest band to monitor his heart rate and fatigue and for logging miles. And he recommends those tools to anyone trying to keep active – from the hardcore athlete to the weekend warrior.",
        "But new wearable tech is coming of age. Smart clothing – shirts, sports bras, and yoga pants –offer the ability to track similar metrics and more. Are these smart second skins all that they claim to be?",
        "“Wearable technology has come a long way. But every wearable has its own strengths and weaknesses,” says Glenn Cain, associate director of strength and conditioning for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights Women’s Basketball team."

(Zones range from 1, low- to moderate-intensity efforts using 50% to 60% of your maximum heart rate, to 5, very high-intensity efforts using 90% to 100% of your maximum heart rate.) On the other hand, “they’re not as accurate in terms of measuring GPS-based metrics, like velocity and speed,” he says."
