        "There are a couple of reasons. First, nicotine is known to raise metabolic rate . It increases the amount of calories used; a heavy smoker may burn as many as 200 calories daily. Nicotine also serves as an appetite suppressant ; after quitting it is normal for your appetite to increase.",
        "Many people report that when they quit smoking their ability to taste and smell is enhanced, a temptation that can lead to increased eating. It is common for people to say that before quitting they never had much of a sweet tooth but now they find that they eat sweet foods. Studies show that people want more sweet and fatty foods after quitting.",
        "Finally, smoking often provides a socially soothing activity for shy or anxious people. When the urge to light up hits, foods -- especially fattening, salty, or sweet snacks -- become a substitute for the physical and emotional comfort smoking provides."
