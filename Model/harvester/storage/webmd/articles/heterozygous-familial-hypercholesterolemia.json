        "You've probably heard that you need to watch your cholesterol to keep heart disease away. That's also true of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The disease can cause your cholesterol numbers to go way up. If your doctor tells you that you have it, it's important to get treatment to cut your chances of a heart attack or stroke.",
        "You don't catch HeFH the way you might pick up a cold . It's a condition you're born with that was passed down to you from genes you got from your parents. Over time, your high cholesterol levels can damage your arteries , which carry blood and oxygen from your heart to the rest of your body. That raises your chances of a heart attack at a young age.",
        "Diet , exercise, and, most important, medicine can bring down your levels of cholesterol. Learn your risk for HeFH and get treated early to cut your chances of heart disease."
