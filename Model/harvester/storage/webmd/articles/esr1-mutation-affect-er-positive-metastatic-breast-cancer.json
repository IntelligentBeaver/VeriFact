        "If you have estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) metastatic breast cancer, your doctor will most likely recommend hormone (endocrine) therapy. That's because the estrogen hormone can attach to breast cancer receptors to help it grow. But hormone treatments can lower estrogen levels in your body, and in some cases block estrogen receptors to slow cancer growth. Endocrine therapies work very well to treat breast cancer. But if you are on certain forms, like aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen, your breast cancer can get a gene change called an ESR1 mutation. An ESR1 mutation can mean that your cancer treatment may stop working, or, in some cases, your cancer may recur. The good news is that new medications work very well to treat this type of breast cancer. Here's a closer look at ESR1 mutations. Learn about how these mutations impact metastatic breast cancer, and get the latest updates for treatment and outlook, too."

ESR1 mutations develop as a result of prior treatment for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. \"The main form of treatment for a long time has been either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole or letrozole, which block estrogen from binding to estrogen receptors,\" says Mariya Rozenblit, MD, a medical oncologist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. These medications have been shown to work very well to treat hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. But after you have been treated for a while, cancer cells can find ways to outsmart hormone therapy. Breast cancer cells can get ESR1 gene mutations that change the estrogen receptor shape. The shape change means your breast cancer cells grow without estrogen. As a result, cancer cells can continue to grow, and spread."

It's still being studied, but liquid biopsy is used to monitor when hormone receptor-positive breast cancer develops the ESR1 mutation. The study monitors people during treatment with an aromatase inhibitor and CDK4/6 inhibitor. If a mutation is found, even if the cancer doesn't progress, doctors can switch to an investigational SERD called camizestrant while the patient is on the same CDK4/6 inhibitor. A study in the American Society of Clinical Oncology journal, published in June 2025, found that liquid biopsy monitoring may greatly increase the amount of time before the metastatic disease gets worse. And combination therapy helped lower the risk of breast cancer progression or death by 56%."
