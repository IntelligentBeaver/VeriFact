        "It’s not unusual to have mixed feelings about your child’s diagnosis with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). The behaviors that led to it may create stress in your family and social life for quite a while. You might worry about how your child (and others) will react to being “labeled,” on top of all your other challenges. Don’t let that keep you from talking with your kid about it. Discovering together how your child’s brain works can be a first step toward improving their symptoms.",
        "Jen Mackay found out her son, James, had ADHD when he was 6 years old. “[It] was a bit of a relief, because we felt like it explained some of the things we were seeing,” she says. She was also hopeful that the diagnosis meant they’d be able to find the right tools to help James. “He was a constant ‘behavior problem’ in his preschool and transitional kindergarten classes, which was so discouraging for him. In fact, we decided to pull him from public kindergarten because I didn’t want him to think that he was bad. In retrospect, I wish that we had been [able] to diagnose him and start treating his ADHD earlier.”",
        "In this way, finding out your child has ADHD is a good thing, and you can help explain it to them by focusing on the positives."

        "“We came at it from the standpoint that he’s at an advantage knowing the things he needed to work on and that everyone can improve with time and practice,” Mackay says. “He had the best heart and loved all of his friends. It was confusing when they were upset, because he was so impulsive and would do things that would bother his friends or not listen to his teacher. We talked about how understanding that certain things would be tricky (like personal space and remembering homework) can be an advantage, because you can make a conscious effort to learn and get better.”",

You can tell them how the medicine may make it easier to achieve some of those goals. Today, “[James] can acutely tell the difference when he’s forgotten his meds and prefers the way that he feels when he is on them,” Mackay says. “When school went remote, he asked to speak with the psychiatrist and request a meds adjustment. I think this demonstrates that he understands the diagnosis and what helps him and has come to peace with it.”"
