        "Nereus (tradipitant) is a new prescription medicine approved by the FDA to help prevent nausea and vomiting caused by motion (motion sickness) in adults, such as during car rides, boat trips, or flights.",
        "Motion sickness happens when the brain receives conflicting signals from the eyes, the inner ear (which controls balance), and the body's sense of position. This sensory mismatch can trigger the release of a chemical called substance P, which activates neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors in the brain. Together, these signals can cause nausea and vomiting, leading to motion sickness.",
        "About 1 in 4 adults in the U.S. – roughly 65 million to 78 million people – are affected by a mild form of motion sickness while travelling by cars, boats, or planes. But about 5%-15% of people have severe motion sickness that can come back often, disrupting their day-to-day life. In some cases, intense motion sickness may cause people to avoid travel or motion-related activities altogether, resulting in missed opportunities and experiences."

In both the studies, the participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either an oral single dose of Nereus (85 mg or 170 mg) or a placebo, without food, about an hour before boat travel that lasted about two to five hours. The results showed that fewer people vomited when they took Nereus, compared to those on a placebo. In one trial involving 365 people, vomiting happened in 18.3%-19.5% of those taking Nereus versus 44.3% of those on a placebo. In another study of 316 people, vomiting rates were 10.4%-18.3% with Nereus versus 37.7% with a placebo. This represents a reduction in risk of about 50%-70%."
