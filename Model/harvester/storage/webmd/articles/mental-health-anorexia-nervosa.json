        "Anorexia nervosa, also called anorexia, is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder that can affect people of all ages, genders, ethnic or racial groups, and body sizes and weights. People with anorexia may have trouble maintaining a healthy weight for their body frame, height, and age. This disorder can lead to a distorted body image and serious health consequences.",

        "The term anorexia means \"loss of appetite.\" But this definition is misleading. People with anorexia nervosa do get hungry but starve themselves on purpose.",
        "If you have anorexia, you may have an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming \"fat.\" You may have a false sense of body image or think your self-worth depends on your body size. As a result, you may try to correct this perceived \"flaw\" by strictly limiting your food intake and exercising too much to lose weight. But extreme weight loss can lead to dangerous health problems and even death.",
        "About 9% of people in the U.S. will have an eating disorder at some point in their lives. But not everyone who has anorexia is underweight. One study found less than 6% of people with eating disorders were underweight. In recent years, experts have called on medical professionals to recognize that people with larger bodies can have anorexia, too."
