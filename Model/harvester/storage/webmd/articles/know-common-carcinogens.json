        "You've probably heard the word \"carcinogen\" pop up in news stories and wondered what that means. A carcinogen is something that can cause you to have cancer . It may be a substance in the air, a product you use, or a chemical in foods and drinks. There are also biological carcinogens, including infections caused by some viruses.",
        "Just because you’ve had contact with common carcinogens doesn't mean that you'll get cancer. Your chance of getting sick depends on many things, including the level and duration of exposure. Your genes also play a role.",
        "Researchers use different methods to decide whether something should be called a carcinogen. There may be enough evidence to show that something causes cancer in humans. Or, large doses of a substance can be given to lab animals to see if they get cancer . Scientists also analyze the results of many studies. Finally, scientists submit their findings to the federal government for review and approval.",
