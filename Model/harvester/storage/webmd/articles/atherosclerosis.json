      "bullets": [
        "EKG : It uses painless electrodes on your arms, legs, and chest to measure your heart’s rate, rhythm, and electrical activity. It may show if you've had a heart attack in the past or are having one now. It can also show any strain or thickening of the heart muscle.",
        "Exercise stress test : During this test, a medical team takes EKG and blood pressure readings as you exercise on a stationary bicycle or treadmill. The test has limitations because only serious narrowing of arteries typically shows up as abnormal on the test. Although the test is useful and means you likely don’t yet have serious atherosclerosis, you could still have growing plaque buildup in your arteries.",
        "Cardiac catheterization : Here, your doctor inserts a small flexible tube (catheter) into an artery, typically in the groin, arm, or neck and guides it through to the heart. They then inject dye to watch which way it flows. This helps your medical team find and measure any blockages in your heart. Sometimes, they can even open up any blockages by expanding a small balloon to push plaque against the artery wall (angioplasty) or placing a tiny metal tube, or “stent,” to keep the blood vessel open.",
        "Echocardiogram : This test uses ultrasound waves to provide pictures of the heart's valves and chambers. It tells your doctor about chamber size, heart wall thickness, blood flow, and more. Because it’s so easy and noninvasive, the echocardiogram is often used as the first test after EKG to look for heart problems. However, it does have some limitations. For example, it can’t directly detect blockages or plaque buildup in the coronary arteries.",
        "Carotid ultrasound : This test uses ultrasound waves to provide pictures of blood flow in the arteries of the neck. Because atherosclerosis affects arteries in general, detecting blockages in the neck arteries suggests that it is highly likely that blockages are present in other parts of the circulatory system (including the coronary arteries).",
        "CT scan : Here, a computer uses X-rays to make a cross-wise image of the heart. This can tell doctors the likely amount of calcium in coronary arteries, which is an indication of underlying atherosclerosis. Some more advanced CT scanners give more detailed pictures of coronary arteries.",
        "Magnetic resonance arteriography : This test uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio waves to create images of blood vessels and show where they may be blocked."
