        "Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain. It is a painful condition caused by inflammation of plantar fascia — the bands of tissue that connect your heel to your toes . This part of your body supports the arch of your foot and absorbs the impact when you walk, run, or jump. It also helps you walk as it pushes you forward with each step you take.",
        "Anybody can have plantar fasciitis, but it is often seen in people aged 45-64 and those with obesity or excess weight. It also affects people who stand for long periods or have difficulty moving their toes upward to their knees.",

        "Plantar fasciitis may be acute or chronic.",
        "Acute plantar fasciitis occurs after an injury or trauma, leading to sudden and intense pain in the heel that may also cause mild swelling. On the other hand, chronic plantar fasciitis develops over time from using your heels for too long or with repetitive use. This can be the case when you stand for long hours every day, or you engage in long-distance or downhill running. The chronic type is the typical type of plantar fasciitis that many people experience."
