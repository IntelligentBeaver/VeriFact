        "It's also important to keep a food journal in which you record what you eat and drink and how you feel afterward. This can help you track any possible triggers that may be causing flare-ups in the future. Experiment with your diet so you can determine what works for you.",

      "bullets": [
        "Tune in to your body: Observe how you feel after eating particular dishes. If something is causing more distress than normal, it may be a symptom trigger for AS.",
        "Reduce your consumption of red meat as it can be hard to process and exacerbates AS symptoms. Instead, opt for lighter options such as fish or poultry, which are easier on the digestive system.",
        "Minimize inflammation by abstaining from spicy and acidic foods like hot peppers, chili, tomatoes, pineapple, and citrus. While these foods may be quite delicious, they have the potential to worsen inflammation.",
        "Embrace a healthy diet by incorporating omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties that can help minimize the pain and swelling associated with AS. Before practicing yoga, my day starts with a lukewarm glass of chia seeds, honey, and lemon juice. Chia seeds are not only a reliable source of omega-3 fatty acids but have also been proven to promote cardiovascular health.",
        "Stay hydrated. Dehydration can lead to an increase in AS symptoms, so drink plenty of water throughout the day. My daily fluid intake is a minimum of 1.5 liters, mainly made up of water and decaffeinated herbal tea. Not only will drinking water keep you hydrated, but it can also help flush out toxins from your body.",
        "Add probiotics to your diet, such as kimchi and other fermented foods. Probiotics can help restore balance to the good bacteria in our gut, which is linked to reducing inflammation. If eating kimchi isn’t your thing, you can try a fermented protein powder, which you can find at your health food store.",
        "Exercise regularly to help reduce inflammation and improve mobility. Low-impact activities such as yoga and walking are great for people with AS, as they don’t put too much strain on the joints. My aim is to practice yoga at least 4 or 5 days a week and take short daily walks in the morning with my dog. As a result, my flexibility has been steadily improving.",
        "Eat more antioxidant-rich foods for an extra defensive layer against inflammation. Fruits and veggies such as blueberries, spinach, and kale are a great way to make sure your cells have the protection they need. A few antioxidants can go a long way in giving you that shield of defense."
