      "bullets": [
        "Infection. Colds, flu , and croup can all lead to a lingering cough for kids. Colds tend to cause a mild to moderate hacking cough; the flu a sometimes severe, dry cough; and croup has a \"barking\" cough mostly at night with noisy breathing. These viral infections are not treated with antibiotics but can be managed with other medications.",
        "Acid reflux. Symptoms in children may include coughing , frequent vomiting or spitting up, a bad taste in the mouth, and a burning feeling in the chest known as heartburn . Treatment for reflux depends on a child's age, health, and other issues. Try these tips: Remove trigger foods from their diet (often chocolate , peppermint, fried, spicy, fatty foods, and caffeine and carbonated drinks). Eat at least 2 hours before bedtime . And eat smaller meals.",
        "Asthma can be tough to diagnose because symptoms vary from child to child. But a wheezing cough, which may get worse at night, is one of many signs. The other may be a cough that appears with increased physical activity or during play. Treatment for asthma depends on what's causing it and may include avoiding triggers like pollution, smoke, or perfumes.",
        "Allergies or sinusitis can cause a lingering cough as well as an itchy throat, runny nose , watery eyes , sore throat , or rash . Talk to your child's doctor about allergy tests to find out which allergens cause the problem, and ask for advice on how to avoid that allergen. Allergens can include food, pollen, pet dander, and dust. Your doctor may also recommend allergy medication or allergy shots.",
        "Whooping cough , also called pertussis, is marked by back-to-back coughs , followed by an inhale that has a \"whooping\" sound. Other symptoms may include runny nose, sneezing , and low fever . Whooping cough is contagious but easy to prevent with a vaccine. Whooping cough is treated with antibiotics .",
        "Other reasons children cough. A child may also cough out of habit after having been sick with a cough, after inhaling a foreign object like food or a small toy, or after being around irritants like pollution from cigarettes or fireplace smoke."
