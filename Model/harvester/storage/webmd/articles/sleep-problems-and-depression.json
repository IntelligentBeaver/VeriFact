        "Depression is a mood disorder that is characterized by sadness or feeling blue along with a series of physical symptoms such as low energy, disrupted sleep, and appetite changes. Nearly everyone feels normal sadness or feels down from time to time. Sometimes, however, the sad feelings become intense, last for long periods of time, and involve other physical symptoms that prevent a person from leading a normal life. These feelings often lead to a medical diagnosis of clinical depression .",
        "Lack of sleep caused by another medical illness or by personal problems can also lead to daytime fatigue and make diagnosed depression worse.",
        "An inability to sleep that lasts over a long period of time is also an important clue that someone may be depressed."
