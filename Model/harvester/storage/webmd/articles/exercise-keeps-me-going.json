I switched to swimming and went to the pool 3 days a week, which was great. The water supports the swimmer’s weight and keeps you from getting overheated.",

I couldn’t stand well enough to do shallow water exercise, but I was lucky to find deep water aerobics . You put on a flotation belt so you can’t sink and so a series of movements led by an instructor.",
        "I loved deep water movement so much that I even learned to be an instructor and led classes for about 4 years. But I noticed that my MS kept progressing, and a Chinese medicine doctor convinced me the cold water was making it worse. So I stopped that, too. I’ll never know if I should have kept on, but giving it up certainly meant I would be resting more and moving less."

It’s generally much easier to keep what you’ve got than to recover what you’ve lost. And definitely, what you don’t use, you tend to lose.
