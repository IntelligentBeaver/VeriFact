There is still a stigma attached to medication for a child with ADHD. We made the decision to medicate our children when they were younger (they are teenagers now). Personally, I can say that I wish we would have tried it sooner.",
        "There are two types of medications: stimulants and non-stimulants. They work in different ways, and different medications work for different children. I’m neither a doctor nor a pharmacist, so I won’t get into that, but I can say it often is a period of trial and error to find a medication that works. Managing side effects can be frustrating as well."

Behavior therapy teaches modifications to ADHD-caused behaviors. It can include social skills, emotional regulation, schedule structure, and ways to increase focus and attention. Behavior therapy also can be done at home and often is used in conjunction with the school and home together. Behavior therapy is not a short-term process; it is long term with goals, and it's monitored for progress.  Behavior therapy is also sometimes combined with medication.",

Several studies have been done to prove effectiveness of zinc, omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil), and ginseng. Melatonin can help with sleep issues associated with ADHD. As always, consult your doctor before starting any of these, either with or without prescription medication."
