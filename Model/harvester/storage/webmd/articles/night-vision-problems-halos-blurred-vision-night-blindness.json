They don’t hurt, but they do get worse and slowly cloud your lens. The first symptom is often worse night vision . Because cataracts distort the light that comes into your eyes, you may see halos around lights -- again, mostly at night. Blurry vision is also common.",

Most Americans get enough vitamin A in their diets, but if you have a health issue that makes it hard for you to absorb nutrients (Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, gastric bypass), you might have night vision problems."
