You may need treatment right away, often including surgery, to save the ovary. Ovarian torsion can also happen in the weeks after you’ve completed the egg removal procedure. Treatment for severe OHSS Contact your doctor right away if you notice or think you have any of these symptoms. They may admit you to the hospital to watch over you carefully. They’ll use more active measures to treat your symptoms, including: IV fluids Medications to tamp down the function in your ovaries, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) antagonist or letrozole (Femara) Surgery in the event of a ruptured cyst on your ovary Anticoagulant medicines to lessen the chances of a blood clot forming in your legs Intensive care for any liver or lung issues caused by clotting"

This medication can lower the level of the hormone VEGF, a hormone with a link to OHSS. It also reduces levels of prolactin, a hormone that stops ovulation. Letrozole (Femara). This lowers the levels of estrogen and VEGF after your eggs are retrieved, two hormones that have a link to OHSS. Leuprolide (Lupron). This treatment causes your body to make a surge of luteinizing hormone instead of hcG. This form of the hormone leaves your system faster than the synthetic one, making OHSS less likely.
