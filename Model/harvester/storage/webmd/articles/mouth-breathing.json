You should also make sure your nasal passages are clear before bed, and if you have allergies, take medications to treat them. Finally, you can try propping your head up with extra pillows at bedtime. This may help you breathe better.",

But in the long term, mouth breathing can cause serious problems, such as tooth decay, gum disease, snoring, and poor sleep. It can also change your facial features and lead to ongoing respiratory problems, such as colds and flu.",
