        "The risk of cross-contamination can be concerning when you get diagnosed with food allergies. It can be a difficult ground to manage, as some people risk eating food that may contain their allergen while others don’t take any risks at all. I hope by the end of the blog post, I will have some answers to your concerns and you can effectively manage your allergies safely.",
        "Cross-contamination can occur when allergens are accidentally transferred from one food or surface to another, potentially causing a severe allergic reaction or even anaphylactic shock.",
        "This can happen due to multiple factors, such as shared utensils, surfaces, cooking equipment or even when someone touches your allergen then touches you or the food you eat! Can feel overwhelming, right?",
        "Let’s start with food that has the “may contain” warning on it and whether you should risk eating it when you have an allergy. Personally, I think it depends on the severity of your allergy and what your doctor has said is safe for you. I don’t eat anything that says “may contain” on the packaging, as it's too much of a risk for me."

On one occasion, they used peanut butter on mouse traps around the kitchen. I nearly had a heart attack when I found out. The risk of cross-contamination if the trap didn’t work and the mouse was running over the work surfaces! Once I communicated this to my housemate, they understood and changed it straight away. Never feel embarrassed to speak up and communicate your allergy, even more so when you live with other people!"
