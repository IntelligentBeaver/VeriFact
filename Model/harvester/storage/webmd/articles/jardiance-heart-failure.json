        "Jardiance helps to lower the workload on the heart. Normally, the kidneys filter in a way that keeps all of the sugar in the bloodstream rather than allowing the sugar to leave the body through the urine. The kidney protein that is responsible for this process is called sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2). Jardiance works by temporarily stopping the SGLT2 proteins from working, therefore allowing more sugar (glucose) to leave the body through the urine. This causes an increase in the amount of urine that your body makes. The increase in urine causes diuresis (also known as water loss), weight loss, and a decrease in blood pressure, therefore decreasing the workload on the heart."
