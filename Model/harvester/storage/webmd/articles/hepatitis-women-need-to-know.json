        "The female sex hormone estrogen works with cells in your liver to protect against the hepatitis C virus. But that defense goes down as you hit menopause, when your estrogen levels fall and you no longer have your monthly periods. That means HCV can cause more liver damage as you get older. If you’re nearing menopause, HCV treatment can affect your perimenopause symptoms. You might have more hot flashes than before, or you might have fewer. Your menstrual bleeding might get heavier or might get lighter. You also might notice more vaginal dryness. Younger women may notice similar changes with their monthly periods."

Some hepatitis C treatments also can stop hormonal birth control from working well. This includes the drug simeprevir (Galexos). Always use two forms of birth control.
