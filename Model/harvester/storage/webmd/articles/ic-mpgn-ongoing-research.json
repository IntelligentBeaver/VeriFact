        "For decades, people with immune-complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) had few treatment options. Most relied on broad immune-suppressing drugs that could slow kidney damage, but those didn’t address the underlying cause of the disease. Now, that’s starting to change. A new wave of research has opened the door to more targeted treatments — and fresh hope for patients."

        "In July 2025, the FDA approved a new drug for IC-MPGN called pegcetacoplan. The disease affects the complement system, the part of the immune system that acts as your body’s first line of defense by activating proteins that help fight germs and bacteria. In people with IC-MPGM, the system goes into overdrive and damages the tiny filtering units inside of your kidneys called glomeruli. Pegcetacoplan works by blocking C3, a key protein in this process, which calms your immune response and helps protect your kidneys.",
        "Andrew Bomback, MD, a nephrologist and assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, says that the biggest difference between pegcetacoplan and existing therapies, like immunosuppressants, is that the drug is a targeted treatment. “This truly tilts the balance towards this being a precision medicine approach where we can say, OK, we're going to give a therapy that directly goes after what we think is causing the disease.”"
