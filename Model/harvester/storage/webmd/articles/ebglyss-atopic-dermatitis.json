        "Atopic dermatitis is a common type of skin condition called eczema. Eczema can cause inflammation and irritation of your skin. Some people may be able to control their symptoms with topical (on-the-skin) creams and ointments, but people with moderate to severe eczema may not benefit from these treatments and may need medicine that is taken by mouth or given as a shot. Ebglyss (lebrikizumab-lbkz) is an injectable medicine that was approved in 2024 to treat patients with moderate to severe eczema. Below you will find common questions and answers about Ebglyss to help you decide whether it's right for you."

A health care provider, yourself, or a caregiver may inject Ebglyss into your stomach, thigh, or back of the upper arm. You should not inject into areas where the skin is tender, red, bruised, hard, or affected by eczema. You should also not inject within 2 inches of your navel (belly button). Each injection should be put into a different site.",
