        "What is uveitis? It is an inflammation of the uvea of the eye, which is the middle layer of the eye. This layer contains the iris, the tissue around the lens, and the connective tissue and blood vessels in the eye. The same process of inflammation of my joints and skin also takes place with my eyes. It isn’t a rare occurrence for me at all. In fact, I am dealing with uveitis currently as I write this blog post. Just yesterday, I woke up to eye redness and pain in both eyes. My vision had begun to get blurry and sensitive to light. Because these cruel symptoms are not unfamiliar to me, I recognize them immediately. I have steroid eye drops that I keep on hand for any uveitis flares that decide to pay me an unwelcome visit.",
        "The sensitivity to light is the most bothersome symptom for me because even the light of the computer screen is bright and hurts my eyes. Both of my eyes are affected this time, and they are producing an excess of tears, which makes it even more uncomfortable and more difficult to read a computer screen. The symptoms of uveitis can come on suddenly or more gradually. For me, the symptoms were sudden. I woke up yesterday with symptoms and had no symptoms before yesterday morning. Because I have uveitis flares on a regular basis, my eye specialist will have telemed appointments with me and tell me to see her if the symptoms do not improve over 3 to 5 days with the drops.",
        "I have an annual eye exam, and I also see an eye specialist between my annual eye exams at the 6-month mark. My eye specialist was able to see uveitis before I had my psoriatic arthritis (PsA) diagnosis, which led to the diagnosis and proper treatment of both the uveitis and the PsA. I take daily and weekly medications for PsA, including a DMARD and a biologic, which also helps to treat and prevent uveitis. For the breakthrough uveitis inflammation, a steroid eye drop is added. If that doesn’t completely take away the pain and inflammation, then a short-term oral steroid is added. Depending on where the uveitis affects the eye, the drops may or may not penetrate the affected area. If the back of the eye is affected, the eye drops will be less effective, and treatment will be more complicated."

        "The best way to stay ahead of uveitis is to pay attention to your body, but it is not always possible to be ahead of uveitis symptoms since they can appear suddenly and without and warning as mine did yesterday morning. Focusing on what can be done to prevent uveitis flares is the best way to keep our eyes as healthy as possible. The best ways to do this are to take our medications as the doctors prescribe them and to see our doctors regularly. The medications for PsA can also help to prevent uveitis flares, like DMARDS and biologics. Also, keep your doctor's appointments. See your rheumatologist regularly, your general practitioner as needed and for a regular physical, and your eye specialist annually or more for a regular eye exam and for more specific tests for uveitis and other eye testing. If you have eye drops on hand that your eye specialist has given you to take in case of a uveitis flare, then make sure to take them as soon as the symptoms occur, and call your eye doctor to report these symptoms so that you can receive any new instructions."
