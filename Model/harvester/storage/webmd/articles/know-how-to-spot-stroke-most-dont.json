In contrast, Dick Clark, 76, made a bittersweet television comeback on New Year's Eve after having suffered a debilitating stroke more than one year earlier. With slurred speech, he said, \"I had to teach myself how to walk and talk again. It's been a long, hard fight. My speech is not perfect but I'm getting there.\"",
        "These two prominent men's medical crises have turned the media spotlight on a potentially devastating disorder.

        "Besides ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, people can also have transient ischemic attacks, or TIAs, in which blood flow to the brain is blocked temporarily. These \"ministrokes,\" in which symptoms may last for only a few minutes, are a serious warning sign that an actual stroke may be on the way. Because TIA symptoms disappear, it's easy for people to dismiss them when they should call 911 and seek treatment to prevent a full-blown, debilitating stroke.",
        "During a stroke, experts urge people to get to the hospital as soon as possible, preferably within one hour after symptoms appear, so that they can be evaluated and perhaps receive treatments that must be given within a window of time. One drug, t-PA, can dissolve blood clots and restore blood flow during an ischemic stroke, but doctors must start delivering it intravenously within three hours after symptoms begin.",
        "Besides the lack of awareness of stroke symptoms, psychological issues get in the way of timely treatment, too, Becker says. \"There's a huge issue of denial. People can't believe they're having a stroke. Or they're embarrassed to have an ambulance pull up and everyone's watching what's going on.\""
