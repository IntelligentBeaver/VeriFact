        "Sep. 21, 2023 -- Heart failure affects approximately 3 million women and is the leading reason for hospitalization and a major cause of death in women over age 65. What facts do women need to know about heart failure? Why is heart failure so prevalent in Black and Hispanic communities? How does premature onset heart failure impact people under the age of 65? We spoke with Karol E. Watson, MD, PhD , attending cardiologist and professor of medicine/cardiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, about common risk factors and symptoms of heart failure, treatment options, and how racial disparities and social determinants of health impact diagnosis and treatment. We also spoke with Chevonne Dixon , blogger of This Well Planned Life , who is living with heart failure after being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy at age 19. Chevonne spoke openly about her journey to diagnosis and how other heart failure patients can be their own best advocates."
