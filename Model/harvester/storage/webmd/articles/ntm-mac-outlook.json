You’ll most likely need treatment for a year or more to cure it and it sometimes comes back. But your outlook depends on many factors. Here’s what you need to know."

The sooner this happens, the more likely it is that you’ll get the right treatment. You’ll also be more likely to have a good outcome. If you’re worried you might have MAC, let your doctor know. Signs to watch for include: Chronic fatigue Night sweats Trouble breathing or shortness of breath Weight loss You’re more likely to have MAC if you have other health conditions affecting your lungs or immune system .

Here are some questions you may want to ask your doctor to make sure you’re doing all you can to improve your outlook: What type of MAC do I have? Do I need treatment? Why or why not? What kind of treatment do I need? Do I have choices to make about treatment? What else can I do to help in my recovery? Will I need surgery? What are my chances of recovering? What can I do to manage treatment side effects and stick with treatment? Are there other risks? What can I do to avoid a relapse? What can I do to avoid getting reinfected?",
