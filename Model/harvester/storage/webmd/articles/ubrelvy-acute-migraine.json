The first CGRP antagonists were only available by injection, and they were only approved to prevent migraine.

        "Migraine is a condition where you have intense headaches, usually with throbbing pain on one side. The headache can come back again and again and may last for up to 72 hours. You may also have what is called an aura, where you have changes in your vision or other symptoms, such as numbness or trouble speaking.",
        "The active ingredient in Ubrelvy is ubrogepant. You may also hear it called a “gepant.” It is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist. CGRP is a protein that causes blood vessels to widen and can lead to pain and inflammation during a migraine. CGRP may also have a role in causing migraine. CGRP antagonists prevent CGRP from binding to its receptors and having its effects. Blocking CGRP can help relieve pain during a migraine attack."
