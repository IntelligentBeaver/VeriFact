        "“For me, fitness really means, ‘Can I do all the activities that I want to do from a physical standpoint? Can I walk 5 miles in a day, without breathing hard? Can I keep up with my child at soccer? Can I climb a flight of stairs if the elevator gets out?’” she says. “The point is, can you do all the activities that you both want to do and perhaps need to do?” Hunnes says, “You might be thin but have a horrible diet . You might eat very minimally, and you may actually be very weak.” If you have low muscle mass, you’re more at risk for falling, breaking bones, a poorer quality of life, and a shorter life span. “When we have little muscle on our arms and our legs, we tend to have less muscle in our hearts,” she says. “This can be dangerous in terms of heart health .” Similarly, if you have a lot of extra body fat, you may not be able to do all the activities you want or need to do. But, while you may need to lose some weight, becoming “skinny” won’t make you fit. “Losing the weight is a healthy goal, and [one] I wouldn't ignore. But zeroing in and focusing too much attention on that specific goal can be counterproductive,” says Stephen Devries, MD, a preventive cardiologist and associate professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “The quality of your diet is also important. Even if people are not successful at losing weight, if they're able to shift to a healthier quality of diet, that can be helpful. Because the goal [of fitness] is for people to live more fully and to live longer.”"

        "Even though there are so many other factors of fitness that we should focus on, many people still obsess over thinness. “I really do believe that media, social media, and the way celebrities talk about thinness and looks – what I would consider to be a fairly superficial idea of what health is – is making a lot of people miserable,” says Hunnes. “We tend to say: ‘If I'm thin, I'm happy.’ ‘If I'm thin, people will want to be my friend.’ Whereas what we really should be focusing on is our overall health, well-being, and fitness.” One study found that women in the U.S. aimed to be skinny due to pressure from the media and their peers. This push to be thin doesn’t just affect females though. It can be an issue for anyone, regardless of gender. In many cases, to avoid the fear of gaining fat, people will use unhealthy ways to lose weight or stay skinny. “I think one of the problems is that people want to see results quickly,” says Devries. “They’re motivated by very unrealistic and deceptive advertising – advising them that there's a quick fix to their weight.” “The drive to lose weight is not always coming from a health standpoint,” he says, “but coming from you trying to match some ideal of aesthetics.”"

        "“The best plan is to look for approaches that have a whole range of positive side effects, as opposed to things that are only focused on weight loss,” says Devries. This means you’ll need to put fitness into many parts of your life. “I think it's important for people to have balance. Balance in your eating – eating three meals a day – balance in physical activity, and balance in your life,” says David Creel, PhD, a psychologist and registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic. “A big part of all of this is to not become over focused on any one section of our life. But instead focus on what's important for someone's life overall.”"

        "To maintain or lose weight in a healthy way, there are plenty of steps you can follow: “Physical activity is really powerful for preventing weight gain and, for people who've lost weight, to keep off the weight,” says Creel. “Just exercising, without changing diet, doesn’t show a lot of quick weight loss. It's not as evident,” he says. To have long-term and healthy results, it’s best to do both at the same time. “Eating less processed foods, in general, can be really helpful for us. Not drinking a lot of sugar-sweetened beverages, because we know that people tend to over-consume these. And then add lean proteins and lots of vegetables and fruits in your diet,” says Creel. “Those things, in general, tend to lead to healthier outcomes.” Listen to your body. “We want to have a healthy relationship with food. Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. Have some kind of regimen and structure to your eating,” he says."

Especially the fat that's surrounding the organs.” Metabolic measurements. “What does your blood pressure look like? What’s your blood sugar look like? Do you have high cholesterol? Those sorts of things,” says Creel. Your ability to be active. “What can you do from a cardiovascular standpoint? We know that lack of cardiovascular fitness also puts people at risk,” he says."
