        "Eisenmenger syndrome is a kind of high blood pressure in the lungs , called pulmonary arterial hypertension . It's caused by a heart defect that lets blood from opposite sides of your heart mix together. Usually, this happens when there's a hole between the two lower chambers of your heart, called the ventricles, or a hole between the upper chambers, called the atria.",
        "The right side of your heart pumps blood a short distance to your lungs, where it picks up oxygen. The left side sends blood out to the rest of your body, so it pumps much harder. When there's an opening between the two sides, the stronger left side forces blood into the right side. That sends too much blood into your lungs.",
        "Over time, the blood vessels of your lungs are damaged. They get stiff and thick, and the pressure inside them rises. Eventually, pressure also rises in the right side of your heart. That forces blood from the right side into the left, so blood that hasn't made it to the lungs yet is mixed with the oxygen-rich blood being pumped out to your body. Organs and tissues don't get enough oxygen, and that causes serious problems.",
        "This damage happens slowly, and symptoms can take many years to show up. The process starts before a child turns 2, and by the teenage years, blood starts to flow the opposite way through the hole in the heart and oxygen levels drop. Health problems start in the teens and 20s."
