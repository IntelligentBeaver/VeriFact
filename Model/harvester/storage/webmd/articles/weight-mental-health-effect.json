        "“When people are depressed or anxious, they often engage in emotional or comfort eating. These foods are typically high in calories and unhealthy,” says Renee Solomon, PsyD, a clinical psychologist and CEO of Forward Recovery in Los Angeles, California. Stress changes how you react to things, and it can lead to impulse control and affect your judgment. This means you might be more likely to reach for that so-called forbidden food or you might decide you don’t need to go for that walk or gym session. The result is sudden comfort or relief from what’s bothering you, rather than looking at the long-term."
