        "Palsonify (paltusotine) is a new once-daily oral medicine approved to treat adults with acromegaly who either didn’t get much help from surgery or cannot have surgery for certain reasons. Acromegaly is a rare condition caused by too much growth hormone (GH), usually due to a tumor in the pituitary gland. This increases levels of another substance called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) that can damage bones, joints, the heart, and other vital organs over time. Symptoms of acromegaly include joint pain, tiredness, swelling, headaches, bigger hands and feet, and changes in the way you look. If not treated, acromegaly can also affect your heart and other organs, shorten your life span, and affect your everyday activities.",
        "Palsonify works by mimicking a natural hormone called somatostatin and targets a specific protein called somatostatin receptor type 2, helping lower GH and IGF-1 levels. This eases the symptoms and possibly slows the worsening of the disease.",
        "Unlike current injection-based treatments, Palsonify is a once-daily oral pill that offers a simpler and more convenient way to treat acromegaly, manage your treatment plan, and improve your daily life."

        "Palsonify was approved because studies showed it was safe, effective, and well-tolerated and provided quick, reliable, and longer-lasting hormone control in adults with acromegaly.",
        "In one study, people with acromegaly who had not undergone any prior treatment were given Palsonify or a placebo once every day. After 24 weeks, significantly more people taking Palsonify vs. a placebo (56% vs 5%) had IGF-1 hormone levels in the normal range. Palsonify improved symptomatic score by 2.67 points, while placebo worsened it by 2.75 points. Also, 57% of people taking Palsonify vs. 18% of those taking a placebo achieved low GH levels.",
        "In another study, people with acromegaly who had already been using injectable treatments switched to Palsonify or placebo. After 36 weeks, IGF-1 levels were maintained under control in people who took Palsonify vs. 4% who took a placebo. Symptoms stayed stable or improved in the Palsonify group but worsened in the placebo group; 87% of those in the Palsonify group vs. 28% in the placebo group were able to maintain low GH levels. People taking this medicine also said they felt better overall, with fewer symptoms like joint pain, tiredness, and headaches. The most common side effects included diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea, loss of appetite, slow heart rate, high blood sugar, heart palpitations, and stomach infections. Serious side effects were rare and included gall bladder issues, fluctuations in blood sugar levels, slow heart rate, heart-related problems, poor absorption of fats or vitamin B12, and impaired thyroid function. But no new safety concerns were found during the studies."
