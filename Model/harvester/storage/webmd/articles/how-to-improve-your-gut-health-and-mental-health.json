The enteric nervous system has the same type of neurons and neurotransmitters found in your central nervous system.",
        "This connection between the brain and gut affects your digestion, mood, and the way you think. ENS lines your entire digestive system with more than 100 million nerve cells forming two layers. It runs from the esophagus to the rectum."
