Hormone therapy often treats advanced prostate cancer, which is cancer that has spread to other parts of your body or that has come back after treatment.

        "Everyone’s bodies make these hormones, but you’ll have more of them if you’re assigned male at birth. The most common androgens are testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Androgens work in many different ways in your body, including increasing your amount of red blood cells and building strong bones and muscles. But their main job is sexual development. They give men things like a deeper voice and facial hair, and they fuel the growth of prostate cells."

Some testosterone gets changed into dihydrotestosterone inside your testicles, prostate gland, and adrenal glands. Hormones that come from your brain control the process. When androgen levels are low, a part of your brain called the hypothalamus releases a chemical called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). That signals the nearby pituitary gland to make luteinizing hormone (LH), which, in men, stimulates your testicles to make testosterone."
