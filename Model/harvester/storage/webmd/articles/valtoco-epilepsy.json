        "Valtoco (diazepam nasal spray) is a prescription medicine for quick and effective treatment of seizure clusters, also known as acute repetitive seizures, in people with epilepsy . Seizure clusters are seizures that happen close together in time. These clusters are different from a person’s typical seizure pattern. You may also hear it called a seizure emergency. If a seizure cluster continues without treatment, it can lead to physical injury or a dangerous type of seizure called status epilepticus .",
        "Valtoco is a seizure rescue medicine, which means you only use it during a seizure cluster, but not on a regular basis. Some seizure cluster treatments can be taken orally. But it may be difficult for a person to swallow a pill during a seizure cluster. Other forms of seizure rescue medicines include a rectal gel or a nasal spray.",

        "The active medicine in Valtoco is diazepam, which is a type of medicine called a benzodiazepine.

GABA calms down the extra electrical activity in your brain that happens during a seizure.",
        "Valtoco nasal spray is designed to make you get the right dose of medicine. When you have a seizure cluster, it is important for your seizure rescue medicine to start working right away. Getting Valtoco as a nasal spray allows the medicine to be absorbed quickly into your bloodstream through the lining in your nose.",
        "Valtoco is an emergency medicine that should only be given as needed to treat a seizure cluster or seizure emergency. Unlike other anti-seizure medicines you take regularly, Valtoco should only be used when you need it for a seizure cluster. It is not a replacement for your other anti-seizure medicines."
