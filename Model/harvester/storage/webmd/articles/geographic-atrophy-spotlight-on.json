        "By Philip J Rosenfeld, MD, PhD, as told to Sonya Collins Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) progresses over many years. It’s usually not diagnosed until you’re in your 50s. You start having decreased vision in your 60s or later. At first, you might have difficulty in dim light, with glare, driving at night, making the transition from bright outdoor light to darker indoor light or vice versa, and difficulty seeing people’s faces. You won’t be able to tell if the problem is due to cataracts or AMD. Only a doctor can make the distinction. Eventually, if you live long enough with AMD, you develop geographic atrophy. That’s a loss of tissue in the retina and supporting structures around the retina that allow you to see. If you think of the eye as a camera, it’s not the lens at the front of the camera that’s getting damaged. That’s a cataract. But rather, it's the film or the digital sensor at the back of the camera. And once that’s damaged, we can’t get it back. We can’t restore vision that’s already been lost, so our goal from here is to prevent further vision loss."

        "Until recently, we didn’t have any treatment that would slow the progression of geographic atrophy. But now we have two drugs, known as complement inhibitors, that are approved for geographic atrophy. One is called avacincaptad pegol (Izervay), and it’s injected every month. The other, pegcetacoplan (Syfovre), is injected every 4 to 8 weeks. It’s important for patients to understand that these drugs will not improve their vision. The drugs only slow further enlargement of the geographic atrophy – they slow the loss of tissue with the hope that vision loss will be slowed as well. The longer you get therapy over an extended period, the more it slows the progression of the disease, so there’s a benefit of continued therapy."

In addition, it’s going to be the doctors’ clinical experience treating patients with these medications that informs how long we may need to treat. My advice is that as long as you can tolerate and accept the treatment, stay with it because it’s going to slow down the disease. My hope is to save as much vision as possible until a better treatment comes along. That’s where we are with complement inhibitors. There are other complement inhibitors in development, but we don’t expect them to be much different than the current complement inhibitors.

        "There’s a wide range of other drugs in development that may improve visual function, but they might not slow the enlargement of geographic atrophy. One day, we could be looking at combination therapy where we take one of these drugs alongside complement inhibitors. Another interesting strategy that I am cautiously optimistic about is based on the idea that one of the reasons AMD progresses is because there’s just not enough blood getting to the eye. We have evidence of this from past studies that look at anatomic changes in the eye as the disease goes on. Blood flow to the eye appears to be decreased in patients with AMD. Now a group of researchers is looking at increasing blood flow in the ophthalmic artery. The ophthalmic artery is the first artery that branches off the carotid artery. There’s a carotid artery on either side of your neck, and they provide the blood supply to your brain. People can get disease in the carotid arteries that decrease blood flow through them. Currently, surgery can be performed to improve the blood flow in the carotid arteries, and one strategy is to place stents in the artery to increase blood flow to the brain. Interestingly, researchers have found that there can be narrowing of the ophthalmic artery just as it leaves the carotid artery. Now there’s a phase I clinical trial in Argentina in which they insert a catheter through the groin, and they pass the catheter into the ophthalmic artery to improve blood flow. It’s called balloon angioplasty, and so far, the preliminary data look very encouraging."
