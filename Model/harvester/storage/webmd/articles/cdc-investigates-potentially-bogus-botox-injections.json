        "April 16, 2024 -- At least 19 people from nine states have reported serious reactions after receiving botox injections from unlicensed or untrained individuals or in non-healthcare settings, such as homes and spas and now the CDC is investigating, the agency said.",
        "Reactions have included blurry vision, double vision, drooping eyelids, difficult swallowing or breathing, and other symptoms of botulism.",
        "Of the 19 individuals — all of whom identified as female and had an average age of 39— 9 (60%) were hospitalized and 4 (21%) were treated with botulism antitoxin because of concerns that the botulinum toxin could have spread beyond the injection site. Also, five were tested for botulism and their results were negative.",
        "The CDC, several state and local health departments, and the FDA are investigating these reports, according to the announcement.",
        "States reporting cases include Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, and Washington. According to the CDC, some of the people \"received injections with counterfeit products or products with unverified sources. Investigation into the sources of these products is ongoing.\" All but one report involved receiving botulinum toxin injections for cosmetic purposes."
