        "A recent study in China followed changes in gut bacteria over time in 22 people treated for RA in two different ways. The study showed RA patients differed from people without RA in about 60 types of bacteria to start with. They had more of some and less of others. One of the treatments they looked at led to changes in 11 microbes while the other changed four. While there’s more to learn, newer biologic drugs used for RA also may change the diversity of microbes in the gut. More study is needed to know exactly how these changes affect RA and whether it might work to target the gut microbiome more specifically to treat RA better or prevent it in the future."
