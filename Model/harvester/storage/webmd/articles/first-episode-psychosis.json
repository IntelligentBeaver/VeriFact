Psychosis is often a sign of a serious mental or physical condition. People between their late teens and mid-20s are the ones most commonly affected. It’s more common than most people think. Research shows that 3 in 100 people experience psychosis at least once in their lifetime and more than 100,000 adolescents in the United States experience it each year.",
