        "Dec. 11, 2001 -- As a nation, we are getting fatter, and that is especially true of our children. A new study confirms that over the last decade, childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S., hitting boys, African Americans, Hispanics, and kids living in Southern states the hardest.",
        "The research, published in the Dec. 12 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association , represents the most comprehensive national picture of weight trends among children over the last two decades. From 1986 to 1998, the number of non-Hispanic white children who were overweight doubled from 6% to 12%. The research suggests that roughly one in five African-American and Hispanic children are overweight -- a startling 120% increase during the 12-year study period.",
