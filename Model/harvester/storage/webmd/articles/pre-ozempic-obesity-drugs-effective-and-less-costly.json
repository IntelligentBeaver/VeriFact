        "April 26, 2024 – Before there was ozempic , Wegovy, or Zepbound, there were cost-friendly, safe, and effective weight loss drugs. FDA-approved obesity medication like orlistat (brand name: Xenical ), phentermine/topiramate ( Qsymia ), and naltrexone/ bupropion extended release ( Contrave ) have been on the market for decades.",
        "“Some older obesity medications go all the way back to the ’50s and ’60s – like phentermine, which is still one of the most widely prescribed medications in the world,” said Anthony Auriemma, MD, medical director of Ascension Illinois Weight Loss Solutions.",
        "While newer GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy ) often lead to greater degrees of weight loss, the benefits of more established drugs – like lower costs, ample supply, and ease of access – also makes them valuable options, said Andres Acosta, MD, an obesity expert with the Mayo Clinic.",
        "“Many people say that the GLP-1s are the first medications to give you weight loss at double digits,” he said. “That is not true. Qsymia was already at double digits, giving you 11% [of total body weight loss] at the medium dose and 13% at the high dose.”"

        "Some patients can get drugmaker coupons for Qsymia and Contrave for as low as $100 per month, and generic phentermine as low as $20 per month, Auriemma said. You can find Xenical for $200 to $300 per month. Compare these costs to GLP-1s, like Ozempic, where you are shelling out a minimum of $500, all the way up to thousands of dollars, per month.",
        "An independent assessment by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review found that Qsymia is the most cost-effective medication among semaglutide and other obesity drugs that came before it. Qsymia's “dual mechanism” suppresses your appetite in the morning, and the extended-release function can keep you satiated into the afternoon – which means less snacking and excess calories, according to John Amos, CEO of VIVUS, the drug company behind Qsymia.",
        "Another key difference between older obesity drugs and newer GLP-1s is that the former are taken orally, and you get the latter as shots."
