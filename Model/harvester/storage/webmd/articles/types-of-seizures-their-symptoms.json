        "Normally, your brain sends signals through your nervous system in a predictable, organized way. But sometimes, these signals get mixed up and cause a seizure. You might experience a seizure as a sudden change in how your brain works. It's like a burst of electrical activity that disrupts your normal brain function. This can cause you to feel confused for a short time, have uncontrollable movements, stare blankly, or even lose consciousness altogether. Seizures can happen for many reasons, and they can be mild or severe.",
