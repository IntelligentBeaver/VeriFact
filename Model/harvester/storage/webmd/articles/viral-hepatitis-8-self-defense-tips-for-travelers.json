This can occur via sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis B or C, by sharing personal items (nail trimmers, razors, drug paraphernalia, etc.) of an infected person, or from dirty hypodermic needles or transfusions of blood that wasn’t screened for hepatitis. Hepatitis B and C can lead to cirrhosis of the liver , liver cancer , and death."
