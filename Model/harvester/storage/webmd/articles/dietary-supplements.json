        "Not everyone needs a dietary supplement, but they can help some people. “Supplements can’t take the place of a healthy diet,” says Carol Haggans, a registered dietitian with the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements. Unlike drugs, supplements aren’t for preventing or treating illness or disease. But like drugs, they can have side effects. Though many of these things are naturally in foods, more isn’t always better – even for vitamins and minerals, Haggans says."

        "Some popular supplements include: Multivitamins They contain several vitamins and minerals your body needs, but most adults get enough from a well-rounded diet. Don’t expect multivitamins to stop you from getting diseases. They can be ideal for children or athletes, as well as people who are older, pregnant, lactating, or those with eating disorders or malabsorption issues, Richard says. What to look for: Check the Daily Value (DV) – a percentage of each nutrient included. Don’t choose one with 100% for each nutrient, as too much can be toxic. Collagen This protein in your body breaks down as you get older. It comes from plant and animal protein sources like chicken. Some studies have shown oral collagen plumps up your skin and makes it more elastic (or flexible). But more research is needed to determine if this is true. Generally, there aren’t major side effects. What to look for: Collagen peptides are the broken-down form of collagen. Studies suggest that between 2.5 grams and 15 grams per day is safe."

It’s in fatty fish, fortified milk, and cereals, but not many other foods. Vitamin D is important for bone and immune health and helps with nerve signaling. It’s generally safe, but too much can cause vomiting, weakness, or constipation. It can interact with medications like statins or steroids. Breastfed babies should take extra because human breastmilk doesn’t contain much. What to look for: Adults up to age 70 should get 600 IU (international units) daily. People over 70 should get 800 IU a day. Folate Women who can reproduce can prevent serious birth defects like spina bifida if they have enough folate (a B vitamin) when they become pregnant. Folic acid is the manmade version of folate. The vitamin supports cell function and DNA. It’s in cereal, pasta, beans, peas, nuts, bananas, oranges, and dark green veggies."

Ask your doctor about possible interactions with anticonvulsants, barbiturates, and other medicines. Most adults need 400 micrograms a day. If you’re pregnant, you will need 600 micrograms a day. This carb can help you stay regular and may help you maintain your weight, control blood sugar, and lower your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. You can get fiber from fruits, veggies, beans, nuts, and whole grains. More than 90% of women and 97% of men don’t get as much as they should. Both types of fiber – soluble and insoluble – have health benefits. Who it’s for: Ask your doctor about extra fiber if you have impacted stools. If you have diverticulitis , you may have been told to avoid fiber-rich foods like nuts, seeds, and popcorn, but evidence suggests they don’t worsen the condition – fiber can actually help. Fiber can delay or reduce how you absorb medications. Some experts say to take medicines at least 1 hour before taking fiber, or 2 hours to 4 hours after.",

Supplements typically include two omega-3s called docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) – they’re naturally in some fish. Another omega-3, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is in some seeds, nuts, and vegetable oils – most Americans get enough from food. “Your body can use omega 3s … to keep the heart, lungs, and hormones systems functioning and play an important role for your immune system,” Richard says. Fish oil can interact with some anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs and supplements, as well as medicines for blood pressure and birth control. It can lower your vitamin E levels. If you’re on orlistat (Xenical, Alli), take it about 2 hours apart from the medicine. Too much may raise your risk for bleeding or impact your immune system. It’s unclear if they’re safe if you’re allergic to seafood."

But if you’re a vegan, you may not be getting enough. And if you’re breastfeeding, your baby may not either. Vitamin B12 helps with nerve function, red blood cells, and generates DNA. “It’s a good idea for all people over 50 to supplement,” says Sharon Palmer, a registered dietitian nutritionist. If you’re on a proton pump inhibitor or other medications, you may be prone to vitamin B12 deficiency. High doses can cause nausea, headache, or fatigue.
