        "Seizures , abnormal movements or behavior due to unusual electrical activity in the brain , are a symptom of epilepsy. But not all people who appear to have seizures have epilepsy , a group of related disorders characterized by a tendency for recurrent seizures.",
        "Non-epileptic seizures (called pseudoseizures) are not accompanied by abnormal electrical activity in the brain and may be caused by psychological issues or stress. However, non-epileptic seizures look like true seizures, which makes diagnosis more difficult. Normal EEG readings and lack of response to epileptic drugs are two clues they are not true epileptic seizures. These types of seizures may be treated with psychotherapy and psychiatric medications .",
        "Provoked seizures are single seizures that may occur as the result of trauma, low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ), low blood sodium, high fever , or alcohol or drug abuse. Fever-related (or febrile) seizures may occur during infancy but are usually outgrown by age 6. After a careful evaluation to estimate the risk of recurrence, patients who suffer a single seizure may not need treatment.",
        "Seizure disorder is a general term used to describe any condition in which seizures may be a symptom. Seizure disorder is a general term that it is often used in place of the term ''epilepsy.''"
