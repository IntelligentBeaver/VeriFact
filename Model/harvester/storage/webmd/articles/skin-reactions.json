        "matters a lot, in addition,",
        "how much of it you use",
        "and where you use it.",
        "So bar soaps and fragrance soaps",
        "are drying,",
        "and I don't recommend them.",
        "I generally like",
        "a fragrance-free product, which,",
        "by the way,",
        "is different than unscented.",
        "Unscented products have",
        "a little bit of perfume.",
        "Fragrance-free products are",
        "completely free of all scent",
        "and are, therefore, less",
        "strong and irritating.",
        "Your skin could be dry",
        "because there's lack",
        "of moisture.",
        "But it also could be",
        "dry from dead skin cells",
        "on the surface.",
        "So it's a little",
        "counterintuitive, but some fruit",
        "acid moisturizers containing",
        "ingredients such as lactic acid",
        "or urea are especially",
        "good at taking off",
        "the dead cells.",
        "Once those dry, older cells are",
        "exfoliated, you can moisturize",
        "over the damp, remaining cells",
        "and really feel great.",
        "It will give your skin",
        "a dewy feel, and it will feel",
        "softer to the touch.",
        "Brushes and loofahs are OK,",
        "but they tend to collect",
        "bacteria in the shower.",
        "They're good for elbows, knees,",
        "feet, but they're not",
        "great for large body surfaces",
        "like the back or chest.",
        "They're a little bit harsh.",
        "Some people just get",
        "a little sense of dryness.",
        "Some people get a lot",
        "of itching.",
        "And some people even get cracks",
        "or fissures around their hands",
        "and feet.",
        "So there's a wide variety in how",
        "dry the skin can become.",
        "And in that regard, there's",
        "a wide variety of products",
        "to help treat dry skin.",
        "And that spans the gamut",
        "from lighter moisturizers that",
        "are liquid at room temperature",
        "to creams that are solid at room",
        "temperature.",
        "The most important feature",
        "is that you use these products",
        "on your damp skin",
        "so that they'll trap a little",
        "of that moisture",
        "in the top layer.",
        "Well, it can be confusing",
        "because there are so many types",
        "of moisturizers to choose from,",
        "but I generally like to make it",
        "simple.",
        "One for the face.",
        "One for the body.",
        "While you're not going to get",
        "a systemic illness",
        "from dry skin,",
        "although some people",
        "with illnesses",
        "show that with dryness.",
        "For instance, one",
        "of the main features",
        "of hypothyroidism or low thyroid",
        "is dry skin.",
        "So that's one thing your doctor",
        "would consider if drawing",
        "a blood test",
        "or during your checkup.",
        "But the take home messages",
        "are the same for everybody.",
        "Not too much soap.",
        "No fragrance.",
        "Shorter, cooler showers.",
        "And lots of moisturizer",
        "on your damp skin.",
        "And for the most part,",
        "you're going to get some relief",
        "immediately.",
        "For most people, beauty products are a quick, simple way to look great. But if you notice that you have skin reactions -- like irritation, rashes , or allergies -- to certain ingredients, these tips can help you steer clear.",
        "1. Check the label. Look for products with the fewest ingredients. This will make a bad reaction less likely.",
        "2. Do a patch test first. Before you start to use a new product, place a small amount on the inside of your elbow and wait 48 to 72 hours. If you notice no redness, swelling, itching, or burning on that spot, it’s OK for you to use.",
        "3. Spritz the smart way. Always put fragrance on your clothes, not your skin. You’ll be less likely to have a skin reaction to it. It also helps prevent the fragrance from having a bad reaction with other products you use.",
        "4. Be true to yourself. See how your skin responds. The labels \"hypoallergenic,\" \" dermatologist tested,\" \"sensitivity tested,\" or \"non-irritating\" don't guarantee that your skin won't react.",
        "5. Stop and soothe. If your skin reacts badly to a beauty product, stop using it immediately. You can sometimes use an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to help ease inflammation . In some cases, you might need a prescription-strength cream."

        "2. Skin allergies (allergic contact dermatitis). Sensitivity or a true allergy to a specific ingredient in the product causes redness, swelling, itching, or blisters on the skin. Fragrances and preservatives are some of the biggest culprits.",

        "To make sure no perfume is included, look for products marked “fragrance-free” or “without perfume.”",
