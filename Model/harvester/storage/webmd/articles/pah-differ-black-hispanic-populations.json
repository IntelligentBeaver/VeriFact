        "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare lung condition. When you have PAH, small arteries in your lungs thicken and narrow, which makes it hard for your blood to flow. That puts strain on your heart as it works harder to pump blood through narrowed arteries. It’s a progressive disease, which means it gets worse over time. PAH can shorten your life span and have a big impact on your quality of life. The sooner it is diagnosed, the better your odds. Some studies suggest people from certain ethnic and minority groups with PAH don’t fare as well as white patients. Researchers are digging into the reasons for those differences."
