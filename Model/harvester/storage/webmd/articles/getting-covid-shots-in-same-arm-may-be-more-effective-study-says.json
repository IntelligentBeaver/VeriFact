        "Aug. 21, 2023 -- People may get more protection against COVID-19 if they get their vaccinations and boosters in the same arm, a new study says.",
        "Scientists in Germany looked at health data for 303 people who got the MRA vaccine and then a booster shot. Their antibody levels were measured two weeks after the second shot. None of the people had had COVID before the vaccinations.",
        "Scientists found that the number of protective “killer T cells” was higher in the 147 study participants who got both shots in the same arm, said the study published in EBioMedicine .",
