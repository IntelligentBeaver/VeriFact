        "Let's start with the basics. Antacids neutralize excess stomach acid to relieve heartburn, sour stomach, acid indigestion, and stomach upset. They are sometimes prescribed in addition to other meds to help relieve the pain of stomach and duodenal ulcers. Some antacids also contain simethicone, an ingredient that helps eliminate excess gas.",
        "You should take antacids exactly as directed by your doctor, or according to the manufacturer's directions. For stomach or duodenal ulcers, take the medicine for as long as your doctor tells you. If you are using the tablets, chew them well before swallowing for faster relief.",
        "Serious side effects can occur with an overdose or overuse of antacids. Side effects include constipation , diarrhea , change in the color of bowel movements, and stomach cramps . Products containing calcium may cause kidney stones and are more likely to cause constipation.",
        "Products like famotidine ( Pepcid -AC) are called histamine -2 blockers or H2 blockers. These drugs reduce production of stomach acid and are available in prescription-strength or in lower doses in over-the-counter varieties. These products are for relief of heartburn , acid indigestion, sour stomach, and other conditions, such as stomach ulcers.",
        "Another type of heartburn medication, known as proton pump inhibitors, may be used when antacids or H2 blockers fail. PPIs block the secretion of acid from the stomach. Prilosec (omeprazole), Lansoprazole (Prevacid), and esomeprazole (Nexium 24HR) can be bought over the counter. Pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant ) , and esomeprazole (Nexium) are examples of other PPIs that are available only by prescription."

        "People with a hiatal hernia who also have severe, chronic esophageal reflux may need surgery to correct the problem if their symptoms are not relieved through these management techniques. Surgery may also be needed to reduce the size of the hernia if it is in danger of becoming constricted or strangulated (so that the blood supply is cut off). During surgery, gastroesophageal reflux is corrected by pulling the hiatal hernia back into the abdomen and creating an improved valve mechanism at the bottom of the esophagus. The surgeon wraps the upper part of the stomach (called the fundus) around the lower portion of the esophagus. This creates a tighter sphincter so that food will not reflux back into the esophagus.",
        "Hiatal hernia surgery can be performed either by opening the abdominal cavity or laparoscopically. During laparoscopic surgery, five or six small (5 to 10 millimeter) incisions are made in the abdomen. The laparoscope and surgical instruments are inserted through these incisions. The surgeon is guided by the laparoscope, which transmits a picture of the internal organs on a monitor. The advantages of laparoscopic surgery include smaller incisions, less risk of infection, less pain and scarring, and a more rapid recovery."
