The virus causes painful sores, most commonly on or around your lips, but you may also get sores on your tongue, the roof of your mouth, and inside your cheeks. These sores are also called \"cold sores\" or \"fever blisters.\" HSV can also cause symptoms such as fever and muscle aches, especially during your first outbreak of infection.",
