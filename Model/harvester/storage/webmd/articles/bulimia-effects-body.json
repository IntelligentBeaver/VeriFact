If it tears, it can cause severe and life-threatening bleeding. This is known as Mallory-Weiss syndrome. Bright red blood in your vomit is a symptom of this syndrome.",
        "Burst esophagus. Repeated forceful vomiting can also cause your esophagus to burst. This is called Boerhaave syndrome. It's an emergency and needs immediate surgery.",

        "Diabetes connection. If you have type 1 diabetes and an eating disorder , you may also have a condition that has been called diabulimia . The term describes people with diabetes who need insulin but deliberately take less than they're supposed to in an effort to lose weight . This can lead to serious health problems like stroke, coma, and death.",
