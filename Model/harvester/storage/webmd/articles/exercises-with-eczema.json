        "The hardest part of exercising with eczema is that sweat can trigger a flare-up. Your body is designed to sweat to regulate your temperature and keep you from overheating. By doing this, though, your sweat creates moisture that evaporates and dries out the skin, leaving behind a salty residue. The residue is what irritates your eczema and makes you itchy.",
        "Even though sweat is a barrier, it shouldn't keep you from working out. There are far too many benefits to being physically active for your physical and mental health. You may have to adjust your physical activity. If allergens like grass and sweat make your skin itchy and sore, you may take your workout inside.",
