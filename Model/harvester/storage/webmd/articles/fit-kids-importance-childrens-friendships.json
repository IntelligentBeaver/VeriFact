Learning about friendships hadn't come into focus until now. As a pediatrician , I know that figuring out how to build friendships and handle relationship change is important -- even for young kids. I realized I couldn't shield her.",

More studies are needed, but many child psychologists suspect children who feel loneliness may be affected over the long term, possibly with lower self-esteem and an increased likelihood of being a lonely adult. One study looked at 242 students in sixth grade. Those who did not have friendships reported being sadder and feeling less self-worth than their peers."
