        "Dawnzera (donidalorsen) is a new medicine approved to help prevent attacks of a rare genetic swelling disorder known as hereditary angioedema (HAE) in people aged 12 or older. Affecting about 7,000 people in the U.S., HAE causes repeated episodes of sudden, painful swelling in areas like your face, throat, stomach, genitals, or arms and legs and can become life-threatening if your airways are affected.",
        "Dawnzera is the first medicine for HAE that works by targeting RNA, the genetic material your body uses to make certain proteins. Dawnzera blocks the production of a protein called plasma prekallikrein, which plays a key role in triggering inflammation and swelling during HAE attacks. Its targeted approach and less frequent dosing may offer a simpler way to manage HAE, especially for people who experience sudden and painful flare-ups despite treatments."

Those who switched from other long-term HAE treatments to Dawnzera saw a 62% drop in attack frequency over 16 weeks, with no increase in flare-ups. Most people who made the switch said they preferred Dawnzera because it gave them better control of their condition, was easier to use, and caused less pain or reactions where it was injected.",
