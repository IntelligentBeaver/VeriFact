        "The small and large intestines are a 25-foot-long tube coiled inside your abdomen. The gut barrier lines the tube and protects the health of the gut as well as the rest of the body.",
        "It may sound odd, but the gut must “leak” to support your wellbeing. In medical terms, this so-called leaking is referred to as “permeability.” A healthy gut barrier is permeable, but it’s picky about what it allows to leave the gut. The gut barrier is a smart filter with tiny gaps that allows water, nutrients, and other beneficial compounds into the bloodstream.",
        "Infection, inflammation, or other damage to the gut barrier, which is often seen in intestinal diseases such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and certain infections, enlarges gaps in the gut barrier. Bigger gaps allow compounds, including harmful bacteria, toxins, and undigested food, to seep into the blood and cause problems. This is called increased intestinal permeability or IIP."
