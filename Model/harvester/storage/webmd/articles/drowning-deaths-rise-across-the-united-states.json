        "Meanwhile, more than half of U.S. adults have never taken a single swimming lesson, and 15% of adults do not know how to swim, according to survey data released alongside the CDC’s new unintentional drowning report . About two-thirds of people are comfortable swimming in water over their head, the survey showed.",
        "Drowning deaths increased a dramatic 10.5% from 2019 to 2020, from 4,067 deaths in 2019 to 4,589 in 2020. During the prior decade, annual drowning deaths in the U.S. had stayed around 4,000 or less. But since the pandemic’s onset, the number has topped 4,500 annually. The report included new preliminary numbers for 2022, putting that year’s drowning total at 4,509."
