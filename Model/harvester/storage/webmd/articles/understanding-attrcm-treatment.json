        "Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a condition that happens when a protein that your liver makes -- called transthyretin (TTR) -- doesn't work right. Clumps of the protein deposit within your heart's muscles. These deposits can cause your heart's main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, to become stiff and weak. As a result, the heart has to work a lot harder to pump blood. The deposits can also lead to nerve damage, with symptoms of pain, tingling or numbness, and weakness. ATTR is uncommon, but it can be life-threatening. There's no cure, but medications can slow disease progression and help you feel better. Your treatment plan may depend on the type of ATTR you have and how severe it is. It might also include supportive therapies to help with symptoms and boost your quality of life."
