        "Nov. 12, 2024 – Doctors and researchers can assess an older person’s health in a few ways.",
        "A handgrip test, for example, is simple to do, and decades of research have shown links between grip strength and health risks, including early death.",
        "Other tests, like timing how fast someone can walk down a hallway or measuring the length of their strides, are a bit more complicated. But the results can show if that person is at risk of falling or becoming disabled.",
        "Both tests have one key disadvantage: You need either special equipment or a trained observer to get accurate measurements.",
        "But there’s one test you can do by yourself, at home, with nothing more than the stopwatch on your smartphone – the one-leg balance test.",
        "And now there’s a compelling reason why you might want to: The length of time you can stand on one leg may indicate how fast you’re aging at the neuromuscular level.",
        "That’s according to a new study from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, which compared volunteers in their 50s with those who were 20 years older."
