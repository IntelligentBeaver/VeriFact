        "Take it from Sarah O'Meara, a mother of three: accidents take only seconds. When her first child was around 3 months old, she was changing his diaper, and because he wasn't moving around much at that age, she didn't strap him onto the changing table. She let go for just a moment to grab something, and boom, he hit the floor.",
        "Fortunately the baby wasn't hurt. \"But it was really frightening, just to hear that thump on the floor,\" O'Meara recalls. The experience was enough to turn her into a die-hard changing-table strapper. \"I thought he was too little to roll over, but it's the same old story -- they always roll over when you think they can't.\"",
        "O'Meara and her baby boy were lucky. Nearly 800 babies died in accidents in 1997, and thousands wound up in hospital emergency rooms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And when an accident sends a baby under 6 months to the ER, it's most likely to have been a fall.",

If your baby is heavier than 20 pounds but not yet a year old, find a seat that converts from rear- to front-facing. For small infants or low-birth weight babies, a five-point harness fits better than a shield-type harness.",

Unfortunately, 85% of all car seats are installed or used improperly, according to studies by the National Safe Kids Campaign. If you're unsure about your car seat, before you strap baby in, have it checked out by a certified car seat technician. Local hospitals and many General Motors dealers provide the service free in conjunction with the Safe Kids campaign. For details, visit the Web sites for Safe Kids or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which provides a searchable database of car seat technicians."
