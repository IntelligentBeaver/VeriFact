        "Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a type of muscular dystrophy , which is a group of genetic disorders. DM is the most common kind of muscular dystrophy in adults. Symptoms usually show up around your 20s or 30s, but they can happen at any age. Myotonic dystrophy causes muscle wasting and weakness that gets worse over time. These symptoms can make it hard to relax your muscles after gripping or holding something.",
        "At least 1 out of 8,000 people worldwide have myotonic dystrophy. In most geographic and ethnic groups, more people have myotonic dystrophy type one than myotonic dystrophy type two. But experts recently found that type two may be just as common as type one in Germany and Finland."
