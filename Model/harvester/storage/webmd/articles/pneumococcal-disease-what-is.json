The germ causes two main pneumococcal diseases: These are milder infections that stay in one place and don't spread to major organs or your bloodstream. Invasive . More serious infections are called invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The bacteria infect your blood and major organs — parts of your body that don’t typically harbor bacteria, like your brain or lungs. IPD causes death in about 10 people out of 100.

Pneumococcal bacteria can spread and you can get sick through: Coughing or sneezing, and you breathe in the droplets in the air Close contact with someone who is ill, handling mucus or saliva Touching infected mucus or saliva on it and you then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. Once pneumococcus enters your body, the first three days are usually symptom free. It’s called the incubation period, the bacteria makes copies of itself to infect your body and others. Around day four, pneumococcus bacteria can infect other people through your mucus or saliva. Because carriers don’t get symptoms, it’s unclear how long pneumococcus stays infectious. About 20 to 40 children are carriers out of 100. But only 5 to 10 adults carry the bacteria out of 100."
