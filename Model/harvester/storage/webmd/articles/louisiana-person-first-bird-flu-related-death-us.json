        "Jan. 7, 2025 – A person in Louisiana exposed to bird flu by a backyard flock has died. This marks the first U.S. human death linked to H5N1 avian flu, which has increasingly been detected in humans, cattle, and other wild and domestic animals.",
        "The person was more than 65 years old and had unspecified underlying health conditions, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, which announced in mid-December that the person was hospitalized with a severe case. The person’s infection also followed exposure to wild birds in addition to backyard poultry, the department said.",
        "“While tragic, a death from H5N1 bird flu in the United States is not unexpected because of the known potential for infection with these viruses to cause severe illness and death,” a CDC news release stated.",
        "In the past year, 66 people have had confirmed cases of bird flu in the U.S. The World Health Organization logged 939 human cases globally since 2003, of which 464 were fatal, although most cases and deaths occurred prior to 2015. Last year, there were three human deaths linked to bird flu worldwide."
