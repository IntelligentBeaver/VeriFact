        "Taxanes have been used for many years to treat breast cancer because they can be very effective. A few years ago, researchers reviewed 29 breast cancer treatment studies that included thousands of women. They found that taxanes improved survival rates among women with early breast cancer who would be treated with surgery, and they lowered the rate of returning cancer. The taxanes did, however, increase the risk of some side effects – most commonly low white blood cell counts ( neutropenia ) and nerve damage that causes weakness and pain or numbness in the hands and feet (neuropathy) – compared with women who had chemotherapy without taxanes.",
        "For metastatic breast cancer:",
        "Given as palliative chemotherapy – that means treatment that extends life but doesn’t cure cancer – taxanes with other chemotherapy drugs can increase chances for survival. Researchers looked at studies evaluating taxanes as treatment for metastatic breast cancer. And they showed that overall, taxanes usually slowed down the cancer’s progress.",
        "Although taxanes are often used for HER-positive breast cancer, they can also be used for women with triple-negative breast cancer. It’s called triple-negative breast cancer , or TNBC, because the cancer cells don’t have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and the HER2 protein."
