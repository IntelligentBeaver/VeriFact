        "Choosing the right formula can feel daunting for any parent, but when your baby has severe allergies, intolerance issues, or GI conditions, you’ll need to make your choice very carefully. About 80% of the formulas on the market are made with cow’s milk. All babies under 1 lack the ability to digest cow’s milk properly, which is why formula companies alter the milk proteins in their products in a way that makes the formula safe for babies to have. But for babies with an allergy or intolerance to dairy, this process isn’t enough to make the formula digestible. Fortunately, there are hypoallergenic options made with milk proteins that are broken down into much smaller parts so your baby’s digestive system doesn’t have to do the work."

Babies with GI issues such as allergic proctocolitis or enterocolitis, conditions that cause inflammation in the GI tract, have a 25% to 60% chance of reacting to soy formulas. Partially hydrolyzed formula. The milk proteins in partially hydrolyzed formula have been broken down into small pieces, but these pieces aren’t small enough not to trigger an allergic reaction in babies with a cow’s milk intolerance. This option isn’t hypoallergenic but is often labeled “gentle” for babies with easily upset tummies. It can be an option for babies with an intolerance to dairy. Lactose-free formula. If your baby has signs of intolerance, the issue could be the sugar in the milk, lactose. Lactose-free formula is refined so that the lactose content is modified and replaced with a different form of sugar."
