        "Jan. 29, 2000 -- A mysterious, brain -destroying condition similar to mad cow disease has been identified in herds of elk and deer in several Western states, but scientists say so far there is no evidence that the fatal illness can be transmitted to humans.",
        "Â",
        "But they caution that there is no proof it can't, either.",
        "Â",
        "\"Right now, we have no evidence that humans are susceptible. Obviously, we can't say that that can't happen,\" says Beth Williams, DVM, PhD, a professor of veterinary science at the University of Wyoming who was among a panel of FDA advisors reporting on the ailment, called chronic wasting disease (CWD), to the agency at a meeting on Jan. 19.",
        "Â",
        "The panel concluded there was no evidence that humans could get CWD from eating elk or venison, or from nutritional supplements made from antlers. Nor was there evidence, they said, that hunters should be prevented from donating blood .",
        "Â",
        "More at risk may be the $150 million elk-breeding industry, which has destroyed 13 of its 3,600 herds so far, and the economies of Western states where hunting is big business. In Colorado, where up to 15% of the mule deer are affected, the sport generates $800 million annually, says Dale Lashnits, a spokesman for the state Division of Wildlife, adding that the state sold 300,000 hunting licenses in 1999, the last year for which figures are available."
