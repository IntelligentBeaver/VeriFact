In July 2002, WHI researchers reported that long-term use of the most commonly used hormone replacement preparation of estrogen and progestin, Prempro , could increase a woman's risk of heart disease, stroke, and invasive breast cancer .",

In the estrogen-only group, there was no increase or decrease in heart disease . However, women taking estrogen-only hormone therapy had a slightly increased risk of stroke , a risk similar to that seen in the estrogen and progestin study.",
        "As a result, the search for a non-drug approach to managing menopausal symptoms has accelerated, with many women looking toward soy for deliverance from the raging heat within. And, in fact, they're finding many soy products that are being marketed as nutritional fire extinguishers."

For that reason, I don't have a problem with someone saying, 'On the days that I don't eat two servings per day, I'll take a pill to bring my level up to the recommended amount.'
