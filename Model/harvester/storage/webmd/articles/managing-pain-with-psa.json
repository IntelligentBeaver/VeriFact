        "As a patient with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, I have experienced a few rather physically painful conditions. Occasionally, I am forced to “soldier through” the pain, through my own form of meditation or mental deflection or diversion. But I am never reluctant to take prescribed medications to relieve and/or limit the pain, especially when it limits my ability to do my work and live my life to the fullest.",

        "A week after my state bar exam, I was on vacation in Canada, and one morning my neck cracked loudly. I bought a foam collar to hold up my head, and I ended up cutting short my vacation. During an examination, an orthopedist heard about my prior stress and prescribed an opiate-like medication that allows you to manage pain. Within a couple of weeks, I returned to normal use of my head and neck, but I was careful not to drive a car while on that medication."

        "In 1996, while climbing into bed, my left knee locked in a ninety-degree angle and was excruciatingly painful (my #1 lifetime experience with pain). Close to midnight, we called my physician who prescribed the same medication, and asked me to call him in the morning if the pain persisted. The next morning, I was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where an orthopedist performed a meniscectomy (repair of the meniscus) and removed excess synovial lining of the knee. I took a short dose of morphine for a week to control the pain, but the surgery solved the problem. This experience was a foreshadowing of major joint replacements in the future.",
        "In 2003, I began to have sharp pain in my right wrist (my dominant side), which prevented me from typing or writing. A hand surgeon took X-rays, gave me a cortisone shot, and prescribed a customized splint for that wrist and hand. Shortly thereafter, the pain subsided, and the wrist returned to normal function. I continue to use that splint as necessary, plus one developed for my left wrist when that one acts up."

        "In 2008, my wife and I took a plane from California to Florida to board a cruise ship for a well-deserved vacation. One hour into the 5-hour flight, I developed an unbearable pain in my left elbow. I elevated my arm, but nothing worked to stop the pain, which frankly caused me to cry. When we arrived in Florida about 5 a.m. local time, we had a driver drop us off at a local hospital, where I had an MRI, and the emergency room physician told me I had experienced a condition referred to as “tennis elbow.” (Ironically, I had not played tennis for about 20 years at that time, and my tennis was only played with my right arm.) I asked the ER physician to give me an infusion of morphine or cortisone into the elbow. He told me that he wouldn’t do either because the ER area was rife with infection, and such a treatment could only be performed in an orthopedist’s office. He did, however, give me a prescription for the same opiate-like medication, which I was able to fill right away at the hospital outpatient pharmacy. There was no way I could have had an appointment with an orthopedist and then made the cruise, so I waited for a few hours to call my physician in California. He assured me that the pain medication should work quickly, and that the cruise ship physician should be able to treat whatever had happened with my elbow. A couple days later, normal function returned to that elbow.",
        "Around 2014, I felt a strong and persistent pain on the right side of my abdomen. When a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) did not calm it down, we drove to the emergency room. The ER physician was female, and she assured my wife and me that the pain of kidney stones was greater than that of childbirth. An infusion of morphine resolved the pain, and the muscle relaxant in the morphine caused the stone to pass within 24 hours (without any surgery). I started taking an anti-gout medication to try to prevent the development of any further kidney stones, and it has worked."

Unfortunately, the shingles triggered lingering, chronic post-herpetic pain on my right side, so I take a daily dose of a nerve pain medication.",
