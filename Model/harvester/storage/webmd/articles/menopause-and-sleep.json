        "Welcome to the signs of approaching menopause . In addition to hot flashes and mood swings, many of my patients report difficulty sleeping. Although some 40% of premenopausal women report sleep problems, this percentage can double from the onset of perimenopause (the transition into menopause, beginning as early as the late 30s for some women) through postmenopause. That's a lot of women missing out on a good night's sleep .",
        "During this transitional time, the ovaries gradually decrease production of estrogen and progesterone (a sleep-promoting hormone). Hot flashes , typically accompanied by a surge of adrenaline, can result. And when they happen in the middle of the night, a woman may find it very hard to settle back into slumberland."
