        "A friend of mine recently went to the ER with her mother-in-law, who’d been vomiting for two days. At the hospital, she was diagnosed with gastroparesis, a digestive disorder that happens when the stomach empties so slowly that it triggers abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.",
        "Turns out she was taking a GLP-1 agonist to treat diabetes and obesity. Partly, these medications work by slowing down stomach emptying, which creates a feeling of fullness that can help you eat less and lose weight.",
        "But people taking these medications also have a higher risk of gastroparesis, which affects the nerves and muscles of the stomach and can cause serious complications like dehydration and malnutrition.",
        "Currently, about 1 in 8 people in the U.S. are taking a GLP-1 medication. The medications have been shown to help you lose up to 20% of your body weight, which can improve your health in dramatic ways. The drugs may even help quiet cravings for drinking alcohol and smoking."
