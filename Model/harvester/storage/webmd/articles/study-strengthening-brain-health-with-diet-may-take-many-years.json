        "July 19, 2023 -- Researchers studying a diet designed to improve brain health say were surprised by the results of a recent experiment because subjects on the MIND diet did not show greater brain health than those on a control diet after three years.",
        "About half of the 604 participants followed the Mediterranean–DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet for three years. The other half had only mild caloric restrictions.",
        "“Among cognitively unimpaired participants with a family history of dementia, changes in cognition and brain MRI outcomes … did not differ significantly between those who followed the MIND diet and those who followed the control diet,” the study’s authors wrote.",
        "The MIND diet did improve the brains of those who followed it for three years. Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed fewer tiny lesions and more grey matter and white matter, the brain’s cognitive center and “communication highway,” respectively, CNN reported.",
        "But the brains of the participants who were not following the MIND diet showed similar improvement."
