        "Having psoriasis also puts you at risk for psoriatic arthritis (PsA), an inflammatory disease that affects the joints. About one-third of people with psoriasis will get PsA , but painful, swollen joints sometimes don't appear until many years after psoriasis starts. Psoriasis affects each person differently. Some have mild symptoms, while others have severe symptoms. Each bout of symptoms is called a flare. If you do develop PsA, early treatment is important. The sooner you start on medicine, the better your chance of avoiding joint damage and disability. You'll be more likely to get prompt treatment if you know the symptoms of PsA and report them to your doctor right away. Along with the psoriasis rash, these are some warning signs of PsA you should know about."
