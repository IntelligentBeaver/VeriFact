        "This was no surprise to me as I was way too familiar with the ground meeting my face on a regular basis. Years of ballet lessons were not enough to combat the deterioration of myelin associated with my multiple sclerosis (MS) and resulting a lack of basic coordination.",
        "I knew I wasn’t alone in the “I Can Do It Myself!” Club. This club is housed of stubborn, self-sufficient, hard-headed folks like me who loathe the thought of asking for help or needing assistance. We enjoy being the superhero type. The “fixers.” Sound familiar?",
        "The shift in which the fixer becomes the fixee can lead to a tricky algorithm. For me, it required some humility, patience, and an overall bigger sense of self-acceptance. Knowing that using a mobility aid would mean less face-to-ground contact was pretty appealing. Fewer ripped pants. Less bruised knees. Fewer crowd-roaring gasps of shock and disbelief. Fewer assumptions that I may have got into a bar fight."

I wanted my cane to feel like an extension of me -- something I was proud to use and wear. Nobody is going to go to their optometrist saying, “I’d like the ugliest frames in stock please.”",

I felt discouraged, and even a little embarrassed, seeing mobility aids in general being marketed to seniors only. No disrespect at all to my elders -- I just wasn’t quite there yet. I wanted to see people in my age bracket sporting walking canes and modeling them. I wanted to find those I could relate to."

        "I think there’s quite a bit of “shock factor” when it comes to mobility aids, especially for the younger generations using them. I guarantee if you do an online search right now for walking canes, 99% of the marketing will target seniors. But what if we widened our target audience and changed the algorithm? The element of shame that comes with using a mobility aid for younger generations may be reduced when we see them being used in a more relatable way."
