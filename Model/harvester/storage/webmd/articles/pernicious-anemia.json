        "Pernicious anemia (PA) is a rare autoimmune condition where your body can’t make enough healthy red blood cells because it lacks vitamin B12. PA affects people of all ages, but mostly those over 60. It's just one of the causes of B12 deficiency. A long time ago, pernicious anemia was fatal (“pernicious” means \"deadly\"). These days it’s easily treated with B12 pills or shots. With treatment, you can live without symptoms.",
