The researchers expressed concern about the sheer number of people who newly developed the condition, which over time can severely damage a person’s arteries, heart, and other parts of the body.",

The people did not have a history of high blood pressure, which is also sometimes called hypertension. All of the people were treated at the Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, NY,  and had returned to the hospital system for any medical reason within an average of 6 months."
