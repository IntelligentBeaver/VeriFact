      ],
      "bullets": [
        "Water vapor thermal therapy . A doctor places a device into the tube through which you pee (your urethra). A small needle on the end of the device delivers water vapor (steam) to destroy the extra prostate tissue that’s been squeezing your urethra. As you heal, the extra tissue breaks down and goes away, which lets your prostate shrink. Most often, you get this procedure in your doctor’s office. You’re given local anesthesia or a pill for pain.",
        "Transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT) . This procedure uses a microwave antenna attached to a flexible tube that your doctor inserts into your bladder . The microwave heat kills off excess prostate tissue. This helps shrink your prostate and eases the flow of pee. You're given a local anesthetic to prevent pain in the prostate area. You also might get intravenous (IV) sedation, which helps you relax and feel drowsy. In general, TUMT is only for men with smaller prostates in certain situations because there’s a chance you’ll need the surgery again some day.",
        "Prostatic urethral lift (PUL) . This procedure uses a permanently placed device to lift and hold the enlarged prostate tissue out of the way, so it no longer blocks the urethra. The procedure does not affect sexual function. It is typically performed using local or general anesthesia in a doctor's office, ambulatory surgery center, or operating room. Patients typically return home the same day without a catheter .",
        "Temporary implanted prostatic devices (TIPD) . Your doctor uses a thin, lighted tube called a cystoscope to place a device in your urethra. The device helps reshape the channel that pee passes through. This can lead to better flow of urine and fewer symptoms of BPH. Your doctor removes the device after about a week.",
        "Catheterization . A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is placed into your bladder to drain urine. The catheter goes through your urethra or through a small puncture in your bladder above the pubic bone. Your doctor may have you place and remove the catheter every six to eight hours, or leave it in for longer amounts of time. This procedure can help if you have trouble controlling your bladder and a blocked prostate, but the benefits don’t last long. Your doctor might suggest it if you’re waiting for BPH medicine to work, waiting for surgery, managing an infection, or if you can’t get surgery.",
        "Prostate artery embolization (PAE) . This procedure blocks blood flow to your prostate in an attempt to shrink the whole gland and make your symptoms better. PAE may ease urinary symptoms in the short term, but there’s not enough research for experts to recommend it over other minimally invasive procedures for most men with BPH. A doctor called an interventional radiologist does PAE. They have experience using imaging tests (like X-ray, MRI , and ultrasound) that let them see inside your body and guide them during procedures."

        "Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) . This is a common surgery to treat BPH. Your doctor removes portions of the prostate that are affecting your urine flow. There is no cutting and no external scars are seen since a scope is inserted through the urethra to remove the excess tissue. With TURP, some men might get what’s called “retrograde ejaculation” (ejaculation of semen into the bladder instead of through the urethra).",
        "Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) . This surgery does not involve removing prostate tissue. A few small cuts are made in the prostate to reduce the gland's pressure on the urethra, making urination easier. This procedure is an option for some men, such as those with smaller prostates. With TUIP, there is much less risk of retrograde ejaculation compared with TURP. However, it usually gives you symptom relief equal to TURP. One possible downside: Some men need a repeat TUIP. Doctors decide which to use based mainly on the prostate's size.",
        "Laser surgery . A doctor uses laser energy to kill prostate tissue and shrink the gland. This may not be as effective on larger prostates. Laser procedures usually give you symptom relief and better urinary flow similar to TURP. But some laser therapies cause fewer side effects than others and also reduce the risk of bleeding. Long-term studies are needed to find out whether laser treatments are as effective as TURP. There are two main types of laser surgery: Ablation procedures can get rid of prostate tissue that block the flow of urine; one example of this is called photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP). Enucleative procedures remove prostate tissue that blocks urine flow and keeps the tissue from growing back; an example of this is called holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP).",
