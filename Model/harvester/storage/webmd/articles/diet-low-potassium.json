This essential mineral keeps your muscles healthy and your heartbeat and blood pressure steady. If you have a heart or kidney condition, though, your doctor may recommend a low-potassium diet. Your kidneys are responsible for keeping a healthy amount of potassium in your body. If they're not working right, you may get too much or too little. If you have too much potassium in your blood, it can cause cardiac arrest -- when your heart suddenly stops beating. If you have too little potassium in your blood, it can cause an irregular heartbeat. Your muscles may also feel weak."

        "Bread (not whole grain) Cake (angel or yellow) Coffee (8 ounces) Cookies (no nuts or chocolate) Noodles Pasta Pies (no chocolate or high-potassium fruit) Rice Tea (16 ounces max) Here's a trick: You can lower the potassium levels in certain vegetables by a cooking process called leaching. Try this on white and sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, winter squash, and rutabagas. Fill a pot with warm water. Peel your vegetable and rinse it in warm water, then cut it into 1/8th-inch-thick slices. Rinse the slices and soak them in the pot for 2 hours. When you pull them out, rinse them again with warm water. Drain the water in the pot, fill it again, and cook your vegetable. If you want to leach more than one vegetable at a time, soak them in 10 times the amount of water to the amount of vegetables. And when you cook them, use five times more water than vegetables. Based on the amount of potassium that's right for you, ask your doctor or nutritionist how to balance high- and low-potassium foods in each meal."
