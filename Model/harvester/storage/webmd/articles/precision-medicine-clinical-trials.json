        "Today’s phase III clinical trials tend to be large and involve thousands of people with one disease. The response rate can be surprisingly low, even for drugs that get approved. A precision medicine trial lets researchers study treatments that target just one aspect of disease -- say, a genetic mutation or lifestyle trait -- that only some people have.",
        "You only study people who can respond. If you have responders, and you’ve eliminated nonresponders, the effect is much larger, says Robert Temple, MD, the deputy center director for clinical science at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “We call that predictive enrichment.”",
        "In contrast, he says, when a drug can only help a small group of people, it won’t have great results in a regular clinical trial. An example here would be the cystic fibrosis drug ivacaftor (Kalydeco), approved in 2012 for patients with a specific gene mutation that affects only about 4% of people with cystic fibrosis.",
        "Will smaller trials with better results mean faster drug approvals? That part of the puzzle is still unknown. “We always weigh benefits against risks. If you do something spectacular, you can get away with smaller numbers [in trials], but it doesn’t change the fundamental process. You’re still demonstrating effectiveness, still demonstrating safety,” Temple says. And that can still take years."
