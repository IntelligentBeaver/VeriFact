        "Among people with deep vein thrombosis , or DVT , around 30% will develop post-thrombotic syndrome. Also called chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), it happens when the high blood pressure from DVT harms valves in your leg veins.",
        "These valves – or one-way, swinging-door like flaps called leaflets – act as a barrier to stop blood from leaking back down your veins, a condition called reflux. When damaged, the one-way leaflets can weaken and give way so that when you stand or sit, your blood not only can flow backward, but pool in one place. Pressure can build up and swell your veins, which can pull apart the leaflets below it, too, and make the problem worse.",
        "Past treatments for deep-vein CVI have mainly eased symptoms, such as meds to aid blood flow or compression garments like stockings.",
        "But there’s good news on the technology front. The FDA has recently fast tracked a new bioprosthetic venous valve that replaces the damaged valve and mimics normal functions. Studies have shown that having surgery to insert the new valve can help curb reflux, improve the condition of the disease, sharply reduce pain, and enhance quality of life."
