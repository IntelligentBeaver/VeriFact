        "If you have metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), it’s critical to monitor your liver health. Blood tests that measure liver function are one way to do that. Many at-home liver function tests are on the market, allowing you to check your liver function from home. At-home tests can be especially important for Hispanic communities, as they’re more likely to be affected by MASLD. This means you might be at a higher risk just because of your ethnicity. But doctors warn to use these tests as screening tools and not as replacements for liver disease care. As a screening tool, the tests give a general view of your liver health. If the tests show that something is off, it’s time to head to your doctor for all future tests."

This test measures levels of albumin and globulins, which are proteins mostly made in your liver. Liver enzymes. Liver tests can look at levels of ALP (alkaline phosphatase), ALT (alanine transaminase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), and GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase). These liver enzymes, or proteins, can play a role in liver function and indicate if something is not working as well as it should. Bilirubin. This is a substance your body makes when breaking down old red blood cells. It’s your liver's job to remove it. Bilirubin gives bile its yellow color. A bilirubin test (called TBil or total bilirubin) measures the amount of bilirubin in your blood. High levels might mean there are problems with converting bilirubin into bile or blockages in the bile ducts."

Quest Health offers an at-home fatty liver panel that measures ALT, AST, and platelets in your blood.
