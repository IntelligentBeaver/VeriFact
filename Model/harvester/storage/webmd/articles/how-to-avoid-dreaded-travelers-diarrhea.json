        "I’d been planning the trip for months: A week in Costa Rica with my husband and two kids. Things were going great. We were hiking through the rainforest, gazing in wonder at waterfalls, and navigating the winding roads like pros.",
        "Halfway through the trip, I started to feel queasy. What I thought was a case of car sickness got worse and worse. I spent the next day and night with the most awful case of diarrhea I’ve ever had.",
        "I experienced what’s referred to as “traveler’s diarrhea,” the most common illness for travelers. It’s usually caused by drinking water or eating food that’s contaminated by bacteria. That can happen when food service workers (or you!) aren’t handling food safely or properly washing hands – and because your system isn’t used to the kinds of bacteria in that region. Viruses like norovirus and parasites trigger a smaller number of cases.",
        "Beyond diarrhea, you can also have nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, weakness, and even fever. It can happen to any traveler, but some are at greater risk, including those with weaker immune systems, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and who take acid-reducing medicines."

        "So how can you enjoy the adventure of traveling but reduce your chances of being down for the count on your dream vacation? Though you can’t eliminate the risk completely, here are some things you can do:",

If drinking tap water isn’t advised, use bottled water for drinking and brushing your teeth, and skip ice in your beverages. Keep your mouth closed when showering and when swimming in local waters.",

In higher-risk areas, follow the adage “boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it,” which means avoiding things like fresh fruit you can’t peel, raw veggies like salad, and raw fish. Food from street carts can also be risky. In my case, I suspect that fresh mango, cut by the proprietor of a roadside stand, was my downfall."
