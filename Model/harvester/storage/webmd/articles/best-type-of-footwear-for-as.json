        "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a kind of arthritis that affects the spine. It usually starts with stiffness and pain in the back after periods of low physical activity. The symptoms ease with activity but can become ongoing with symptoms spreading to the heels, shoulder, ribs, and neck. The spine bones may fuse when the condition is severe. This makes the affected joints stiff and inflexible.",
        "The human foot has 52 bones, over 200 muscles and tendons, and 66 joints. They support our skeletal system and provide balance and movement. If someone with arthritis in the ankles, feet, knees, or hips wears the wrong shoe, that can make existing problems even worse and create complications down the road.",
        "A good supportive shoe for those with arthritis can usually be found in an athletic stability shoe. Stability shoes have a cushioned midsole and heel that controls motion. They take the weight off the ball of the foot, which is important for those dealing with arthritis."
