Without my support network, I wouldn't be here today.",

I must know them well enough to feel comfortable in my vulnerability. They must also recognize that I can't communicate very well when I'm in pain. They're not allowed to treat me with pity. And they must understand that sometimes, just being present is enough."

Recovery from a crisis isn't complete once the pain has stopped or a patient has been released from the hospital. It takes a while to return to optimal health, so be patient and supportive. During the recovery stage, gauging your patient or loved one’s mobility and mental well-being can be challenging. They will become more autonomous daily, but finding balance is essential. Therefore, talk with your loved one about how you can aid in their recovery.",
