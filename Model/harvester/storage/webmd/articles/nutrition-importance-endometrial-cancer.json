        "You’ve probably heard the advice: Eat more plants. Cut back on sugar. Avoid red meat. Those tips show up a lot when you search for endometrial cancer and diet, especially around prevention. But what if you’ve already been diagnosed with advanced disease? What you eat still matters. A lot. “People who are better nourished during treatment have better quality of life,” says Mary-Eve Brown, a clinical dietitian with the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. “If you’re able to meet your calorie, protein, and hydration needs, the chances of completing therapy the way it’s planned is much higher.” And staying on track is key. If you’re not eating well, your care team may need to lower your chemo dose, delay your next infusion, or switch treatments. That doesn’t just affect how well the treatment works, but also how you feel day to day. Diane Riccardi, MPH, a clinical dietitian at Moffitt Cancer Center, echoes this message. “If you have advanced disease, treatment is often ongoing and may not be stopped entirely,” she says. “And the priority during treatment is preventing malnutrition and avoiding dietary restrictions.” From managing side effects to staying strong through treatment, here’s how good nutrition can help you feel better and support your care."

        "Cancer treatment doesn’t just go after tumors. It also affects healthy, fast-dividing cells – like the ones in your gut, mouth, and bone marrow. Your body needs extra protein (up to twice as much as usual) to repair that damage. Without enough, your body breaks down your muscles for fuel. That can leave you tired and unable to keep up with everyday activities. “If I lose my muscle mass and I’m weak, I can’t spend time doing the things I want to do,” Brown says. “I can’t go on vacation. I can’t spend time with family and friends. And that quality of life piece is huge for people in the metastatic group.” But staying nourished isn’t just about what you eat. Fluids matter, too. “If you’re dehydrated, pain feels worse, energy levels drop, and appetite goes down,” Brown says. “And most people are dry and don’t even know it.” To estimate your daily fluid needs, take your body weight in pounds and divide by 2.2. That’s about how many ounces you’ll need each day. Drink more to replace fluid lost through vomiting or diarrhea . “Anything caffeine-free can count as fluid,” Brown says. Drinks like protein shakes or smoothies are even better – that’s nutrition plus hydration, she says."

        "Loss of appetite is common in people with advanced endometrial cancer. Sometimes it’s the treatment. Sometimes it’s the tumor. “If the tumor is pressing on the stomach or intestines, people may feel bloated or full quickly,” Riccardi says. “We call that early satiety.” Pain meds, fatigue, and taste changes can also make eating harder. Riccardi suggests doing a bit of “detective work” to find out what you can tolerate and what actually sounds good. Here are some tips: Eat small, frequent meals. Set alarms if you need to. Try smaller portions on bigger plates to avoid overwhelm. Pack in nutrition. Add calorie-dense ingredients like nut butters, full-fat dairy, or protein powder to boost each bite. If you’re nauseated. Skip hot, fragrant meals – odor can trigger nausea . Try cooler, low-smell foods like sandwiches or plain pasta. If you have diarrhea. Cut back on fiber, sugar, and fat. Try easy-on-the-gut foods like white rice, toast, bananas, or potatoes. If your mouth hurts. Stick with soft, moist, protein-rich foods like scrambled eggs, yogurt , tofu, or cottage cheese."

So far, no studies have looked specifically at how following the  Mediterranean diet after diagnosis affects survival in people with endometrial cancer. Still, that doesn’t mean it’s not worth following a plant-forward approach. Eating more plant foods during treatment supports your immune system and provides essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. These nutrients can help your body recover and may ease side effects like fatigue or constipation . Brown adds that some people can’t stand the smell or texture of meat during treatment. They often find plant proteins easier to tolerate. Good options include tofu, beans, nut butters, or smoothies with leafy greens and plant-based protein powder."

          "text": "You’ve probably heard about the Mediterranean diet. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables , whole grains, legumes , and healthy fats like olive oil – foods known to reduce inflammation and support long-term health. Plant foods are rich in phytonutrients and antioxidants, compounds that protect your cells from damage and help calm chronic inflammation. “Phytonutrients give plants their colors,” says Courtney McGowan, a registered dietitian at Yale School of Public Health. “Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables that offer different colors will provide the widest variety of nutrients and have the biggest impact.”",

        "But what if you’ve already been diagnosed with metastatic cancer – can the Mediterranean diet help you live longer? “We don’t have data to address that question directly yet,” says epidemiologist Leah Ferrucci, PhD, MPH, assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health. Most research on endometrial cancer and diet is observational and focuses on prevention or pre-diagnosis eating habits, Ferrucci says. So far, no studies have looked specifically at how following the  Mediterranean diet after diagnosis affects survival in people with endometrial cancer. Still, that doesn’t mean it’s not worth following a plant-forward approach. Eating more plant foods during treatment supports your immune system and provides essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. These nutrients can help your body recover and may ease side effects like fatigue or constipation . Brown adds that some people can’t stand the smell or texture of meat during treatment. They often find plant proteins easier to tolerate. Good options include tofu, beans, nut butters, or smoothies with leafy greens and plant-based protein powder."
