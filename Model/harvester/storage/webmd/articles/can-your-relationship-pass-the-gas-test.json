One survey by online media company MIC found that 3 out of 4 people in their 20s and 30s regularly broke the \"fart barrier\" within the first year of dating. And an eHarmony survey of about 1,000 Australians found the average Aussie waited six months to pass gas in front of their partner – three months longer than it took to declare \"I love you.\" Even then, those under the age of 24 were more likely than older respondents to break wind in the first three months of a relationship."

A 2023 survey of more than 88,000 Americans found that 1 in 7 dealt with bloating in a week, with women and those with conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, and Crohn's disease most likely to have symptoms."
