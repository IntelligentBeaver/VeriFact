        "Oct. 24, 2024 – People ages 50 to 64 have a new annual vaccine to consider adding to this fall’s roster.",
        "The CDC now says everyone 50 to 64 years old should get a pneumococcal vaccine to help protect against serious illnesses like pneumonia , meningitis , and bloodstream infections. They are caused by an infection called pneumococcal disease that stems from a bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae . (It’s also called pneumococcus.)",
        "The CDC’s independent expert advisory panel made the expanded recommendation on Wednesday, and CDC director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, endorsed it later the same day. Previously, pneumococcal vaccines were recommended for people 65 and older, and for younger adults at high risk. Children get a series of the vaccines before they turn 5 years old.",
        "The move to include more adults is largely intended to increase access to the shots, as well as address disparities among racial groups.",
        "“Lowering the age for pneumococcal vaccination gives more adults the opportunity to protect themselves from pneumococcal disease at the age when risk of infection substantially increases,” the CDC explained in a news release."
