        "The left ventricular assist device, LVAD or VAD, is a kind of mechanical heart pump. It's placed inside a person's chest, where it helps the heart pump oxygen-rich blood throughout the body.",

This can mean the difference between life and death for a person whose heart needs a rest after open-heart surgery or is too weak to effectively pump on its own or who is waiting for a heart transplant .",
        "A permanent LVAD is currently being used in some terminally ill patients whose condition makes them ineligible for heart transplantation. This is also called destination therapy.",
        "In studies, therapy with the permanent LVAD device doubled the one-year survival rate of patients with end-stage heart failure as compared with drug treatment alone. However, there were some risks, including infection, stroke, and bleeding."
