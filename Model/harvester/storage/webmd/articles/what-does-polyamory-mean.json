        "Polyamory is a type of consensual nonmonogamy where people have more than one partner at a time. Unlike cheating , polyamory is based on open communication, trust, and mutual agreement among partners. Polyamory is not tied to any specific gender, and each relationship can look different depending on the people involved. The core idea is that love or connection isn't limited to just one person.",
        "A brief history of polyamory",
        "The term \"polyamorous\" comes from the Greek word \"poly,\" meaning \"many,\" and the Latin word \"amor,\" meaning \"love.\" It was coined in the 1970s, but the idea of polyamory has roots in many cultures throughout history. In the U.S., communes have practiced group relationships since the 19th century, which continued during the \"free love\" movement of the 1960s and 1970s. However, during the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, the idea of having multiple partners was often viewed as risky or irresponsible, which led to more stigma around polyamory and other forms of nonmonogamy. In recent years, polyamory has seen a resurgence, largely thanks to the internet, which has made it easier for like-minded people to connect and learn about the lifestyle."
