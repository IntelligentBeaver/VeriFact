        "Weight and insulin resistance are often connected. Insulin resistance happens when your body doesn’t respond to insulin as it should. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose , or blood sugar, enter the cells of your body for energy. When cells don’t respond well to insulin (insulin resistance), your body will make more insulin. High levels of insulin in the bloodstream can lead to fat storage (especially around your belly), cause you to feel hungrier, and make weight loss more stubborn.",
        "Doctors link insulin resistance to overweight and obesity, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes . Keeping a healthy weight is one way to reverse the condition or lower your chances of getting it.",
