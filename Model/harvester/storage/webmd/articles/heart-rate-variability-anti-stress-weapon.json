        "Simply, HRV is a measure of the variation in time between your heartbeats and can be used as a guide to help manage stress. If you’re in fight-or-flight mode, for example, your heart pumps faster and time between beats becomes shorter. This reduces HRV and indicates higher stress.",

In life, there’s stress all the time. It’s the ability to not have extreme reactions and recover quickly — essentially that’s what HRV is measuring.”"

In one study , people practiced deep, resonant breathing for 20 minutes a day for 4 weeks; their HRV improved, and their perceived stress levels went down."
