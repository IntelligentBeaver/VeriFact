But as someone with a severe tree nut and peanut allergy, navigating the season safely requires a bit of thought. While most people focus on festive menus and gift lists, I’m double-checking ingredients, reading food packaging, and having honest conversations about my allergy.",
        "One thing I’ve learned over the years is that communication is absolutely key. Whether it’s reminding family members about your allergy, ensuring safe food prep, or letting friends know where your epinephrine pens are, being open about your needs makes all the difference – not just for your safety, but for your peace of mind, too.",

As much as my relatives love me, some of them need a little nudge at times when it comes to remembering my allergy. It’s not that they don’t care; it’s just that people get caught up in the whirlwind of holiday planning."

A friendly reminder, like, “Hey, just a heads-up about my nut allergy,” goes a long way in making sure they’re mindful while preparing food. It also gives me a chance to politely ask that no nuts or nut-based snacks be put on the table to reduce any chance of cross-contamination.",
        "Why Food Packaging Matters",
        "One of my biggest holiday tips? Always ask your friends or family members to keep the food packaging when they’re hosting. It’s such a simple thing, but it gives me peace of mind knowing I can check the label myself if I need to. Even the most well-meaning family members can miss things like “may contain nuts” warnings, so being able to scan the ingredients and allergen info myself makes me feel so much safer."
