        "My psoriasis has been in blissful remission for so long that I didn’t recognize this slow, yet persistent flare knocking at the back door. It stopped me in my tracks. It frightened me. It opened the floodgates to a cascade of catastrophizing thoughts and memories of pain, itch, and sting, messy and time-consuming routines, greasy ointments, and smelly shampoos.",
