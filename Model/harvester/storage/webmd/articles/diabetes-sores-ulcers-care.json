You’re most likely to get ulcers in your feet and legs, but they can also form in other areas, such as your hands or the folds of skin on your stomach.",

Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage your nerves and blood vessels. That lessens blood flow (especially to your hands, feet, and limbs), which makes it harder for sores and cuts to heal. It makes you more likely to get an infection, too. What’s more, diabetes is linked to a condition called peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ), which lessens blood flow to your legs and feet."
