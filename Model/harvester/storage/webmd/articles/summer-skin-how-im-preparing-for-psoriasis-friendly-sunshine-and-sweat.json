        "For the majority of my time since I’ve had psoriasis (eight years), I’ve had better experiences in the summer than in the winter. It’s the noticeable shift from springtime weather to optimal warm, sunny weather. The added sunshine truly does improve my skin. I notice a shift in my flare-ups from often to sometimes. While the sun can have many advantages, it can also be damaging if you get too much of it. Some of the starter items I have handy are moisturizer, sunscreen, and possibly a hat.",
        "Personally, when the sun is beaming down during peak sunshine times, I opt to wear a simple backward hat to protect my scalp and my neck. The same advice would go for anyone, but especially with psoriasis, I also stay hydrated. I always keep water handy and accessible. The heat of the summer can cause dehydration, and my skin can feel tighter, flakier, and itchier.",
        "One of my pet peeves is always to check the weather anytime I’m going to be outside for most of the day. It never hurts to dress light, bring a couple of extra layers, and use combinations to find the outfit that makes the most sense on the given day. Something light and breathable is encouraged. Fitted or slightly fitted clothing has been my go-to style. Fewer layers on me means more room for my body to breathe."

        "Humidity leads to uncomfortable piles of sweat, especially when I’m going on summer runs. One of the things I always do post-workout is to change my shirt before driving home. Sometimes, I was drenched and would just jump in the car, throw a towel on, and call it good. Spending unnecessary time with our sweat isn’t necessarily ideal, but as long as you take a shower shortly after, you may be OK.",

I stayed in my running gear, got rained on during the half-marathon, and paid for it. There were parts of my skin that had intense flare-ups the same evening, and it was a battle for a couple of days. It could have been easily avoided by planning and quickly getting back to equilibrium."

        "On the wet side of things, I always pack a raincoat, especially since I’ve been living in Washington state for nearly a year now. If you get drenched at an unexpected time, it’s best to get home, shower, and dry off. Similar to basting in our own sweat, simmering in rainwater doesn’t have any added benefits. The goal is to get back to equilibrium skin care sooner rather than later, but it’s not always in our control, so we adapt. In addition to sweating, there’s swimming at the beach or in pools. From my recent swims, I highly recommend a prompt shower to get chlorine, saltwater, or bacteria off your skin. A shower and a quick reset will lead to minimal negative impact."

        "For the summers, my skin care routine involves packing creams and moisturizers, dressing accordingly, and taking care of my body. It’s a simpler process compared to the winters. For winter, I’d have several different types of clothes to manage the challenging weather. It’s been some time since I’ve needed to use any topical steroid or ointments, but it’s always handy just in case things get out of hand. One of my tips is to apply moisturizer every couple of hours and use sunscreen in the sensitive areas, even if it’s a little bit.",
        "For some, the sunshine can be the enemy. But with solid preparation, being adaptable, and using some regular maintenance techniques, it can be the best time of year. Summer to me is almost a guaranteed “mini break” from the regular, intense struggles that come with psoriasis. If I’m planning a long road trip or a vacation away from home, I have options. It can sometimes lead to overpacking, but it’s better to be fully prepared than to re-buy things like moisturizer, better-suited clothing, and more. From experience, I would much rather have these minor inconveniences to steer clear of flare-ups and other uncomfortable situations.",
        "Over the years, managing my psoriasis has taught me how to stay ahead, not only with skin care routines but in all facets of life. It’s important to stay on top of responsibilities, take care of ourselves, and stay grounded."
