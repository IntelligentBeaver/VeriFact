        "Your bones renew themselves throughout life by making new cells and tissue. But starting in your 30s and 40s, you lose bone mass faster than you rebuild it. You also lose calcium and other minerals that keep bones strong. As a result, your bones become more fragile and more likely to break, especially in the hips, wrists, and spine. If you didn’t build strong bone density when you were younger, you’re more likely to face fractures as you age. But it’s never too late to care for your bones. Weight-bearing exercise after 30 can help you maintain bone mass and strength."
