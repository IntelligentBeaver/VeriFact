        "Mar. 28, 2024 -- March is colorectal cancer awareness month. According to the American Cancer Society, nearly double the number of young adults under 55 are being diagnosed with colorectal cancer. And while it’s a highly treatable cancer, many people will not have symptoms in the early stages of colorectal cancer. So, when should regular screening begin? And what measures can we take to lower our risk for colon cancer ? What do we need to know about the latest research on a blood test for colon cacner screening? We spoke to Jaydeep Bhat, MD, MPH, gastroenterologist, and physician lead for resource stewardship at The Southeast Permanente Medical Group, Kaiser Permanente Georgia, about what puts someone at a higher risk for colorectal cancer, the various screening tests available, questions we should ask our primary care doctors, and small and actionable lifestyle changes we can make to reduce our risk."
