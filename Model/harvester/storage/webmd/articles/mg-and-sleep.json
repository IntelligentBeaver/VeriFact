        "You may need CPAP to make your breathing more regulated. Talk to your doctor to find the best solution for your specific sleep problems.",
        "Take naps. I can’t recommend this enough. Naps help me during the day, especially when fatigue and sleepiness get the best of me. Your muscles retrieve some of their energy when you give them continuous breaks throughout the day.",
        "Consult with a sleep specialist: It's crucial to discuss sleep problems with them. Talk about any side effects you’re having. Most of those side effects can be treated with medications and improve your quality of life.",
        "Optimize your sleep routine. Establish a regular sleep schedule (easier said than done, I know), create a relaxing bedtime routine, stop caffeine and screen time before bed, and maybe read or meditate to get your body in its most relaxed position.",
        "Finally, take your meds on time! Especially steroids. There’s a reason why we’re required to take them in the morning. If we take them in the afternoon or evening, their side effects last longer. Be consistent with the time you take them every day."
