Babies who weigh about 2¾ pounds and are born earlier than 31 weeks are most likely to get it. Out of the 28,000 U.S. babies born weighing that much or less, as many as 16,000 will develop some form of ROP . Fortunately, most will have a mild case and won't need treatment.

To make up for this, your baby's brain ignores the image from the crossed eye and processes only the image from the stronger eye. This can affect their depth perception. It can also lead to amblyopia , or lazy eye . This happens when the crossed eye doesn't develop good eyesight or even loses vision. About one-third of children with strabismus get amblyopia.",

They might use an eyepatch or drops that blur vision. This will strengthen their crossed eye and help them see better. They may not like the patch, but they need to wear it. Amblyopia can become permanent if it isn’t treated early."
