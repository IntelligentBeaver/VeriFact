        "After non- melanoma skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men. It's also highly treatable if your doctor spots it early. For many men, though, the standard treatments for prostate cancer -- medication, radiation, and surgery -- often come with side effects.",
        "Because of those side effects, some men wonder if there are any alternative medicine treatments for prostate cancer that might be helpful.",
        "For instance, is it possible that dietary supplements -- like vitamins, minerals, and herbs -- might help treat prostate cancer or slow it from getting worse? Might they delay you from getting this disease in the first place? Clinical trials continue to investigate these questions.",
        "Other men are interested in exploring mind-body treatments like yoga, meditation, and massage to ease the side effects of treatment and the stress of a cancer diagnosis. There's not a lot of research on these approaches, but some studies have found mental and physical benefits.",
        "As you learn about alternative treatments, you might also hear them called complementary treatments . Lots of people use either term to describe an unconventional therapy that you use along with a standard medical treatment. (That’s what a complementary treatment is. Strictly speaking, an alternative treatment is something that’s used in place of a standard treatment.)"
