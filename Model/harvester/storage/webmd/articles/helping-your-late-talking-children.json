Don't become overly troubled if a young child doesn't clearly say \"l,\" \"r,\" and \"s\" sounds. The ability to form these particular sounds tends to develop with time, although perhaps not until the age of 7 in some children, says Debora Downey, MS, a speech-language pathologist at the University of Iowa's Center for Disabilities and Development. Generally, no speech-language therapy is necessary, although there may be an exception if these sounds are in a child's own name (e.g. Robert or Rhonda). \"These children may become self-conscious, may be reluctant to tell you their name, and could withdraw socially,\" says Downey.",
