        "Heaters and prolonged hot showers are the biggest culprits when it comes to dry skin. Both can deplete the skin of its natural moisture, even more than cold temperatures. And no matter how much water you drink, it probably won’t be enough to rehydrate your skin. For starters, invest in a humidifier, which helps bring moisture into heated homes.",
        "Beyond that, one of the most important things you can do in the winter is use a nondrying wash like Dove Visible Care Renewing Crème Body Wash , and shorten your shower to three minutes max or bathe in lukewarm water.",
        "Next, apply body lotion -- try Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion -- immediately after showering or bathing while the skin is still damp. This helps lock in moisture and boost reabsorption. If you’re eczema -prone in the winter, seek out thicker creams or ointments -- those like Aquaphor Healing Ointment for lips are more moisturizing than creams like L’Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream , which are more moisturizing than lotions. Choose the richest formula your skin can tolerate, and apply it to your body religiously to maintain a healthy skin barrier."

You may want to ease up on exfoliating face cleansers and toners. These are often too rough for the skin in the winter so aim for something gentler and look for ingredients like jojoba beads on the label.",

For day, stock up on hydrating creams and lotions that contain moisture-locking ingredients such as ceramides, glycerin , and hyaluronic acid , and use every day. Try Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme . No matter what, it’s best to apply face and body moisturizer twice a day during the winter -- in the morning after showering and before bed."
