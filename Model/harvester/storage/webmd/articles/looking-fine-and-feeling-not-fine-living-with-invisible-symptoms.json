Some part of me was secretly pleased that she mistook me for someone who takes good health for granted. I want to look like someone who moves through the world with ease. Appearing healthy comes with a raft of benefits, including presumptions about capability and strength. I shouldn’t trade on such unfounded presumptions, but I do.",

I don’t have to contend with strangers’ thoughts or feelings about my illness. If anyone knows that I’m struggling with my symptoms, it’s because I tell them. But telling is tricky."

I don’t want others to assign me a well-intended but static “suffering person” label. I also don’t want pity.",

Pain and fatigue are impossible to describe. While experiencing them is endlessly original, there’s absolutely nothing original to say about them. I also don’t care to saddle people who love me with any sorrow on my behalf. Keeping it to myself protects people I care about from worry and helps me compartmentalize my discomfort and get on with my life."

Compassion in response to suffering is not the same as pity. If I offer compassion with respect (and I do), I can also receive it with grace. I’d like to be more courageous about admitting when I’m struggling. It makes me feel vulnerable, but there’s integrity in it. I expect it’s worth the effort.",
