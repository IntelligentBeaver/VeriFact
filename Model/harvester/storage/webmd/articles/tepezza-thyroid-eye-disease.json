        "Thyroid eye disease happens when your immune system is not working right and attacks and damages the muscles and other tissues around your eyes. It happens most often in people with a thyroid problem called Graves’ disease but can also happen in people with other types of thyroid problems. Until 2020, the only medicines available for thyroid eye disease were ones that treated its symptoms (like steroids such as methylprednisolone for eye inflammation or artificial tears for eye dryness). In 2020, Tepezza (teprotumumab-trbw) was approved by the FDA to treat thyroid eye disease."

        "Your dose of Tepezza is based on how much you weigh at the time of each visit. Tepezza is usually given as an infusion once every three weeks for a total of eight infusions. The first two infusions of Tepezza will last for 90 minutes each. After that, your infusions may be shortened to about 60 minutes each but may be longer if you experience side effects from the infusion."

They were given either Tepezza or a placebo (containing no medicine), infused into their veins, once every three weeks for a total of eight infusions. The dose of Tepezza given was based on how much they weighed at the time of infusion.",

About 85% were White, about 10% were Black or African-American, 4% were Asian, and 1% were identified as having a race of “other.” The main goal of both studies was to see if there was an improvement in eye bulging in people who were given Tepezza for six months compared to people who were given placebo."
