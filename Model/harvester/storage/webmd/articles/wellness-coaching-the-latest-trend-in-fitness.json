        "A compulsive overeater, Heit had struggled with her weight since childhood. She went on diet after diet, and was finally ready to join an overeating support group when a friend told her about wellness coaching. She suggested Chere Bork, a registered dietitian and coach. Heit jumped at the chance.",
        "After her first appointment, Heit was so impressed that she decided to do more. She has now had 12 telephone coaching sessions with Bork at a cost of $75 each. She insists they were worth every penny.",
        "Although Heit has made significant improvements to her diet and lost weight, she says she's gained something far more important. Through the coaching process, Heit discovered that losing weight wasn't what she needed most. She longed to be at home with her family. So after debating the options, Heit quit her insurance job and became a full-time homemaker. She's never been happier.",
