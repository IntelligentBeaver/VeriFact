        "April 5, 2024 – For more than two years a 58-year-old man has seen “demonic”-looking human faces whenever he looks at another person.",
        "Now, researchers have for the first time used computer software to depict accurate representations of the facial distortions that patients like this see thanks to a rare visual disorder called prosopometamorphopsia, or PMO, which is often mistaken for mental illness.",
        "PMO is a rare, often misdiagnosed, visual disorder in which human faces appear distorted in shape, texture, position, or color. Most patients with PMO see these distorted facial features all the time, whether they are looking at an actual person, on a screen, or paper.",
        "Computer software helped researchers create images that are similar to what one patient says he sees.",
        "But the man involved in this new study published in March, said he only sees the distortions only when encountering someone in person but not on a screen or on paper.",
        "This allowed researchers to use editing software to create an image on a computer screen that matched the patient's distorted view.",
        "\"This new information should help healthcare professionals grasp the intensity of facial distortions experienced by people with PMO,\" study investigator Brad Duchaine, PhD, professo in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH, said."
