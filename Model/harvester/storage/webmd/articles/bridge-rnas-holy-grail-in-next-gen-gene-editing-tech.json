They can be reprogrammed to retarget different parts of the genome for editing. The drawback for both of these systems is that they cut, damage, or destroy their DNA or RNA targets to complete their tasks.

The bridge RNA folds into two loops; each loop can be programmed independently of one another, with one binding to the element itself and the other binding to the target DNA site. The process seamlessly recombines the two DNA strands without causing any unwanted breaks in the DNA – a major limitation in existing technologies. Hsu’s team was able to achieve a 60% success rate when inserting a desired gene (insertion efficiency) for an E. coli gene, and 94% specificity, reflecting the accuracy with which it was able to correctly identify the location and edit the target DNA."

        "Despite the incredible potential of bridge RNAs, researchers like Tou note there are still some uncertainties, including how well bridge RNA would carry out instructions and how well human cells would respond to those instructions, particularly at a low dose. Unlike CRISPR, bridge recombinases are not immune systems, so they are not as efficient at what they do.",
        "The greatest uncertainty and risk, in Tou’s view, is specificity, or how accurately bridge RNAs can identify the correct location, particularly in a large genome like human cells. These bridge RNAs are shorter than those for CRISPR, so in a complex genome, there could be many sites with the same short sequence of base pairs, he explained. If the guide identifies the wrong target region, significant, unintentional, and even harmful errors involving large deletions or inversions could result. Much like a password, multiple sites might share the same short sequence, but only a few or just one region might match a longer group of base pairs.",
        "“Do you want the ease of bridge recombinase programmability at some expense of specificity, or do you want something that's a little more complicated, but … is much more specific?” Tou said of the current trade-off between CRISPR and bridge RNA. “It has a lot of promise, but there’s also obviously some things to be seen still in the field.”"
