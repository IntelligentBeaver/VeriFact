        "About two decades ago, Maria Rita Lepe-Suastegui, MD, was just starting out as a gastroenterologist. Back then, most of her patients with serious liver disease were in their 70s or 80s. But that’s no longer the case. “Not only is it affecting the entire Hispanic population, but we see it in really young people,” said Lepe-Suastegui, an assistant professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center specializing in liver disease and Latine health disparities. “I see patients in their 20s with cirrhosis and liver failure, and unfortunately some of them die from this disease.” Cirrhosis means that scarring has overtaken healthy tissue in the liver. It can lead to liver failure or cancer. Cirrhosis is the most severe stage of fatty liver disease, a condition tearing through the Latine population. About 45% of Latine adults and 38% of Latine children and young adults ages 12-29, especially Mexican Americans, have fatty liver disease. Compare that to the broad population – fatty liver disease affects roughly 25% of adults and 5%-10% of children in the U.S. – and you see the problem."

        "Also known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), fatty liver is exactly what it sounds like: Too much fat builds up in the liver. It’s often linked to other health conditions, especially obesity and type 2 diabetes, and it can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and chronic kidney disease, according to Lepe-Suastegui. Because fatty liver disease is taking hold in younger age groups, even “from infancy,” it can create challenges throughout people’s lives, she said. Latine people may be more vulnerable to fatty liver disease for various reasons. Genes can play a role, but many also struggle to get nutritious foods that can help prevent the disease. Cultural and language barriers can make it harder to find doctors they trust, delaying treatment. Others lack health insurance because of costs or documentation status. But even among people who get regular checkups, fatty liver disease can progress for decades without being noticed. “This disease is a little bit sneaky,” Lepe-Suastegui said. “A lot of [patients] tell me, ‘I've been going to my doctor all these years. Why did this not get picked up?’”"

The most important thing with this disease is to see how much scar tissue somebody has. There's specific testing that needs to be done to stratify a patient with fatty liver. We can have a patient with 50% fat and no scar tissue. We're not worried about those folks. We're worried about folks that have advanced scarring. Traditionally, it had been brushed off as, “You have fatty liver, lose weight, not a problem.” But because we didn’t pay it the attention it deserved, young kids had been progressing. And now we have a big problem in a very young population. Kids are having more problems with obesity than in the past, since the 1980s. We're seeing children who have been overweight since age 8, for example. I see them as adults, but they've had maybe 10 to 15 years of a problem that is not addressed.
