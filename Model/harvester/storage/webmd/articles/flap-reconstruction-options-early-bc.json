        "The term “flap” refers to tissue taken from one part of your body that’s used to restore another area. Other terms you may hear are autologous reconstruction or tissue-based reconstruction. Your doctor can use a tissue flap to rebuild your post-mastectomy breast mound. During flap reconstruction, your surgeon will remove multiple layers of “donor” tissue. This mostly includes skin and fat, but some flap surgeries use muscle. The flap will come from a part of the body that’s similar in makeup to the fibrous and fatty tissue in your breast, which is usually your belly. There are two different surgical methods used in flap reconstruction, including: Free flap. Most often, the surgeon will cut the tissue flap completely out of your body. Once they place it in your chest, they’ll reconnect the original blood vessels to the ones in your breast area. This is where those special skills in microsurgery come in handy. Pedicle flap. The surgeon may not cut the original blood vessels in your tissue flap. Instead, they’ll create a tunnel under your skin and move the flap up to your chest that way."
