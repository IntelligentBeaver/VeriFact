Its cause isn't known, but it's believed to be an autoimmune issue. If your puppy has symptoms, they need veterinary care immediately. The condition is curable, but it can be fatal if not treated. It doesn't usually come back after your pup recovers. Sometimes, the hair loss and scarring are permanent."
