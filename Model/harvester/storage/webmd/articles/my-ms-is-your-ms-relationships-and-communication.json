        "Communication in the space of MS is a tricky one. First off, it sets the stage for increased vulnerability. How can we communicate about our disability without putting it all out there? This can be daunting and intimidating and can often give a “naked” and uncomfortable feeling.",
        "It’s so important to get used to communicating our struggles, hurdles, and needs with a disease like MS. Can anyone think of why? Well, it may have something to do with the fact that 99% of MS symptoms are invisible. So if we are playing everything close to the vest, how can we expect others around us to understand what we are being faced with?",
        "Communication came natural to me as I love to talk, and I’ve always just thrown my mess out there for the world to see. Holding it all in is like hanging onto poison, and I just don’t want that in my body. That’s a lot to hold onto anyways. Way too much pressure if you ask me. But maybe you’re somebody that really struggles with communication and it’s harder for you to put yourself in a place of vulnerability because on the inside, you instinctually view yourself as weak if you put yourself out there. In my opinion, that's completely and utterly ridiculous!",
        "Here’s an example: Instead of telling my husband that I am exhausted, I might say something like this: “I’m so tired that I feel like I have walked uphill 5 miles with cement bricks attached to my legs.” This paints a more clear picture for him. It adds a whole new level to the image and explanation I’m trying to have understood in the first place. Details are vital! So get creative and your explanations. My husband and I actually have a really good understanding that when I cannot pick up the slack, I pass the baton over to him to take charge. Trust me when I say I wasn’t always good at this. I like to be independent and self-serving when it comes to getting things done and I very rarely enjoy asking for help. Though this is a part of life, I’d like to think I’ve gotten a little bit better at. I guess it comes down to my focus on maintaining sustainable independence. Plus the East Coast, Italian stubborn nature definitely has to be taken into consideration."

        "MS is an all hands on deck situation. The disease can affect things like home life, time spent with family and friends, how we accommodate for the care of our kiddos, and so much more. MS is not a solo ride. Though it can be really appealing to try to take on the world and handle as much as possible by ourselves. This is not always the wisest choice. So find your support system and start sharing the MS wealth. Share the messy parts. Share the good parts. Share the funny parts. Share the sad parts. Communicate, communicate, communicate! Start small and see how you do from that starting point. You can always add more each day. It’s a step process. Perfection out of the gate is unrealistic."
