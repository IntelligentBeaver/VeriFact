Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Marshall's whole family was involved in show business. His mother ran a tap dance school; his father created industrial films (and later became a producer); his sister is actress Penny Marshall and his brother is TV producer Ronny Marshall Hallin.

        "Sometimes, I couldn't figure out where they all were! Seriously, though, it was a lot of stars who were never all together but were shooting different days, different locations. A lot of them came to the Dec. 5 premiere in Hollywood."
