It’s possible for it to extrude (come out), and it can get infected or cause irritation. But we always weigh risks and benefits carefully. And what we know is that this medicine does actually have an impact on the disease, which is great. Still, eye procedures can feel scary for many people, and that’s OK. What I always point out is there’s no urgency to put it in. It's not like you can't do it tomorrow if you say no today. We can always talk and revisit the idea later."

Other common conditions like diabetes and diabetic retinopathy don’t have cures, so we learn to manage them. Years ago, we didn't have a treatment for MacTel, and now we have one. Back in the day, we had no treatments for macular degeneration and suddenly we have a whole host of them decades later. And it all started with one. Also, there's great support out there for people living with MacTel. In fact, part of the reason we have such great research for this particular disease is because there were some people with means and resources who really pushed for treatment, because one of their family members was affected.
