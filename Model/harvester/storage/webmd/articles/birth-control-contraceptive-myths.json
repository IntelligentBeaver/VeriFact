        "When it comes to getting pregnant, many people don’t know the whole truth. Myths and misconceptions about birth control abound. There’s also confusion about how you can conceive, too. These questions and answers separate fact from fiction.",
        "Can I get pregnant from pre-ejaculate?",
        "Yes. Pre-ejaculate is a clear fluid that men release when they’re sexually aroused. Although it doesn’t contain any sperm on its own, pre-ejaculate can mix with sperm on its way out of the penis.",
        "In fact, one study found sperm in the pre-ejaculate of more than 40% of men. That’s why the pull-out, or withdrawal, method isn’t foolproof. Even if the man removes their penis before they ejaculate, sperm in the pre-ejaculate can still fertilize an egg.",
        "Is it true that I won’t get pregnant while I’m on my period?",
        "Although the odds are lower, you can still get pregnant during your period. There are a few ways it can happen: What you think is your period may actually be bleeding caused by ovulation. That’s when your ovaries release an egg. It’s also possible to ovulate during menstruation. And there’s a chance of getting pregnant if you ovulate shortly after your period. Sperm can fertilize eggs for up to 3 days. If you have sex at the end of menstruation and ovulate a few days later, you can get pregnant."
