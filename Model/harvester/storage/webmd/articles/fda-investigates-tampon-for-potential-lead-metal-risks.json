        "Sept. 11, 2024 – The FDA has launched an investigation of the potential exposure to heavy metals when using tampons, the agency announced Tuesday.",
        "The move follows the publication earlier this year of concerning laboratory test results that detected the presence of more than a dozen metals in a variety of popular non-organic and organic tampon products. That small study was a combined effort by researchers from Columbia University, Michigan State University, and the University of California, Berkeley.",
        "“We want the public to know that before tampons can be legally sold in the U.S., they must meet FDA requirements for safety and effectiveness. Manufacturers must test the product and its component materials before, during, and after manufacturing,” the FDA wrote in the announcement of its own upcoming study. “Before a product is allowed onto the market, biocompatibility testing is undertaken by the manufacturing company, which is part of safety testing, and is reviewed by the FDA prior to market authorization.”",
        "There will be two studies, the FDA said. One of the studies will involve laboratory tests to evaluate metals in tampons and potential exposure people may experience when using them. The other study will be a review of current research regarding the health effects of metals that may be found in tampons."

The study authors noted that the average age that girls begin menstruation is 12 years old, and the onset of menopause occurs, on average, at age 51. One study mentioned by the researchers estimated that between 52% and 86% of people who menstruate use tampons."
