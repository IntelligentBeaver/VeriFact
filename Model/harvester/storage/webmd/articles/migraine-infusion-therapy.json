        "Infusion or intravenous (IV) therapy for migraine is a treatment used to help avoid a migraine headache or ease the symptoms of one. It delivers medicine straight into your vein through a needle . Infusion therapy sends migraine medicine directly to your bloodstream, which means faster symptom relief compared to medicines you take by mouth. Vyepti, available since 2020, is the only FDA-approved infusion treatment for preventing migraine. In 2021, the FDA approved DHE as a nasal spray for treating migraine, but you can still take it as an IV at a hospital or infusion center."

        "Before your infusion therapy session, you may also take medicines to ward off a: Queasy stomach Pain Inflammation Allergic reaction A nurse will insert a needle into a vein in either the top of your hand or in your arm. The needle connects to a small tube and an IV bag filled with your migraine medicine, which will slowly flow into your bloodstream. The length of your infusion therapy session depends on the type of medicine you’re taking. With Vyepti, it could last anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours. And if you’re having a DHE treatment, you’ll check into the hospital for about four days, where you’ll get a dose of the medicine every eight hours until your migraine goes away or you’ve taken the maximum amount. After infusion therapy As with all medications, there’s a chance you could have side effects after infusion therapy. You could need follow-up sessions for several days in a row to feel the full effect of infusion therapy. You’ll usually take Vyepti every 3 months to avoid migraines and DHE only when you have migraine symptoms."
