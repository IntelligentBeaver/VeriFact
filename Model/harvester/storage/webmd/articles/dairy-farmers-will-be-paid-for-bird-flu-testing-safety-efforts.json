        "The move comes after a Texas dairy farm worker tested positive earlier this year for the virus, which is officially called avian influenza A (H5N1). Since then, inactive virus fragments have been detected in pasteurized milk, and 42 herds of cattle across nine states have tested positive for bird flu. Officials maintain that the commercial milk supply is safe, but admit there is much more they want to learn about how the virus may be affecting animals, humans, and the food supply.",
        "Dairy farmers have reportedly been reluctant to voluntarily participate in government efforts to monitor cows and workers. The new plan includes compensation of up to $28,000 per location for farmers and those in dairy industry support roles for a long list of different biosecurity and testing actions, including:"
