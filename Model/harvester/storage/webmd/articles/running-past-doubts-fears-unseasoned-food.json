For Latoya Shauntay Snell, 40, it was of all things, runner’s diarrhea. “I wrote about a very real issue no one talks about, and from then on my phone blew up with messages.” Runners and non-runners alike appreciated her candor, and she received a record number of followers after that post. Snell’s 15 minutes would extend to nearly 10 years and counting."

Doctors told her she would be disabled the rest of her life and that only weight loss would fix everything. Without knowing she was a chef and accomplished in making healthy (yet savory) dishes, they blamed poor eating habits as well.",
        "While some might sit back and possibly give up after multiple health conditions, Snell decided that these diagnoses would not stop her. She didn’t start small, either. When a friend from across the pond (London) encouraged her to sign up for a marathon, she took on the challenge. (Side note: He didn’t show up for the race.) Snell showed up and was pleasantly surprised. “I saw Black women who were super happy at 6 in the morning … without coffee,” she says. “I saw that not only could I get physically fit, but I could make friends.”",
        "That was a turning point and would start a new normal for Snell as a runner and later power lifter. Before she knew it, Snell was signing up for back-to-back marathons as her weight dropped close to 90 pounds. “I was celebrated for this, but people don’t understand the trauma to your body to lose that much weight that quickly,” she says."
