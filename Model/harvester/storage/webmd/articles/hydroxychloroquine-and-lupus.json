        "Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial medication used to treat lupus . It is also known by its brand name, Plaquenil. Research shows that anti-malaria medications can help prevent lupus flares. They might even help you prolong your life. Anti-malaria medications are also used to treat lung inflammation, joint pain, fatigue, and skin rashes.",
        "Other antimalarial drugs commonly used to treat lupus are chloroquine (Aralen) and quinacrine (Atabrine). Chloroquine may be prescribed when hydroxychloroquine is not available. However, it is not the preferred medication due to its severe side effects. Quinacrine is also rarely used because it can lead to a yellow discoloration of the skin. It might be used together with hydroxychloroquine if you don't respond to hydroxychloroquine treatment alone.",
