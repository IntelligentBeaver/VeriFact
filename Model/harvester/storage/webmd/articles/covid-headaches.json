        "Headaches from COVID-19 typically last about 4 days. (Photo Credit: E+/Getty Images)",
        "Scientists don’t know for sure what causes COVID headaches, but research suggests that it may be because COVID activates the trigeminal nerve . That nerve carries signals between your face and your brain, helping your face recognize pain and other sensations.",
        "People who are younger and people who have a history of migraines or other headaches are more likely to have COVID headaches. They are also more common in people who lose their sense of taste or smell when they have COVID.",

        "Sometimes, headaches keep happening even after you’ve gotten over COVID. Long COVID is a chronic condition that lasts weeks, months, or even years after a COVID illness. People with long COVID have symptoms that linger, and long COVID headache is one of them. This can happen even if you had a mild case of COVID.",
        "Sometimes, long COVID headaches don’t really go away – the pain gets more or less intense, but the headaches persist."
