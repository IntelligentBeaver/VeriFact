        "An ankle sprain happens when you twist, roll, or turn your ankle too far. You might land wrong after a jump, step into a hole, or slip off a curb.",
        "Ligaments, tough bands of tissue, keep your ankles stable as you walk, run, and jump. They hold your bones together, allowing some — but not too much — movement. If these ligaments get stretched too much or even tear, this is a sprain.",
        "Sprains most often happen on the outside of the ankle when you roll your foot, so the outside of your ankle is pointing down to the ground. This causes the ligament to stretch beyond its normal limit. It’s the classic ankle sprain, says Vandan Patel, MD, an orthopedic surgeon with The Institute for Foot and Ankle Reconstruction at Mercy Medical Center in Maryland.",
        "There’s also a high ankle sprain . It’s higher up on the ankle and it happens mostly to athletes, particularly those who play football or basketball, Patel says. “That is a more significant injury, higher up between the two bones in the legs. It’s a more serious type of ankle sprain compared to the ankle sprains we normally think about, which are the lower ankle sprains.”",
