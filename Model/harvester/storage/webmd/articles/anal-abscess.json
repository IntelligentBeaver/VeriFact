About half of people with an anal abscess also develop an anal fistula, which is an abnormal tunnel that drains pus from the inside of your anus to the skin. It’s important to see a doctor if you have pain or leakage in your anal area because abscesses rarely go away on their own and can lead to serious infections and other complications. Surgical incision and drainage is the best way to treat anal abscesses in most cases and is usually successful.",

        "Is it a fistula or an abscess?",
        "An anal abscess is a tender lump in or near the anus or rectum that you can often see or feel with your fingers. A fistula is an abnormal tunnel that forms between an abscess inside your anus or rectum and the skin near your anus. If you are feeling or looking for something, you will probably not easily feel or see a fistula “hole.” You may, however, be in pain and notice that you seem to be “leaking” pus, blood, or poop. In many cases, you could be dealing with both an abscess and a fistula, as they often occur together.",
        "What is the difference between a pilonidal sinus and a perianal abscess?",
        "An anal abscess is a painful pus-filled lump that forms under the skin near your anus or rectum. A pilonidal sinus is a small, abnormal opening inside your butt cheeks. When the sinus becomes infected, it will form a painful cyst that is typically filled with pus, hair, and dead skin."
