        "To prevent cavities and maintain good oral health, your diet -- what you eat and how often you eat -- are important factors. Changes start the minute you eat certain foods. Bacteria in the mouth convert sugars and carbohydrates from the foods you eat to acids, and it's the acids that begin to attack the enamel on teeth , starting the decay process. Too many carbohydrates from sugars (like cake, cookies and candies) and savory foods and starches (like pretzels and potato chips) can cause tooth decay. The more often you eat and snack, the more frequently you’re exposing your teeth to the cycle of decay. Time between meals allows saliva to wash away food particles that bacteria would otherwise feast on. Frequent snacking, without brushing immediately afterward, gives bacteria constant fuel. Try to limit snacks as much as possible -- no more than one or two a day. Brush teeth after each snack, if possible."

These foods are thought to protect tooth enamel because they have the calcium and phosphorus needed to remineralize teeth (a natural process by which minerals are redeposited in tooth enamel after being removed by acids).

These foods have a high water content, which dilutes the effects of the sugars they contain, and stimulate the flow of saliva (which helps protect against decay by washing away food particles and buffering acid). Acidic foods, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, and lemons, should be eaten as part of a larger meal to minimize the acid from them.",

These foods have large amounts of sugar and some can stick to teeth, giving a fuel source for bacteria. Cough drops should be used only when necessary as they, like sugary candy, coat the teeth with sugar. If you plan to give your child any sweets, give them as desserts immediately following the meal. There's usually an increased amount of saliva in the mouth around mealtime, making it easier to wash food away from teeth. The mealtime beverage also helps to wash away food particles on teeth.",

Limit your consumption of sugar-containing drinks, including soft drinks, lemonade, and coffee or tea with added sugar. Also, avoid day-long sipping of sugar-containing drinks -- day-long sipping exposes your teeth to constant sugar and, in turn, constant decay-causing acids."
