        "About 75% of Americans take dietary supplements, and 55% are regular users. Supplements are “vitamins, minerals, botanicals, probiotics, and similar products that consumers take to supplement their diet,” according to Cara Welch, PhD, the director of FDA’s Office of Dietary Supplement Programs in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. More than 100,000 products are sold on the market, yet none are regulated or approved by the FDA.",
        "This lack of regulation can be a serious issue, especially for anyone who has a chronic health condition. Supplements account for 20% of the cases of liver toxicity in the U.S. each year. People who have liver damage, such as from fatty liver disease, are even more at risk, says Robert J. Fontana, MD, professor of medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.",
        "Fontana, who is also the director of the university’s Transplant Hepatology Fellowship Program and part of the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network, says the incidence of herbal and dietary toxicity is on the rise, and people may not know they’re in trouble until it’s too late. “You don’t realize you’re having a problem with your liver until you get really sick,” he says. “When you start to have mild injury, most liver diseases have no symptoms. There are a lot of people who have milder injuries, who are walking around and have no idea.” They could have fatty liver disease, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a condition where fat builds up in your liver. That buildup causes swelling and inflammation, and eventually scarring that damages your liver."
