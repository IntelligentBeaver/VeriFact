        "Aqvesme (mitapivat) is a new oral medicine approved by the FDA for treating anemia in adults with alpha- or beta-thalassemia, including those who need and those who don’t require regular blood transfusions.",
        "Thalassemia is a rare inherited blood disorder that affects how the body makes hemoglobin, a protein in the red blood cells (RBCs) that carries oxygen. Depending on which part of the hemoglobin structure (globin chain) is affected, thalassemia is categorized into two main types: alpha-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia. Due to impaired hemoglobin production, people with thalassemia have fewer healthy RBCs with shorter life span than the healthy ones. These RBCs break down faster, leading to anemia with tiredness, weakness, and potentially serious long-term health problems.",
        "Some people with thalassemia need regular blood transfusions to manage their anemia (transfusion-dependent thalassemia), while others do not (non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia). Regardless of type, thalassemia requires lifelong care and monitoring because it can cause heart, liver, and blood vessel complications and significantly impact daily life. In the U.S., about 6,000 adults are living with thalassemia."

        "In a 48-week multicenter study involving 258 adults with transfusion-dependent alpha- or beta-thalassemia, participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either an Aqvesme pill or a placebo twice daily. Results showed that Aqvesme significantly reduced the need for blood transfusions compared with placebo. About 30% of patients on Aqvesme versus 13% on placebo had a greater than 50% reduction in transfused RBC units in any consecutive 12-week period through week 48, and nearly 10% on Aqvesme versus 1% on placebo became transfusion-free for a period of eight or more consecutive weeks. The treatment also showed sustained reductions in transfused RBC units over longer periods and improved anemia.",
        "Aqvesme was generally well tolerated over the study period. The most common side effects were headache and trouble sleeping. In one of the clinical trials, a few people had liver-related side effects, including serious liver damage. Because of this, the FDA requires regular liver testing and limits access to the medicine through a special safety program called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)."
