        "Treatment-resistant depression is when you try at least two antidepressant drugs and neither improves your symptoms enough. But a true “drug trial” means you take your medicine every day for at least 4 to 6 weeks. For some people, it takes 8 weeks or longer to notice the full effectiveness. If, after you’ve given it sufficient time and dose, your medication still isn’t helping, your doctor will try a different one. You’ll probably get a drug from a different class than the first one you tried. For instance, you may try a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) like fluoxetine (Prozac) before switching to a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) like venlafaxine (Effexor) or duloxetine (Cymbalta)."

That might include experiences such as: Moving to a different place Death or divorce Relationship conflicts Ongoing parent-child trouble Losing a job Financial problems You can’t get rid of stress entirely, but there are ways to manage it.
