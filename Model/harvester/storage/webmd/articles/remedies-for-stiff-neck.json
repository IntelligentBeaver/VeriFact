        "The phrase \"pain in the neck\" was created for a good reason. Waking up with a stiff neck is an annoying and uncomfortable way to start your day. And a stiff neck is a common problem, affecting about 10% of the population at any given time. There are many reasons for neck pain, but it's usually caused by overuse or sleeping too long in an odd position.",
        "Having a stiff neck in the morning is often a muscle spasm, or contraction, known as a muscle strain . A neck sprain affects the ligaments, or tough tissues that connect and stabilize your bones. Tendonitis--inflammation in the tissue that attaches muscle to bone and controls movement--is another contributing factor for neck pain.",
        "Neck pain is usually not an emergency. But if you continue to have pain for a few days, at-home treatments don't relieve your pain, or you have other issues like a fever or flu-like symptoms, talk to your doctor to find out treatment options.",
