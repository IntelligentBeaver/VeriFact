This has resulted in more specific treatments but also our ability to make a more rapid diagnosis. There are no specific blood tests for psoriatic arthritis. Making a diagnosis relies heavily on the doctor’s experience and level of suspicion. As we have learned more about what to look for and how the symptoms may vary among men, women, and people of color, collectively our experience and level of suspicion have been raised. This results in patients reaching an appropriate diagnosis sooner. We still have a long way to go, as far too many people are dealing with psoriatic arthritis for longer than they should. But we are definitely making progress."

Understanding how various inflammatory conditions differ, on a cellular level, has further refined our ability to target certain inflammatory proteins in each condition. This enables us to be more specific in our treatment strategies. Psoriatic arthritis, in particular, has benefited from this. We’re no longer limited to using biologics developed for rheumatoid arthritis in psoriatic arthritis. Where we are moving now is learning how to identify markers within the individual that will help inform which medication is best suited for them. Another treatment option is using Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. They’re not biologics. They come in a pill form and can prevent your immune system from making certain enzymes that lead to psoriatic arthritis. Your rheumatologist may even prescribe these before trying a biologic."
