Cramps happen because as your uterus expands during pregnancy, it puts pressure on nearby muscles and ligaments. During your second trimester, your round ligament muscle often cramps as it stretches. You feel it as a dull ache in your lower abdomen, but you may also feel sharp stabs of pain. Minor cramps are normal, and may be caused by constipation, gas, or even sex. To relieve the aches, try a warm bath, relaxation exercises, changing your body’s position, or pressing a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel to your lower belly.",

To ease the pressure, sit up straight and use a chair that provides good back support. Sleep on your side with a pillow tucked between your legs. Avoid picking up or carrying anything heavy. Wear low-heeled, comfortable shoes with good arch support. If the pain is really uncomfortable, ask your partner to rub the sore spots, or treat yourself to a pregnancy massage ."
