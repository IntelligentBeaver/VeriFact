If your child is born with a genetic disorder, the cord blood likely contains the same code that caused the problem in the first place. It cannot be used to treat your child, or any other person. Cord blood cells from a healthy infant can be used to treat an ill child, as long as the two are a good match.",

Full-grown adults typically need more stem cells than are available in cord blood, though it is possible to combine stem cells from more than one birth.
