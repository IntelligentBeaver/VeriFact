        "Is your child having trouble sleeping ? We all know that restful sleep is necessary to heal and repair the body. But recent health reports suggest that many children in the U.S. are chronically sleep deprived. For instance, in a National Sleep Foundation (NSF) poll, researchers found that more than two out of every three children ages 10 and under have experienced some type of sleep problem.",
        "There's a price to pay for sleep problems in children. In a revealing study at Northwestern University Medical Center, scientists followed the sleep patterns of 510 kids between 2 and 5 years old. The study showed that less sleep at night means more behavioral problems during the day.",

        "As with adults, there are all sorts of reasons why children don't sleep well. Some of those reasons are more serious than others. But if you've got a problem sleeper (or two) in your house, there are ways to help everyone, including the parents, get a good night's sleep and feel alert and productive the next day."
