Depending on where the tumor is, your surgeon will suggest one of these procedures: Wedge resection: Cut out the tumor and a small amount of normal lung tissue. Segmental resection (segmentectomy): Take out the part of the lung where the tumor is. Sleeve resection: Remove a lobe of the lung and a part of the airway. Lobectomy: Cut out an entire lobe of the lung. (The right lung is divided into three lobes; the left lung has two lobes.) Most surgeons prefer this option since it offers the best chance for a cure. Pneumonectomy: Take out the entire lung. This might sound extreme, but you can live a normal life with only one lung."
