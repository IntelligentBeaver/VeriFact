Nearly 20% of adults ages 50 to 64 report using dating apps or sites, according to Pew Research.

Dating apps that zero in on certain age groups could be one reason for that, says DePree, director of women's health at Holland Hospital in Holland, MI. And the numbers bear that out. Nearly 20% of adults ages 50 to 64 report using dating apps or sites, according to Pew Research. While that’s not as high as the next age group down (38% for ages 30-49) it’s still a lot of online activity.",

For women, in particular, the vulva and vaginal tissues thin with age and could be more susceptible to infections such as human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis B , and hepatitis C, says DePree."
