        "Below the skin's surface, losing fat in your cheeks, temples, chin, nose, and around your eyes may loosen skin and give your face a leaner look. If you lose bone around your mouth and chin, the skin around your mouth may pucker. Even the nose may change, if you lose cartilage there.",

You can delay changes associated with aging by limiting your time in the sun, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., and wearing sunscreen with zinc oxide as a physical blocker and an SPF of 30 or more.
