They also weren’t specific in targeting the underlying causes of your skin flares as needed to allow long-term healing. For too many people with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, it wasn’t enough. While oral steroids can improve the skin symptoms, atopic dermatitis often flares when treatment is stopped. Systemic steroids also come with many side effects when taken long-term. The goal of treating your atopic dermatitis is to ease your dry skin, reduce skin inflammation, and stop future flares. Today, you’ll have more cutting-edge and targeted options you can use topically or take systemically to address and reduce the underlying inflammatory responses and help you find relief."

        "There is a lot to think about when choosing a treatment for your atopic dermatitis. See a dermatologist with experience treating moderate to severe atopic dermatitis for advice if you haven’t already. Treatment approaches for this skin condition will depend on how severe your atopic dermatitis is. Your doctor can help you come up with a treatment plan that suits you best. It may include steps to avoid things that trigger your flares. Some common triggers include allergens, food allergies, skin irritants, sweat, and stress. Over-the counter medicines, creams, and ointments may help, too. Especially when atopic dermatitis is moderate to severe, you shouldn’t stop there. Your doctor can help you understand the severity based on how much of your body is affected, how intense the redness and swelling is, how itchy it is, and how much it’s affecting your ability to sleep and mental health. Talk to your doctor about your treatment options to get your atopic dermatitis under good control and help to prevent future flare-ups."

See a dermatologist with experience treating moderate to severe atopic dermatitis for advice if you haven’t already. Treatment approaches for this skin condition will depend on how severe your atopic dermatitis is. Your doctor can help you come up with a treatment plan that suits you best. It may include steps to avoid things that trigger your flares. Some common triggers include allergens, food allergies, skin irritants, sweat, and stress. Over-the counter medicines, creams, and ointments may help, too. Especially when atopic dermatitis is moderate to severe, you shouldn’t stop there. Your doctor can help you understand the severity based on how much of your body is affected, how intense the redness and swelling is, how itchy it is, and how much it’s affecting your ability to sleep and mental health. Talk to your doctor about your treatment options to get your atopic dermatitis under good control and help to prevent future flare-ups.",
