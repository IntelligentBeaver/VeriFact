The day’s exercise component had included lifting heavy weights, stationary biking, and some strenuous gardening for my overgrown backyard perennials.",

How my son had been so very upset, how hard I had worked to calm him down. How all of that had been followed by my spinning thoughts, my sleepless night. The answer to the blood sugar mystery suddenly was clear: a hefty helping of stress."
