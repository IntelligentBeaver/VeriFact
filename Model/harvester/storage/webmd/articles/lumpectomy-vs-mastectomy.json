        "During a lumpectomy, the surgeon removes the cancer and some healthy tissue around it to have “clean margins.” That means making sure no cancer is left behind in that area. You might hear other names for lumpectomy, such as partial mastectomy, wide local incision, and breast-conserving surgery.",

        "Based on the exact type, location, and stage of cancer you have, your provider may recommend one of these procedures. They may let you know that you have a choice between them. Here’s what you need to know to make that choice.",
        "Both lumpectomies and mastectomies can help treat breast cancer in people with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, but which one is right for you can depend on many factors, from your cancer location to your long-term goals. (Photo Credit: E+/Getty Images)"
