If that’s not enough to tell you about my love for perfumes, I considered taking a class to learn how to mix my own. Even as a child, I was captivated by the story of the wise men from the East bringing scents to baby Jesus. I wanted to know what frankincense and myrrh smelled like for as long as I could remember."
