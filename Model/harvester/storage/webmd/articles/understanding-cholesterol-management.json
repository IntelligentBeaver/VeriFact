        "All three PCSK9 inhibitors come as shots that you either give yourself or a doctor gives you. Praluent and Repatha are given once every two to four weeks. The first and second doses for Leqvio are given three months apart. After that, you get the medicine once every six months. Are PCSK9 inhibitors safe? Research finds that these medicines are safe and have a low risk of side effects. What are the side effects of PCSK9 inhibitors? Most side effects of these medications are mild. Who should not take PCSK9 inhibitors? Don't take these medicines if you've ever had an allergic reaction to any of their ingredients. How much do PCSK9 inhibitors cost? The price of PCSK9 inhibitors has come down since they were introduced. But they can still be expensive, with a list price of several hundred dollars per month. Most insurance companies cover them, but the approval process can be complex. Many drug companies that make PCSK9 inhibitors offer patient assistance programs (PAPs) to help reduce out-of-pocket costs. If you qualify, you may be able to get these medications at a reduced cost or, sometimes, for free. You may also be able to get a copay card that can reduce what you pay. Some drug companies will also help answer questions you have about your insurance coverage or other ways to get financial help."
