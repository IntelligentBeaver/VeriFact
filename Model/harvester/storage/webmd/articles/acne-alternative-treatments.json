But the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) says that \"all-natural supplements \" have not been shown to be effective, and some may even be harmful. For example, the group cites an over-the-counter (OTC) acne supplement that contained more than 200 times the amount of selenium stated on the label. It caused a wide range of toxic reactions. The AAD also states that there is emerging research that suggests that high glycemic index diets (those high in processed carbs and sugar) and dairy (particularly skim milk) may be associated with acne.",

For instance, oral zinc supplements are rated as only \"possibly effective.\" The same is true for topical preparations that contain zinc. Until there is better research, it's impossible to say which alternative acne treatments work and which ones don't."
