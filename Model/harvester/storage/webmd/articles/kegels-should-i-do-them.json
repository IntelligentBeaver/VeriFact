        "Kegel pelvic floor exercises are used to strengthen the muscles that support your uterus, bladder, bowel, and rectum. These highly focused exercises don't just help keep these muscles fit, they can also help you avoid bladder leaks and passing gas or stool by accident.",
        "In 1948, American gynecologist Arnold Kegel did the first studies among women exploring how specific exercises could strengthen pelvic floor muscles that had weakened due to age, pregnancy , or surgery. Once he found this exercise of contracting and releasing the pelvic floor muscles was successful, he published the study — and the helpful exercises took on his name.",
        "Although Kegel focused his study on women, more recent research has shown that men can even benefit from pelvic floor muscle exercises. Beyond incontinence, strengthening those pelvic floor muscles may also lead to greater sexual satisfaction and improved orgasms for all genders."

            "Vaginal cones. Vaginal cones are weights specifically designed to be inserted into the vagina like a tampon . When the cone is inserted, your pelvic muscles automatically contract to hold the device in place. Vaginal cones come in a set that includes cones of varying sizes and a series of weights that are placed inside the cones. As your pelvic floor muscles strengthen, you can decrease the size of the cone and/or use a heavier weight as you hold the device in place by contracting your pelvic muscles. Think of it as strength training for your vagina.",
            "Biofeedback . For both men and women, your doctor will insert a pressure sensor into the rectum or vagina. As you squeeze and relax your pelvic floor muscles, a monitor measures activity. At least one study among women with urinary incontinence showed that when used with pelvic floor exercise, biofeedback can improve the strength and selective control of pelvic floor muscles more than exercise alone."
