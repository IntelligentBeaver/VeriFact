        "A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood outside the brain. It is usually caused by serious head injuries. The bleeding and added pressure on the brain from this condition can be life-threatening. While some may stop on their own and suddenly go away, others need surgical drainage. Sometimes, they are called intracranial hematomas or subdural hemorrhages.",
        "In a subdural hematoma, blood collects between the layers of tissue that surround the brain. The outermost layer is called the dura. When bleeding occurs between the dura and the next layer, the arachnoid membrane, it's called a subdural hematoma .",
        "This bleeding occurs under the skull and outside the brain, not in the brain itself. As blood pools, however, it puts more pressure on the brain causing symptoms. If pressure inside the skull rises to a very high level, a subdural hematoma can lead to unconsciousness and death.",
        "Subdural vs. epidural hematoma",
        "Like a subdural hematoma, an epidural hematoma occurs when blood pools in the cranial tissue outside the brain. But in an epidural hematoma, the blood collects outside the dura, the outermost layer of this tissue. It usually requires a more forceful blow to the head to create this type of injury . Epidural hematomas are less common than subdural hematomas and most often occur in young adults.",
        "Epidural hematomas also tend to be more sudden than subdural bleeds. If you have an epidural hematoma, you will probably briefly lose consciousness. Other symptoms include headaches, drowsiness, vomiting and seizures. One of your pupils may also dilate, or become larger, a symptom known as a “blown pupil.” It is very important to get treatment for an epidural hematoma as quickly as possible, as the condition can become life-threatening or even fatal as it progresses.",
