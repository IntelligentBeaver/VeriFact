        "Arexvy was the first vaccine approved to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is a common virus that usually causes mild cold-like symptoms. These symptoms can be more severe in babies, older adults, those with compromised immune systems, and those with other health conditions. In some people, RSV can cause lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia . According to the CDC, RSV causes between 6,000 to 10,000 deaths each year in older adults. Arexvy has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalization from RSV."
