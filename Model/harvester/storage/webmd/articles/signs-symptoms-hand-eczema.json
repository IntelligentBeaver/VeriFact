You may have it all your life, or it may start later. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic condition. It’s caused by changes in the way your skin barrier and immune system work. Your immune system attacks your skin when it shouldn’t to cause the signs and symptoms. Many people with atopic dermatitis will have flares on their hands. It’s more likely for atopic dermatitis to affect your hands as you get older. About half of people with hand eczema don’t have atopic dermatitis on other parts of the body. Hand eczema can be triggered by contact with water or other irritants even when you don’t otherwise have problems with your skin barrier."
