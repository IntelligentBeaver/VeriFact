        "There are usually reasons or risk factors that predispose you to asthma and respiratory problems. Asthma can happen to anyone without any risk factors, but it is less likely if there are no risk factors present.",
        "Let's look at some asthma risk factors and see how they increase the chance that a person will have the asthma symptoms of cough , wheezing, and shortness of breath associated with the disease. After determining your personal risk factors for asthma , decide on the ones you can control and try to make some lifestyle changes. Avoidance of the risk factors you can control is crucial in preventing asthma symptoms . While you cannot change your gender or family history , you can avoid smoking with asthma, breathing polluted air, allergens, and taking care of your general health so you don't become overweight. Take control of your asthma -- by controlling your asthma risk factors. By understanding all the risk factors, you may be able to prevent or control your asthma."
