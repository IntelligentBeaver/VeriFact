        "When a baby gets respiratory syncytial virus (RSV ), it often causes cold-like symptoms that may need little treatment other than over-the-counter medicines and basic home care. But a serious infection may need more aggressive RSV treatments, including a temporary hospital stay. There, your baby can get IV fluids, supplemental oxygen, breathing treatments, and deep suctioning of mucus if they need it."

        "RSV is a common, very contagious viral infection that affects most children before the age of 2. RSV can make breathing harder. It’s also the leading cause of bronchiolitis (swelling of the lung’s small airways) and pneumonia in infants. While most cases of RSV in infants are mild and short, some can get worse and cause babies to go to the hospital. The CDC estimates that as many as 80,000 children under the age of 5 go to the hospital every year with an RSV infection. One or two out of every 100 babies younger than 6 months old with an RSV infection may need at least a short stay in the hospital."

        "Most mild RSV infections will clear up within a couple of weeks, with or without any treatment. Mild cases of RSV may be treated effectively with over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen , to help reduce a fever and soothe sore throat pain. You should never give aspirin to an infant. A lukewarm bath may also help bring down a mild fever. RSV also usually brings on congestion and a runny nose. Try saline drops to break up congestion. A cool-mist humidifier may be helpful, too. Gentle nasal suction can also help clear out mucus and make breathing a little easier. Getting enough fluids will also help loosen congestion and prevent dehydration. If your baby’s throat is sore, they may not want to swallow fluids, but it’s important to keep them hydrated. Breast milk or formula are best because they also contain important nutrients. Water is also helpful, but don’t let your baby go too long without breast milk or formula."
