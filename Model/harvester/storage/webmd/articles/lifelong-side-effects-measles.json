        "In 1957, just six years before a vaccine was released, Sarah R. and her cousin were infected with measles at the same time. Sarah, who now lives in Oakland, California, eventually recovered without major lasting effects. But her cousin, whom the family affectionately referred to as “Cotton” because of his platinum blond hair, lost both his hearing and eyesight. They were 6 years old.",
        "The two cousins started feeling ill during one of their family’s frequent visits together. Cotton soon went home, and Sarah continued to get sicker: Her fever spiked to more than 105 degrees. She was given a painful immune globulin injection, which contains antibodies and can sometimes reduce the severity of measles infection.",
        "Despite the shot, Sarah became very ill, unable to leave her bed for two weeks. Her grandmother bought her a canary to cheer her up. “That bird saved my life,” she says. Her high fever triggered seizures. She began hallucinating monsters and horrible creatures wandering her room. “I was absolutely terrified for hours at a time,” she says. “I had dreams of them for years — scary, scary dreams.”"

Marcie, then 9 years old, became sick quickly and was rushed to the hospital. She had developed encephalitis. She fell into a coma for more than five weeks, Herman says, and had irreversible brain damage.",
        "Around Passover in April, Marcie finally came home. “She survived, but she was a different Marcie,” Herman recalls. Her movements and social cues had become strange. Her laugh had become exaggerated. She often had abrupt mood changes. She’d been a great dancer, but now she struggled with balance. A gifted pianist, she now made frequent mistakes. She became easily frustrated and got sick often.
