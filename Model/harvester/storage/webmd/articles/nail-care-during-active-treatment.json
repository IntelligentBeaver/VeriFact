        "One of the most painful side effects for me during active treatment was nail lifting. That’s when your fingernail or toenail separates from the nail bed. I was told that in some severe cases your nails might fall off. The thought of this made my knees weak, and I really hoped it would not happen in my case.",

        "Keep your nails short on both your fingers and toes. This will help them from getting caught on anything. And it can keep you from accidentally hitting them on anything. This is extremely important during this time, as your nails can become fragile and can easily lift.",
        "Apply dark nail polish to help protect from UV light. I’m not entirely sure if this was helpful, but I did not want to risk it. I kept my nails a darker color, that is, until my nails started to turn black.",
        "Apply tea tree oil. Tea tree oil has many benefits. I even used some on my scalp. For nails, it is said to help with discoloration, to soften your nails, and to help prevent fungal infections. I did not do this daily but would try to do it at least a couple of days a week.",
        "Wear ice therapy socks and mittens. I saw that many people in an online breast cancer support group said they would wear the ice socks and ice mittens during their chemotherapy infusions. I left mine at home and would use them after getting home from a chemo session and during the week after.",
        "Visit a medical nail salon. I would go to a medical nail salon every other month whenever I could, or as needed. At some point my nails were so fragile and my fingers hurt so badly that applying any type of pressure would result in insurmountable pain. Doing simple tasks that involved my hands or fingers had me in tears. So I looked to a professional to help me. I am so happy I was able to find a place near my home that was affordable. The salon personnel were all professional and the location was very clean. Since this was a medical salon there were not very many people there, so I did not have to worry about being around a crowd. This, of course, was important since I had a lowered immune system. The other important thing for me is that they were medically trained and the salon was sterile and clean."
