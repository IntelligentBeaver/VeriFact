        "Oculomotor: Associated with seeing. It allows for motor function in many of the muscles surrounding your eyes as they move and focus. The oculomotor nerve also controls the dilation and constriction of your pupils as they respond to light.",
        "Trochlear: Associated with muscle movement. The trochlear nerve operates the superior oblique muscles, which perform many eye movements (inward, outward, and downward).",
