        "Systemic arthritis , also called Still's disease, can affect the entire body or involve many systems of the body. Systemic juvenile arthritis usually causes high fever and a rash. The rash is usually on the trunk, arms, and legs. Systemic juvenile arthritis can also affect internal organs, such as the heart, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes , but usually not the eyes. Boys and girls are equally affected.",
        "Oligoarthritis, also called pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , affects fewer than five joints in the first six months that the child has the disease. The joints most commonly affected are the knee, ankle, and wrist. Oligoarthritis can affect the eye, most often the iris. This is known as uveitis, iridocyclitis, or iritis. This type of arthritis is more common in girls than in boys, and many children will outgrow this disease by the time they become adults.",
        "Polyarthritis , also called polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), involves five or more joints in the first six months of the disease -- often the same joints on each side of the body. This type of arthritis can affect the joints in the jaw and neck as well as those in the hands and feet. This type is also more common in girls than in boys and more closely resembles the adult form.",
        "Psoriatic arthritis affects children who have both arthritis and the skin disorder psoriasis . The child might get either the psoriasis or the arthritis years before developing the other part of the disease. Children with this type of arthritis often have pitted fingernails.",
        "Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of arthritis that often afflicts the spine, hips, eyes, and entheses (the places where tendons attach to bones). This type of arthritis occurs mainly in boys older than 8 years of age. There is often a family history of arthritis of the back (called ankylosing spondylitis) among the child's male relatives."

NSAIDs include products such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Possible side effects are nausea and stomach ache; these drugs should be taken with food. Aspirin is included in the NSAID category, but is rarely prescribed for treating arthritis.",
        "Slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs (SAARDs) are used to treat pain and swelling over time and usually take several weeks or more to work. These drugs are also called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The doctor may prescribe drugs in this category in combination with NSAIDs. Lab tests to check for possible side effects are usually necessary. One of the most commonly used DMARDs is methotrexate (Rheumatrex). Other DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine ) , and drugs that block tumor necrosis factor (TNF), also called anti-TNF drugs. Etanercept (Enbrel) and etanercept-szzs (Erelzi) are examples of anti-TNF medication used to treat juvenile arthritis.",
        "Corticosteroids are also used to treat pain and swelling. Sometimes, before any other treatment is tried, steroids are given as an injection into the affected joint. In certain cases, the doctor might prescribe oral steroids (taken by mouth), but these are generally avoided in children because of adverse side effects, which may include poor growth and weight gain.",
        "Antimetabolites are a type of drug that is an aggressive therapy aimed at helping reduce further joint damage and preserve joint function. The new drug Xatmep is an oral form of methotrexate that can be used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in pediatric patients, usually when NSAIDs have been proven to be ineffective."

NSAIDs include products such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Possible side effects are nausea and stomach ache; these drugs should be taken with food. Aspirin is included in the NSAID category, but is rarely prescribed for treating arthritis.",
            "Slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs (SAARDs) are used to treat pain and swelling over time and usually take several weeks or more to work. These drugs are also called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The doctor may prescribe drugs in this category in combination with NSAIDs. Lab tests to check for possible side effects are usually necessary. One of the most commonly used DMARDs is methotrexate (Rheumatrex). Other DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine ) , and drugs that block tumor necrosis factor (TNF), also called anti-TNF drugs. Etanercept (Enbrel) and etanercept-szzs (Erelzi) are examples of anti-TNF medication used to treat juvenile arthritis.",
            "Corticosteroids are also used to treat pain and swelling. Sometimes, before any other treatment is tried, steroids are given as an injection into the affected joint. In certain cases, the doctor might prescribe oral steroids (taken by mouth), but these are generally avoided in children because of adverse side effects, which may include poor growth and weight gain.",
            "Antimetabolites are a type of drug that is an aggressive therapy aimed at helping reduce further joint damage and preserve joint function. The new drug Xatmep is an oral form of methotrexate that can be used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in pediatric patients, usually when NSAIDs have been proven to be ineffective."
