        "Feb. 23, 2024 – The recent growth in measles cases in the United States and the world is linked to declining vaccination rates for children, medical experts say.",
        "The CDC issued an alert last month saying 23 confirmed cases of measles had been detected in the United States between Dec. 1, 2023, and Jan. 23. That included seven cases imported by international travelers and two outbreaks with more than five cases each.",
        "“Most of these cases were among children and adolescents who had not received a measles-containing vaccine (MMR or MMRV), even if age eligible,” the CDC said.",
        "Vaccination rates have been declining for several years.",
        "National coverage for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) was 93.1% for the 2022-2023 school year, a 2% drop from the 95% rate in the 2019-2020 school year, the CDC reported . That was the third straight year the rate fell below 95%, which is the level needed for herd immunity.",
        "“We’re not just seeing cases, we’re seeing transmission, which means vaccine levels aren’t what we’d like them to be,” Saskia Popescu, PhD, an assistant professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told PBS ."
