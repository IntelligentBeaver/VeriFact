These drugs also lower elevated triglycerides. The main side effects are flushing, itching, tingling, and headache, yet aspirin can reduce many of these symptoms. However, speak with your doctor first. Niacin or nicotinic acid, includes the brand names Niacor , Niaspan , or Slo-niacin. Over-the-counter preparations include extended-release, timed-release, and controlled-release. Niacin found in dietary supplements should not be used to lower cholesterol. Your doctor or lipid specialist will let you know if niacin is appropriate for you. Recent research suggests that niacin may improve cholesterol numbers, but may not be associated with the prevention of heart attacks.",
