        "Faster and lighter are the qualities many of us look for in a car, a laptop, and our bodies when we're running a marathon. They're also the prized attributes of skin care serums -- light, fast-absorbing liquids used as an alternative or in addition to creams or lotions.",
        "The biggest difference between a serum and a cream or lotion is what the formulation doesn't include. Serums leave out occlusive, or airtight, moisturizing ingredients such as petrolatum or mineral oil that keep water from evaporating. They also contain fewer lubricating and thickening agents, like nut or seed oils. Most serums are water-based, eliminating oils altogether.",
        "Serums are a top pick of many skin care pros, including Ni'Kita Wilson, a cosmetic chemist and vice president of research and innovation at Englewood Lab. Wilson chooses a serum instead of a cream for her own at-home regimen: \"It works better for my oily skin, and it has every ingredient I need.\"",
        "Esthetician Veronica Barton-Schwartz, owner of Veronica Skin and Body Care Center in Malibu, Calif., who counts celebrities Olivia Newton-John, Suzanne Somers, and Cher among her clients, is also a fan. \"I think everyone is doing their skin a disservice if they don't have a great serum.\"",
        "\"The beauty of a serum is that most of the fluid is eliminated,\" Wilson says, \"so what you're left with is a high concentration of active ingredients.\" Serums contain the most potent dose of anti-aging ingredients -- antioxidants , peptides, and skin brighteners such as kojic acid -- you can find in nonprescription products. \"They're the true workhorses of any product line,\" Wilson says."
