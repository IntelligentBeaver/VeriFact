        "Every so often, ABC News anchor Bob Woodruff feels a rock \"emerge\" from his face “like a zit,\" he says. But it's not a pimple; it's a not-so-subtle reminder of what he has been through over the past four years.",
        "On Jan. 29, 2006, a mere 27 days after he was tapped to succeed Peter Jennings as the co-anchor of ABC World News Tonight, Woodruff was nearly killed when a roadside bomb struck his vehicle while on assignment near Taji, Iraq.",
        "The details of the attack are still murky, but an improvised explosive device (IED) waylaid his convoy. Woodruff was wearing body armor and was in a tank, but his head, neck, and shoulders were exposed during the blast. The blast knocked Woodruff unconscious as rocks and metal pierced his face, jaw, and neck. Woodruff's cameraman, Doug Vogt, and an Iraqi soldier were also hurt.",
        "\"How I survived, we still don’t know to this day,\" Woodruff said in a speech this month in San Diego at the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery's annual meeting. The audience included the surgeon who rebuilt his face after the attack."
