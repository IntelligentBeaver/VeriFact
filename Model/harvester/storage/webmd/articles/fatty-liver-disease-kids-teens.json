        "After looking at Cash’s kidneys, the ultrasound tech – whom they hadn’t seen before – did something no one else had: She lingered around Cash’s liver with her ultrasound wand, taking more pictures. Then she stepped out to chat with the radiologist .",

        "“I’ve seen a lot of kids over the past few years as young as 2. Even yesterday, I saw a 6-year-old,” says Niviann Blondet, MD, a pediatric gastroenterologist and fatty liver expert at Children’s. “And their [liver enzyme] levels are in the hundreds, but normal for their age would be less than 30.”",
        "If fatty liver disease goes unchecked, it can lead to serious conditions such as permanent liver scarring, liver failure , or even liver cancer . “If you’re already having these issues [as a child], it’s really, really hard to break the cycle once you get into adulthood,” Blondet warns.",
        "As the diagnoses climb in numbers, experts advocate for more routine screening of children with risk factors, including obesity, prediabetes or diabetes, and family history of fatty liver disease. Doctors should also take it into account when kids come from Hispanic backgrounds, as they are several times more likely to have fatty liver disease. That may be due to higher rates of obesity and diabetes, which raises the risk of fatty liver, and higher rates of certain genes linked to the disease, notes Rohit Loomba, MD, a gastroenterologist and founding director of the MASLD Research Center at the University of California, San Diego.",
        "In most cases, if MASLD is caught early, it can be reversed through diet and exercise. “We’re trying to capture them earlier and earlier,” Blondet says."
