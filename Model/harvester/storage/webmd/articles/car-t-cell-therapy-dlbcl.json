        "It's a type of immunotherapy that uses your body's own white blood cells to fight your lymphoma. It uses a particular kind of white blood cell known as T lymphocytes , or T cells. Doctors remove them from your body, change them in a lab so that they target lymphoma cells, and then put them back into your body, where they go to work killing cancer cells. To help make sure your body doesn't reject the CAR T cells, you'll typically be given three to four days of chemotherapy a few days before you receive them. This is to tamp down your immune system by reducing the number of immune cells in your body. Then the CAR T cells can go to work."
