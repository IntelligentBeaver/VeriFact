        "Every day, your heart beats about 100,000 times, sending 2,000 gallons of blood surging through your body. Although it’s no bigger than your fist, your heart has the mighty job of keeping blood flowing through the 60,000 miles of blood vessels that feed your organs and tissues. Any damage to the heart or its valves can reduce that pumping power, forcing the heart to work harder just to keep up with the body’s demand for blood.",
        "So how do you make sure your heart is in tip-top shape? \"Keeping your body in good health helps keep the heart a more efficient organ,\" Krasuski advises. In other words, eat healthy, well-balanced meals and don’t skimp on the exercise."
