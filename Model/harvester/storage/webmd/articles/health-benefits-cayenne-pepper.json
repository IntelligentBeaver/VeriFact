        "If you like spice, you’re probably familiar with cayenne peppers. The long, thin, bright red chili pepper ( Capsicum annuum) is a member of the nightshade (Solanaceae) family. It’s related to other capsicums, including sweet bell peppers, jalapeños, poblanos, serranos, and the notoriously spicy ghost peppers.",
        "Dried and fresh cayenne peppers are packed with antioxidants and nutrients beneficial to your health. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images)",
        "While cayenne pepper's not nearly as hot as ghost pepper, it still packs quite a punch on the Scoville scale, which measures the heat of chili peppers in Scoville Heat Units (SHU). Cayenne peppers have a heat range of 30,000-50,000 SHUs, while ghost peppers have a higher heat level, ranging from 855,000 to 1.04 million SHUs.",
        "Cayenne pepper is commonly dried and ground into a fine powder and has been important for centuries, in both cooking and medicine. It's very common in Cajun and Creole cuisines and widely used in traditional Ayurvedic and Eastern medicines, mostly for digestive and circulation problems.",
        "The pepper grows on the cayenne shrub that likely originated in Central and South America, but today it's cultivated around the world in tropical climates such as India, East Africa, Mexico, and certain areas of the United States.",
        "Not only are cayenne peppers delicious, but they also have capsaicin , which provides some remarkable health benefits."
