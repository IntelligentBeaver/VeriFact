I spent my whole adolescence researching and studying tidying. … I realized that the most important thing about tidying is not deciding what to discard but, rather, deciding what to keep.",

        "Bring out each item you own and hold them one by one. If it’s difficult for you to connect with your sense of joy when holding your belongings, I suggest starting with an item you really love and using that feeling as a point of comparison for everything else."
