        "Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory condition in which your body’s immune system attacks your joints and causes painful inflammation . Ixekizumab (brand name Taltz) is a prescription medication that many doctors prescribe to patients as a psoriatic arthritis treatment. The medication blocks a specific protein in your body called protein IL-17A that causes inflammation.",
        "There are many ways to improve your psoriatic arthritis symptoms naturally through diet , exercise, and therapy, but for severe conditions, your doctor may recommend a medication like Taltz to improve your symptoms. Addressing inflammation and swelling is crucial with psoriatic arthritis because, if left untreated, permanent damage to your joints may occur.",
        "Ixekizumab is an injection you can perform at home. You will use two 80-milligram syringes for your first dose. You follow up with a single 80-milligram injection every four weeks for maintenance. Some people feel a difference as quickly as a few weeks after the first injection. For other people, it takes several months before you can tell a difference in your symptoms."
