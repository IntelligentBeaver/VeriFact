        "Portal hypertension is an increase in the blood pressure within a system of veins called the portal venous system. Veins coming from the stomach , intestine, spleen , and pancreas merge into the portal vein, which then branches into smaller vessels and travels through the liver . If the vessels in the liver are blocked due to liver damage, blood cannot flow properly through the liver. As a result, high pressure in the portal system develops. This increased pressure in the portal vein may lead to the development of large, swollen veins (varices) within the esophagus , stomach, rectum, or umbilical area (belly button). Varices can rupture and bleed, resulting in potentially life-threatening complications."
