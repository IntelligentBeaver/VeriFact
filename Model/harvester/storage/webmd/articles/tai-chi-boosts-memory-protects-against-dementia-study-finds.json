        "About 300 people in their mid-70s participated in the study. They all took the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, with an average score of 25, NPR reported. A score of 26-30 is considered normal and a score of 18-25 means they don’t have dementia but they do have memory problems.",
        "Participants who took a simplified form of tai chi called Tai Ji Quan twice a week for six months improved their score by 1.5 points.",
        "\"If you're able to keep doing [tai chi] two or three days a week on a routine basis, you're going to get extra years before you hit that decline into dementia,\" lead author Elizabeth Eckstrom, MD, of Oregon Health and Science University told NPR.",
        "Participants who practiced a form called Cognitively Enhanced Tai Ji Quan improved their score about 3 points, NPR reported. In that form, challenges were added, such as asking participants to spell a word forward and backwards as they did the movements."
