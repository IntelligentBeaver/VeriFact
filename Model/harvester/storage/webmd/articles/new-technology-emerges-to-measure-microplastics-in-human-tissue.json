        "Feb. 26, 2024 – Researchers examining human placentas for evidence of microplastics found measurable amounts in every single one.",
        "The findings were published this month in the journal Toxicological Sciences. For the study, researchers used a technology called saponification on the donated placenta tissue that works in a way similar to how soap is made. The samples were then spun using an ultracentrifuge, which is a device that can spin as fast as 150,000 rotations per minute. After the spin, a tiny pellet of plastic remained, which was then heated until gas emissions from the plastic could be analyzed to find out what type of plastic it was.",
        "“The gas emission goes into a mass spectrometer and gives you a specific fingerprint. It’s really cool,\" lead researcher Matthew Campen, PhD, a professor in the University of New Mexico Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, said in a statement .",
        "Nearly every one of the 62 samples analyzed showed evidence of polyethylene, which is a chemical compound used to make plastic. It’s commonly used in packaging. Polyvinyl chloride (often called PVC) and nylon were also common."
