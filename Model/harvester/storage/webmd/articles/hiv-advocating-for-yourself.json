        "After testing positive for HIV, I was told to see an infectious disease specialist. I was afraid and concerned and in a delicate state of mind. I didn’t ask many questions, but I was aware of what the doctor said. I listened closely to the information I was receiving. The appointment had almost finished, when she started speaking out loud to herself about what tests to order. (I remember thinking she wasn’t the warmest individual I’d encountered.) Still, I was going along with everything until she mumbled, “ We’ll also have to possibly schedule a spinal tap.” I asked why that was necessary. Without even looking up from the chart, she said, \"Because we have to make sure the HIV hasn’t spread to your brain.\""
