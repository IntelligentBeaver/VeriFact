        "Contact lenses have come a long way and offer some exciting options. You can wear a pair of baby blue lenses one day, then flash golden tiger eyes the next. You can even toss disposable lenses in the trash each night.",
        "For people who have difficulty seeing in the distance or close up, contacts remain an effective, comfortable, and almost invisible tool. The thin plastic lenses fit over your cornea — the clear, front part of your eye — to fix vision problems, including nearsightedness , farsightedness , and astigmatism . You can wear contacts even if you are both nearsighted and farsighted and need bifocals.",
        "Contacts have some advantages over glasses, aside from the convenience of not wearing frames. For example, placing contacts directly on your eyes gives you a full range of vision, unlike lenses in frames that are just a few inches around your field of vision. The contact lens itself can also “smooth out” some imperfections on the eye surface better than glasses can.",
        "If you’re interested in trying contacts, speak to your eye doctor about the best type of lenses for you. Get regular eye exams to keep your eyes healthy and make sure your prescription stays up to date."
