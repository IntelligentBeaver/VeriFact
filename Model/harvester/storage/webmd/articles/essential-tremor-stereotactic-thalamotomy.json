        "Researchers think that the abnormal brain activity that causes Essential Tremor is processed through a structure deep in the brain called the thalamus. Stereotactic thalamotomy works by destroying part of the thalamus to block the abnormal brain activity from reaching the muscles and causing tremor.",
        "Although thalamotomy is still performed today, it is done less frequently because of the risk of serious side effects and the availability of deep brain stimulation or ablation of brain tissue or burn through a high-intensity ultrasound technique, both of which are safer and have fewer complications.",
        "Most thalamotomies are performed on just one side of the brain -- the side opposite to the most severely affected limb. If done on both sides of the brain, you carry a higher risk of developing severe speech problems or becoming completely mute. You also have a greater risk of developing cognitive (thinking) problems."
