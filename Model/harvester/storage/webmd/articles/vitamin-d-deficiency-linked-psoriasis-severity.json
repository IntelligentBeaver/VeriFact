        "July 26, 2023 -- A study has found a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and psoriasis severity, suggesting that some people who increase their intake of the vitamin could better control this skin condition that affects up to 8 million people in the United States alone.",
        "Brown University researchers studied almost 500 psoriasis cases taken from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the scientists told the conference of the American Society for Nutrition (ASN) in Boston. They compared the peoples' reports on how much of their body surface was affected by psoriasis to vitamin D levels collected in blood samples.",
        "“After adjusting for lifestyle factors such as smoking, the analysis showed that lower vitamin D levels and vitamin D deficiency were significantly associated with greater psoriasis severity,” the ASN said in a news release. “The researchers also found that patients with the least amount of body surface affected by psoriasis had the highest average vitamin D levels while those with the greatest affected area had the lowest average levels of vitamin D.”"
