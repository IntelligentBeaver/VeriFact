        "Migraine headaches cause intense, throbbing head pain. These headaches can also make your nerves extremely sensitive, and even the slightest touch may become painful. This is called allodynia, which means \"other pain.\" Up to about 80% of people with this condition have allodynia during an attack.",
        "Pain is an uncomfortable sensation, but it's meant to be helpful. It warns your body that you're injured so you can stop doing whatever caused it and treat it if needed. However, allodynia is pain that doesn't serve any purpose.",
        "You also can have allodynia if you have a disease that damages your nerves, such as diabetes, or if you've broken a bone or have nerve damage from an injury.",
