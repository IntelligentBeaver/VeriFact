        "Does It Work?",
        "Research suggests that a Mediterranean diet, similar to Turner's, can aid weight loss. You will lose weight on the plan because it is low in calories.",
        "But promising that it can \"balance hormones,\" cure a whole host of problems and diseases, restore sleep, give you glowing skin and healthier hair , and more is not based on solid, scientific evidence.",
        "Eating a clean, natural, preferably organic diet, free of preservatives and processed foods is ideal, but it's not practical or necessary for weight loss or good health. Nor are the tremendous amounts of supplements, including herbal and bowel cleansers.",
        "Is It Good for Certain Conditions?",
        "Following a Mediterranean-style, low-glycemic diet is a sensible approach to healthy eating and weight loss that could benefit most people. Reaching a healthy weight can improve many conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.",
        "The Final Word",
        "The cocktail of supplements and the hormone theories are unfounded and not recommended. Keep in mind that many things affect your hormone levels. It's not just about your food. To say that certain foods are \"hormone hindering\" is inaccurate and oversimplifies the role of nutrients in the body.",
        "Phases two and three, or the “Glyci-Med\" portion of the diet, are the most nutritionally balanced phases and the most likely to be sustainable. Anyone seeking a very green diet may want to use this plan as a template for a low-calorie diet, but be sure to add a daily multivitamin with minerals, and also make physical activity a habit.",
