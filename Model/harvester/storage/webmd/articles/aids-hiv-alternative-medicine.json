There’s not a lot of research specific to HIV/AIDs, but some small studies show that it may ease depression and anxiety. If it helps you relax and feel better, that’s a benefit. Massage may work better when combined with other therapies like meditation and stress relief .",

These practices focus on the link between the mind, body, and behavior to improve your health and well-being. When it comes to HIV/AIDS, scientists have found that meditation and other mindfulness training techniques like repeating mantras could lower stress and make you feel happier, and better prepared to manage anger and conflict."
