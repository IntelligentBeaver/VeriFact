        "When doctors catch ovarian cancer early, standard treatments, including surgery and chemotherapy, often work. Most women diagnosed when their cancer is only in the ovaries or nearby lymph nodes survive for 5 years or more. That doesn’t mean they live only 5 years. Research typically doesn’t track cancer survival past 5 years.",
        "The trouble is that doctors find about 6 in every 10 ovarian cancers after they have spread to more distant parts of the body. That’s because ovarian cancer often doesn’t show symptoms before it spreads. These advanced cancers are much harder for doctors to treat successfully. As a result, statistics show that less than half of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer live 5 years or more.",
        "But, looking ahead, new research offers a lot of hope. Ongoing research and treatment advances now give women with advanced ovarian cancers more options and the chance to live longer and better."
