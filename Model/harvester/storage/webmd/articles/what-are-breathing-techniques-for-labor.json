Medical settings at hospitals are often highly controlled and restrictive for the safety of patients and staff. Breathing techniques like Lamaze may be the only non-medication comfort strategy available in some settings.",
        "Focusing on and controlling your breath enhances your ability to relax and lessens your perception of pain. The Lamaze breathing technique for labor is named after its creator, Dr. Fernand Lamaze. He first introduced the technique when delivering Marjorie Karmel’s baby in France.",
        "Following her experience, Karmel partnered with Elisabeth Bing to found the American Society for Psychoprophylaxis (ASPO), which is now known as Lamaze International. Their goal was to train childbirth educators in the Lamaze technique so they could help doctors and nurses implement it during labor and delivery .",
        "The Lamaze breathing technique is thought to work because your focus is on your breath instead of the pain. This provides a distraction while also relaxing your body and ensuring you get enough oxygen. Women who used the technique were less likely to need pain medication, which at the time meant being asleep instead of awake during the delivery."
