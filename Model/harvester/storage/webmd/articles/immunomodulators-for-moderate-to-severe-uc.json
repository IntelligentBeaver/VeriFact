Having more than six bloody bowel movements a day is what doctors call moderate-to-severe UC. There’s no cure. But different treatments, like immunomodulators, can help you stay in remission."

        "Conventional, or nonbiologic, immunomodulators (IMs) are a type of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). IMs have been around since the 1960s. They’re a group of prescription drugs for certain autoimmune conditions, where an overactive immune system causes inflammation, pain, and other UC symptoms. Because they’re not biologics, they’re sometimes known as traditional DMARDs. These drugs can “turn down” your immune system. This is helpful since UC is caused, in large part, by an overactive immune system.  They can be helpful for some people with UC. But they can take up to 6 months to work and can cause side effects. Your doctor may have you try other treatments before trying immunomodulators. Or they may have you take an immunomodulator and a different type of medicine at the same time."

        "Your immune system’s job is to defend you from foreign invaders, like viruses and bacteria, that could make you sick. But sometimes, this important defense system switches on and doesn’t turn off. Experts believe that’s what happens with UC. Your body keeps sending white blood cells into your colon and rectum to fight against an imagined enemy. The result is ongoing inflammation that causes sores in the lining of your large colon. Some IMs help by tamping down your immune system response. S1P receptor modulators seek out and attach themselves to a protein receptor called sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) on the surfaces of immune T and B cells. This stops the immune cells from being released in the blood."
