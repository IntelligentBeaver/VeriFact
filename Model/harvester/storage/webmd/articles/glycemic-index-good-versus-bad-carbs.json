        "Carbohydrate-containing foods vary in how they will affect your blood sugar, a quality measured as glycemic index (GI). Green veggies, beans, and most fruits have a low to medium GI, while white rice and potatoes have a high GI. (Photo Credits: iStock/Getty Images)",
        "Glycemic index (GI) is a number that gives you an idea about how fast your body converts the carbohydrates in a food into glucose. The GI is a way to rank foods containing carbs on a scale from 1 to 100 based on how much they affect your blood sugar levels . Two foods with the same amount of carbohydrates can have different GI numbers. The smaller the number, the less impact the food has on your blood sugar.",
        "You can group foods into three categories based on their GI: low, medium, and high. A food with a score of 100 means that it has a big effect on your blood sugar, while a score of 1 indicates little effect. GI can help you make food choices. For example, following a low-GI diet can help you avoid spikes in your blood sugar levels.",
        "The reason some foods make blood sugar shoot up fast is that simple carbohydrates in them, such as refined sugars and white flour, are easier for your body to change into glucose, the sugar your body uses for energy. In contrast, carbs such as those in vegetables and whole grains are digested more slowly. Foods that are close to how they're found in nature tend to have a lower glycemic index than refined and processed foods. If you eat a lot of those high-GI carbs, you may have a harder time controlling your blood sugar."
