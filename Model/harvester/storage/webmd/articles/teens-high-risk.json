        "Talk about it. This is less about one big talk than it is many talks to prepare your teen to be on her own. \"It is important for parents to prepare kids to be independent,\" says pediatric allergist Anne Miranowski, MD. \"Parents should teach kids how to read food labels, make smart decisions at grocery stores and restaurants, recognize symptoms, and when to call 911. It should be an ongoing educational process.\"",

For instance, help her create \"chef cards\" that explain the allergy, and encourage her to talk about it with waiters, chefs, and restaurant managers when you go out to eat."
