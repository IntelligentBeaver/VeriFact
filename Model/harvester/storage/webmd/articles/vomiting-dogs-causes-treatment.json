The food expelled during regurgitation is usually undigested and without bile. But vomit is partially digested and has some bile. Your dog will almost always try to eat regurgitated food."

Other medications may include antiemetics, which are used to control vomiting. In other cases, the dog may need fluid therapy. Surgery can be recommended in serious cases.",

The vet may advise you to feed your dog some home-cooked food like skinless chicken, boiled potatoes, and rice. These can be good short-term options for a dog with an upset stomach, but they are not nutritionally complete for long-term care. Take care of your dog as you would a sick child. Do not feed your dog raw food, which can have germs like Salmonella.",
