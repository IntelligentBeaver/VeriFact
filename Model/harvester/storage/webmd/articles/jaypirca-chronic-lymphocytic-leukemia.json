        "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a form of cancer that affects white blood cells called lymphocytes . There are many types of leukemia, and CLL is a common type in adults. This type of cancer starts in the bone marrow and then goes into the blood. Often people do not have any symptoms of CLL for many years after the disease starts because it develops slowly, but symptoms may begin to appear as it spreads to the lymph nodes , liver, spleen, or other areas in the body. CLL is closely related to another leukemia called small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). CLL is more commonly found in the blood and bone marrow, while SLL is found more commonly in the lymph nodes.",
        "Because CLL develops slowly, you may not need to be treated right away. You will work with your health care provider to find out when treatment is right for you. Your health care provider has many options for treating your CLL, including chemotherapy , immunotherapy , and targeted therapy . jaypirca is a targeted therapy for CLL and other types of blood cancer."

        "Jaypirca is a targeted therapy for CLL and other specific cancers. It is known as a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTK inhibitor). BTK is an enzyme that helps certain types of cancer cells grow. Jaypirca blocks the BTK enzyme to help stop cancer cells from growing and multiplying. It can help slow the spread of CLL. There are two types of BTK inhibitors, the noncovalent and covalent BTK inhibitors. Jaypirca is a noncovalent BTK inhibitor that acts differently from covalent BTK inhibitors. Jaypirca may work for people when other BTK inhibitors no longer work."
