        "Seeing a therapist wasn’t a thing in my family. It was quite the opposite, actually. My parents and their siblings tend to keep things private. So the idea of speaking to someone about me had never entered my mind.",
        "When my schizophrenia symptoms started (though I didn’t know that’s what they were at the time), I approached a friend about the issues I was facing. He avoided responding and handed me a business card from his therapist. “She is good,” he said. “You should talk to her.” Curious about what might help, I called Susan.",
        "I felt awkward during our first session, but Susan guided me to open up. She asked about my childhood and what I wanted to do when I grew up. She wanted to see me every two weeks, which I thought was superfluous, but I agreed. Over the subsequent sessions, I told her about my parents, hobbies, and what made me happy. She recommended that I put up a wall of sticky notes with what I want to do in life and look at it daily."

        "Deborah asked fewer questions than Susan and didn’t have a decorated sitting room like Mary. Because I knew better now, the sessions with Deborah felt helpful. I enjoyed talking about what was on my mind for 45 minutes every two weeks. I felt good about dedicating time to talking about and focusing on myself. At the end of the session, Deborah would always check in on any flare-ups and the status of my medication.",
        "For a long time, I wondered why no one ever asked me what I heard from my auditory hallucinations or my distorted thoughts during a psychosis. One of my research doctors explained that recognizing someone in distress and alleviating that is more important than discussing the actual hallucinations and confused thinking, which would vary from person to person.",
        "I now understand why Susan, Mary, and Deborah were trying to get me to think about my life with different questions. Once I gained awareness of my brain disease, I was able to move on from my hallucinations and focus on my day-to-day life goals. I wasn’t ready to get therapy with Susan and Mary, but I benefited enormously from meeting with Deborah regularly years later."
