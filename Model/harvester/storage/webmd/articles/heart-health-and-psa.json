        "Psoriatic arthritis doesn't just impact your joints and skin. It is so much more than that. One major organ it impacts is your heart. Heart disease, hypertension, and other heart-related conditions can arise from PsA, and it’s crucial to learn how to protect yourself and your heart while dealing with this condition.",
        "So how does PsA affect the heart? Since PsA is an inflammatory condition, it can cause inflammation throughout the body, including the heart. This kind of inflammation can lead to the buildup of fatty plaques in blood vessels within the heart and surrounding it. Inflammation can also trigger heart disease in some PsA patients. With the risk of developing heart disease, some people are also at risk of heart attacks, strokes, atrial fibrillation, angina, and heart failure.",
        "Let’s talk about heart disease and PsA. Did you know heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States for both men and women? According to the Arthritis Foundation, the risk of having heart disease may be nearly doubled in people with psoriatic arthritis. PsA can contribute to heart disease, especially if there is a family history of it. However, there is a lot you can do to protect your heart and stay healthy. Heart-healthy living includes making healthy choices daily and taking steps to reduce your chances of getting heart disease as best as you can. By taking preventive measures right now, you can actually lower your risk of developing heart disease that could lead to a heart attack, and you can also improve your overall health and well-being in the process.",
        "So what can you do to protect your heart and be heart healthy while dealing with PsA? First things first, you need to try and eat a healthy diet. A healthy diet can help protect the heart, improve blood pressure and cholesterol, and lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. A heart-healthy eating plan usually includes lots of vegetables, fruits, beans, legumes, lean meats and fish, low-fat or fat-free dairy foods, whole grains, and healthy fats. If you are unsure where to begin diet-wise, two great examples of heart-healthy diets are the DASH eating plan and the Mediterranean diet. You also want to try your best to avoid very salty meals/snacks, sugar or sweetened beverages, highly refined carbs, alcohol, highly processed food, and trans fat."

        "Some other ways to protect your heart health while living with PsA are to exercise, get quality sleep, manage your stress, and get regular health screenings. Exercising can be extremely tough with PsA, but if you can move your body for at least 30-60 minutes a day, a few times a week, it will make your heart stronger. You can even do resistance exercises, go for walks, swim, lift light weights, ride a bike, or dance.",
        "Another way to protect your heart health with PsA is to try to get a good night's sleep as often as possible. People who don't get enough sleep have a higher risk of obesity, high blood pressure, heart attack, diabetes and depression. Most adults need at least seven hours of sleep each night. You can try to set a sleep schedule and stick to it. To do that, go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. You can keep your bedroom dark and quiet, too, so it's easier to fall asleep and stay asleep."

        "Managing your stress will also help with your heart health and PsA symptoms. I know it can be difficult to manage stress with PsA. Did you know that ongoing stress can play a role in higher blood pressure and other risk factors for heart disease? Some people may deal with their stress in unhealthy ways. With PsA, you can boost your health by finding other ways to manage your stress. You can try getting some physical activity, doing breathing relaxation exercises, practicing gratitude/mindfulness (I like to keep a journal for this), and even trying out yoga or meditation. If you notice that your stress is becoming overwhelming, try to seek help right away. Keep in mind, your ongoing stress could be linked with mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.",
        "Last but certainly not least, please do not forget to get regular health screenings done. One thing I actually monitor daily is my blood pressure. I use an at-home blood pressure cuff machine. Your blood pressure should be measured at least once a month, and most doctors check your vitals at your appointments. This will indicate if you have high blood pressure, which puts you at risk of heart disease and strokes. Seeing a cardiologist at least once a year for a checkup is super important with PsA. Even if you feel perfectly fine, it doesn’t hurt to get your heart checked out. You just never know what could be going on inside of your body, and it’s important to be proactive. If you notice any changes in your blood pressure, resting heart rate/active heart rate, or overall health, you should see a doctor right away. Do not wait until it is too late. I can’t stress this enough."
