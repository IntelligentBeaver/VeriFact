        "By Elena Sledge, as told to Kara Mayer Robinson I’ve been living with depression for almost 12 years. I’m 31 now and I found out I had major depressive disorder when I was 19. I had a miserable freshman year of college, but I didn't really know what was wrong. I saw a therapist and the following summer, I was diagnosed with major depression. Looking back, I can see I was also depressed in high school. Coming to terms with my diagnosis was a process. I had a hard time understanding why I was depressed and where it came from. In my mind, I hadn't been through anything bad enough to warrant having major depressive disorder. Therapy helped. My therapist normalized and validated my experience. At one point, she told me, \"You have depression because you have it.\" That’s something I've never forgotten. I realized I needed to accept my diagnosis and take steps to help me."

        "I’ve also taken various medications. I took one SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) for about 2 years when I was first diagnosed. The effects wore off, but it helped me so much initially. I tried other medications for short periods of time, like other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). They helped when I needed them. I’m 100% a supporter of medication for mental health, but it's not something I feel I need right now. If that changes, I’ll probably try it again. I’ve also made many lifestyle changes. Two years ago, I started working with a personal trainer because I was hardly active. I feel stronger and have more energy. I still work with the same trainer 4 days a week. With exercise, I try to take care of my body in a way that feels good for me. I also focus on getting enough sleep. I hardly drink alcohol. I focus on keeping a routine in my day and taking care of my spiritual health."
