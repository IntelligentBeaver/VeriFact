        "One of the hardest things about living with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is how it affects your relationships. Your family members, friends, co-workers, even your doctor may have a hard time understanding what’s going on with you. They may think you’re lazy or undependable. They may take it personally if you have to cancel plans or if you drift off during a conversation. It’s easy to feel embarrassed or isolated. In fact, in one survey, 98% of people with idiopathic hypersomnia said it made social life more difficult. But if you learn how to communicate how you feel and what you need, your relationships can be a great source of support."

        "The people close to you won’t know how you feel if you don’t tell them. But it can be hard to find the right words. It’s especially hard with someone new. People with IH say the condition makes it difficult to start a relationship. At the beginning, keep it simple. Tell them you have a medical condition that makes you feel extremely tired all the time. You can get into details as you feel more comfortable. The Hypersomnia Foundation suggests you describe the feeling by comparing it to something other people might have experienced. For example, you could say it’s like having jet lag or taking a sleeping pill , then trying to function normally. Other people with the condition can be a good source of advice on how to talk about it. Reach out to people you’ve met online or in support groups and ask how they’ve handled these conversations. Be open about your emotions. Do you feel embarrassed? Overwhelmed? Fearful for the future? If you have trouble expressing your feelings, a therapist or a counselor can help."

For example: You may get sleepy or have to nap at inconvenient times. That may mean you miss an appointment or don’t finish a chore. You may wake up confused or crabby . That can be uncomfortable for the people you live with. You may have trouble thinking clearly. That can come across as being forgetful or inconsiderate. You may not be able to drive. That can mean relying on other people or missing out on events. You may have to guard your bedtime. That may mean saying “no” to a late concert or an evening study session. You may feel too tired for sex. That can cause conflict with your partner."

          "text": "Recognize that the people closest to you are also struggling. While they want to be helpful, they aren’t going to get it right every time. Be patient. It can take some time for others to truly understand what’s happening with you. Give them a chance to educate themselves. And when they fall short in the sensitivity department, use gentle reminders. Take responsibility. Maybe you snapped at your friend or slept through a date. You didn’t mean to, but it still hurt. Recognize other peoples’ feelings. Be gracious. Well-meaning people may give you advice that’s less than helpful. Try to accept it in the spirit it’s being given. But be firm about what’s best for you. You can always decline their suggestions by telling them you’re following doctor’s orders.",
