        "Hemophilia is a rare genetic condition that prevents your blood from clotting and can lead to bleeding problems. People with hemophilia can have bleeding episodes that happen without trauma and can also bleed longer after an injury. Some people with hemophilia receive treatment to prevent bleeding, and other people with hemophilia are treated only when they are bleeding.",
        "People with hemophilia have low levels of proteins that help your blood clot . These are known as clotting factors. People with hemophilia A have low levels of factor VIII, and people with hemophilia B have low levels of factor IX. The body uses these clotting factors to make thrombin. Thrombin is another substance that helps clot the blood. Replacement of the missing clotting factors with manufactured clotting concentrates has been the standard hemophilia treatment for many years, but treatments that work in new ways are becoming more common.",
        "Qfitlia (fitusiran) is a new hemophilia treatment to prevent or decrease the frequency of bleeding in adults and children 12 and older with certain types of hemophilia. Because people with hemophilia have low levels of clotting factors, they make less thrombin, making it harder for the blood to clot. Another substance in the body, called antithrombin, keeps the body from making more thrombin. Qfitlia is the first medicine to treat hemophilia by lowering the amount of antithrombin in your blood allowing more thrombin production."
