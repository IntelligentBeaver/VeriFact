        "Raising an active kid isn't easy for any parent in the age of Xbox and Facebook. If you were a kid who hated gym class and are now an adult who hates the gym, you may find it especially challenging to help your child become more active. You know it's important for her health and psychological well-being, but you don't feel that it's something you can do.",
        "You can do it, however. There are many ways to be physically active beyond traditional sports or gym exercises. You don't have to be a champion athlete to boost your child's motivation to exercise. You just need to be a little creative and willing to try moving again yourself.",
        "Even if your children are teens, it's not too late. \"There's always an opportunity for your family to start fresh, become more active, and get healthier together,\" says psychologist Susan Bartell, PsyD, an expert in child and parenting and the author of Dr. Susan's Fit and Fun Family Action Plan.",
