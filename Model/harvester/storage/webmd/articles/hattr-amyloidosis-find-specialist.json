In fact, you’ll have to find multiple specialists to help you get the best hATTR treatment possible."

        "hATTR is a rare disease that affects multiple organs in your body. This means you’ll likely need to see several specialists such as a heart doctor ( cardiologist ), blood doctor (hematologist), ophthalmologist ( eye doctor ), kidney doctor (nephrologist), and brain doctor ( neurologist ). You may also need to see a digestive tract and liver doctor (gastroenterologist), cancer doctor ( oncologist ), or genetic counselor.",
        "The type of doctor you see for hATTR can depend on the symptoms you have, the organs affected, and how much damage amyloid buildup has caused. For example, it’s common to have cardiomyopathy if you have hATTR. This condition causes your heart not to pump blood as well, and it can affect your heart rhythm, among other symptoms. You would see a cardiologist for this. On the other hand, if you have tingling and numbness in your legs and feet, you may see a neurologist. Other people with hATTR deal more with stomach pain or weight loss, and need to see a gastroenterologist.",
        "Your hATTR symptoms can depend on the change, or mutation, in your transthyretin (TTR) gene that causes the disease. That can play a role in knowing which doctors you’ll see. Also, as your disease progresses and you have new symptoms, you may need to see more specialists."
