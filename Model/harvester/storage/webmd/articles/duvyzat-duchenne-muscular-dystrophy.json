        "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disease that causes progressive muscle weakness. DMD commonly affects boys, where symptoms are seen in early childhood. There is not a cure for DMD. Health care providers manage symptoms with steroids, physical therapy , and assistive devices (like braces and wheelchairs ). New medicines are being studied to help slow the progression of DMD by targeting the abnormal gene or inflammatory processes. Duvyzat is the first nonsteroidal medicine for DMD that helps to slow down damage to your muscles."

        "Your muscles need continuous maintenance to stay strong and healthy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) happens when there is a change in a person's genetic instructions that affects the production of an important muscle protein called dystrophin. This change, or mutation, causes the body to make little or no dystrophin or to make a version that doesn't work properly. Without the right amount of functioning dystrophin, muscles become weak and can't repair themselves as they should, leading to progressive muscle weakness."
