Even with good health insurance, chronic migraine patients can pay between $8,500 to $9,500 a year out of pocket, so you may need to keep this in mind for planning purposes as you start treatment for chronic migraine. It will be easier to get relief from headaches if you don’t worry about money at the same time."
