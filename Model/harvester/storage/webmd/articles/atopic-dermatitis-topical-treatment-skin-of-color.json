        "Topical treatments for atopic dermatitis, aka AD or eczema, are those you put directly on your skin. They range from gentle skin care and potent moisturizers to creams and ointments with and without steroids. Over time, treatment for AD has tended to be the same for everyone. Studies show science has had some catching up to do, though: People of color are not only more likely to have AD, but treatment for it can cause more severe side effects, such as skin color changes, than for lighter-skinned people. These effects can be upsetting and affect your quality of life. The good news is that some non-steroid treatments that block certain proteins and enzymes have proven to work as well or be better at treating AD, without discoloration and other unwanted effects. Some even improve dark spots from melanin changes after flare-ups, or they even out pale patches some meds cause. Knowing how various topical treatments, including protective products like sunscreen, affect darker skin can help you make the best choices for management, treatment, and follow-up."

        "For moderate to severe AD, the first line of treatment – meaning the first thing most providers prescribe – is usually a corticosteroid cream or ointment. These products mimic natural hormones and offer quick relief: They can ease heat, swelling, pain, and itchiness from AD. They also can help your skin stay moist and fend off flare-ups. These medications are often used for a limited time. The downside for people of color is that using strong topical corticosteroids too much can cause areas of your skin to lighten, a condition called hypopigmentation. When your AD flare calms and swelling goes down, it can leave a dry patch of skin that’s paler than your skin tone. Hypopigmentation isn’t the same as skin damage, and it’s temporary. Still, some experts suggest people of color simply avoid this route and try a non-steroid treatment instead."

          "text": "Some of these, like the acids, can also slow down melanin production. A product that fades spots or evens out your skin tone will work better if you’re using a sunscreen and, if possible, you stop using meds that cause dark spots to form. Sunscreen can not only protect against dark spots, it can help clear them, too. Apply sunscreen every two hours, and after you swim or sweat heavily, to all areas of your skin that aren’t covered when you go outside. Wear protective clothing, like a wide-brimmed hat and long sleeves. Try to stay inside between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun is at its hottest. Look for sunscreen that: Has at least 30 SPF Contains titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, or both Is a color that blends with your skin tone, if you want to avoid a whitish cast Offers broad-spectrum protection Is water-resistant Is a non-comedogenic formula – meaning it won’t clog your pores – if your skin is oily Even if a product contains an ingredient you want, make sure it’s not also made with anything that’s harmful. Be extra careful before buying products made in other countries, which might not list all the ingredients in them. For example, mercury and steroids have been found in some products, unlabeled. It’s a safe bet to stick with products from the U.S., which must state all ingredients, or use what your provider recommends.",
