Then, they’ll make a care plan designed especially for you and your unique situation. Here are some treatments you might have:"

Because the medicine is strong enough to kill cancer cells, it can have side effects. Talk to your care team about what side effects to expect, how to prepare for them, and any suggestions for managing them.",
        "Chemotherapy medications come as pills, shots, creams, and IVs. You might need to visit a doctor’s office or chemotherapy clinic to get IVs or other kinds of chemotherapy. Your doctor will explain the schedule of how often you’ll need chemotherapy treatments.",
        "Radiation therapy. This treatment uses X-ray radiation to target cancer cells. Your doctor or technician will use a special machine to point a beam of energy at specific spots. You might get radiation therapy all over or in only one part of your body where there are a lot of cancer cells. People often get radiation therapy before they have a stem cell transplant. Radiation also affects other cells in your body, which means it can have side effects.",
        "Biologic therapy (also called immunotherapy ). Because cancer cells are mutated (changed) versions of your own cells, they are good at getting around your body’s usual defenses against invaders. Biologic therapy is a newer kind of treatment that helps your immune system get better at finding and killing cancer cells. It can boost your body’s natural defenses against leukemia. There are different kinds of biologic therapy. Two biologic therapies that are used for leukemia are monoclonal antibody therapy and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a way of giving you extra antibodies (“attack cells”) to go after cancer cells. Sometimes, these antibodies are programmed to recognize and target specific parts of the cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy works by making T-cells (a kind of white blood cells) better at catching cancer cells. You get biologic therapy through an IV. Your doctor will let you know what kind of biologic therapy is best for you, and how often you’ll need to get it.",
        "Targeted therapy . This newer approach uses medications that get in the way of cancer cells. Targeted therapies can attack specific genes or proteins that cancer cells need to grow, stop the signals they use to divide and spread, cut off their nutrient supply, or kill them directly.",
        "Because targeted therapy goes right after cancer cells and leaves other cells alone, it often has fewer side effects than other kinds of treatment.",
        "Stem cell transplant (also called a bone marrow transplant or hematopoietic cell transplant). A stem cell transplant can replace the leukemia cells in your bone marrow with new, healthy cells. If the transplant works, your bone marrow will copy the healthy blood cells without making more cancer cells. A stem cell transplant can use cells from a donor (a person who agrees to give blood or bone marrow). Donors can be family members or people you don’t know who have similar genes. Some transplants use blood from babies’ umbilical cords that their parents chose to donate to a cord blood bank . Doctors can sometimes also take healthy cells from your own body. If this happens, you’ll get shots first that help you grow extra cells. Before a stem cell transplant, you’ll get high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to kill off cancer cells and get your body ready to accept the transplant. Then, you’ll get the new cells through an IV or a tube (called a central line). You’ll be in the hospital for a while. They will take steps to help you avoid getting infections while your body heals. There are important risks to think about with a stem cell transplant. But for some people, it can stop their leukemia. Your doctor can explain how well it might work for you and help you weigh the risks and benefits.",
