In men, they may be seen on the tip of the penis, the shaft of the penis, on the scrotum, or around the anus. Genital warts also can develop in the mouth or throat of a person who has had oral sex with an infected person.",

Children's vaccines are generally scheduled at age 11 or 12, but the vaccine is safe for those as young as 9.",
