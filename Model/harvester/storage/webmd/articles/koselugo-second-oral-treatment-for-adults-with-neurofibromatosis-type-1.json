        "Koselugo (selumetinib) is an oral medicine that helps slow the growth of certain tumors. The FDA has approved it for adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who have tumors called plexiform neurofibromas (PN) that are symptomatic and cannot be surgically removed. Koselugo works by blocking two enzymes, MEK1 and MEK2, that can become overactive in people with NF1, leading to the growth of noncancerous plexiform neurofibromas. Another MEK inhibitor, mirdametinib (Gomekli), is also approved in the U.S. for NF1 in adults and children ages 2 years and older.",
        "NF1 is a rare genetic condition caused by either spontaneous or inherited changes in the NF1 gene. It affects about 1 in every 3,000 people and usually begins in childhood. Almost half of the people with NF1 may develop PN, which can affect their brain, spinal cord, and nerves. These PN may also develop later in life, growing quite large and causing pain, changes in appearance, muscle weakness, and problems with movement or organ function. These tumors often can't be removed with surgery because of their location or the way they grow."

        "Why Was It Approved?",
        "Koselugo was approved for adults with NF1 and inoperable PN based on clinical studies that showed it could shrink tumors, provide significant pain relief, and lower the need for pain medications.",
        "The study included 145 adults with inoperable PN who had ongoing pain and tumors that could be measured using MRI. Results showed that 20% of people who took Koselugo, versus 5% of those in the placebo group, had a noticeable shrinkage in their tumors – at least a 20% reduction in size. Among those who responded to Koselugo, 86% of patients continued to improve for at least six months. On average, it took about 3.7 months to see a response."
