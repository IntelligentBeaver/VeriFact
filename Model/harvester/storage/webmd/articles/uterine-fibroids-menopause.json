        "Uterine fibroids are tumors that grow in or on your uterus, or womb. Fibroids aren’t cancerous and hardly ever turn into cancer . They're made of smooth muscle cells and other tissue that grows in or around your uterus. Up to 80% of women (and those assigned female at birth) will develop uterine fibroids by age 50.",
        "Fibroids may appear as a single tumor or a cluster of growths. You might have one fibroid or many. They can range in size quite a bit. Some are as tiny as a seed, while others are as large as a watermelon.",
        "Doctors haven’t figured out the exact cause of uterine fibroids. They do know that the tumors tend to grow more during the years you’re able to get pregnant. That’s because you have high amounts of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in your body at this time. These hormones are thought to play a role in the growth of fibroids.",
