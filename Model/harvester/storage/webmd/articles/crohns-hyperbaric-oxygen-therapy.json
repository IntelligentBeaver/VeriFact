        "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was first used to treat decompression sickness for deep-sea divers. Now, it has grown to treat many medical problems, including carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene , and necrotizing fasciitis (“flesh-eating disease”), among others. The therapy provides extra levels of oxygen to oxygen-starved tissues. The increased oxygen levels can also promote the growth of new blood vessels, reduce inflammation in the body, and help the body fight harmful bacteria.",
        "Because hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can reduce inflammation, some experts believe that HBOT can reduce inflammation from Crohn’s disease when it flares. Crohn’s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes irritation and inflammation in the digestive tract. Left untreated, it can cause serious illness and life-threatening complications. In several studies where no interventions were done, research supported claims that HBOT may be helpful in Crohn’s disease. But more research needs to be done with different types of study designs to figure out if this really is the case."
