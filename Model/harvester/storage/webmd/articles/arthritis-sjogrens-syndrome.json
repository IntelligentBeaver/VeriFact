These products may also have antibacterial properties that reduce the severity of dental cavities over a long period of time.",

Artificial tears must be used regularly and more often in dry environmental conditions such as on airplanes, in air-conditioned buildings, and on windy days. While artificial tears are helpful, they often do not last long enough. Thicker preparations, like gels or ointments, are available that last longer. These often are used at bedtime because they sometimes cause blurry vision . Eye drops containing cyclosporine (Cequa, Restasis) or lifitegrast ophthalmic solution (Xiidra), treat inflammation in the glands around the eyes and may help to increase tear production. While Cequa or Restasis are often used at bedtime because they sometimes cause blurry vision , Xiidra is used twice a day. Tyrvaya is a newly approved nasal spray that can increase tear production.",

It is painless and usually takes just a couple of minutes in the exam chair. Surgery to slow the disappearance of tears by sealing the tear ducts with cautery is another treatment option for more severe cases when artificial tears are not sufficient.",
        "Medications. Drugs that tend to deplete body fluids should be avoided. Mild pain-relieving medications including acetaminophen (Tylenol), Aleve , or Motrin can reduce muscle or joint pain . Two prescription drugs, Evoxac and Salagen, stimulate saliva production and may relieve the dry mouth symptoms. In some patients, the anti-rheumatic drug Plaquenil has been beneficial in decreasing pain and salivary gland swelling . For patients with generalized symptoms, particularly when the disease affects internal organs (including the gastrointestinal system, kidneys, brain , or spinal cord), high doses of immunosuppressive drugs may be necessary.
