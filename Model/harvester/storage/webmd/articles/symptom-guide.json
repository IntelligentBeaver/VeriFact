        "Do you ever feel like your heart is racing or fluttering, even when you're at rest? It’s often an isolated event for those with a healthy heart . But sometimes these symptoms can be caused by an arrhythmia or heart rhythm disorder.",
        "One common arrhythmia is called atrial fibrillation or AFib. During AFib, the atria -- the smaller chambers that normally pump blood into the larger ventricles -- quiver rapidly and erratically. This causes the atria not to squeeze blood effectively into the ventricles. It typically results in a rapid and irregular heartbeat .",
        "“Normally, one’s own pacemaker beats at rates between 60 and 100 beats per minute at rest. In contrast, during atrial fibrillation, the atria are being activated at rates in excess of 400 beats per minute in a chaotic electrical pattern,” says Richard L. Page, MD, chair in the department of medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine & Public Health in Madison.",
        "Atrial fibrillation symptoms can include:",
        "Atrial fibrillation may happen occasionally with symptoms that come and go, last for a few minutes to hours, and then stop on its own. With chronic atrial fibrillation, the arrhythmia is always present."
