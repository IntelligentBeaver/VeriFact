        "Scallops. Shellfish have some of the highest taurine content, especially scallops. Whether you cook them or eat them raw, 100 grams of scallops can have up to 827 milligrams of taurine. Other good options include clams at 520 milligrams and mussels at up to 655 milligrams for the same portion.",
        "Tuna. Whether you get it fresh or from a can, tuna is an excellent source of taurine. Though when choosing your fish, darker meat is richer in amino acids than white meat. Some varieties, like yellowfin tuna, contain up to 964 milligrams per 100 grams, while other marine fish have high levels as well. Try cod for its 120 milligrams or salmon with 94 milligrams of taurine per serving.",

There’s also the dark meat from carp with 868 milligrams and catfish with almost 700 milligrams for the same serving.",

        "Chicken. You can add chicken to almost any recipe — and with it, about 170 milligrams of taurine to your meal. However, as with turkey, go for the dark meat for the taurine benefits. Light meat like chicken breast has only 18 milligrams of taurine per 100 grams compared to cuts like chicken thighs.",
        "Seaweed. Because most taurine sources are from animals, seaweed is an excellent option for people on a plant-based diet . Nori, the papery-like seaweed product used in making sushi , has up to 1,300 milligrams of taurine per 100 grams. While we don’t eat that much in a single sitting, sprinkling a sheet of nori into a dish or eating it with sushi can add about 40 milligrams of taurine to your meal.",

While a high intake of red meats is linked to greater rates of chronic diseases , most people can have two to three servings a week without much risk. With these servings, you’ll add about 40 milligrams of taurine to your meal."

        "The main taurine sources are meat, dairy, and fish — and studies show cooking food doesn’t affect a food's taurine content.",
        "Because there are few plant-based foods containing taurine, people who are vegetarian or vegan may need a taurine supplement. Talk to your doctor about whether more taurine in your diet would benefit your health and how you should take it.",
        "The best natural sources of taurine include:"
      ],
      "bullets": [
        "Scallops. Shellfish have some of the highest taurine content, especially scallops. Whether you cook them or eat them raw, 100 grams of scallops can have up to 827 milligrams of taurine. Other good options include clams at 520 milligrams and mussels at up to 655 milligrams for the same portion.",
        "Tuna. Whether you get it fresh or from a can, tuna is an excellent source of taurine. Though when choosing your fish, darker meat is richer in amino acids than white meat. Some varieties, like yellowfin tuna, contain up to 964 milligrams per 100 grams, while other marine fish have high levels as well. Try cod for its 120 milligrams or salmon with 94 milligrams of taurine per serving.",
        "Tilapia. Freshwater fish are high in taurine as well. Tilapia’s dark muscle has about 972 milligrams for a 150-gram filet, while the white meat has less than 120 milligrams. There’s also the dark meat from carp with 868 milligrams and catfish with almost 700 milligrams for the same serving.",
        "Octopus. Octopus contains about 335 milligrams per 3-ounce portion. Squid has potent levels as well, with 219 milligrams for the same serving.",
        "Turkey. With up to 306 milligrams per 100 grams, turkey has the highest taurine content of any animal meat. But like fish, the meat you choose matters. Only dark turkey meat has these high amounts, while light meat has just 30 milligrams.",
        "Chicken. You can add chicken to almost any recipe — and with it, about 170 milligrams of taurine to your meal. However, as with turkey, go for the dark meat for the taurine benefits. Light meat like chicken breast has only 18 milligrams of taurine per 100 grams compared to cuts like chicken thighs.",
        "Seaweed. Because most taurine sources are from animals, seaweed is an excellent option for people on a plant-based diet . Nori, the papery-like seaweed product used in making sushi , has up to 1,300 milligrams of taurine per 100 grams. While we don’t eat that much in a single sitting, sprinkling a sheet of nori into a dish or eating it with sushi can add about 40 milligrams of taurine to your meal.",
        "Beef. Beef is rich in nutrients and amino acids, including taurine. While a high intake of red meats is linked to greater rates of chronic diseases , most people can have two to three servings a week without much risk. With these servings, you’ll add about 40 milligrams of taurine to your meal."
