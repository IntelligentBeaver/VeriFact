When researchers swabbed four babies born by scheduled C-section with gauze that had been exposed to mom’s vaginal fluids for about an hour, they found that a month later the bacteria on their skin and in their mouth were similar to those of babies born vaginally. That wasn’t the case with the 11 C-section babies who hadn’t been swabbed.",

More recent research has found that the differences in bacteria among C-section and vaginally born babies disappear by the time they’re 6 weeks old. That suggests that an infant’s body will make the natural adjustments it needs no matter how they came into the world."
