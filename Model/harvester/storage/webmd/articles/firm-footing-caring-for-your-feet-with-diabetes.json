        "Two weeks ago, with spring weather finally threatening to overtake the East Coast, I decided to treat my winter-weary feet to a pedicure. Between the hot soak and the soothing leg massage, I must have drifted off, only to be woken by an overzealous nail tech sawing away at the calluses on my heels and the balls of my feet with what looked like a large cheese grater.",
        "“I think that’s plenty,” I told her, fearful she might be about to draw blood.",
        "She stopped her scraping, but the damage had been done. A day or two of walking on my newly grated heels opened several small splits in the skin. Luckily, I caught them in time, and slathering a dollop of petroleum jelly under white socks for several nights eventually healed the heels, even if it wasn’t the sexiest way to go to bed. Disaster averted.",
        "For people with diabetes, seemingly small foot problems – a crack in the heel, a blister, an ingrown toenail – can quickly blossom into something worse. High blood sugars that lead to poor circulation and nerve damage in feet can lead to serious infections, wounds that refuse to heal, and in the absolute worst case, amputations."

I thought nothing about slipping my double AA narrow, extremely high-arched size 9’s into whatever shoes matched the occasion or the current style: 3-inch platforms, unbalanced high heels, spiky stilettos. Comfort never played a role. If anything, “comfort footwear” was reserved for those who didn’t grasp that fashion often involved a bit of pain.",

Loafers, balletic slip-ons, and stylish, well-padded sneakers can get you through most events these days. It’s not just the height of the shoe, but the size, too. If it’s been a while, it might be worth it to have your feet measured to make certain your size and width haven’t changed.",
        "Also, make certain your toes have enough wiggle room, particularly when it comes to athletic shoes, where you may be bumping up against the end of the shoe as you run or jump.",
        "Check your feet every day. This can be done in the bath or shower. When you have nerve damage, a small cut or blister can go unnoticed. This may not seem like much, but if it’s slow to heal, you might want to consult a podiatrist.",
        "Treat your dry skin. Very dry, cracked skin can be open to infections. But, as noted above, the cheese grater approach to dry skin is not a solution. Neither are harsh “skin shedding” products. If you suffer from very dry, hard skin, the best approach is to soak your feet in warm, not hot water (which could burn feet) and then gently exfoliate the surface skin with a pumice stone. Slathering on a thick cream or petroleum jelly afterward can protect and infuse the skin with moisture."
