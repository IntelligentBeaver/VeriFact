        "For the last several months, home has become the place where many of us work and interact with the world. The use of live video chatting technologies to meet with co-workers or connect with friends and family has become part of the new normal for millions.",
        "But the use of all this technology at home can lead to unwanted pain problems or exacerbate existing issues. The human frame was meant to move freely, not looking down and keyboarding while slouching all day long. A number of my patients who have been forced to work remotely have found it challenging to create a comfortable (ergonomic) “workstation” at home, and this has led to a whole host of pain problems, including carpal tunnel syndrome, elbow and shoulder pain, headaches, neck stiffness, and back pain.",
        "Performing repetitive activities from a less-than-ideal physical position can lead to numbness, tingling, and pain in the hands, fingers, and arms. Common culprits include carpal tunnel syndrome (irritation at the wrist of the median nerve), cubital tunnel syndrome (irritation near the elbow of the ulnar nerve), and cervical radiculitis, where nerves around the neck that travel down the arm get agitated. Other common hotspots include inflammation of the tendons in the forearms connected to the elbow, known as epicondylitis, and muscle pain and tenderness around the top of the shoulder and back of the neck."
