        "Studies show that smoking cigarettes puts you at a higher risk for follicular lymphoma. It also raises your chances of dying from the disease. 2. Take vitamin D . It’s important to check your vitamin D level before treatment. One study found that people with low vitamin D levels before follicular lymphoma treatment didn’t do well. They also are more likely to relapse quicker than those with healthy levels of vitamin D. 3. Exercise regularly. Physical activity can help during treatment for follicular lymphoma. A couple of studies found that exercise during chemotherapy for lymphoma greatly improved a person’s quality of life. Stick to moderate activities such as strengthening movements, cardio, balance, coordination, and flexibility activities. You can try things like: Mowing the lawn or cleaning the house Walking Cycling Dancing Water aerobics Golf Squatting Sit-ups Push-ups Resistance-band training Stretching Tai chi Pilates Yoga 4. Protect yourself from germs. Your risk of infection is higher with lymphoma. It isn’t possible to protect yourself completely from infections. But there are some things you can do to lower your risk: Stay away from germs when possible. Don’t be around sick people, and don’t share cups or other personal items. Always wear gloves when you garden or clean. Wash your hands after you touch animals or cook. Keep your household clean. Stay on top of your personal hygiene. If you shave, use an electric shaver instead of a razor. Wear shoes outside to protect your feet from cuts or wounds. Keep cooked and uncooked food separate. Cook and store your food at the proper temperatures. Always wash your hands before you eat."

        "A nutritious diet can help keep you healthy mentally and physically. During follicular lymphoma treatment, a healthy diet can also help you better tolerate treatment, like chemotherapy. You should keep a good balance of carbohydrates, protein, fat, fiber, dairy, vitamins, minerals, fruits, and vegetables on your plate. It’s best to stick with lean and grilled meats instead of fatty and fried options. Some studies suggest that a lot of red and processed meat can lead to a higher risk of cancer . Experts recommend that you get no more than 70 grams of processed or red meat a day. If you don’t eat meat or dairy, there are many vegan and vegetarian options that will help you meet your nutritional needs."

Swap out sponges and dish towels often. Don’t rinse off raw meat or poultry before you cook it. This can spread bacteria to your sink or counter. Use different cutting boards, dishes, and utensils when you prepare raw meat, poultry, or fish. Keep raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs (and the juices from them) out of contact with food that you won’t cook. Only marinate food in the refrigerator. Thaw frozen foods in your refrigerator or microwave instead of on your kitchen counter. Put all your food away properly right after you go grocery shopping. Look at the expiration dates on all of your food. Check to see if any of the food has spoiled and throw it away if it is or if you’re unsure. Use a food thermometer to see if your meat is cooked fully."
