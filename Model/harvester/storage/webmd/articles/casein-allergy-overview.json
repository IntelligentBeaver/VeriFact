        "Most people with an allergy to milk have symptoms which appear when they are infants and outgrow them as they get older. However, some people do not outgrow these symptoms and continue to be allergic as adults. It is unusual to develop an allergy to milk proteins later in life. However, the development of lactose intolerance tends to increase with age. Symptoms include bloating , pain, gas, diarrhea or gastroesophageal reflux. Lactose intolerance is not an allergy but an intolerance, where individuals are unable to digest lactose, the sugar in milk. Lactose intolerance is uncomfortable but not life threatening. It is, on the other hand, important to learn how to recognize and avoid potential allergens."
