Uveal melanoma, the most common eye cancer in adults, starts in the uvea (the pigmented layer of the eye) and has no known link to sun exposure. Even basal cell carcinoma cases – typically a sun-related skin cancer – can develop in areas generally protected from the sun, with some estimates suggesting this happens in up to 20% of cases."
