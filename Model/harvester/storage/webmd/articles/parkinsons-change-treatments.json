        "After your Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis, you may ask, \"How quickly will things change?\" It's normal to want to know what to expect. There's no way to know exactly how quickly your condition will progress. Most people have slow-progressing Parkinson's. In fact, it can often take 10 or 15 years, or even longer, before Parkinson's reaches the later stages. But it's also possible that your PD won't reach a later stage for 20 years. Only about 1 person out of 5 with Parkinson's has the fast-progressing type. So it's possible you could see your symptoms worsen more quickly. But you can prepare and help your loved ones prepare, too. PD is a progressive condition, and eventually, your treatments can stop working. That's true regardless of how fast or slow the condition progresses. Explore how to build a care team and the types of care that can keep you comfortable. And find out which treatments can help support your quality of life as long as possible."
