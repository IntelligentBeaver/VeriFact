        "Channing Muller, a 38-year-old marketing consultant in Chicago, has become a pro at easing her friends’ concerns about having a colonoscopy. She has a family history of colon cancer , so she has them regularly to stay on top of possible problems. “I’ve experienced this procedure multiple times across the span of 13 years,” Muller says. When a friend asks her what to expect, she knows what they need to hear. “There’s no need to be nervous,” she says. “It’s so much simpler now than it was 10, 20, or 30 years ago.” Plus, she reminds them, it’s the best way to get ahead of problems."

        "A colonoscopy is a quick procedure. It takes about 15 minutes. It may be a little longer if your doctor removes or treats something at the same time. You’ll have anesthesia , so you won’t feel it happening. The most common type of anesthesia for colonoscopies is deep sedation, or monitored anesthesia care (MAC). This is an IV with the drug propofol, which makes you fall asleep. It wears off quickly, about 10-15 minutes after the procedure. After your colonoscopy, you may feel like you’ve had a really nice nap. You may also be ready for a big, filling meal."

        "You’ll have a clear, liquid diet the day before your colonoscopy. You’ll avoid solid foods and have clear liquids only, such as apple juice, broth, flavored sparkling water, or white grape juice. Before her first colonoscopy, Muller asked family members who already had colonoscopies to find out more about what the prep would be like. “Everyone had a different take. Some complained about cramping. Others said it was really no big deal at all -- you just have to be at home,” she says. When she did her own prep, she realized it wasn’t as bad as she expected. “You’re just going to have to feel like you need to go have a bowel movement, and it’ll just flow right out -- literally!” Muller says. To help your prep go smoothly, try these tips: A few days before your procedure, start eating small portions and low-fiber foods. Try drinking your colonoscopy prep drink cold so it goes down more easily. Prepare for frequent trips to the bathroom by stocking up on wet wipes and double-ply, soft toilet paper. “Remember why you’re doing this,” Muller says. “Fasting for a day is so much easier than not knowing something’s going on in your colon.”"
