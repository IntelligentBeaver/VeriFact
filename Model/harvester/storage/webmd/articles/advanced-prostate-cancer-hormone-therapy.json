Doctors often use it when: Your cancer has spread too far outside your prostate to be cured with surgery or radiation. Your tumor is big. Hormone therapy can shrink it before you get radiation. This helps the radiation work better. The cancer comes back after surgery or radiation. There’s a high risk that your cancer will come back after radiation. In this case, your doctor might use hormone therapy along with radiation. When you have advanced prostate cancer, the cancer has spread to another part of your body. It may be in your lymph nodes, or in another organ like your bones or lungs. Hormone therapy can help control it and ease the symptoms it causes."
