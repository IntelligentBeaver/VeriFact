        "If you have been diagnosed with MASH, you most likely have a lot of questions about lifestyle changes and treatments that will help. There's no set-in-stone answer. MASH affects every individual differently.",
        "“You can ensure that you get the best treatment possible by advocating for your care.”",
        "If you have MASH, you want to see a certain type of specialist known as a hepatologist. They diagnose and treat various conditions that affect the liver, including MASH. Sometimes, you may get a referral to a gastroenterologist instead. If you are seeing one, make sure that they specialize in liver care – some GI specialists do. If it's a first visit, or a visit to sit down and talk about treatment, you'll also want to be seen by the actual doctor, not their physician assistant or nurse practitioner.",
        "Make sure your doctor knows that you want to focus on lifestyle and treatment options during this appointment. Bring a list of questions and have that front and center for your visit. Be prepared for your doctor to ask you a few things, too.",
        "There are currently two drugs that are FDA-approved to treat MASH when there is moderate to advanced liver scarring but no cirrhosis. Resmetirom (Rezdiffra) is a daily pill that activates a thyroid hormone receptor that reduces liver fat buildup. Semaglutide (Wegovy) is a GLP-1 agonist that is a weekly shot that can help decrease weight and manage metabolic dysfunction.",
        "But if you have MASH, you may have other, related conditions such as sleep apnea, high blood pressure, or type 2 diabetes. Getting those under control may help to prevent your MASH from progressing.",
        "This is important to know, because the stage that you're at may dictate whether or not you can take Rezdiffra or Wegovy, or whether or not you're a candidate for any clinical trials.",
        "People with MASH are more likely to get cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. If you do have cirrhosis, you may need a liver transplant at some point.",
        "You're more likely to have certain health conditions such as heart disease, sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol. So besides your liver specialist, your primary care doctor may recommend you also see a cardiologist, sleep specialist, or an endocrinologist, depending on your particular health concerns.",
        "Your doctor can guide you to ones in your area.",
        "“Taking steps toward a healthy lifestyle will not only help to manage your MASH, but make you feel physically and mentally better.”",
        "Your doctor will want to monitor your symptoms, as they can provide clues as to whether your MASH is progressing.",
        "A well-balanced diet that's rich in fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and low-glycemic carbohydrates can help you manage your MASH. It will also help you stay at a healthy weight, which is important to help to reduce the fat buildup in your liver.",
        "Doctors such as cardiologists, nephrologists, and hematologists can keep an eye on how your MASH affects your other organs.",
        "There are over 15 other drugs for MASH in development. You may be a candidate to be part of a study of one.",
        "You know your own body, and you know when something is off. If your doctor doesn't listen to you, get a second opinion.",
        "Keep up to date on specialist visits. Besides seeing your liver specialist (hepatologist), you'll want to keep up with any other doctors you see to manage other conditions. This may include a cardiologist, a nephrologist (kidney specialist), a hematologist (blood specialist), and an endocrinologist.",
        "Stay up to date on clinical trials. You'll want to stay in the loop about trials, in case one pops up that's a good fit for you. You can get updates at ClinicalTrials.gov.",
        "Embrace a healthy lifestyle. Even if you go on medication, treatment works best when it's done along with good lifestyle habits. Many doctors recommend a diet low in saturated fat and high in healthy fats like omega-3 fatty acids. You should also focus on low-glycemic index foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These are less likely to impact your blood sugar levels. Regular exercise is important, too.",
        "Monitor your progress. Stay on top of your bloodwork, as well as any imaging tests to check your liver and look for signs of worsening disease. That way, you'll get a better sense of whether your treatment plan is working."
