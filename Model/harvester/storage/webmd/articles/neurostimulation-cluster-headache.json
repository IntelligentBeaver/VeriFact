        "The gammaCore doesn’t require surgery to implant it, but you'll need a doctor’s prescription if it’s approved. It’s about the size of your smartphone. You hold it up to your neck for 2 minutes at a time. It stimulates the vagus nerve in the neck and aims to prevent cluster headaches or to lessen the severity of one that’s already started. Potential side effects include temporary hoarseness and a tingling or prickling sensation during use.",
        "The ATI Neurostimulation System targets an area called the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), where “a whole bunch of nerve cells come together that stimulate various parts of the head, including the eyes and nasal passages,” Saper says. The device is smaller than an almond . A surgeon implants it through your mouth's upper gumline and guides it up into the area of your head where the SPG is.",
        "A third type of neurostimulation for cluster headaches focuses on the occipital nerves, which are in the back of the head.",
        "In deep brain neurostimulation , a surgeon places a device in your hypothalamus, which is a part of your brain behind your eyes. Unlike the other methods, this is major surgery."
