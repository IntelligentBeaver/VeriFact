        "Like the common cold, RSV is a contagious respiratory illness. Almost all children in the United States get RSV by their second birthday. Most parents may not realize it because of how similar the two conditions are. RSV is spread the same way as colds: through infected droplets. Your child can breathe in droplets that stay in the air after someone with RSV coughs or sneezes nearby. The virus can also be spread through direct contact. If the droplets land on a surface, your child can touch that surface. If your baby then touches their mouth or nose, the virus can enter the body. The virus stays on hard surfaces, like tabletops or toys, for about 6 hours. It can stay on soft surfaces, like clothing or soft toys, for about an hour. The best way to stop RSV infection is washing your hands well and often and trying to avoid people who are sick."
