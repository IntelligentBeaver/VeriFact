        "Traveling is a real passion of mine; I enjoy seeing new things and immersing myself in different cultures – primarily through the local cuisine. As a child, my mother would make sure we at least had a holiday to look forward to every other year. I looked forward to being on a plane and peeking out the window to see the clouds that looked exactly like my picture books.",
        "As a child, I didn't understand the toll traveling took on my body, as the excitement of travel was the dominating feeling. However, this strain on my body would cause crises while abroad. In my teenage years, I was severely underprepared as crises sent me to hospitals in foreign lands where sickle cell disease hadn’t been heard of. I felt shame, guilt, and fear whenever I felt a crisis coming on while on holiday or school trips.",
        "Having sickle cell has meant that I have had to be more cautious when traveling. Good preparation ensures I don't have a crisis to ruin my trips abroad. Unfortunately, it doesn't always go according to plan, as I have had painful crises on most of the trips I have been on. In a couple of cases, I have also had severe hospitalizations."

Blocking a few days before your trip can be beneficial to your body, as long ones can put a strain on your body. Additionally, blocking a day or two when arriving at your destination allows you to recover and adjust to the weather and environment. You’re always urged to do everything as soon as you land, but preventing a crisis is paramount to enjoying the vacation."

It’s OK to say, \"No, I'm tired, and I'll join once I have rested.\" This is challenging for me as the fear of missing out often comes with a chronic condition like sickle cell. When on a solo trip, you must check in with someone, so they know how you're feeling physically."

These thoughts are great, and I will not change them, but sickle cell doesn't always respond to them. Having the mindset that a crisis is possible isn't a bad thing, as it allows you to prepare for it. When you are in a foreign country without access to the proper medication, this can be life-threatening. Preparing for the worst-case scenario is essential so you are ready for all possible scenarios.",

I'm happy I can continue to do something I love despite a chronic condition like sickle cell."
