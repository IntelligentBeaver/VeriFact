You could even have problems with your vision. This phase can last from several months to up to 2 years. The goal of treatment during the active phase is to relieve the symptoms. Your doctor will aim to preserve your sight and protect the surface of your eye (called the cornea ) from damage. They can also work on correcting any double vision you might have from the disease or as a side effect of surgery. The inactive phase is when your disease has settled down and stabilized. Most symptoms are not active at this time, but your eyes may still bulge and have some problems. Once you enter the inactive or stable phase, your doctor can perform any surgery you might need to correct damage such as double vision or eyelid retraction."

Your doctor may suggest prisms , a type of lens, in your glasses to help correct it.

During the procedure, your doctor removes the bone between your eye socket (orbit) and your sinuses (air spaces beside your eye socket). The swollen tissues can fill this area. This gives your eyes more space to shift back to their normal position. The surgery could cause double vision. Eyelid surgery: Bulging eyes caused by thyroid eye disease can sometimes keep you from closing your eyelids all the way, leading to dry and irritated eyes or cornea damage. A surgeon can help correct the problem by cutting and repositioning your eyelids to help them close fully. Eye muscle surgery: If scar tissue on one or more of your eye muscles makes them shorter than they should be, you may need surgery to realign them. This also corrects double vision caused by scar tissue. A surgeon cuts the scarred muscle from your eye and reattaches it farther back. It may take more than one surgery before your double vision gets better."
