        "A knee magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is a detailed image of the inside of your knee. T he MRI machine scans the outside of your leg without using radiation. Strong magnets, radio waves, and a computer make the MRI image. A knee MRI allows your doctor to see the soft tissues inside your knee joint as a whole image or in slices.",
        "Your knee is the largest and easiest joint to injure in your body. Your thigh bone ( femur ), shinbone (tibia), and kneecap (patella) form your knee joint. But the most common knee problems are soft tissue tears, kneecap dislocations, and fractures. An X-ray only looks at broken bones, b ut a knee MRI can detect bone, cartilage , tendon, and ligament damage.",
