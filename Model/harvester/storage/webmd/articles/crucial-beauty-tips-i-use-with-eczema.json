        "I can genuinely say that I’m thrilled not to be that little girl who once looked through airbrushed photos in magazines and felt so lonely. The world used to tell anyone who didn’t have picture-perfect skin that you were invisible. Well, visible enough to be stared at if there was a skin condition of course, but then to be avoided.",
        "Our products were only prescribed by a medical professional, over-the-counter, in dated packaging that screamed medical trauma. Nothing but shame and embarrassment as we’d look for any insight on how to help our skin appear better. Thankfully, we’ve moved past that stage and are part of the mix where skin of all different types is embraced.",
        "I’m at a point now where I finally feel comfortable in my skin (it only took a little over 2 decades. But who’s counting?) to know that living with eczema has shaped how I approach beauty in ways I never expected. Having eczema and curating a beauty routine has become more than just self-care; it’s part of managing a condition that affects how my skin looks and feels every day. Let me share some strategies that have made a big difference in how I care for my skin."

        "This may seem like a small detail, but for anyone with eczema, it’s a game changer. I swore by having longer nails to satisfy the intense itchiness, but over time I realized I was doing more harm than good. My nails would be filled with skin, blood, crust from the oozing and always looked damaged. Additionally, I would often scratch so much that not only did it break my skin barrier but my nails too, which was painful. Now, I keep my nails trimmed, filed down, and often polished. This minimizes the risk of infections, further irritation, and allows my skin to have minimal damage.",
        "Invest in a Humidifier",
        "Listen, I kid you not: Every single night, I plug in my humidifier. It has been a lifesaver for my skin (and allergies for that matter). When the air is dry, it pulls moisture from your skin, leaving it vulnerable and prone to irritation and flare-ups. I live in the Northeast (a temperate climate), where the heat is blasting through my vents during the colder months, which dries out the air. Making sure my skin is hydrated, comfortable, and healthy is key. My humidifier is such a small yet crucial investment that has made a huge impact on an overall healthier environment."

        "Anything with a fragrance is a big no-no. And if we’re being honest, even the “natural” fragrance can be a hidden irritant for my sensitive skin. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve trained myself to flip the item over immediately to read the label before even thinking about purchasing anything new. It’s not just about avoiding strong smells; it’s about ensuring that the products I’m using are gentle, non-irritating, and of good quality. If there’s one thing I want to emphasize it’s that you must read the label on all products before using them. A helpful tip is to use the National Eczema Association (NEA) Seal of Acceptance as my guide. This way I’ll know that it’s been tested and approved for sensitive and eczema-prone skin.",

        "Have you ever received an ingrown hair so bad a dermatologist had to inject a steroid into it? I have, and let me tell you, it’s probably one of the most painful things I’ve experienced in my life. One piece of advice from the dermatologist that will always stick with me is, “Make sure you’re applying any moisturizer in the direction of the hair growth.” I learned the hard way that it reduces the chances of getting ingrown hairs or developing small bumps and lumps on the skin. Due to my skin already being inflamed from eczema, the last thing I want is another issue to deal with. This small change in how I apply my lotion has helped keep my skin smoother and more comfortable."
