When you hear the word “cancer,” it might seem surprising that the doctor doesn’t want to treat it right away. But “watch and wait” – also called “active monitoring” or “active surveillance” – is a common approach to follicular lymphoma in many people. Learn why it’s sometimes OK to wait to treat this type of blood cancer so you can begin to feel comfortable with your choice."

Decades of data show that earlier treatment doesn’t change long-term outcomes for people who are eligible for the watch-and-wait approach.
