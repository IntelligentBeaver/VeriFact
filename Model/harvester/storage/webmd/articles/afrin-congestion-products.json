        "Afrin products are used to help reduce symptoms of a stuffy nose from conditions like a cold , hay fever , or allergies . This makes it easier to breathe through your nose and reduces sinus congestion and pressure .",
        "The active ingredient in most Afrin products for congestion is nasal oxymetazoline . It helps reduce symptoms of a stuffy nose by narrowing your blood vessels. This lowers swelling, inflammation, and congestion in your nose, allowing you to breathe better and helping to drain your sinuses, leading to less sinus pressure.",
        "There are Afrin products to reduce stuffy nose symptoms for adults and children as young as 2 years old.",
        "There are also Afrin products that are “drug free,” meaning they do not contain any medicine. Most of these products contain saline (a mixture of salt and water). Saline nasal sprays can help moisturize your nasal passages, clear out mucus if you have nasal congestion, and wash away pollen, dust, or other particles that can cause allergies or irritation. Some of these products can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months old."
