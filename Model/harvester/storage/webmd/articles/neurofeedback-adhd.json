        "You may have heard of \"brain training\" to boost intelligence or memory. If your child has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), there's a type of brain training some researchers think may improve focus and help other ADHD symptoms too. It's called neurofeedback or EEG biofeedback .",
        "Electroencephalograph (EEG) sensors are placed on the scalp, often using headgear that looks like a bike helmet. The EEG sensors monitor brain waves. It's painless, and the sensors don't go into the scalp or head.",
        "While your child wears the sensors, they'll play a computer game that they control using only their brain. For example, they may make a fish move through the sea while other ocean creatures go by. When the EEG sensors pick up brain waves that show your child is concentrating, they trigger a \"reward\" signal or sound. For example, a bell may sound, or the fish your child is controlling may dive deep into the water.",
        "The idea is that as your child does this, they learn how it feels when they are concentrating. This might give them more control to \"create\" brainwaves that can reduce ADHD symptoms."
