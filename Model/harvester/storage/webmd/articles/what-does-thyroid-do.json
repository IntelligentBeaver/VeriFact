They can also help control your body temperature, cholesterol levels , and women’s menstrual cycles.",

A goiter can be caused by other thyroid conditions or by a lack of iodine, an element your thyroid needs to work properly. Most Americans get plenty of iodine because it’s now added to table salt in the United States."
