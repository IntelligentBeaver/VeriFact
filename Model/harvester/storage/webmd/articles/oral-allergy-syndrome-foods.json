If so, chances are you have oral allergy syndrome, or pollen- food allergy syndrome as it’s also known. It happens because your immune system can’t tell the difference between proteins in these foods and pollen. The symptoms are usually itching , tingling, and swelling, mostly to the mouth, lips, and throat.",
