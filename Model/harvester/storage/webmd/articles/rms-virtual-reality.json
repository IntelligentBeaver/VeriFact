When the pain is overwhelming, you can go into a different world. That was the basis of our interest in using it for MS-related pain .  Does VR strengthen the mind’s ability to harness attention away from pain or discomfort signals?",
        "Most of our patients live with the burden of day-to-day pain. So we took a specific angle to see if repeated VR sessions can allow the mind to lower pain signal noise and provide an escape, both within and outside of the VR environment, over time.",
        "Eight patients were enrolled in the study based on having high long-term pain related to their MS. We designed the intervention as 8 separate days of 35-minute VR sessions. The larger study is designed to compare different VR content. We categorized it as active, where you’re seated but move your hands and actively navigate the environment, versus passive, where you watch an emotionally neutral or pleasant video.",
