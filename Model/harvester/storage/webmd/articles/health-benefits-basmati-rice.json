        "At first glance, basmati rice likely doesn’t look all that different from other types of rice. One sniff of the grain, however, and you’ll notice a major difference. Basmati rice has a very distinct smell that many describe as being similar to popcorn when it’s cooked. In fact, the word “basmati” in Hindi means “full of aroma” or “fragrant.” In some places, it’s called the “queen of perfumed rice.”",
        "Basmati rice is native to India and Pakistan, with India being responsible for 2/3 of the global supply. While its true origins aren’t clear, archaeologists have discovered a type of long-grain rice near Udaipur, India dating back to between 2000 and 1600 BC that they believe to be an ancestor of the basmati rice we enjoy today.",
        "Basmati rice has been cultivated for thousands of years in the foothills of the Himalayas. Today, it’s a staple in many Indian dishes and is enjoyed all around the world.",
        "Basmati rice comes in two varieties, white and brown. Both have a nutty taste and a distinct smell. White basmati, however, is more processed. The hull, bran, and germ are all removed. With brown basmati, only the hull gets removed. Both types make for a delicious and healthy addition to your diet."

Repeat this process until the water runs mostly clear, then drain the rice using a fine-mesh strainer.",

Let the rice simmer for 15 to 20 minutes to absorb the water. Once the rice becomes soft, remove the pot from the heat and let sit for another 5 minutes. Fluff the rice using a fork and serve."
