        "1. What is Gardasil?",
        "Gardasil is a vaccine, licensed for use in June 2006, by the FDA. It targets four strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) -- HPV-6, 11, 16, and 18. HPV-16 and HPV-18 account for about 70% of all cervical cancers. HPV-6 and -11 cause about 90% of genital warts. HPV is also linked to anal cancer .",
        "2. How does HPV spread?",
        "Sexual activity spreads the virus, a very common one. It's one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) in the country, according to the CDC, with more than 20 million people currently infected and another 6.2 million contracting the virus each year.",
        "About half of those with HPV are aged 15 to 24. Surveys suggest 3.7% of U.S. girls have sex by age 13, and 62.4% have had sex by the 12th grade."
