        "July 17, 2023 – Singer-songwriter Lisa Marie Presley died from a “strangulated,” or twisted, small bowel on Jan.12, surprising many fans who had seen her attend the Golden Globe awards ceremony just days before. The daughter of the late Elvis Presley was 54 years old.",

CNN, which first obtained the autopsy , said it included the official opinion of deputy medical examiner Juan M. Carrillo, MD, who said the obstruction was caused by “adhesions (or, scar tissue) that developed after bariatric surgery years ago. This is a known long-term complication of this type of surgery.”",
