Several studies show adults using echinacea at the first sign of a cold suffered shorter and less severe illnesses. Because herbs are so poorly regulated and labeled in the U.S., however, it's difficult to know if the product you're using contains the right species and active ingredient. If you decide to try echinacea, take small doses for no more than eight weeks, since prolonged use may suppress your immune system.",
