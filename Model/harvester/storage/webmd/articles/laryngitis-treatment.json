If you have any signs of respiratory distress or that your airway might swell and close, seen more commonly in children than in adults, then you will be admitted to the hospital. These rare and severe events may make it necessary to place a breathing tube into your throat. The procedure is called intubation. You will then be placed on a machine called a ventilator to breathe for you. In this situation, you will receive intravenous antibiotics and probably steroids. These instances are mainly seen in children and can be due to severe croup or epiglottitis."
