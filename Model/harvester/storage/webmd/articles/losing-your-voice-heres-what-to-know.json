        "Jan. 28, 2025 – As he takes the microphone for his confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, you might notice something about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the president’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services: He speaks with a shaky voice.",
        "The cause: spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological condition that disrupts the brain’s ability to coordinate muscle movement during speech. Kennedy, 71, told the Los Angeles Times he first noticed his voice changing at age 42. “I feel sorry for the people who have to listen to me,” he told the Times .",
        "Spasmodic dysphonia is just one of many conditions that can change the way someone talks. Anything that injures your vocal folds – or affects the tiny muscles around them – can alter your voice.",
        "“Voice changes happen for many reasons,” said Christina Kang Rosow , MM, MS, CCC-SLP, a medical speech-language pathologist and voice teacher based in Florida. “There are anatomical or neurological reasons, or even just catching a virus that happens to go the wrong way.” More and more people are finding this out. A study from Harvard Medical School found that 12.2% of Americans reported a voice problem in 2022 – an increase from 7.6% a decade prior. You might notice temporary vocal changes for a week or so after a cold, or for a few days after screaming at a concert. Don’t ignore voice changes that last longer."

A network of muscles moves your larynx to help you produce sound, and muscles in your neck help, too. An imbalance between airflow through the vocal folds and muscle tension in the neck and larynx, known as muscle tension dysphonia, can cause a strained or hoarse quality.",
        "“Just like we can develop muscle tension in other parts of our bodies and be sore from sitting a certain way or from holding our shoulders in a certain way, we can create muscle tension patterns in the neck, which can contribute to a strained feeling or feeling of increased effort during speaking,” Lloyd said."
