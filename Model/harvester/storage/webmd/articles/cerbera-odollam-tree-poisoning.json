        "Cerbera odollam is a medium-sized tree native to India and Singapore. It’s also present in some forests and shorelines — particularly those near the Pacific Ocean. Typically used as a shade tree, Cerbera odollam has recently gained popularity as an ornamental plant in gardens and parks.",
        "A typical Cerbera odollam tree grows about 12 meters tall with a gray and knobbly trunk.  Its crown is usually bushy, and its white flowers are known for their beauty and fragrance. The Cerbera odollam leaves are elliptic and green, often turning orange before dying and falling off the tree.",
        "Its fruit is red, smooth, and round, bearing some similarity to an apple. When opened, it presents a fibrous husk and thin outer pulp that some specific bird species eat. At its core, it contains a highly toxic large seed that gives the tree its infamous name.",
        "Cerbera odollam is more commonly known as the “suicide tree” due to its extreme toxicity. It’s a particularly prevalent cause of death in India, being involved in over 500 deaths in the span between 1989 to 1999. However, a recent case of Cerbera odollam poisoning in the US has brought this plant to the national spotlight."
