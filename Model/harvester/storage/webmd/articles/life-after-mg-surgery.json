        "By Amy Burtness, as told to Hallie Levine I was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis in July 2019. In hindsight, I’d experienced symptoms for several years already. The main one was droopy eyelids that made it difficult to keep my eyes open and eventually led to double, blurry vision. I underwent three surgeries on the muscle in my upper eyelid. Each time, the operation would help for a few months, then the eye droop would begin again. I’m a systems analyst who spends her days on computer screens. There was no way those symptoms could continue if I wanted to keep my job. Finally, my primary care doctor referred me to a major medical center where the specialist suspected a neuromuscular problem. She referred me to a neuro-ophthalmologist , who diagnosed me with myasthenia gravis."

        "Meanwhile, my myasthenia gravis was worsening. I was diagnosed with generalized myasthenia gravis, which meant I began to experience other symptoms like trouble breathing, chewing, and swallowing. My care was transferred to a neuromuscular disease specialist for additional treatment options. My doctor wanted to put me on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), which is a common and very effective treatment for myasthenia gravis. But my insurance company refused to cover it unless I first tried another class of drugs called immunosuppressants, like mycophenolate mofetil. I went through 3 months of misery on them, then switched to IVIg treatments. I had hoped IVIg would be my miracle therapy, but it was pure torture. I was bedridden with side effects such as severe headaches and nausea . The nurse who came to my home to give me infusions called her manager during my third month to say she couldn’t in good conscience continue the treatment given how much I was suffering. At that point, my doctor suggested a thymectomy. It’s an operation to remove the thymus gland and often improves symptoms. About 50% of people who have this surgery go into remission . The problem was I simply wasn’t healthy enough to attempt surgery yet. As a last-ditch effort, I underwent PLEX, or plasma exchange. I had to have plasmapheresis, a process where a machine removes harmful antibodies. I also had infusions of eculizumab , a type of drug known as a complement inhibitor. It works by limiting the activation of specific proteins thought to cause myasthenia gravis. Finally, after 9 months, I was stable enough to undergo an operation."

This is particularly true in situations like mine, where you very well may live with debilitating symptoms for life. Initially, I had so much pain post-surgery from nerve damage that I needed to go on several different pain medications. That left me with a brain so foggy I couldn’t even think. I was bedridden and too exhausted to even watch a movie. But as time went by, the pain got more manageable. I did physical therapy and got to the point where I could spend time out of bed. Then last August, I had a setback. All my treatments have left me immunocompromised. I came down with a cold and was sick for months. Due to my insurance, I was transferred to a different medical center where PLEX was unavailable. My doctor started me on a new drug for myasthenia gravis known as efgartigimod. It was FDA-approved in 2021 and lowers the levels of harmful antibodies in the blood. It’s given every week as IV infusion. It’s helped my myasthenia gravis, but it comes with its own side effects, like headaches and nausea."

        "As anyone who lives with myasthenia gravis knows, it’s an emotional and mental journey as well as physical. It’s important to get psychological help, whether it’s talk therapy, support groups, trusted friends, or a bit of all three. You have to get into a good headspace with where you are. This is particularly true in situations like mine, where you very well may live with debilitating symptoms for life. Initially, I had so much pain post-surgery from nerve damage that I needed to go on several different pain medications. That left me with a brain so foggy I couldn’t even think. I was bedridden and too exhausted to even watch a movie. But as time went by, the pain got more manageable. I did physical therapy and got to the point where I could spend time out of bed. Then last August, I had a setback. All my treatments have left me immunocompromised. I came down with a cold and was sick for months. Due to my insurance, I was transferred to a different medical center where PLEX was unavailable. My doctor started me on a new drug for myasthenia gravis known as efgartigimod. It was FDA-approved in 2021 and lowers the levels of harmful antibodies in the blood. It’s given every week as IV infusion. It’s helped my myasthenia gravis, but it comes with its own side effects, like headaches and nausea."

        "Still, I’m glad I had my thymectomy. I think I would have been much worse off without it. But I’d advise anyone considering one to research it. Doctors still aren’t quite sure how a thymectomy works to control symptoms of myasthenia gravis. One theory is that while for most people, the thymus goes dormant in adulthood, it becomes activated in people with myasthenia gravis and makes the antibodies that harm your body. Most people don’t feel better immediately after a thymectomy, either. My surgeon told me that it can take up to 3 years for its effects to kick in. I’m optimistic that I’ll continue to feel better over time. I’m still housebound, but I celebrate small wins. Every hour that I spend sitting on my couch -- not lying in bed -- is a victory."
