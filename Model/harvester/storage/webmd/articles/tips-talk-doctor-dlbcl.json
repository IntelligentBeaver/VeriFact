Start by having a conversation with your doctor. Find out as much as you can about your cancer, its treatment, and how it could affect your life. Take detailed notes or ask someone to go with you to help you take notes and process what you've learned. If you're not sure what to ask, take this list of questions with you to your doctor’s appointment. Write down the answers in a notebook or enter them on your smartphone."
