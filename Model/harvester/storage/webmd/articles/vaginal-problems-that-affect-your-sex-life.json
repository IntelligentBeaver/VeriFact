I’m here, in a place where no              woman wants to be, because the incessant itching , pain , and burning that              plagued me for two years has gotten so severe I can barely tolerate underwear,              let alone the “luxuries” -- tampons, intercourse, and tight jeans -- that my              college roommates take for granted.",
