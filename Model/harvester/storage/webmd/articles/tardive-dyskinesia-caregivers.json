        "Whether someone you know already has tardive dyskinesia (TD) or they're at risk for it because of a medicine they take, you might wonder how you can help. People who have this movement disorder need a lot of extra support. TD causes uncontrollable, repeated movements of the face, neck, arms, and legs. TD symptoms don't always go away after someone stops taking the medicine that caused it. Sometimes the movements are permanent. That’s why someone who has TD may need help adjusting to life with this condition. Caring for someone with TD can be challenging, but it will get easier once you learn more about the condition and how to respond. You can help your loved one manage their condition and cope with the stresses of TD."
