Genetic testing for IRD may help your eye doctor find gene changes or mutations behind your retinal disease. IRDs lead to vision loss that worsens over time, sometimes causing blindness. The right diagnosis early on may boost your long-term eye health and help you plan for the future. The genetic cause of your IRD may also impact your access to current clinical trials and new and future gene therapies. Here’s some information about genetic testing for IRD, but work with your doctor to decide if it’s right for you."

That can speed up the process for you and your medical team. Genetic testing typically uses only a little of your blood or saliva. This process is similar to other common lab tests, but your doctor should let you know what to expect. You may not hear back about your tests for 2 to 3 months. But your genetic counselor will help you understand the results. They’ll work with your doctor to help you figure out next steps or if you need genetic testing in the future.",
