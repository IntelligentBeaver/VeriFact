        "You know with EPI, your pancreas isn’t making enough digestive enzymes , so foods are passing through your intestines in a more whole or undigested state. If your body isn’t getting the nutrients it needs, EPI can lead to malnutrition. Since your body has trouble absorbing fats from foods, you get uncomfortable digestive problems including constipation , pain, gas, bloating, diarrhea, weight loss, and pale, bulky foul-smelling stools. And if that wasn’t enough to worry about, you can also imagine your stool possibly floating or sticking to the side of the toilet bowl, making it difficult to flush away."

        "“Simple social interactions, like having a meal with a friend, can lead to significant amounts of stress and anxiety for individuals anticipating symptoms, which are often worsened by food,” says Vinay Chandrasekhara, MD, an American Gastroenterological Association spokesperson. “People plan their day and activities around the fact that they have access to a restroom, and may limit travel so that they are not stuck in an unfamiliar location.” The main cause of EPI in adults is chronic pancreatitis, which triggers inflammation and swelling of the pancreas and can damage the cells that make digestive enzymes. Over time, the inflammation can lead to damage to the pancreas that can’t be fixed. As many as eight in 10 adults with chronic pancreatitis develop EPI. EPI in adults may also be caused by: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Diabetes Celiac disease Pancreatic cancer Surgery on the digestive tract"

A study in the Journal of Clinical Biochemistry and Nutrition found that the emotional state of anxiety – feeling fearful and tense about what might happen – was linked to EPI patients who have indigestion that keeps coming back. Emotional stress also keeps the stomach and pancreas from releasing enzymes the way they should. Chronic stress can make that worse. Managing chronic stress is critical for people at risk for pancreatitis. Stressors – things that cause stress – can be physical, mental, or a combination of both. Stressors that can make EPI worse include: Forgetting to take your medication Not knowing what to eat A hard time paying for meds Feeling alone and humiliated Assuming your social life is over"
