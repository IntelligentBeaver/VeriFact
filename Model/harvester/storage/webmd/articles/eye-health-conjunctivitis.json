        "Pink eye can happen to anyone, regardless of age, but it's common in children. It can be highly contagious, spreading rapidly in schools and day-care centers, but it’s rarely serious. It's unlikely to damage your vision, especially if you find and treat it quickly. When you take care to prevent its spread and do everything your doctor suggests, pink eye clears up with no long-term problems.",
