Blujepa works differently than other medicines. It blocks bacteria from copying their DNA, which helps to stop the infection from spreading. In clinical trials, Blujepa worked just as well as or better than another medicine that is commonly used to treat bladder infections.",

These infections may be hard to treat because bacteria in some locations may have developed resistance to certain antibiotics.
