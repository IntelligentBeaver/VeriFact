A nearsighted person whose eyesight has not been corrected holds a book closer to the eyes when reading and has to sit in the front of the classroom or movie theater to see clearly. The condition runs in families and affects men and women equally, usually appearing in childhood. The prevalence of myopia is on the rise and researchers attribute much of it to increased use of handheld devices and computers. Children of two parents who have myopia have a greater risk of developing it and should be monitored and tested regularly.",

Children may outgrow mild farsightedness as they mature and the eyeball reaches adult size. Did you know that the eye grows during childhood? The length of the eye (from front-to-back) elongates nearly one-third between birth and age five."
