        "If you have leukemia or lymphoma , or another non cancer ous condition, you may get transplants of stem cells from a donor’s blood or bone marrow to help your body produce blood cells again. In rare cases, though, you may then develop a potentially serious condition called graft versus host disease (GvHD) because of the transplant. There are two kinds: chronic (cGvHD) and acute (aGvHD). Chronic graft versus host disease can be treated, but treatment can take months or years."
