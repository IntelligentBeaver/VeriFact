        "The earliest mentions of bipolar disorder in medical literature date back to Hippocrates (460-370 B.C.), a physician in ancient Greece who’s often referred to as “the father of medicine.” He was the first to document two extreme moods : feeling extremely low (what we now call depression) and feeling extremely energized or excited ( mania ).",
        "Hippocrates described the state of extreme sadness as “melancholia.” “Melas” meant black and “chole” meant bile, so the term means “black bile.” Mania, on the other hand, was thought to be caused by too much yellow bile.",
        "Another Greek physician, Aretaeus of Cappadocia, who lived during the first century, is credited with being the first to express the concept of a mood spectrum, with these extreme moods on each end. He was also the first to determine that melancholia and mania were associated with a problem in the brain .",
        "Plato (428-348 B.C.), an Athenian philosopher, delved into the concept of mania and described two types in his writings: “One involving a mental strain that arises from a bodily cause of origin, the other divine or inspired.” Hippocrates and Aretaeus were able to distinguish between the two, and they each worked to prove that melancholia and mania were biological conditions, not just psychological reactions to a situation."
