        "The cost can range from $20,000 to $100,000, according to one source. A lot depends on whether you have insurance and how much the insurance company will cover. Medicare Part A caps your copayment at under $2,000 for having a pacemaker implanted. Part B can help to cover costs for doctor's visits to monitor your pacemaker. You usually pay a coinsurance of 20% along with your premium.",
