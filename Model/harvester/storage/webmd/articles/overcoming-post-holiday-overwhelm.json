        "The holiday season can leave even the best-prepared and most resilient food allergy parents and caregivers feeling worn out and in need of a rest and refresh. Add an overwhelming social season with food in abundance to the stress of managing a food allergy, and you just may need some tips for overcoming the aftermath of the happiest time of year!",
        "Tips for Overcoming Post-Holiday Burnout",
        "For our family of seven, with kids ages 7 to 17, our holiday festivities began back in October with fall festivals and Halloween and didn’t stop till just after the New Year. I cannot even think of another school party or family or friend get-together, or imagine hosting or attending a birthday party or other social function right about now. Quite frankly, even simple day-to-day tasks can feel overwhelming after making it through a stressful season. Feel the same way? Here are a few tips to help overcome the overwhelmingness:"

        "Take time off for nothing but filling your cup. Everyone is different. Some refuel by being social, traveling, or getting away. Others refuel by staying home, reading a great book, and taking it easy. Whatever helps you feel refreshed and rested, take time off and do that! This may be with your entire family, with your significant other, with a group of best friends, or on your own.",
        "Adjust your schedule and create pockets of downtime for doing your favorite things. Maybe that is a spa day, a massage, a lunch out with friends, or just a nap with no one bothering you. Perhaps there is a book you’ve been longing to have time to read or a hobby you haven’t had time for. Make yourself a priority, do things that bring you happiness, and fill your cup!",
        "Set boundaries and learn the power of saying no. There is great stress relief in saying no, although it can be very hard for some to do. You don’t even need an excuse or reason. Just say, “No, but thank you for thinking of me,” or “No, I’m not available for this.”",
        "Keep your days simple and focus on what is easy. Mealtime, chores, and social activities can all be simplified. In fact, some items on the daily agenda may not only be simplified, but altogether removed from the “to do list” until you're ready to add them back to your rotation. Do what works for you and your family.",
        "Practice self-compassion and give yourself and others grace. Sometimes we hold ourselves and others to ideal standards and forget to congratulate or recognize the good that was done, as opposed to what was not done or not ideal. A glass-half-full outlook makes a huge difference in mental health and stress relief. Consider making a gratitude journal and listing all the great things you are able to do and have done as well as what others have done."

        "Create a meal plan for the week. If that feels overwhelming, take it day by day. Perhaps keep breakfast and lunch simple with cereal and sandwiches, for example, and only plan for a simple dinner. That might be oven-baked chicken and veggies drizzled with oil, salt, and pepper on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. A dish like this takes about five minutes of prep and 30 minutes in the oven at 400 degrees, until the meat is cooked through and veggies toasted. Plus, a one-sheet recipe such as this is free of the top nine allergens. Switch out your protein and veggies and do it again the next day! (Oven time will vary based on the cut of meat and vegetables used).",
        "Become a creature of habit and be OK with it! Your meal plan doesn’t have to be different every single week. Use that same week on repeat until you feel like changing it up. As mentioned previously, make that same oven-baked meat and veggies on repeat, switching up the protein and veggies. Pork, chicken, beef, and fish, give you four days of different “meals” although they’re prepared the same way! Veggies that are great for roasting in a one-pan dish include, but are not limited to: green beans, Brussels sprouts, butternut squash, zucchini, baby carrots, baby potatoes, broccoli, and cauliflower. Think of all the leftovers you will have, so you can take a night off dinner duty. Not only could you make this meal at least four different ways, you might also be able to create two to three nights of leftovers as well.",
        "Keep mealtimes and snacks simple. Taking care of your mental health is important as a parent and caregiver. Give yourself permission and grace to have a simple breakfast, lunch, and snacks. For those who love to bake and cook most meals from scratch, be OK with allergy-friendly pre-packaged cereal, waffles, or other foods until you feel like tackling the kitchen once again."
