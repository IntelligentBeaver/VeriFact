        "There is something about the Christmas holiday season that warms my heart. Of course, since I am a Christian, I know that Jesus is truly the reason for the season. But even for non-believers, it seems that most folks show more love, joy, and peace when they are out shopping as decorations, lights, and songs about the Nativity are in the background.",
        "Despite my love for this time of the year, I was contemplating whether I should put up a Christmas tree. It’s mostly because it seems that the fall season has accelerated, and I just didn’t feel ready to do so after Thanksgiving (which is the tradition). While the air was becoming more frigid by the day, I recently sat back in reverie and thought about the amazing time that I had over the summer when I was hanging on a beach in the Hamptons celebrating my friend’s 50th birthday.",
        "I was excited about spending time with some of my dearest friends and knew it would be an epic time. While I felt physically fine for the most part, I had my scans a week before the getaway. While the report wasn’t terrible, as I didn’t have any disease progression, my oncologist suggested that I might need to redo a procedure to open up my airway. I didn’t allow this news to dampen my spirits, but it was in the back of my mind.",
        "Things never feel awkward when I’m with the rest of the ladies, yet I had to discreetly catch my breath a few times after we danced to one of our favorite songs on loop. Hey, now that I think about it, I could have just played it off as old age. But I know that it was really the result of the cancer in my lungs competing with my love of dance. I also had to play it off when another friend and I went for morning walks because the incline wasn’t easy. I took my time, not sure if she noticed my challenge or she was just being polite, but I pushed forward and we completed our walks (although it probably took longer than it should have)."

I had not mentioned my health stuff to my friends, but I felt compelled to whisper to one of them and asked her for prayer because I might have to have another procedure. She also asked for prayer for her son. We had a brief, intimate yet highly charged emotional moment that signified a deep connection of what sisterhood is really about: love and support. That’s always in season.",
