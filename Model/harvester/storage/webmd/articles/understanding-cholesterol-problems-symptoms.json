        "Because unhealthy cholesterol numbers often don’t cause symptoms, especially at first, it’s important to get tested. You can be slim and feel healthy and still have a cholesterol problem. Once you know there’s a problem, you can try to change it through diet , lifestyle, and, if necessary, medication. But you’re unlikely to do that if you don’t know about it. If you’re 20 or older, you should get your levels checked (a simple blood test) every 4 to 6 years. Your doctor should test you more often if you’re overweight or diabetic, or if you have heart disease.",
        "Exercise : Regular exercise is one of the best ways to control your cholesterol. You don’t have to run a marathon. A half-hour or so of brisk walking, swimming , or dancing three or four times a week should do the trick. If you’re short on time, you can break it into 10-minute increments throughout the day. Resistance training -- pushups, pullups, weights -- may help too.",
        "Don’t smoke: Smoking lowers good cholesterol, which means you keep more of the bad stuff, LDL. And it’s linked to high blood pressure , diabetes, and heart disease. You can improve your cholesterol levels and help protect your arteries if you quit. Even if you’re a nonsmoker, it can help to avoid secondhand smoke ."
