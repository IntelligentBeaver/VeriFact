Some people are prone to it.”",
        "When the cartilage wears down, the joint bones rub more closely against one another due to reduced cushioning that normally acts as a shock absorber. The rubbing causes pain, swelling, and stiffness. Knee osteoarthritis can make it harder to walk and may also cause bone spurs.",
        "Knee osteoarthritis can be primary or secondary. Primary knee OA means the cartilage has worn down due to wear and tear. Secondary knee OA happens when there’s a specific cause, such as trauma, bone deformation, or certain diseases."
