        "The world is all abuzz about the transformative effects of GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide ( Ozempic , Rybelsus , Wegovy) to treat overweight and obesity. But research shows there are often indirect effects: Lower weight from GLP-1s may lead to better health outcomes for heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and – possibly – nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , which doctors now call metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD.",
        "Novo Nordisk in November reported promising early results from an ongoing clinical trial on Wegovy for a serious form of MASLD. In August of 2025, the FDA approved semaglutide to treat metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a serious form of MASLD.",
        "Semaglutide is the first GLP-1 treatment for MASH and the second FDA-approved drug to treat fatty liver disease. The first drug, resmetirom ( Rezdiffra , approved in spring 2024), works directly in the liver by “reactivating” liver cells that can reduce liver fat. Less liver fat means less inflammation and scarring (fibrosis), along with less of a chance of severe, permanent damage to the liver with that scarring ( cirrhosis ).",
        "Semaglutide seems to achieve the same thing indirectly through weight loss – something scientists know helps improve fatty liver disease. Wegovy suppresses appetite and body weight and thus reduces the amount of fat that could pile up in the liver."
