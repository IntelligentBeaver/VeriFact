Here’s this kid that gets to stop in the middle of playing, take a deep drag on a cool-looking device, and get all the attention! As a bit of a ham, I guess I thought it was a party trick of sorts. I didn’t know anyone with asthma, so I didn’t truly understand how dangerous it could be.",

I had scarlet fever as a child that impacted my breathing a bit, but the memories of that are hazy. In general, I was a healthy child with just the occasional cold or sore throat. I never broke a bone, never had an ER visit, and didn’t have surgery until I was in my mid-30s."

By this time, I knew about the dangers of asthma and how it could limit your quality of life. It was the last thing I wanted to hear. I was known as an active young woman who loved to dance, hike, and travel. An asthma diagnosis seemed like it would be life-changing and the end of everything that made me -- me. Would I be the same person I had been for the past 20 years?"

Here I was, a full adult with a condition that I always assumed was only diagnosed in children. It wasn't too long after my diagnosis, however, that I saw it would be nearly impossible to hide. Early on, my doctor prescribed a rescue inhaler to be used as needed. My secret was safe until I started Zumba classes and would often need to take a puff before or during workouts. Can we say embarrassing!? When friends and family would ask me why it was taking me so long to get over a cold, I eventually had to tell them about my asthma and how it was contributing to my symptoms. No matter how I tried to hide, I felt like a big letter “A” for “asthma” was on my forehead, and I didn’t like it."
