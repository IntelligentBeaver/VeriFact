It’s best to discuss care options with your loved one early, so you’re not left guessing when it’s time to make tough decisions. Take some time to investigate all the options in the area: Check online reviews and ask neighbors and friends who may have a loved one in a residential facility. Tour facilities, check menus, and talk to staff. Ask about pet policies, if that’s important to your loved one. Use all your senses. Does the place look and smell clean? Ask to sample food. Does it taste good? Do the residents look well taken care of and engaged? Are you and your family welcome to visit regularly?",
