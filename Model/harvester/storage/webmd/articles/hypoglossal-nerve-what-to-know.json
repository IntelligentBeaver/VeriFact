        "The hypoglossal nerve is one of the 12 cranial nerves arising from the brain. It's a paired nerve, and you have two — left and right. Together, the two hypoglossal nerves control the muscles of the tongue. Your tongue moves food around in your mouth and helps in chewing it. It also enables you to speak and swallow. Disorders of the hypoglossal nerve make it difficult to speak, swallow, and chew food."
