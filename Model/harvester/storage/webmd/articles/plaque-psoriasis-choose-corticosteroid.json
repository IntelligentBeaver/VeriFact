        "If you’ve lived with plaque psoriasis for a while, you may already be a pro at using creams, gels, and ointments to control those itchy red patches. You’ve got many topical treatments to choose from, but one of the most potent is a type of medicine called a topical corticosteroid. Also known as steroids , corticosteroids bring down swelling and redness, reduce flaky scales, and relieve psoriasis itch. Corticosteroids are hormones your adrenal glands make to bring down inflammation in your body. In medicine form, steroids quiet your overactive immune system to reduce swelling and redness from psoriasis. These medicines also slow the growth of new skin cells that form scaly patches. You can get corticosteroids in different types and strengths. Since most topical corticosteroids require a prescription, you’ll work with your doctor to find the one that’s a good fit for your psoriasis."

        "Corticosteroids work well against psoriasis, which is why they’re the medicine doctors most often prescribe. Many people who use these medicines twice a day will see less redness, swelling, itch, and scale. Some will even get clear skin. The side effects are the downside. Strong steroids can make your skin thinner if you use them for more than a few weeks or you apply them to areas of skin that aren’t covered in psoriasis. Some people get red streaks called stretch marks or reddened veins called spider veins on their skin. Bruises, acne , and dark or light patches of skin are also possible. You’re more likely to have these side effects on areas of skin that are already thin, like your face. They might also appear in skin folds like your groin or under your arms. That’s because skin in these places absorbs more of the medicine. Stronger steroids work better, but they’re also more likely to cause side effects. As long as you follow your doctor’s directions, the chance that you’ll have a problem from your corticosteroid is low. Your doctor will tell you where on your body corticosteroids are safest to use and how long to use them to avoid side effects. The doctor will also watch for side effects during treatment and help you manage any problems you do have."
