        "Granuloma Inguinale (Donovanosis) is a bacterial infection that causes sores on the genitals. It’s known as an STI, or sexually transmitted infection, because it spreads mainly through sexual contact. It’s rare in the U.S. but more common in tropical and subtropical climates like India, South Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. Though formerly more common in Australia, doctors managed to bring case numbers way down through careful, prompt treatment."
