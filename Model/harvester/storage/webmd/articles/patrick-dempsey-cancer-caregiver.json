        "A decade before Grey’s Anatomy was even imagined, Patrick Dempsey -- the actor who catapulted to fame as “Dr. McDreamy” in the hit medical drama -- was already working on his bedside manner. No, he wasn’t preparing for a part. He had traveled back to rural Maine, where he’d been raised, to help his mother, Amanda, take on the fight of her life: a second bout with ovarian cancer .",
        "Her cancer, first caught in stage IV in 1996, returned in 1999, and Dempsey and his family were there to give her crucial support. With the help of her son and his two older sisters, a grueling six-week course of chemotherapy , and comforting, distracting activities such as “gardening and planting, and remodeling the house, so we could look past the cancer ,” Dempsey says, his mother managed to beat the dreaded disease again.",
        "Amanda’s experience -- battling ovarian cancer not once, but twice -- is not uncommon. About 70% of women with ovarian cancer face recurrence. The disease can be a stealth opponent for many reasons, explains Dennis S. Chi, MD, a gynecologic oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. “If a woman has vaginal bleeding over age 55, we think uterine cancer . If someone over 50 has blood in their stool, we think colon cancer. But there is nothing specific about ovarian cancer,” he says."
