Make sure the compress is not so hot that it’s uncomfortable. Apply for 20 minutes, then remove for 20 minutes before reapplying if needed. But don’t use heat if your gums are bleeding, says Maria Sokolina, DDS, a dentist in private practice in New York City. “ That is going to open the blood vessels and increase the bleeding.”",

They can be especially soothing after dental procedures such as deep cleaning, scaling, or root planing. The cold helps shrink blood vessels, lower swelling, and lessen any bleeding. Your dentist or specialist may give you a cold pack to take home, but you can easily make it on your own with some ice cubes and a cloth or linen bag. Place it on your gum or cheek for 20 minutes, followed by 20 minutes off before reapplying."
