        "Benzodiazepines, sometimes called benzos, are a type of medication known as tranquilizers. Familiar names include Valium and Xanax. These drugs slow down your central nervous system, cause sedation and muscle relaxation, and lower anxiety levels. Often used to treat anxiety or insomnia, they're some of the most commonly prescribed medications in the U.S. But they can be addictive, especially if you take them every day or use them long-term.",
        "Benzodiazepine drugs are also sometimes used as \"date rape\" drugs because they impair the functions that normally allow a person to resist sexual aggression or assault. The drug is usually added to alcoholic drinks or even soft drinks in powder or liquid forms and can be hard to taste.",
