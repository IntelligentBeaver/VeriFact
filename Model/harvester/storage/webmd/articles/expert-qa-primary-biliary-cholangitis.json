        "Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease that affects the liver. Your body's own immune system attacks the bile ducts in the liver. This causes inflammation, or cholangitis. Bile ducts are thin tubes that carry bile from the liver to intestine. Over time, the bile ducts become permanently damaged or destroyed.",

Getting diagnosed and treated in an early stage of the disease is important, because it may delay or prevent some of the complications and later stages of PBC.

Women are more likely to have the disease than men, and it's more common in Caucasian people. PBC can strike 18-year-olds to 80-year-olds, but it's most often diagnosed in people ages 40 to 60.",

Studies show that smokers have a higher risk of developing PBC, and PBC is more prevalent in the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe. There's a good possibility that there are more diagnoses in these areas because there's more awareness. But it's an interesting topic for research."

Your liver may have some inflammation, but it still works normally. At stage 2, the inflammation may spread, and scar tissue may build along the bile ducts. The liver can still move bile, so there usually aren't symptoms. But most people start having symptoms at stage 3. The scar tissue blocks bile flow, which causes a buildup in the liver. This is called cholestasis. It causes itchiness and fatigue. In stage 4, the liver has severe scarring, or cirrhosis. There's more bile in the liver. You may have a complication, such as portal hypertension, in stage 3 or 4.",

        "A: For the past 30 years, the first treatment for PBC is ursodiol (also called ursodeoxycholic acid or UDCA). This drug helps remove bile from the liver and reduce liver damage. Ursodiol can delay the progression of PBC. It works in about 60% of patients.",
        "For the other 40%, the disease doesn't improve and continues to get worse. More recently, a new class of medicine called PPAR agonists – elafibranor (Iqirvo) and seladelpar (Livdelzi) – became available for PBC. What's exciting is that trials show that PPAR agonists may reduce some of the itching caused by PBC.",
        "If you’re currently taking obeticholic acid (Ocaliva), talk to your doctor right away. They’ll help you transition to another treatment. The manufacturer took Ocaliva off the market and stopped all clinical trials. Recent studies showed that Ocaliva may cause liver failure. This can happen in people who have PBC, with and without advanced cirrhosis.",
        "For serious cases of PBC with cirrhosis where medication is no longer working, a liver transplant may be an option."
