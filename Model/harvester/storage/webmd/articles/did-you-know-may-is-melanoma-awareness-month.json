        "May brings warmer weather and the promise of spring, but did you know that May is also skin cancer awareness month? While the rates of all skin cancers, including melanoma have risen dramatically over the past decades, with early detection the chances of successful treatment and better outcomes for patients are significantly higher. Unfortunately, if melanoma is not caught early, it can spread to other parts of the body and become much more difficult to treat.",

        "Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that is caused by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells in the skin called melanocytes. Melanomas typically are dark in color (dark brown or black), but not always. While it can occur in all ages, it's fairly uncommon in children. Did you know that melanoma is the No. 1 cancer affecting young adults between the ages of 25-29? In 2023, there were nearly 100,000 cases of invasive melanomas in the U.S. and 7,650 deaths."
