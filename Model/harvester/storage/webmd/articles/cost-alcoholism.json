        "Nearly 7% of adults who drink alcohol develop alcohol use disorder (AUD), the term doctors use to diagnose alcoholism . Heavy drinking can hit you in the pocketbook in many ways. For example, a man who drinks heavily averages 14 drinks per week, according to the CDC. Multiply that by a conservative $7 per drink, and that’s at least $5,096 spent on alcohol each year.",
        "Also, crunching figures from the American Psychiatric Association and Center for Workplace Health shows people with AUD may average a startling 29 lost workdays each year. Let’s say you were carrying 10 sick days and 3 personal days at work, and also could apply 5 vacation days. That still leaves 11 potentially unpaid days, meaning 4.2% of your annual pay is on the line.",
        "And drinking problems can drive up auto insurance premiums (due to accidents) and legal costs (DUI defense, etc.). Plus, an AUD diagnosis will disqualify you with some life insurers."
