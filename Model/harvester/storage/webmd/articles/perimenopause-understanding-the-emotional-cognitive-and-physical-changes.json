        "Jan. 22, 2026 -- Perimenopause is the natural transition leading into menopause, marked by erratic fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone. These unpredictable shifts can trigger emotional , cognitive, and physical changes – often years before menopause officially begins. We spoke with Megan Spence, PsyD, PMH-C , a licensed clinical psychologist, about the whole-body experience of perimenopause, including mood and memory changes, the structural and social factors that place some groups at higher risk, available hormonal and non-hormonal treatments, lifestyle strategies that may help, and when – and how – to ask for support. Your symptoms matter, and you deserve informed, compassionate care."

You know, I think we're at a really interesting time in history where previous generations have not talked about this. This word, perimenopause, wasn't really even known.

        "Spence: Yeah, so perimenopause is the period of time leading up to menopause. Menopause is defined as 12 consecutive months of not having a period. Perimenopause can be a long period of time prior to that point where women begin to experience changes to their cycles, and then a myriad of physical and potentially emotional symptoms as well.",
        "And I'll caveat that with: some people may not realize that the symptoms have begun because maybe they're on birth control and they don't get cycles, or they're not tracking their cycle. But essentially, perimenopause can be any point when the cycle starts to shift—so the flow or the duration changes—and then up until those 12 months after the last period. Perimenopause also can last generally an average of four years, but it can last a decade or even longer. For some, it can begin as early as the mid-thirties to as late as the early fifties, mid-fifties. There's a wide range of time when this could begin for people."

And so all of that is kind of also thrown in the mix here. Aging is a tricky topic for a lot of people. For some, there's shame, embarrassment, or a sense of loss. And even for the patient, it's hard to bring some of these things up because it's an acknowledgment of where they're at in life.",
        "Pathak: I'm so glad you brought this up. Can you talk a little bit about how these types of cultural scripts can shape our mental health as women as we're going through this transition?",
        "Spence: I realize I haven't covered the symptoms of the perimenopause time period. So these can range from physical to emotional, mental—so anything from the classic vasomotor symptoms of hot flashes, night sweats, changes to the cycle. Also can be changes to skin, nails. It can be weight gain specifically in the belly, most classically. Insomnia, brain fog. And then there's the whole emotional end of things, which is, um, increases in rates of depression, anxiety, rage. So in terms of the aging and stigma aspect, when we're thinking about potentially negative labels, negative ideas about what aging means and specifically what aging means about a woman's value in society, in her relationship, or even thinking about just mortality in general, right? I think oftentimes these stigmas and these darker kind of thoughts and themes can lead people into feelings of despair or feeling down, feeling ashamed. You know, if this is the first time a woman's experienced that belly weight gain in her life outside of having a child, it can feel like she's failing at something and she's doing something wrong, when really, this is just our natural biological process, right? It's sort of like we've come to accept puberty as just a normal part of life and we teach our kids about it, but we aren't quite there yet with perimenopause and menopause, and there's not really an embracing of this time period. It's more of a sense of loss and a negative change."

So these can range from physical to emotional, mental—so anything from the classic vasomotor symptoms of hot flashes, night sweats, changes to the cycle. Also can be changes to skin, nails. It can be weight gain specifically in the belly, most classically. Insomnia, brain fog. And then there's the whole emotional end of things, which is, um, increases in rates of depression, anxiety, rage. So in terms of the aging and stigma aspect, when we're thinking about potentially negative labels, negative ideas about what aging means and specifically what aging means about a woman's value in society, in her relationship, or even thinking about just mortality in general, right? I think oftentimes these stigmas and these darker kind of thoughts and themes can lead people into feelings of despair or feeling down, feeling ashamed. You know, if this is the first time a woman's experienced that belly weight gain in her life outside of having a child, it can feel like she's failing at something and she's doing something wrong, when really, this is just our natural biological process, right? It's sort of like we've come to accept puberty as just a normal part of life and we teach our kids about it, but we aren't quite there yet with perimenopause and menopause, and there's not really an embracing of this time period. It's more of a sense of loss and a negative change.",

  "meta_description": "Perimenopause is the natural transition leading into menopause, marked by erratic fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone. These unpredictable shifts can trigger emotional, cognitive, and physical changes – often years before menopause officially begins. We spoke with Megan Spence, PsyD, PMH-C, a licensed clinical psychologist, about the whole-body experience of perimenopause, including mood and memory changes, the structural and social factors that place some groups at higher risk, available hormonal and non-hormonal treatments, lifestyle strategies that may help, and when – and how – to ask for support. Your symptoms matter, and you deserve informed, compassionate care.",
