        "After dealing with the frigid winter months, I enjoy the warmer spring months. Then, living in the South, the summer months can be brutally hot. Temperatures can spike into the 100s! Along with elevated temperatures, we also have the humidity to make it feel even hotter than what the actual temperature is. I do like to feel heat penetrate my joints, but sometimes it is too hot, and my psoriatic arthritis (PsA) body can’t handle it. There are ways, though, to survive the heat and enjoy the summer months with PsA.",
        "The summer months can be dehydrating. When you have PsA, you must stay on top of your hydration to make sure your body does not get dehydrated. Dehydration can cause us to feel more joint pain and stiffness. Staying well-hydrated keeps the joints more lubricated, therefore allowing for better mobility. I carry my water bottle with me everywhere. I put electrolytes in my water as well to help with hydration. I try to eat more fruits and vegetables as well as they are more hydrating foods."

        "Overheating can lead to dehydration, and as mentioned before, that can lead to increased inflammation. Staying cool is how to avoid overheating. Make sure to have fans and air conditioning. Avoid staying in the heat for too long. Taking cool showers and avoiding hot showers will help keep your body from overheating as well. I wear a neck fan on hot days or on days that I must be in the heat. I also have a fan that is attached to my phone. They also have fans that have water mist that spray as they fan you. Those are amazing on hot days!",
        "Don’t forget about your skin! Protect your skin from the sun and sunburn. If you do experience sunburn, it can worsen your psoriasis and cause a flare of your psoriatic arthritis. It is best to avoid the sun between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. That is when the sun’s rays are at their peak. The most damage to your skin occurs during these hours, and the chance of sunburn also occurs. The recommendations are to use a broad-spectrum SPF 30+. I use 50+. I use cream or lotion rather than sprays that have alcohol in them also so that they do not dry out my skin. I also wear clothing that protects me from the sun and a hat if I know I will be in the sun."

        "If you are going to exercise during the summer or in the heat, avoid overexertion or getting overheated. Make sure to exercise during the cooler parts of the day, which is usually the morning and the later evening. Also, it is important to stick to low-impact exercise like swimming, which is easier on your joints. Keep up with your exercises though because it is important to have a regular exercise routine to keep your joints flexible and your overall health in check.",
        "With exercise comes rest periods. Make sure to take the time to rest. Schedule rest periods during your day. Also, listen to your body. If your body is feeling fatigued or worn down, rest. Always be ready to adjust plans based on how your body feels. Remember that your body needs rest to manage fatigue and joint pain. Plan rest breaks.",
        "Follow a diet that will work best with PsA, a balanced diet that helps manage inflammation. I follow a diet with lots of green, leafy vegetables, good fats, and lean proteins. An anti-inflammatory diet works well. I am on the Mediterranean Diet myself. I do not eat processed foods or drink sugary beverages. And drinking water all day long with a balanced diet helps keep the body hydrated as well.",
        "Many people with PsA are on medications as well. It is important to take your medications as directed by your doctor. Make sure to take all medications on time. If you have difficulty with that, set reminders. There are even apps on your phone that can set reminders specifically for medications. I have one that is a health app and keeps track of what I eat, how much I drink, and when to take my medications. It sends an alarm to my phone and to my watch to let me know it’s time to take my medications as well as when it is time to eat or drink because I haven’t had a drink of water in a while. Make sure that you always have enough medicine. My pharmacy is only open Monday through Friday, so I need to make sure every week that I have all my medication before the weekend comes around. Also, make sure before you travel that you have enough of all your medicine as well, or make sure you will be able to fill it at an out-of-town pharmacy."
