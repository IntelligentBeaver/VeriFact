        "This type of headache develops due to a problem in your neck. Your doctor may call it a secondary headache because it's a symptom of an underlying condition. Another term you may hear is referred pain. This means that the source of your pain is different from the part of your body where you feel the pain. In the case of a cervicogenic headache (CH), your pain may be due to a pinched nerve in your neck, even though you feel the pain in your head. But other causes can trigger this type of headache because the area where your spine meets your skull contains many areas that can produce pain, such as the lining of your upper spine, ligaments, and joints."
