        "While the alkaline diet may sound like it’s rooted in science, Kathleen Zelman , MPH, RD, LD, a registered dietitian nutritionist, notes that there’s little evidence to support the claims that the diet can change your body's pH level. “You can’t change the alkaline of your blood,” says Zelman. While following an alkaline diet may be able to change the pH levels of your pee, this measure is not a reflection of the pH of your blood. Your body works to keep that level constant.",
        "The health benefits that an alkaline diet can promote have nothing to do with your body's pH levels. “The diet advocates for fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes, as well as whole and unprocessed foods, and that’s the basis of a healthy diet,” says Zelman. But she stresses that a balanced diet also includes many of the foods that the alkaline diet restricts, like whole grains, dairy, and many forms of protein.",
        "Another notable absence within the alkaline diet’s guidelines? “There’s no mention of exercise in this diet plan,” says Zelman. “It’s not just about what you eat. You have to get regular physical activity, too.” The American Heart Association and the CDC recommend getting at least 150 minutes of exercise each week. If you're new to exercise or have any medical problems, talk to your doctor before you change your exercise routines.",
        "Does the alkaline diet work?",
        "Maybe, but not for the reasons it claims.",
        "While you could see weight loss with the alkaline diet, the results will likely be temporary. “When you start eliminating so many foods – sugar and alcohol and processed food – and most of your foods are fruits, vegetables, and lots of water, you’ll lose weight,” says Zelman. “But it’s not sustainable. Foods like protein are very satisfying. They keep your belly full. So do healthy fats.”",
        "Zelman warns that fad diets like the alkaline diet may cause a yo-yo effect. If you often don’t feel full and return to your normal lifestyle, you’ll likely regain the weight that you lost -- and maybe even gain a few extra pounds. Ultimately, the restrictiveness of the alkaline diet may make it difficult to maintain for the long term.",
        "Research is too limited to prove that eating more alkaline foods will help your body fight diseases like cancer.",
        "Is it good for certain conditions?",
        "In its most restrictive form, Zelman doesn’t recommend the alkaline diet for anyone, especially those with cancer, kidney disease, osteoporosis, or any other chronic health condition whose health could be impacted by the nutritional gaps that exist within the diet.",
        "But there could be benefits to expanding upon the foundations of the alkaline diet by including eggs, dairy, whole grains, and protein to your plate, in addition to eating a more plant-based, unprocessed diet. Zelman notes that the emphasis on fruits, vegetables, and unprocessed foods in the alkaline diet may help someone reduce the amount of sugar, saturated fat, and sodium in their diet, which could benefit anyone with heart disease or diabetes.",
        "But Zelman cautions anyone with a history of disordered eating against starting the alkaline diet: “When you categorize foods as good or bad -- like with alkanizing foods versus acidic foods -- it tends to promote eating disorders.”",
        "Parents should avoid the alkaline diet for kids. Zelman notes that the diet eliminates important nutrient-rich foods like animal proteins, eggs, and fish that can be critical for their growth and development. “When you start having nutritional gaps, a diet becomes unsafe for children,” says Zelman.",
        "Consult your health care provider before you make significant changes to your diet.",
        "The final word",
        "Following an alkaline diet will be tough for many people.",
        "A lot of your favorite foods that are allowed in moderation in other plans (including lean meat, low-fat dairy, bread, and sweets) are forbidden here. Protein is limited to plant-based sources such as beans and tofu. This means you'll have to make sure you get enough protein and calcium from other sources.",
        "Eating out can also be a challenge. If you travel a lot for work or have a busy schedule, you might feel bogged down by all the food selection and prep.",
        "Given that many people will struggle with an alkaline diet because of its restrictiveness, Zelman stresses  that there’s space for a wide range of foods in a healthy diet. “In my opinion, all foods fit. You can have a healthy diet and still have room for -- granted, limited --  indulgences.” says Zelman. “Eighty percent of the time, your diet should be based on fundamentally good foods. But can you have some bacon? Can you have a piece of chocolate cake? Yes – those foods can fit in moderation and in the context of a healthy diet.”",
        "Do the benefits of the alkaline diet outweigh its shortcomings? According to Zelman, no. “There are too many deficiencies and too many risks. It’s not sustainable, and there’s no evidence that it’s going to be healthful,” she says. “The best diet is the one you can stick with, so you need to find a plan that works for you, works for your lifestyle, but is also based on evidence.”"
