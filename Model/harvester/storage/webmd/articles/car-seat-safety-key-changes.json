        "The AAP's 2011 policy on car seat safety mentions 2 years old as a minimum age for switching a child to a forward-facing seat. But Hoffman says naming a specific age overshadowed much of the rest of the statement, which was meant to be more broadly applied. \"The key message was that parents should delay transitions for as long as they possibly can,\" says Hoffman, who’s chairman of the AAP’s Council on Injury, Violence, and Poison Prevention.",
        "The latest policy zeroes in on this largely missed point and leaves out age as a benchmark. The important takeaway: \"Kids should stay rear-facing to the limit of the seat, which is defined by the manufacturer in terms of weight and length,\" he says. This goes for all car seats, not just rear-facing ones. As you move a child from rear-facing to forward-facing and then on to a booster, you lose some protection. So, keeping kids in the \"youngest\" seat they can safely ride in is best -- even if their second birthday has long since come and gone.",
        "\"It runs counter to how most parents think, because we tend to look at reaching milestones as an exciting, positive thing,\" Hoffman says. \"This is one of the few places where a milestone isn't necessarily something to reach for.\""
