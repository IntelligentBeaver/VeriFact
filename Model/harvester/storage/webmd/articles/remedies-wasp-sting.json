        "Wasp stings are a common, yet painful problem. There are many species of wasp, the most common being yellow jackets and hornets. Similarly, there are many reasons why a wasp may sting you. However, most wasps only sting when they or their nest are disturbed, or when they have been irritated by your presence.",
        "Unlike bees, wasps can sting multiple times because they don't lose their stinger with their sting. They will also inject a venom into your skin with their sting.",
        "Most wasp stings can be incredibly painful, especially if they surprise you. But after the initial sting, they mostly cause only minor discomfort, which can be treated at home. Common wasp sting symptoms include pain in the sting area, swelling and redness that extends out of the sting site, itching, heat at the site of sting, and potentially hives if your body has a reaction to the sting."
