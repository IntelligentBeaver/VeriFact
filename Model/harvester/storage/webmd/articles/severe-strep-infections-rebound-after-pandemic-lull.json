        "These infections fell by 25% during the COVID-19 pandemic and were especially low in children. The number of milder infections also dropped. But in 2022, severe infections came roaring back, particularly in children.",
        "Infections increased earlier in the winter/spring season – from September to November – than seen in a typical year and rose to higher than pre-pandemic levels in many parts of the country, such as Colorado and Minnesota.",
        "Now in 2023, invasive infections are high in children in some parts of the country, even after respiratory viruses like the flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) decreased in those areas. Some parts of the country also saw high rates of invasive infections in older adults."
