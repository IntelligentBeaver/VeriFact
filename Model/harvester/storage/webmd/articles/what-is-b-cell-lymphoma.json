        "B-cell lymphoma is a cancer that forms in white blood cells called lymphocytes. These cells are made by your bone marrow and play an important role in your body's ability to fight infections. These cells mature in your lymphatic system, which includes a few organs found throughout your entire body, so B-cell lymphoma can start in different places. These cells normally mature into antibody-producing cells that fight bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The symptoms you have depend on where your cancer forms. But you can have B-cell lymphoma for many years before you notice any symptoms.",

        "B-cell lymphomas come in many different types. They can act differently, too. Some grow quickly and others grow more slowly. Your doctor will help you understand which type you have and how best to treat it.",
        "Large B-cell lymphoma",
        "The most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). It affects 5 to 6 people out of every 100,000 in the U.S. One in every three people with lymphoma have this type. DLBCL mainly affects older adults. It's a fast-growing cancer that can start in your lymph nodes or related organs like your thymus, spleen, or tonsils. This type of B-cell lymphoma usually responds well to treatment and is often cured.",
        "Follicular lymphoma",
        "About 1 in 5 people with lymphoma have follicular lymphoma. This is a slow-growing non-Hodgkins lymphoma that mainly affects older adults. It starts in your lymph nodes, bone marrow, or other places. You might not need to treat it right away. Because it is a slow-growing cancer, doctors usually wait until the cancer starts causing symptoms before they treat it.",
        "Mantle cell lymphoma",
        "This type of B-cell lymphoma is a rare lymphoma that affects 1 in 20 people with lymphoma and is more common in older adults and men. It forms in your spleen, lymph nodes, or bone marrow. Mantle cell lymphoma is a fast-growing cancer that can be hard to treat.",
        "Marginal zone lymphomas",
        "In this type of B-cell lymphoma, excess abnormal B cells grow slowly in places called marginal zones found in almost any organ of the body. These places could be in your stomach, skin, lungs, salivary glands, thyroid, or the area around your eyes.",
        "Burkitt lymphoma",
        "Burkitt lymphoma is a rare B-cell lymphoma that typically affects children. It is a very aggressive and fast-growing tumor, so people with this type will need intensive (in-depth) chemotherapy.",
        "Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia)",
        "This is a rare and slow-growing B-cell lymphoma type. It doesn't always require treatment until symptoms start. It usually starts in your bone marrow but also can grow in your lymphatic system.",
        "Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma",
        "Unlike regular large B-cell lymphoma, this rare type of DLBCL mainly affects young adults and people who were assigned female at birth (AFAB). It's a fast-growing aggressive cancer that starts in your chest. As the cancer gets bigger, it can press on your windpipe, causing breathing problems. It also might block the flow of blood to your heart, causing your face and arms to swell.",
        "Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma",
        "This is a rare type of B-cell lymphoma that affects your central nervous system, including your brain or spinal cord. You're more likely to have it if you're older or have a weakened immune system.",
