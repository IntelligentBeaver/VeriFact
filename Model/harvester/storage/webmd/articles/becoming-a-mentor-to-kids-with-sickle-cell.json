        "As well as being an advocate for sickle cell disease through writing, I am also a mentor to young people with sickle cell. In my own journey to find mentors to help me with career and life choices, I realized that one thing I would have valued was an opportunity to speak to an older person with sickle cell. So becoming a mentor meant I could share my experiences and help others avoid the mistakes I made while managing the disease.",
        "Upon reflection, much of what I have learned and how I interface with sickle cell stems from my environment, upbringing, and with whom I interacted while growing up. Those interactions paved the way for healthy and unhealthy learned behavior. I didn’t have any role models with sickle cell disease that I could learn from as a child. As a mentor, I can reflect on my past experiences as I put myself in my mentees' shoes and hopefully foster more positive experiences than I had."

        "Being a mentor is really rewarding because as much as I give in terms of time and mental capacity, I also learn to be better for myself and my mentees. What has been promising is that the younger generation seems more outspoken about their experiences with sickle cell disease than I was at that age. My mentees prevent sickle cell from getting in the way of their lives, and they’re slightly more open about their condition. The fact that they were able to connect with a mentor shows how much further along they are than I was at their age.",
        "One area where I have noticed I can give support to all my mentees is empowering them to take control of their health. My mentees are beginning to transition from pediatric to adult care. This can be difficult because it involves several changes. The health care teams they’ve spent their formative years with are replaced with new ones who aren’t as familiar with their needs.",
        "In my pediatric appointments, I was always passive. I never had questions or concerns because I didn't really want to be there. I just went with the flow because it was easier. My mum asked all the questions, so I just followed her instructions. But when I transitioned from pediatric care to adult care, suddenly I was responsible for making my own appointments and communicating with the doctor directly."

They often took me away from things I already had planned. They were inconvenient.",
        "I got a reality check during my first hospitalization as an adult. I was treated very differently in the adult ward than in the pediatric ward. I spent long hours waiting for treatment and didn't believe my pain was taken as seriously as it was when I was in the children's ward. I had a whole new care team who didn’t fully know my needs as a patient.",
        "To improve my care during future hospitalizations, I needed to learn how to work with my care team in a way I hadn’t before. I needed an up-to-date care plan and I needed to discuss what was and wasn't working. I also had to get a better understanding of outpatient services and the support that was available to me when I had a crisis. I had to take ownership of my own health needs."

These discussions helped me build a solid foundation that has allowed me to refine my care plan and lifestyle since then.",

In addition, symptoms can arise over time. Given these nuances, I want my mentees to feel a similar sense of responsibility for managing their health. With their willingness to be open about it, I’m confident this added sense of responsibility will make transitioning to adult care a lot smoother than what I experienced."
