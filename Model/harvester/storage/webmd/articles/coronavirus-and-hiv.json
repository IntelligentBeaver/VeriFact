Other types of coronaviruses, such as those that caused SARS and MERS, did not have a major impact on people with HIV. But if your HIV is advanced or isn’t under good control with antiretroviral therapy (ART), then your immune system will have a harder time defending you against infections, possibly including COVID-19.
