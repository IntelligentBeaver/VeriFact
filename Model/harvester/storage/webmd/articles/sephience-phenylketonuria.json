        "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic condition that affects how your body processes an amino acid called phenylalanine (Phe). People with PKU have low levels or missing activity of an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Without enough PAH, Phe builds up in the blood, which can harm the brain and cause developmental problems. Managing PKU requires keeping blood Phe levels in a safe range, most often through a strict, Phe-restricted diet.",
