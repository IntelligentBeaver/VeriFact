        "FCAS is a rare genetic disorder. It affects how your body controls inflammation. Symptoms are triggered by exposure to the cold, though experts aren’t sure why. It’s the mildest type of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS).",
        "When you have FCAS, a protein called cryopyrin doesn’t work the right way. Cryopyrin serves as scaffold for a set of molecules that work together to fight germs or fix injuries. They jumpstart inflammation, which tells your immune system to start the healing process. With FCAS, your cryopyrin is overactive. That can lead to inflammation when you don’t need it. You can get symptoms like rash , fever, and joint pain.",
        "Signs of FCAS tend to show up shortly after you’re born. But it’s possible to get your first symptoms as a child or young adult. Your attacks may come and go throughout your life. There isn’t a cure, but lifestyle changes and medication can help you manage FCAS."
