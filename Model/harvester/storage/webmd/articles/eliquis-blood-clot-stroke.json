The study was looking at the differences in risks for strokes and blood clots while also looking for the side effect of bleeding. The average age of people in the trial was 70. Of the people in the study,  83% were White, 14% were Asian, and 1% were African American. The 89-week study showed that Eliquis was better than warfarin for stroke and blood clot prevention with fewer bleeding events.",

The average age of people in the trial was 57 years old. Of the people in the trial, 83% were White, 8% were Asian, and 4% were African American. The study was 150 days long. At the end, the study showed that Eliquis was as effective as the enoxaparin-warfarin combination in lowering the risk of having a second blood clot or death related to a blood clot.
