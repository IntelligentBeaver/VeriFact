Here are a few of the latest. Machine learning. Machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, is revolutionizing how we detect lung cancer. By analyzing large amounts of data, machine learning can find patterns and predict outcomes with high accuracy. One study found that machine learning was able to diagnose the two most common types of lung cancer with up to 97% accuracy – better than traditional methods. These algorithms look at your medical images, patient history, and genetic information to provide early and precise diagnoses, allowing timely treatment."

The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) found that low-dose CT scans can lower lung cancer death rates by 15%-20% compared to regular chest X-rays. Improvements in CT technology have made images clearer and reduced radiation exposure, making screening safer and more effective. New methods like helical CT offer detailed lung images, helping doctors find smaller tumors that older methods might miss. Markers in blood and sputum. Scientists are working on better tests using your blood and sputum (mucus in the lungs) to catch lung cancer early. There are two main areas they’re focusing on: Blood tests. Researchers are studying blood samples to see if they can find tumor cells or specific molecules that indicate lung cancer. This could help diagnose the disease sooner. Sputum tests. Scientists are examining spit samples for unusual cells or molecules that might show someone needs more testing for lung cancer. These advancements could lead to easier and earlier detection, making treatment for NSCLC more effective."

These drugs have shown longer progression-free survival and better overall outcomes than earlier ALK inhibitors like crizotinib (Xalkori). ROS1 gene changes occur in a small percentage of NSCLC patients. Targeted therapies like crizotinib (Xalkori), entrectinib (Rozlytrek), and the new repotrectinib (Augtyro) are effective in treating ROS1-positive NSCLC. These inhibitors block the ROS1 protein, stopping cancer cells from growing and spreading. Repotrectinib offers another option for patients who develop resistance to other ROS1 inhibitors. BRAF inhibitors. BRAF mutations, especially the V600E mutation, are present in some NSCLC cases. Combination therapies using BRAF inhibitors like dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and MEK inhibitors like trametinib (Mekinist) have been effective in treating BRAF-mutated NSCLC.
