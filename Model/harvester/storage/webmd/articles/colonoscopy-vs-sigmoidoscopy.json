        "If your doctor wants to check the health of your colon — whether as part of a routine screening or to investigate a concern — they may recommend a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Both tests use a thin, flexible tube with a camera to check the inside of your colon — the part of your digestive system that processes food waste and helps you poop. The main difference is how much of the colon each test examines.",
        "During a colonoscopy, your doctor will look inside your entire large intestine, which is the final part of your digestive system. It’s about five feet long and forms a square-like shape inside your abdomen. The large intestine includes four sections: the sigmoid colon, which connects the colon to the rectum; the descending colon, which runs down the left side of your body; the transverse colon, which stretches across your abdomen; and the ascending colon, which moves upward on the right side.",
        "A sigmoidoscopy, on the other hand, only examines at the lower part of the colon or large intestine.",
        "Jennifer Davids, MD, chief of colon and rectal surgery at Boston Medical Center, explains that while a colonoscopy provides a more complete evaluation and is often the better diagnostic tool, both tests have pros and cons. “A lot of patients are turned off by stool tests, colonoscopy prep , sedation, or time off from work and may decide not to proceed with any type of screening, which is what we want to avoid,” she says. “The best test is the one that makes you most comfortable. All of the available tests are superior to no test at all.”",
        "Colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy are both procedures that can help your doctor understand what’s happening inside your colon. A colonoscopy offers a full view of the large intestine and is the best tool for detecting colorectal cancer. A sigmoidoscopy is a less invasive option that focuses on the lower colon.

Your doctor can tell you how often you'll need these tests.",
        "The color, consistency, and frequency of your poop can give you insight into your digestive health. Healthy stool is usually brown, soft and solid, and should pass easily without strain. Bathroom habits vary from person to person, but you should have regular bowel movements — at least once every three days — and control over when you go. Minor changes aren't usually a cause for concern, but larger changes could indicate a problem. These might include blood in your stool, frequent diarrhea or constipation, thin, pencil-like stools, or a constant urge to poop without relief (a condition called tenesmus).",

The tube has a small camera that sends images to a screen, allowing the doctor to see what’s happening inside your colon. To get a clearer view, the doctor will pump air through the tube to gently expand the colon. Once the scope reaches the end of your large intestine, the doctor slowly withdraws it, examining the tissue again as they go. In the days leading up to a colonoscopy, you may need to adjust what you eat and drink. The night before, you’ll take a laxative to clear out your colon and you won’t be able to eat again until after the procedure. Your doctor may recommend performing your colonoscopy under general anesthesia, meaning you’ll be fully asleep, or with sedation, which keeps you relaxed and drowsy, but still awake. If you’re awake, you won’t feel pain, but you might experience some pressure or mild discomfort as the colonoscope moves through your intestine. The entire procedure should take between 30 and 45 minutes. A colonoscopy is usually an outpatient procedure, so you’ll be able to go home the same day. Afterward, you might have some gas, stomach pain, bloating, or nausea. If you had anesthesia, you might also feel drowsy. But these symptoms are normal and should pass within a few hours."

While a colonoscopy offers a full view of the large intestine and is the best tool for detecting colorectal cancer and other conditions, a sigmoidoscopy is a less invasive option that focuses on the lower colon and can help diagnose localized issues. Regular screenings with either test are crucial for early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer. If you notice changes in your digestion or bowel habits, be sure to talk to your doctor about the best screening option for you."
