Severe depression followed, leaving him unemployed, bankrupt, and collecting Social Security Disability. With the help of medication and therapy, he returned to practicing patent law in 2021. His experiences led him to create a course he also teaches – Mental Health and the Legal Profession – at Wake Forest University School of Law. He and his wife, Meredith, live in Raleigh, North Carolina.",
