        "According to human sexuality educator Charlie Glickman, PhD, quoted in Bustle , prostate stimulation is connected to the “point of no return” feeling with penile orgasms. The prostate contracts during orgasm to help push seminal fluid out of the penis. Stimulating the prostate can generate that feeling directly, without stimulating the penis at all.",
        "Prostate vibrators may help stimulate the prostate more effectively than fingers or other sex toys. The vibration stimulates both surface-level and deep nerves. Prostate vibrators also provide much quicker motions than a finger or an unpowered toy can offer. For people who prefer more intense stimulation, prostate vibrators may offer the sensation they want."

        "Since they both work similarly, it’s easy to confuse prostate vibrators and clitoral vibrators. Both use vibrations to stimulate a specific location and encourage orgasm. The biggest difference between clitoral and prostate vibrators is their shape. Both styles of vibrator focus their vibration on a certain area, but they need to meet the needs of different anatomy.",
        "Comparing the two types of vibrators in reviews, the shape differences become obvious. Because prostate vibrators are designed to be inserted into the rectum, they are often relatively slender with an angled head to help target the prostate. On the other hand, the partially external nature of the clitoris makes it easier to stimulate with a variety of shapes. Clitoral vibrators can come in a wide variety of shapes, from wands to eggs to “rabbits” with multiple prongs."
