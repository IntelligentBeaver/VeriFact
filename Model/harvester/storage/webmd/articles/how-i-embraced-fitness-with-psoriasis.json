        "Exercise is more than just a way to stay fit -- it’s a tool for improving your mental and physical health. When living with psoriasis, staying active takes on an additional layer of importance. The challenge lies in finding a routine that accommodates your skin condition while still offering the benefits of exercise. Over time, I’ve developed a fitness approach that balances my body’s needs with the demands of managing psoriasis. My workout routines are built on three core principles: adaptability, consistency, and routines that prioritize my skin’s health.",
        "Starting Slow and Gradually Building Strength",
        "When I first began exercising with psoriasis, I had to ease into it slowly. Psoriasis is a condition that causes flare-ups, often triggered by sweat, friction, or irritation. Areas prone to these triggers -- like the joints, back, and areas where clothing rubs -- need special attention. It was clear from the start that I had to adapt my workouts to avoid overstraining or triggering a flare-up."

        "I began with low-impact exercises like weightlifting. Weightlifting was a perfect starting point because it allowed me to focus on strength training without putting undue stress on my skin. Unlike high-impact cardio, weightlifting doesn’t involve constant movement, reducing the chances of sweating excessively or causing friction. It also gave me the chance to build strength gradually while listening to my body’s signals, adjusting the intensity as needed.",
        "Another crucial exercise that became part of my routine was walking. Walking wasn’t just exercise -- it became a meditative practice. It’s a low-impact activity that allows you to focus on breathing, staying present, and simply enjoying nature. Since I live in Washington, I have easy access to scenic routes that make my walks feel more like an escape into tranquility. I made it a habit to walk during the early morning or late evening hours, avoiding the heat and humidity of the day, which could irritate my skin.",
        "Introducing Cardio",
        "As I gained confidence in my strength and endurance, I decided to introduce cardio into my routine. Cardio can be one of the most effective ways to improve heart health and burn calories, but for someone with psoriasis, managing sweat and friction is key. I started running, but not on a treadmill -- instead, I sought out local trails. Running through nature kept me motivated and connected to my surroundings, allowing me to enjoy beautiful landscapes while staying active."

        "However, managing sweat during a run was a challenge. Sweat buildup can make psoriasis flare-ups worse, especially if it’s trapped against the skin. To address this, I made sure to wear moisture-wicking, breathable clothing that allowed sweat to evaporate quickly, reducing the chance of irritation. I also brought a towel to pat down my sweat as I ran. These small precautions made a significant difference in managing my skin during cardio.",
        "Cycling also became an essential part of my cardio routine. Whether it was cycling outdoors on local bike paths or using a stationary bike indoors, cycling offered great cardiovascular benefits without excessive friction on my skin. The fluid, circular motion of cycling was less likely to irritate my skin compared to running or jumping, and it didn’t lead to the same level of sweating. Cycling was an excellent way to build endurance while keeping my psoriasis under control.",
        "Strength Training With Equipment",
        "While strength training with free weights was a great way to build muscle, I quickly learned that direct contact with metal bars or gym equipment could irritate my skin. The constant friction of lifting weights against my bare skin created an environment conducive to flare-ups. To mitigate this, I started wearing gloves and long sleeves to reduce direct skin contact with the equipment."
