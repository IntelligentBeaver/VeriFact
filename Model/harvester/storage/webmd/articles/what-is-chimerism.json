        "The term chimera is usually associated with Greek mythology. It brings to mind a monster with the head of a goat and a lion. Instead of a tail, it has a protruding snake. There is a genetic term that was created from this mixed beast. In humans, a chimera is a person who has cells from two different sources. Since those cells are from different organisms, it results in two sets of DNA . But how could this possibly happen in humans? To explore chimerism in humans, we must first understand how it can happen in the first place."

Normally, in humans, you have cells with only your DNA, which is a basic understanding of genetics. The body has numerous types of cells, but all the cells contain your exact type of DNA. But with a chimera, this basic understanding is obsolete. A chimera will have two sets of cells with two distinct types of DNA."

        "The tissues that will be chimeric vary in each circumstance. It will depend upon how the cells travel, which cells come through the placenta , and where they settle. One of the more common outcome types is blood chimerism. Blood cells that form in the bone marrow are sturdy and mobile. They will more than likely survive while traveling through the placenta in the exchange from one of the chimeric twins to the other.",
        "Statistically, about 8% of fraternal twins could end up with blood chimerism. In the case of triplets , the chance for blood chimerism rises up to 21%. But can non-twins be a chimera? Absolutely. Vanishing twin syndrome can be the cause of chimerism in some of these cases. In 5% of pregnancies, multiple embryos occur which can lead to a twin birth, but not all the time. Of those, 25% of the time one may fail to survive a full 9 months. In this case, the embryo is sometimes taken back up into the mom's tissues. Or, it can combine with its twin. Either way, the surviving baby becomes a chimera. There is no statistical information on how many chimeras are born like this. But after examining rates of numerous embryos and vanishing twin syndrome, it is speculated that 1 in 80 pregnancies may result in a vanishing twin pregnancy ."

The mom experiences no health problems, but may only visually have some mild vaginal bleeding as a sign that one of the embryos has been lost. So, the earlier the loss of the vanishing fetus during gestation, the more likely no one will notice, and the chances of survival of both mom and the other fetus are good.",
