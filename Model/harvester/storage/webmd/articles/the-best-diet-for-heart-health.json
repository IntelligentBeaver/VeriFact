        "Despite the name, there’s no single Mediterranean diet (MD). It’s an umbrella term for an eating plan based on simply prepared foods that are common to countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, including Italy, Crete, and Greece. Research has linked the MD to better heart health, including a study of about 26,000 women that found following the diet for 12 years reduced the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease by 25%.",
        "A Mediterranean way of eating is based on grain foods, fruits, vegetables, legumes (beans and lentils), nuts and seeds, and very few, if any, highly processed products. The MD is not a low-fat diet -- olive is the main source of added fat. A Mediterranean-style plan minimizes animal foods, but includes moderate amounts of eggs, poultry, fish, and dairy products. There’s very little red meat, such as beef and lamb, or processed meats. Red wine figures into the MD, but with meals and in small amounts. There’s no need to drink wine to follow the MD, however."
