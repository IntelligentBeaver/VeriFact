I awaited the scan results that would determine whether the cancer had spread. After completing chemotherapy and surgery, I then awaited another call, this time declaring that there was no evidence of disease.",
        "Following my subsequent diagnosis last year, I found myself in a similar position, awaiting news about what type of cancer I was facing and whether further treatment would be necessary. I’m grateful that the tumor was localized and that I didn’t need to repeat chemotherapy. However, I had to start the reconstruction process all over again on my left breast, which required nine tissue expansion appointments over 4 months. After completing these appointments, I then waited another 7 months for my implant-exchange surgery."

As much as I try to be proactive about my health, there’s only so much I can know from an outside perspective.
