If your child is younger than age 5 and has no other symptoms, the doctor will likely suggest taking a 'wait and see' approach. This is because most children older than age 5 spontaneously stop bedwetting on their own. However, if your child is older than age 6 and is still wetting the bed regularly, the decision to treat becomes more complicated. It will depend on the attitudes of the child, the parents/caregivers, and the doctor."
