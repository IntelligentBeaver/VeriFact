People with DPD are prone to developing depression or anxiety, symptoms that might prompt the individual to seek help.",

The goal of therapy is to help the person with DPD become more active and independent, and to learn to form healthy relationships.

It is often useful for the therapist and patient together to pay attention to the role of therapist in order to recognize and address ways in which the patient may form the same kind of passive reliance in the treatment relationship that happens outside of treatment. Specific strategies might include assertiveness training to help the person with DPD develop self-confidence and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to help someone develop new attitudes and perspectives about themselves relative to other people and experiences. More meaningful change in someone's personality structure usually is pursued through long-term psychoanalytic or psychodynamic psychotherapy , where early developmental experiences are examined as they may shape the formation of defense mechanisms , coping styles, and patterns of attachment and intimacy in close relationships.",
