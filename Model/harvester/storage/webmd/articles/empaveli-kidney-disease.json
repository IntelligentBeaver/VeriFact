        "Complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and primary immune-complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) are rare kidney diseases that happen because of an overactive complement system (a part of your immune system that activates proteins to help your body heal from infections or injuries). In people with C3G or primary IC-MPGN, problems with the complement system cause clusters of proteins called immune complexes to form. These clusters get stuck in the kidneys and cause inflammation and damage to the filtering units in your kidneys called glomeruli.",
        "Empaveli (pegcetacoplan) was approved by the FDA in July 2025 to lower protein levels in the urine ( proteinuria ) in adults and adolescents with C3G or primary IC-MPGN. It is the second approved medicine for people with C3G and the only approved medicine for people with primary IC-MPGN."

The FDA requires REMS programs for some medicines that have serious safety concerns. These programs help to make sure that anyone prescribing, dispensing, or receiving the medicine is aware of the safety concern and that any measures needed to help the medicine be used safely are in place. In order to prescribe Empaveli, your health care provider will need to enroll in the REMS program. The REMS program requires your health care provider to tell you more about the serious risk of infections associated with Empaveli. They will also make sure that you have received all of the correct vaccines to minimize this risk. If you have not yet gotten the correct vaccines, they will make sure that you receive appropriate antibiotics, if needed.",
