        "The knee is one of the largest and most complex joints in the body, making knee pain a common issue. The activities of daily life can take a toll on your knees. Walking puts stress on your knees that's equal to one and a half times your body weight, while going downstairs creates pressure equal to two to three times your body weight. No wonder that knee pain triggers up to 40% of physical therapy visits.",
        "Often, joint pain is a result of aging and osteoarthritis , but people of all ages can get knee pain. Weak muscles, tight muscles, or muscle imbalance may cause pain around and under the kneecap , often called anterior knee pain. Inflamed tendons can also cause the knees to hurt.",
        "Exercise is the best treatment for most arthritic knee pain . It can also help other types of knee pain . You should not try to correct your knee pain with exercise if you have experienced a pop in your knee. Other signs that you need to see a doctor include a knee that swells, buckles, or locks up."
