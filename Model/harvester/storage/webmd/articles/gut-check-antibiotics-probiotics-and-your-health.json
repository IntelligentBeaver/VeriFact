        "Nov. 27, 2024 -- Antibiotics are life-saving in the right moments, like treating bacterial infections, but knowing when they’re necessary is key. They can also disrupt the delicate balance of gut health. So, how can probiotics help? When should you use them – and when should you not? We spoke with Will Bulsiewicz, MD , a board-certified gastroenterologist and NYT bestselling author, to explore the relationship between antibiotics, probiotics, and gut health. Dr. B shared insights on evidence-based probiotic use, the importance of mindful antibiotic choices, and how a gut-healthy diet can support overall well-being."

They can also disrupt the delicate balance of gut health. So, how can probiotics help? When should you use them – and when should you not? We spoke with Will Bulsiewicz, MD, a board-certified gastroenterologist and NYT bestselling author, to explore the relationship between antibiotics, probiotics, and gut health. Dr. B shared insights on evidence-based probiotic use, the importance of mindful antibiotic choices, and how a gut-healthy diet can support overall well-being.",
