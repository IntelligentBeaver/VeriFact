        "Most everyone can agree that the time from 2020 to 2023 flew by quickly, and those years seemed like a big blur. Although I sometimes find myself having the same thoughts, those years will never truly be forgotten because of all the health battles I faced during that time. Many people remember the global pandemic, and while time may have stood still for many people, my life seemed 10 times more difficult.",
        "In the beginning, very few facts were known about COVID-19, but the detail that was made crystal clear was the number of lives taken in such a short time due to the virus. Individuals most at risk of death after contracting it were those with preexisting conditions or compromised immune systems such as myself.",
        "I can recall how frightening it was to listen to the CDC encourage everyone to shelter in place because of how easy it was for COVID to spread. But I still had a full schedule of doctor’s appointments at the hospital week after week. How could I be expected to remain healthy while visiting the same place responsible for treating hundreds of COVID cases a day? Surely these patients will cross paths with me at some point and I will be next in line for exhibiting symptoms."

Not only was I expected to attend all these appointments amid a global pandemic, but I was sometimes unable to have my mother or other family members present for moral support. Hospitals began enforcing their “no visitors” policy. All patients were expected to battle their hospitalizations, surgeries, and treatments alone."

My clinical trial protocol included 16 very aggressive chemotherapy treatments, which my doctors believed would cause infertility in the future. Being only 23 years old, single, and fresh out of college, it was difficult for me to imagine motherhood at the time, but it was also impossible to envision my life without a family in the future."

I couldn’t begin each IVF cycle until I had a negative COVID test result, which meant I got very acquainted with the uncomfortable nose screening. I also could show no COVID symptoms before any stem cell harvests for my transplant because the treatment alone would be very stressful on my body. Meaning I needed to be my healthiest self.",
        "The unthinkable happened to me in June of 2020, when I started experiencing a fever and horrible headache a day after my 24th birthday. I went to get a blood-exchange transfusion that was scheduled for me monthly and I was diagnosed with COVID-19 during my appointment. I was afraid after testing positive because of all the media reports highlighting how people with compromised immune systems were dying from COVID.",
        "I couldn’t believe a family gathering after my aunt’s funeral could have caused my own life to be in jeopardy, just days after my birthday. I was hospitalized immediately for monitoring and required to wear an oxygen mask during the entire admission. I even received multiple doses of remdesivir, which at the time was an antiviral medication with limited research and considered experimental."
