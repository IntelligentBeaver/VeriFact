Some immune cells in our bodies called T cells have proteins on their surface that bind to PD-L1. When these proteins bind to each other, the T cells in our body get turned “off,” which stops them from killing cancer cells. Keytruda acts on proteins on the T cell and prevents these proteins from binding to PD-L1 proteins on the tumor cell. This turns the T cell back “on” and allows it to do its job of attacking and killing the tumor cell."

        "Keytruda was studied in people with endometrial cancer that was advanced or was recurrent who had never received prior treatment or had not received treatment in the last 12 months. People in this study got either Keytruda plus chemotherapy or a placebo plus chemotherapy. There were 810 people in this study, and they were split into two groups based on whether they had mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) disease. Five hundred and eighty-eight people had pMMR tumor status, and 222 had dMMR tumor status. The average age of people in this study was 66 years old, ranging from 29 to 94. In the dMMR group, 79% of people were White, 9% were Black, 3% were Asian, and 5% were Hispanic or Latino. In the pMMR group, 72% of people were White, 16% were Black, 5% were Asian, and 6% were Hispanic or Latino. The study looked at progression-free survival (PFS), which measures how long people lived without progression of their cancer. In the people with pMMR, those in the Keytruda group had a median PFS of 11.1 months, compared to 8.5 months in the placebo group. This means that half of the people with pMMR getting Keytruda lived at least 11.1 months . For the people who got Keytruda plus chemotherapy, the risk of death or disease progression was reduced by 70% in the dMMR group and by 40% in the pMMR group. For the people in the dMMR group, the endpoint of PFS was not met. This means that the treatment didn’t work as well as expected in preventing the disease from getting worse in this group of people."
