Most people who have hemophilia A have moderate or severe symptoms.",
        "Hemophilia B -- also called Christmas disease -- is less common. It happens in about 20% of people with hemophilia. Hemophilia B results from too little of a plasma protein called factor IX , which helps blood clot. As in hemophilia A, hemophilia B can be mild, moderate, or severe. The less factor IX, the more serious the symptoms. The first person reported in medical books to have the condition had the last name Christmas. It’s also known as the royal disease because members of several European royal families inherited it from Britain’s Queen Victoria."
