        "When Carol Case and Ira Lieberman retired and moved from New York to San Diego, the ocean was supposed to be healing. Lieberman loved the water. Case wanted him to have peace as he navigated advanced Parkinson's disease. \"We did a lot of walking on the beach,\" Case recalls. \"I did things that I felt would support him where he wouldn't feel the loss of what he had just given up.\" For the first eight years after his 2003 diagnosis, Lieberman managed his symptoms well. But when the disease entered its advanced stages, their routine – and Case's role in her husband's care – changed dramatically. Lieberman struggled with mobility issues, sleep disturbances, depression, and a decline in thinking skills. Case arranged her schedule around his care. She meditated, wrote in a gratitude journal, and kept on exercising. But being a full-time caregiver for her husband took a toll on her health. Most nights, she only slept for a few hours. \"It was then that I realized I couldn't do it by myself,\" she says."

        "Advanced Parkinson's disease doesn't look the same for everyone, explains Matthew Barrett, MD, a neurologist and movement disorder specialist at Virginia Commonwealth University's Parkinson's and Movement Disorders Center in Richmond. \"Some patients have serious motor symptoms, unreliable responses to medication, balance impairments, falls, or even wheelchair use,\" he says. \"There are also cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms – a [large] proportion of people with Parkinson's develop dementia.\" The symptoms might vary, but those with advanced Parkinson's tend to have one thing in common: They all need caregiver support. Barrett says the lack of mobility alone may mean that caregivers and loved ones need help with daily activities. Challenges for caregivers Caregivers can include loved ones or professional health care workers. They may help with things like dressing, eating, and bathing. They can also manage finances or medications. Caregiving can be deeply personal and meaningful, but it can also come with emotional, physical, and financial trade-offs. \"I managed it [well] for the first 11 years,\" Case says. \"But the last three years were really difficult.\""
