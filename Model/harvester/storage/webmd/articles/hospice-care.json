        "During a serious illness, you or your loved ones may talk with your doctor and decide that the treatments that are meant to cure or slow the illness are no longer working. Or you may decide to stop those treatments for other reasons. When that happens and you are nearing the end of life, your doctor can refer you to hospice care, also known as end-of-life care.",
        "Hospice care can make sense when you're no longer trying to extend your life, but you want relief from pain and other symptoms, along with emotional , practical, and spiritual support for the last phase of life.",
        "Some people might think using hospice means they're giving up. Others may worry that they won’t get the medical care they need. But hospice care simply shifts the focus of medical care and other supports to improve the quality of your life for as long as it lasts. So, you might spend much less time and energy on treatments and tests and more time and energy on whatever matters most to you."
