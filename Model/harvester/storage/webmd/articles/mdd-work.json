It may create added stress and make your responsibilities feel more challenging. Hard work, deadlines, and an unfriendly environment may be a struggle. On the other hand, work has the ability to help with some aspects of MDD. Having a routine, social contacts, and supportive people around you can help you manage your symptoms better. Everyone is different and so is each workplace, so it depends on the environment where you work. Here are common challenges you may have at work and what you can do to manage them."
