        "When you have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the small blood vessels in your lungs narrow. That makes it harder for blood to flow the way it’s supposed to. This leads to high blood pressure in the arteries that carry blood from your heart to your lungs. Without treatment, the heart gets weaker because it has to work harder to pump blood throughout the body. The goal of PAH medications is to relax or widen blood vessels so blood can flow more freely. There are lots of treatment options to consider, including pills, medicines you inhale (breathe in), and infusions. Let’s take a closer look."
