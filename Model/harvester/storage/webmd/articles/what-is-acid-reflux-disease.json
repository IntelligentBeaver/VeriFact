        "Acid reflux is when acid from inside your stomach flows up into your esophagus and throat. At the entrance to your stomach is a valve, a ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, the LES closes as soon as food passes through it. But if it doesn't close all the way or it opens too often, acid from your stomach can move up into your esophagus. This can cause symptoms such as a burning chest discomfort called heartburn. If acid reflux symptoms happen more than twice a week, you may have acid reflux disease, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) ."
