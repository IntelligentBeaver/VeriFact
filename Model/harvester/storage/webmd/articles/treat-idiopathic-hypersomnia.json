Even diagnosing this disorder, which brings excessive sleepiness in the daytime even after long hours of sleep at night, is challenging. If you have IH, the main goal of treatment is to ease the symptoms, especially the extreme daytime sleepiness that can severely hamper your quality of life. Generally, there are two roads you can take to control the symptoms: the path without drugs and the one with them."

It's also common practice to use so-called \"wake-promoting\" medications that are used for a similar disorder, narcolepsy, to treat IH. Generally, these medicines fall into three categories: Stimulants . These wake-promoting drugs include derivatives of amphetamines, like dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine ), methamphetamine (Desoxyn ) and methylphenidate (Ritalin ). They can be effective, but they also can have side effects that include dependence -- getting \"hooked\" on them -- and heart problems."
