        "Hostility is one of several feelings that trigger the release of stress hormones into your bloodstream. These hormones cause your coronary arteries to constrict, and at the same time induce a more rapid and powerful heartbeat. They also increase your blood pressure , the tendency for blood clotting and the levels of sugar and fats in your blood. The net result: an increase in demand on your heart.",
        "In a recent study, Duke Medical School researchers asked 58 patients with myocardial ischemia, a painful condition of insufficient blood flow to the heart, to wear heart monitors for 48 hours. The patients were instructed to keep a diary of emotions -- tension, sadness, frustration, happiness and feeling in control -- during the period.",
        "Strengthening the view that stress reduces blood flow to the heart, the researchers found that patients who had stressful feelings were twice as likely to have a bout of ischemic pain an hour later as patients who didn't have stressful feelings."
