        "I’m not a medical expert, that much has been established. But I keep finding myself in situations where people ask me what I do to keep my skin so clear. My answer, every time and without failing and bluntly, is that I use steroids. There’s really no other way around it. The most substantial products I use that make a difference in how smooth my skin is will always be steroids until I make the choice to do otherwise. For the time being, I’ll remain with my last resort.",
        "As it stands, steroids are not the last resort for some people. And I can understand not wanting to succumb to them, but also, not wanting to depend on them. I’ve recently been exposed to topical steroid withdrawal, which refers to the uncontrollable spread of dermatitis and worsening skin inflammation after disuse of steroids after you have been using them consistently. It’s not for the faint of heart. It’s a painful condition that requires a lot of strength and determination. Yes, but you also need resolve. For withdrawal and those effects."

Has it not always been a habitual and obligatory part of our morning routine? Well, she isn’t the first actress to admit to as much. Cameron Diaz and others have offered their identical exclusion of the act. Hayek then shared that she picked up this trick from her grandmother and the following reasoning:"

So much so that every night, even if I don’t wash my face (which I often don’t), I will still go to the lengths to lather lotion and hydrate key dry spots with Vaseline to seal the moisture in.

It didn’t feel like any moisture was being locked into my pores. It wasn’t until that moment – that feeling – that I decided this skin tip trick wasn’t one for me.",
