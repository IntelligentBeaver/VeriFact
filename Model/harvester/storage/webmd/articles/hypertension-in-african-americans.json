Drugs used to treat high blood pressure include: Diuretics, which reduce the amount of fluid in your blood by helping your body rid itself of extra salt.

Calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors , and alpha-blockers help keep your blood vessels from tightening up. Your doctor may want to start with calcium channel blockers by themselves, or in combination with diuretics. Beta-blockers prevent your body from using the hormone adrenaline by blocking the cell receptors for it. Adrenaline is a stress hormone. It makes your heart beat harder and faster. It also makes your blood vessels tighten. All of this makes blood pressure higher."
