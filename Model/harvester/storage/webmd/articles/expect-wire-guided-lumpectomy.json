Knowing what to expect can help take some of the fear of the unknown away. Before a surgery, your radiologist will take pictures of your breast with a mammogram or ultrasound . Once the area that needs removal is found, that part of your breast is numbed.",
        "This kind of lumpectomy takes about an hour from start to finish. After your breast area is numb, you’ll have a thin wire inserted into the target area. The wire will stick out of your skin, but some bandages keep you from seeing or moving it. The wire is removed when the area of breast tissue is removed.",
