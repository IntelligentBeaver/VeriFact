        "My dad would explain quietly to me and my younger brother: “Your mother has a headache. Let her rest.” We knew if we knocked on that bedroom door or made any noise near it, he wouldn’t be happy.",
        "I knew she wouldn’t be in the room long, but to a kid, it seemed like an eternity. I would miss her when she would escape behind the closed door of the bedroom at the end of the hall. We would all move to the farthest end of the house and do our best to keep relatively quiet.",
        "What sent her to the room with a headache? Why are they so often? Was it something I said or did? Was she mad at my dad? Surely, it was my brother playing Mario Brothers way too loudly!"

My dad would step up to the plate and finish dinner, take us to practice, or whatever needed to be done. He did his best, but you know kids. We would be silently critical because, “That’s not how she makes rice,” or “Mom lets us watch Dynasty .” (Gosh, I’m aging myself.)",
