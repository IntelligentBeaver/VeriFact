        "My migraine disease has evolved as I’ve aged. No major surprise there. So has my eyesight, flexibility, and my weight. Such is life. Migraine episode frequency has changed along with hormonal shifts from puberty through menopause.",
        "Recently, I noticed an increase in migraines starting up during the night. For several months, I brushed them off as weather-related. Kansas storm fronts were notorious for triggering sinus and/or migraine issues.",
        "Let me go back a bit. For decades, my jaw has popped a little if I chewed gum or ate something extra chewy like baguette bread or caramels. I told my dentist about it, and he told me to let him know if it begins to interfere with eating or starts to hurt. I asked him if it could be triggering migraines. He replied if it were, I would know. Since I didn’t know, I guessed it wasn’t.",
        "When the popping became uncomfortable and more prevalent no matter what I ate, I decided it was time to press the issue with the dentist. He said I might have TMJ and fitted me for a simple, inexpensive mouthguard to wear at night. After a few months, I saw no signs of improvement with the popping, and I woke up several nights a week with a migraine. I thought this had to be more than a coincidence because the weather had been calm."
