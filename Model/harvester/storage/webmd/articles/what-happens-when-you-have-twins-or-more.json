        "The birth of twins or triplets can be a joyful event. But it's also overwhelming to care for multiple babies. Amy Romashko, MD, medical director of the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Urgent Care and a mom of twins, offers this advice on navigating the first few months.",
        "Admit to the tough times. Lack of sleep and endless feedings can make life with multiple newborns stressful. It's important to be honest about that. \"The first few months can be really brutal, and it's easy to feel conflicted, because you don't want to complain, and you're supposed to be happy,\" Romashko says. \"But honestly, there's not much happiness for a few months.\"",

Romashko's own twins fussed and cavorted through their 1-year photo shoot, which felt like a failure at the time, she admits. But those photos have become faves because they so perfectly reflect the reality of that moment."
