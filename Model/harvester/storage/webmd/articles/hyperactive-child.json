        "July 10, 2000 -- When Beth Kaplaneck was told in the early '90s that her 8-year-old son had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common childhood behavior disorders in the United States, she began a decade-long struggle to get appropriate care -- the right combination of medication , psychological counseling, and classroom assistance. She fought the school system, her insurance company, and sometimes her doctors. \"I had to be very, very aggressive,\" says Kaplaneck, the president of the Washington, D.C.-based group Children and Adults With Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder.",
        "A decade later, parents still face many of the same barriers to proper treatment that Kaplaneck did, even though studies have shown the type of care most of these kids need to thrive, including the use of drugs. But treating ADHD with medication has come under increasing criticism lately, leaving parents confused and concerned. What really works best for kids with ADHD?"
