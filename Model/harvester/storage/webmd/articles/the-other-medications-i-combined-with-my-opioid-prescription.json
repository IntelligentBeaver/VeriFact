        "Maybe the additional pain med helped, maybe it didn’t, but all I know is I didn’t need to decrease the primary opioid I was taking. As time went on, I just needed more and more of the hydrocodone, eventually getting to the point where I couldn’t go on that way but I had nowhere else to turn."
