Topical steroids are often a doctor's go-to because they're safe and they work, but they're not your only weapon against psoriasis. If a steroid doesn't clear your skin enough, you also have a lot of nonsteroidal treatments to choose from. Many creams, ointments, and other products that you rub on your skin don't contain corticosteroids. Instead, they're made with ingredients like vitamin A and vitamin D3 that put the brakes on skin cell growth and help clear up scaly patches."

Keep the medicine on your skin for only 5 to 10 minutes at a time and then wash it off. Your doctor can slowly increase the dose and treatment time as you get used to anthralin. Wear gloves when you apply anthralin and wash your hands with soap and water afterward to prevent stains. Apply a layer of petroleum jelly to protect your skin around the treatment area. Vtama is the newest topical psoriasis treatment. It works on your immune system to reduce inflammation and prevent scales. In studies, up to 40% of people who used this cream had clear or almost clear skin. Some stayed clear for months after they stopped the treatment.
