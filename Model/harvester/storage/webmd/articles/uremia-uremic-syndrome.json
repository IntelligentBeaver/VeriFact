        "Uremia or uremic syndrome is a condition that happens when your kidneys can't filter wastes and fluid out of your bloodstream the way they should and you don't get dialysis to remove them either. As a result, toxins build up and can cause problems in your heart, brain, bones, and more. (Credits: iStock/Getty Images )",
        "When you have uremia, your kidneys won't filter waste and extra fluid from your blood and get rid of them through urine the way they should. As a result, those things stay in your blood and can be toxic. This condition is sometimes called uremic syndrome because of all the effects it can have throughout your body.",
        "Usually if you have uremia, it means that your kidneys are failing from chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. This can happen because of a long-running health problem, like diabetes or high blood pressure, or because a severe injury or an infection damages your kidneys. You're more likely to get uremia if you don't start dialysis after your kidneys stop working.",
        "Uremia vs. uremic syndrome",
        "These names are sometimes used interchangeably. But uremic syndrome refers to all the signs and symptoms that you may have when untreated chronic kidney disease leads to uremia. The wastes in your blood can affect other organs and your metabolism in many complex ways."
