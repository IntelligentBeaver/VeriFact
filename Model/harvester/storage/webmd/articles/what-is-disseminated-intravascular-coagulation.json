        "Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition that affects your blood’s clotting abilities. It can either set in slowly or happen very suddenly under particular conditions. It’s also known as consumption coagulopathy.",
        "Disseminated intravascular coagulation has two main stages. In the first stage, your body starts to develop a lot of small blood clots throughout your bloodstream. These clots rapidly use up the cells and proteins—called platelets and clotting factors—that you need in order to stop bleeding.",
        "The second stage comes when you start to bleed uncontrollably because you have used up all of your body's clotting abilities. This stage can be very dangerous and needs to be treated immediately.",
        "DIC never happens on its own. It’s always a secondary complication of some other condition or a sign that another condition is getting worse.",
        "Disseminated intravascular coagulation happens in 1% of all hospitalized patients. Bleeding from three unrelated sites at one time could be a sign of DIC."
