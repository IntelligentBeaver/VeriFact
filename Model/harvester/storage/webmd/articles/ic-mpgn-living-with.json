        "I'm a busy working mom. If I'm tired, my first instinct is to push through. So when I began to have vague symptoms like fatigue, persistent swelling, and high blood pressure in 2020, I thought it was just stress. I had a busy job as a director of financial services at a local university and two young kids at home. We had just moved into an old charming farmhouse, and I had to supervise the renovation.",
        "My doctors lectured me about stress and poor lifestyle. But it wasn't either. It took more than a year of misdiagnoses and testing before I learned I had primary IC-MPGN, a rare and serious kidney condition. While it was scary, there's been a happy ending to my story. I've responded well to a new medication, pegcetacoplan (Empaveli), that's allowed me to better manage my life."
