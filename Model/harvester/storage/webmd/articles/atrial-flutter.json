        "Your heart has its own electrical system. It sends out signals that control your heartbeat. As long as your heart beats normally, your heart will remain able to do its job properly: pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body.",
        "But sometimes those electrical signals go awry. That can cause your heart to beat too fast, too slow, or erratically.",
        "Atrial flutter is an arrhythmia that results from an abnormal electrical circuit inside one of your heart’s two upper chambers, or atria. Most often, this faulty signal develops in the right atrium. It causes both of your atria to beat extra fast, about 250-350 beats per minute. That, in turn, causes your heart’s two lower chambers, or ventricles, to pick up the pace as well. They can beat more than 150 times per minute during atrial flutter. By contrast, a normal heartbeat is 60-100 beats per minute.",
        "An abnormally fast heart rate is called tachycardia . Because atrial flutter comes from the atria, it is called a supraventricular (meaning above the ventricles) tachycardia."

Your doctor will insert long, thin tubes called catheters into a blood vessel and move them to your heart. These catheters are tipped with sensors that can measure and record your heart’s electrical activity in great detail. The sensors also can send electrical signals that will speed up or slow down your heart, allowing your doctor to pinpoint any abnormal electrical signals that are causing your atrial flutter and where those signals are coming from. Sometimes, it’s possible to treat atrial flutter during this test.",
