        "Oct. 9, 2000 -- Alex Garcia (not his real name), tucks his 6-month-old daughter Mia into the crook of his arm and starts to feed her an evening bottle. Back from a long day at the office, Garcia uses his free hand to rub his eyes . He looks down at his daughter adoringly, and the tension of the day seems to melt away. \"The easiest thing is coming home,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter what happens during the day, you see that face and it all goes away.\"",
        "From the moment Mia was conceived, Garcia and his wife began preparing for her arrival. He'd read every book on pregnancy and parenting he could during his wife's pregnancy and was eager to take time off to be with his new baby. Though the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 allows both parents to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, he soon realized that the California district attorney's office where he worked had a different \"policy.\"",
        "His co-workers informed him that the unofficial office rule allowed for a maximum of two weeks off. No father in his office had ever taken off more time, and although Garcia was disappointed, he valued his job and decided to make do. \"If I'd had my druthers, I would have taken off as much time as I possibly could,\" Garcia said. \"But I didn't want to be the one who decided to push the envelope.\""
