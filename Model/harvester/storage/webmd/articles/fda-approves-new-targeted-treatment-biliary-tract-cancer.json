        "The FDA has approved a new drug, zanidatamab, for adults with advanced biliary tract cancer , or BTC. Marketed under the brand name Ziihera , it is a first-of-a-kind treatment for patients with HER2-positive cancer that has spread or can't be removed by surgery after prior treatment.",
        "BTC begins in either the gallbladder or bile duct (branched tubes connecting the liver and gall bladder to the small intestine), with less than 5% of patients surviving five years when it spreads. Advanced HER2-positive cases (where tumors produce high levels of the HER2 protein that promotes cancer growth) are usually more aggressive and have limited treatment options.",
        "The drug is a targeted antibody against HER2 and is the first to attack the protein at two sites, stopping tumor growth. It also helps the body's immune system identify and attack cancer cells. This multifaceted action makes the drug better at reducing disease progression.",
        "The FDA also approved the Ventana Pathway anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody, a test to detect HER2-positive tumors and confirm that people are eligible for the new treatment."
