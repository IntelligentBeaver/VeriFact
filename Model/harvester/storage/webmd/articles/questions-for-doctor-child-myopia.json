Their optometrist or ophthalmologist will check to see if the myopia has progressed and your child needs stronger lenses. This is very likely to happen: Once it starts in childhood, the condition usually gets worse every few months until at least the teen years. At these checkups, you’ll want to be prepared with questions so you can understand your child’s myopia and your treatment options."
