        "Libtayo is a specific kind of medicine called immunotherapy . Immunotherapies work by helping your body’s own immune system work to fight against cancer. Libtayo works by attaching itself to a receptor called programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on specific immune system cells called T cells. PD-1 can show up on these cells when cancer has activated or exhausted the T cells. It blocks PD-1 on cancer cells and stops them from sending signals that make your immune system weaker. This allows normal T cells in your immune system to find cancer cells and kill them to slow or stop tumors from growing."

This means that half of the people who received Libtayo did not have their cancer progress for at least 8.2 months, compared to 5.7 months for people who received chemotherapy.
