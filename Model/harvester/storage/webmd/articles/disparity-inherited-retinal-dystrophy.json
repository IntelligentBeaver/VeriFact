But not everyone with an IRD has the same access to genetic testing , treatment, resources, or clinical trials . That’s because of health disparities that can result from your: Race or ethnicity Gender Education Income and poverty Disability Where you live Access to health care Health insurance Behavioral factors All of these together are called social determinants of health. Your risk of having an IRD depends on the genes you got from your parents. But social factors influence your life with IRD. These can lead to disparities between groups affected by these conditions."

For example, there’s now an approved gene therapy to treat a rare form of IRD. It’s caused by changes in a gene called RPE65. Researchers and doctors think more treatments will be developed. It’s easier and cheaper to run genetic tests today than ever before. This makes it easier for scientists to figure out the specific gene that’s causing an IRD. It also makes it easier for you to get genetic tests to figure out what type of IRD you have. The causes of some IRDs are still a mystery. About 3 in every 4 people with an IRD can get answers from a genetic test. In the others, doctors might be able to find a cause if they look at all of your DNA or all of your DNA that makes proteins."
