        "You and your relatives have a lot in common. Things like blue eyes, tall height, and diseases like asthma or heart disease might run in your family. If you have type 1 diabetes , you might wonder if that has also passed down your family tree to you. And you may worry that your children could get it too. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks beta cells in your pancreas that make insulin . Genes could play a role in that immune system attack. Type 1 diabetes does run in families. Having a parent, brother, sister, or child with type 1 diabetes makes you about 15 times more likely to get this disease than people who don't have a family history . Even so, around 85% of people who get type 1 diabetes have no other family members with the disease. And most people who do have a family history of type 1 diabetes don't ever get it themselves. That's because genes alone don't cause diabetes. Even if you carry genes that increase your risk, something in your environment has to trigger the disease. Researchers are learning more about the genetic and environmental causes of type 1 diabetes. What they've found out could lead to new ways to prevent and treat this disease."

        "Scientists are studying gene changes called mutations that are linked to type 1 diabetes. Many of these genes affect how your immune system works. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes help your immune system tell the difference between your own cells and foreign cells like germs. A problem with your HLA genes could be one reason why your immune system mistakenly attacks cells in your pancreas that make insulin. HLA genes are further divided into different variants called DR. They're written like this: HLA-DR1. Some of these variants, like HLA-DR2, seem to protect against type 1 diabetes. Others increase the risk. The insulin (INS) gene is also linked to type 1 diabetes. This gene gives your body the instructions it needs to make insulin. People of different races may have different gene variants. White people are at the highest risk of having type 1 diabetes overall. Most White people with type 1 diabetes have the gene HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR4. These genes are linked to autoimmune diseases . The gene HLA-DR7 may increase the chances of type 1 diabetes in Black people, while HLA-DR9 increases them in Japanese people."
