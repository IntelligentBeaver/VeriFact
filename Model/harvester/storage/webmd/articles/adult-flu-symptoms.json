        "Influenza, aka the flu, is a highly contagious virus that infects your nose, throat, and sometimes your lungs. You can get sick by being around someone with the flu when they cough, sneeze, or talk. That's because the virus travels through the air on tiny droplets of fluid. If flu germs land on a surface and you touch them, then touch your nose, eyes, or mouth, you can get sick. Some people who get the flu have only mild symptoms. Others become severely ill and need to go to the hospital. The flu can also be fatal. Getting a flu shot every year can help protect you.",
