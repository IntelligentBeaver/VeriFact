You breathe in and out as hard as you can through a tube, and your doctor measures the volume of air exhaled at specific time points during a forceful and complete exhalation after a maximal inhalation. It can help diagnose conditions that affect how much air your lungs can hold, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Doctors will test spirometry before and after the use of an albuterol bronchodilator and see if there is an improvement with the medication s which is seen in asthma, but not in COPD."
