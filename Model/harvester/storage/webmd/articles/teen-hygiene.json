        "\"A lot of teens really have that sweaty sock syndrome,\" says Charles Wibbelsman, MD, chairman of the Chiefs of Adolescent Medicine for Kaiser Permanente of Northern California and co-author of The Teenage Body Book. \"I walk into the exam room and the smell is so overpowering that I really want to keep the door open.\"",
        "Of course, sweaty feet are just the beginning. As soon as puberty hits and the hormones start flowing, a preteen's hygiene requirements change dramatically in many ways. But experts say a lot of parents avoid discussing the subject.",
        "\"Parents too often assume that 10- or 11-year-olds will somehow naturally learn what they need to know about hygiene,\" says Wibbelsman. \"But that's not true. Someone has to teach them.\"",
        "Kids with poor hygiene face consequences. Some are medical: they may be more prone to developing rashes and infections. But equally important, they may quickly become known at school for being dirty. That sort of bad rep can be hard to shake and damaging to self-esteem.",
        "So as a parent, it's your job to help your kids and explain the teen hygiene basics. But where do you start? How can you give your preteen daughter responsibility for their own hygiene? And how can you get your teenage son -- who, let's be honest, stinks -- to shower every day without relentless nagging? Here are your teen hygiene answers."
