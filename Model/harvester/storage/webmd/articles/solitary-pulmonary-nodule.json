        "People with SPNs usually do not experience symptoms. SPNs are usually noticed by chance on a chest X-ray that has been taken for another reason (referred to as an incidental finding). SPNs are a common abnormality seen on chest X-rays that often needs further evaluation. Approximately 150,000 cases are detected every year as incidental findings, either on X-rays or CT scans.",
        "Most SPNs are benign (noncancerous); however, they may represent an early stage of primary lung cancer or may indicate that cancer is metastasizing (spreading) from another part of the body to the affected lung. Determining whether the SPN seen on the chest X-ray or chest CT scan is benign or malignant (cancerous) is important. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of early lung cancer that looks like an SPN may be the only chance to cure the cancer."
