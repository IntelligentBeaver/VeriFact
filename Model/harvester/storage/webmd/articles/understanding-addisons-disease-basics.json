        "One way the body keeps itself in balance is by using chemical messengers called hormones to regulate various functions. Just above each of your kidneys is a small adrenal gland. These glands make hormones essential to a healthy life. When they don't make enough of these hormones, Addison's disease is the result.",
        "Addison's disease is a rare condition. Only one in 100,000 people have it. It can happen at any age to either men or women. People with Addison's disease can lead normal lives as long as they take their medication . President John F. Kennedy had the condition.",

        "Cortisol's most important function is to help the body respond to stress. It also helps control your body's use of protein, carbohydrates, and fat, helps maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function, and controls inflammation.",
        "Aldosterone helps your kidneys regulate the amount of salt and potassium in your body, regulating your blood volume and keeping your blood pressure in check. When aldosterone levels drop too low, your kidneys cannot keep your salt levels in balance. This, in turn, makes your blood pressure drop."
