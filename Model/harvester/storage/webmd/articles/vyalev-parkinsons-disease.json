        "If you have advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD), you may hear about a treatment option called vyalev (foscarbidopa/foslevodopa) . It was approved by the FDA in 2024. It is also known by the brand name Produodopa in other countries.",
        "Parkinson’s disease is a condition that affects your brain’s ability to make dopamine , a chemical messenger involved in body movement. Managing PD often starts with taking oral medicines that help replace or mimic dopamine, such as levodopa . These medicines can work well in the early stages to manage symptoms.",
        "As PD advances, many people begin to notice “wearing off,” when symptoms such as tremor, stiffness, or slow walking return before the next dose of medicine. Shifts between “ON” and “OFF” periods can be abrupt and may become hard to predict.",
        "Infusion therapies, such as Vyalev, were developed to help reduce these fluctuations. A wearable pump delivers Vyalev continuously through a tube placed under the skin . This gives your body a steadier supply of medicine and may replace the need to take multiple pills throughout the day for PD.",

Another option in this situation is to take oral medicine as directed by your health care provider.
