        "Cablivi (caplacizumab) is an injectable medicine used to treat a rare and serious blood condition called acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP). The FDA has approved Cablivi to be used along with plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy for treating aTTP in children ages 12 years and older. The medicine was first approved in 2019 for adults with aTTP.",
        "aTTP is a rare, life-threatening autoimmune blood disorder caused by unusually large molecules of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a blood protein that plays a key role in clotting. Abnormal vWF causes widespread clot formation in small blood vessels, leading to impaired blood supply to vital organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys. As platelets (blood cells involved in clotting) clump together, few remain available to help with normal clotting elsewhere in the body. Red blood cells may also break apart, leading to anemia. aTTP is a medical emergency that requires treatment right away, often in an intensive care unit.",
        "Cablivi is a specially designed lab-made antibody fragment that targets the vWF protein in your blood. By blocking the part of the vWF protein that attaches to platelets, Cablivi reduces abnormal clumping of the platelets, decreases formation of harmful clots, and prevents platelets from getting used up too quickly.",
        "Although aTTP is extremely rare in kids, affecting about 1 in 10 million annually, this approval matters because it’s the first time Cablivi can be used in children, giving younger people a new option for managing this life-threatening condition."
