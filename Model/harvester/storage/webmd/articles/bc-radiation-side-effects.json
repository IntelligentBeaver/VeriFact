        "Radiation therapy treats cancer by using high-energy waves to kill tumor cells. The goal is to destroy or damage cancer cells without hurting too many healthy cells. It is given over a certain period. You may get this treatment around the time of surgery or chemotherapy. It can also be used to ease pain from the tumor. This treatment can cause side effects, but they're different for everyone. The ones you have depend on: The type of radiation you get How much radiation you get The part of your body that gets treatment How healthy you are overall There's no way to predict how radiation will affect you. You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment, while someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you'll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with them about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If the therapy makes you uncomfortable, speak up. When you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment."

These are some common early side effects of radiation therapy. Eating problems. Radiation therapy to the head, neck, or parts of the digestive system can cause nausea or loss of appetite. To get the nutrition you need to keep your body strong during treatment, try these tips: Eat five or six small meals spread throughout the day instead of three large ones. Stick to foods you like. Keep healthy snacks on hand so you can eat when you're hungry rather than waiting for mealtimes. Mouth problems. Before you start radiation to your head or neck, see your dentist for an exam. Radiation can cause mouth problems such as: Sores (little cuts or ulcers) Dry mouth Tooth decay Swollen gums Trouble swallowing Jaw stiffness"

        "The fatigue you feel from cancer and radiation therapy is different from normal tiredness. It’s a physical and emotional exhaustion that doesn’t get better with rest and can keep you from doing daily activities, such as going to work or spending time with family and friends. Fatigue may even make it harder for you to follow your cancer treatment plan. You feel so tired because your body has to use a lot of energy to fix cell damage caused by radiation therapy. Pain, anxiety, and stress from your cancer add to the fatigue. Because tiredness can change from day to day, it can be hard to plan your schedule around. Managing fatigue Let your doctor know if you’re experiencing fatigue. They might be able to help.

Combining it with other treatments, such as surgery, can sometimes increase the odds of success. Is radiation therapy safe? Radiation therapy has been a cancer treatment for more than 100 years and is considered safe. But the high-energy rays damage healthy cells and tissues, so you may have side effects such as nausea or fatigue. Having radiation also increases your risk of developing another cancer in the future. What is the cost of radiation therapy?
