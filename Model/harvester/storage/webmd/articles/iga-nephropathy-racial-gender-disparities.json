        "IgA nephropathy affects your kidneys’ ability to filter your blood. It happens when a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in your kidneys over time and inflames them. This protein normally helps your body fight infections. So IgA nephropathy is both a kidney disease and a disease of your immune system . It isn’t clear why people get IgA nephropathy. But it happens more often in men and in people of certain racial or ethnic backgrounds. It’s also more common in some parts of the world than it is in others. It isn’t clear why there are such differences in IgA nephropathy. It’s likely there are many complex factors involved. IgA nephropathy not only happens more in some places than others, but it also looks different in different places. The disease can show big differences from one person to the next in: Progression Complications Treatment response These differences also can be related to differences in geography, race, ethnicity, and sex in complicated ways. More study is needed to understand variation and disparities in IgA nephropathy and their root causes."
