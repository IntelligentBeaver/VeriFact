Some parents fear that the risks of vaccines outweigh the benefits. Most of these worries are based on information they've seen online or in other media, or that they've heard from friends. A commonly cited belief among anti-vaccine groups is that vaccines can cause autism. That belief is based on a 1997 study by a British doctor that was published in the journal The Lancet . The study has since been discredited many times, the doctor lost their medical license, and The Lancet retracted the report.
