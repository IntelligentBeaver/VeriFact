        "Between our day-to-day lives at home and the time spent behind the wheels of our cars, Americans are spending less and less time outside. Research estimates that we spend about 90% of our time indoors. About 70% of each day is spent at home. You may think that the air you’re breathing during all this time inside is safe. But inside your home, you can find two to five times higher concentrations of some pollutants than typical outdoor levels. “When we're faced with poor air quality from smog, wildfires, or other types of airborne pollutants, most of us instinctively try to stay indoors,” says Gail Lebovic, MD. “This is especially important for individuals who suffer from respiratory illnesses. But … airborne particles from outside can make their way inside, and so filtering or \"purifying\" the air in our homes, schools and offices is important and can make a big difference.”"

        "It may be hard to imagine why the air inside your home could be so dirty. But the causes are all around you. According to Andrea De Vizcaya Ruiz, PhD, associate professor of environmental and occupational Health at UC Irvine, home items are the main culprits. This includes items like your furniture, gas stoves, cleaning products, paints, and carpets. Everyday living and pets can also lead to indoor air problems like dust, mold, and dander. Other indoor activities, like smoking and vaping, using cleaning chemicals, candle and incense burning, spraying air fresheners, and fireplace burning, may cause pollutants in the home, says Jie Zhao, PhD, head of research and development at Delos Labs, a company dedicated to wellness in built environments."

Ideally, you should stop smoking to improve your health and lower your risk of smoking-related diseases like cancer, heart disease, and lung disease. You can talk to your doctor and also find resources from the CDC’s website that may help you start your journey to quitting. Until you can quit smoking, don’t smoke inside your home. Always go out, no matter the weather. Make sure that doors and windows are closed behind you so the smoke doesn’t go back inside. The steps you take to make sure the air in your home is healthy to breathe are worth it. As Zhao notes, “Good air quality is just as -- if not more important -- for your health as eating healthy, exercising regularly, not smoking, and limiting alcohol intake.”",
