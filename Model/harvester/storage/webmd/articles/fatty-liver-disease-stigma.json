        "A stigma is a negative belief about someone or something. Stigma is often related to something that makes people uncomfortable, such as poverty, or certain illnesses like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-induced fatty liver disease. When someone hears you have fatty liver disease, they may think that you brought it upon yourself. The word “fatty” could imply it’s related to food or obesity. The fact that it’s a liver disease could imply it was caused by alcohol – even if it is called “nonalcohol-related.” And then if the name actually says “alcohol” in it, like alcohol-induced fatty liver disease, this can help some people believe they’re justified in thinking someone caused their illness by drinking. Professionals in the health care system can also have negative feelings towards patients with fatty liver disease since they may believe that patients brought the condition upon themselves."

        "Stigmas develop when people don’t understand something or they only know part of the story and they fill in the blanks with what they’ve heard or believe. The stigma surrounding any type of liver disease, especially ones that can lead to cirrhosis, is that it’s your fault you’re ill. And sadly, sometimes it’s the people with the disease who lay the blame on themselves. They self-stigmatize. Up to 69% of people with MASLD feel that they are at least partly to blame for their situation."

Here are some of the most common reasons why people may be stigmatized for having fatty liver disease. They believe it’s caused by: Alcohol consumption Drug use Obesity and unhealthy diets – having the word “fatty” in the name can promote this idea What can also add to the stigma is that liver disease is: A silent disease without obvious symptoms, so people may believe you can’t be as sick as you say you are A chronic disease, and people with chronic diseases who don’t get better can make people uncomfortable Liver disease stigma is such a problem that one study showed almost 30% of people with the disease didn’t tell their friends and family members about it. Another study said it was over 50% who didn’t share that information. Many who do share information about their liver disease feel they must clarify that their disease wasn’t caused by alcohol."

It may sound too simple, but it really can help if you schedule worry time. Rather than allowing the thoughts to crowd your head constantly, pick a time of day and length of time and for when you are going to think about these things. There’s no right time of day, but avoid doing it just before bed since the stress may  make it hard for you to fall asleep."
