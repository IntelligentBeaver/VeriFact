        "Positive support from family and friends can improve your body image and make you less likely to eat in an unhealthy way. Before the holiday season starts, talk to people you plan to spend time with. Tell them about your binge eating disorder , if you haven't already, and ask them to help you avoid your triggers. Tell them that negative comments don’t help. Suggest that they keep their comments positive and encouraging.",
        "2. Create a Holiday Eating Plan",

Talk about the foods that you expect to see. (Ask the hosts ahead of time if you're not sure.)Then, write up your holiday plan: Think about where and what you'll eat, how you'll limit portion sizes , and how you'll stop eating when you should. In some cases, you might decide to skip an event to avoid temptation or stress."
