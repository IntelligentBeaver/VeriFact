        "Found in lentils, garbanzo beans, brown rice, and certain other carbs, this type of starch resists digestion in the small intestine. It passes through your body without entering your bloodstream and breaking down into glucose (blood sugar) like other foods.",
        "This starch works, in part, by making you feel full. The authors claim it also promotes fat-burning, and helps keep your blood sugar levels in check.",
        "You eat a lot of resistant starch on this plan: two to three times as much as most people eat.",
        "In your first week on the diet, you get only 1,200 calories per day -- and you’ll lose up to 6 pounds, say authors Ellen Kunes (editor-in-chief of Health magazine) and Frances Largeman-Roth, RD.",
        "After that, you’ll eat 1,600 calories in three meals and two snacks per day, with a \"carb star\" at every meal."

        "Is It Good for Certain Conditions?",
        "If you have diabetes, choosing high-fiber, complex carbs over simple ones will help keep blood sugar levels steady and help the body use glucose more effectively. But the diet’s emphasis on carbs may be at odds with your diabetes treatment plan. Talk to your doctor or dietitian first to be sure this diet fits into your plan.",
        "As for other conditions, losing excess weight, eating fiber-rich carbs, and avoiding high-fat dairy are also your best bets to lower cholesterol and boost heart health.",
        "Since no food is off limits on this plan, though, you’ll need to choose carefully to make sure you don’t go over your sodium, fat, or cholesterol limits.",
        "The Final Word",
        "With the CarbLovers Diet , you’ll be able to eat the foods you want as long as you keep your calories in check and follow the plan’s rules.",
        "The diet also helps you make lifestyle changes that can get your eating habits on the right track. But you’ll still need to make many healthy choices on your own.",
        "If you prefer dining out to cooking at home, you may find it hard to stick with the plan.",
        "If you haven’t already been eating a lot of high-fiber carbs, start slowly. Otherwise you might feel bloated and gassy until your system gets used to the fiber.",
