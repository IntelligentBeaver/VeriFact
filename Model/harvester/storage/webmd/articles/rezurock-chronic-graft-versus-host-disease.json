        "Graft versus host disease is a condition that can occur in people who have received a stem cell or bone marrow transplant from a donor, usually for the treatment of blood cancers or certain other disorders. As the name suggests, this condition occurs when the cells in the donated tissues (the “graft”) attack the healthy cells of the person who received the transplant (the “host”).",

Chronic GvHD typically appears more than 100 days after the transplant and, in some cases, may not appear until many years later. About 40%-50% of people who receive a donated stem cell or bone marrow transplant will develop this condition, although certain people are at a higher risk than others."
