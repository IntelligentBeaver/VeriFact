Scientists use them to deliver genetic information to your cells that helps your body mount an immune defense, which protects you against diseases.

        "Like adenoviruses, coronaviruses are spread from person to person and can cause similar respiratory symptoms. But they belong to different virus families and are different in other ways. Coronaviruses are less resistant to disinfectants. So adenoviruses spread more easily."
