        "Lactose Malabsorption Versus Lactose Intolerance",
        "Did you know that you can poorly digest lactose and still feel normal? Lactose malabsorption occurs when you don't produce enough lactase enzyme to digest lactose, but you may not notice symptoms. Lactose intolerance, however, occurs when lactose malabsorption leads to digestive upset, such as gas, bloating, or diarrhea, typically 2-8 hours later. If you've been diagnosed with lactase deficiency but don't notice any dairy aftermath, enjoy it freely. If you’re intolerant, there are practical solutions available."
