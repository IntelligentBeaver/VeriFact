        "Bartonella quintana causes a disease called trench fever, a name that comes from the original discovery of the disease. In 1915, allied soldiers in the trenches of the Western Front began to succumb to an outbreak. While the illness they encountered rarely caused death, it was still severe enough that it took many soldiers out of commission. It was the soldiers who coined the term “trench fever.”",
        "Because this disease thrived in the summer but became less common in the winter, doctors first suggested that it might be carried by mosquitoes. Captain T. Strethill Wright, though, suggested that lice or fleas could be responsible. These pests were common in the poor sanitary conditions of the war trenches. By 1917, scientists had concluded that body lice were the culprit.",
        "Once the source was found, the military sprung into action to control the lice populations in their trenches. They started with strip searches each week and baths every other week, eventually moving on to using hot air and a pest control paste to rid the soldiers of body lice.",
        "The American military recorded only 743 cases of trench fever in their troops, but between the Belgian, British, and French soldiers, it’s estimated that about 500,000 cases of trench fever occurred between 1915 and 1918."
