        "Having been diagnosed with additional conditions in the midst of cancer treatment was extremely difficult. Type 1 diabetes and adrenal insufficiency are life-altering diagnoses in themselves, but to know that your cancer battle was not yet over and you were introduced to two new diagnoses was extremely hard.",
        "The best way I can describe how I was feeling is when you fall and you’re trying to get up and you just keep losing your balance, you’re discouraged, tired, and frustrated. I know I want to get up, but my body is not cooperating. I went through so many emotions in the span of the week that I was at the hospital recovering from being in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and an adrenal crisis. By the time of my discharge, I had accepted that my life forever changed. Although my cancer diagnosis had already done that, I guess it was just something that I didn’t want to think about or process and now I absolutely had to because my life depended on it. At that point, it was important not only to me to understand my conditions but those around me too."

And the permanent damage to my pancreas and adrenal glands due to the cancer treatment I received is also something that I have also accepted. With that, there have been many changes and shifts in priorities in my lifestyle that I hope help enhance my quality of life.",

After all, you’re attempting to perform like an organ that essentially is supposed to automatically complete a certain task. Although we can’t take breaks, don’t be so hard on yourself. If you are struggling, reach out to your doctors and come up with a plan together. I am constantly on the lookout for new technology as I know medicine is always advancing and there are several devices that can help monitor or manage your treatment."

Another thing I’d like to mention is I know that devices and the latest and greatest medications can also be very expensive. So be sure to contact the manufacturer to see if they have a discount program or coupons to help with the costs. If costs are a factor, make sure to also mention this to your medical provider as they may have knowledge of programs that help with costs or can help by prescribing a generic form of a certain medication if available.",

That’s where having a good relationship with your medical team comes into play. Being able to communicate, trust and advocate for yourself is also extremely important. Don’t forget about your mental health as this too is extremely important and is part of your overall health."
