        "For some, getting enough sleep is a sought-after idea and nothing more. Being satisfied with shut-eye can escape even the best of us. Sometimes it requires team effort. Sleeping well for at least 7 hours a night (as experts suggest for adults) is the best way to be fresh and alert for the next day. “My parents made sure we kept a bedtime when we were growing up,” said Jharen Nelson, a recent college graduate and health administrator. “When I went to college, I kept it up because I knew I wouldn’t function well the next day without it.” While feeling ready for the day is a huge benefit, experts note there are many other benefits to getting your sleep, such as: A p ositive mood A h ealthy heart Controlled blood sugar A s tronger immune system Less stress Better athleticism Maintaining a h ealthy weight Mental clarity and good memory But it can be a lot easier said than done.

        "It’s crucial that you take control of your screen time. Our sleep and wake cycle is controlled by something called a circadian rhythm . When the sun is up (or light is around), it tells our brains to stay awake, whereas sundown means it’s time to sleep. Too much screen time is a problem for all ages. We bring tech (with lit screens) to bed – there are always emails to read, recipes to save, and social media giggles to have. That said, bedtime isn’t a good time for scrolling. “We did a nationwide poll and found that keeping phones out of bed was the behavior people were least willing to do,” said Joseph Dzierzewski, PhD, vice president of research and scientific affairs at the National Sleep Foundation and a licensed clinical psychology professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. Studies show that 2 out of 3 teens, for example, get less than the amount of sleep they should get. “This is probably one of the biggest areas for sleep improvement,” said Dzierzewski."

        "How can you stay active if you’re sleep-deprived? Get moving, experts say. It can be tough to start or maintain an exercise program when you’re exhausted , but you’ll sleep better. Experts agree getting at least 30 minutes of activity several times per week can help you fall asleep faster and sleep deeper. Two tips: Find an exercise program you can stick to, and try not to exercise too close to bedtime. The increase in body temperature and release of endorphins (happy brain chemicals) can keep you awake. Sip and snack wisely. It might be tempting to have a glass of wine or a steaming cup of coffee before bed, but don’t do it! “Alcohol, nicotine, caffeine , and heavy meals too close to bedtime can disrupt sleep,” said Dzierzewski. Stick to no alcohol, caffeine, or large meals at least 2 hours before bedtime. Watch out for hidden caffeine, too, like in chocolate, some desserts, and even some teas. While sleep seems like a very personal thing, it can truly take a village to adopt new sleeping habits. No matter what family structure you have, working with the people in your household can help you develop a routine that’ll set your sleep straight."

How can you get your sleep when you’re living with a person or people who just don’t get it? “I would tell my friends that I was heading to bed. They would stay up, but I wouldn’t,” said Nelson. “Now, they expect that if it’s after 9 p.m., I probably won’t answer the phone.” For roommates, whether temporary or long-term, try the following: Share the benefits . “If someone doesn’t know the benefits of good sleep, they won’t know why playing the drums at 3 a.m. is n’t a good idea if roommates are trying to sleep,” said Dzierzewski.
