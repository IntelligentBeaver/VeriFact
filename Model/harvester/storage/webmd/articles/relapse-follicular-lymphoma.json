Your doctor might also check whether your cancer has gone through a change, or transformation. Follicular lymphoma can change from a slow-growing type to a fast-growing type. That only happens in about 2% to 3% of people with this cancer. If that happens, it can affect your outcome and you may need more aggressive treatment."
