        "Research shows that people with HS are nearly three times as likely to have depression . They also have double the risk of having anxiety. \"Hidradenitis suppurativa can wear you down mentally,\" says Steve Daveluy, MD, a professor and program director at Wayne State University Department of Dermatology in Detroit. You may feel embarrassed or upset by your symptoms. The flares cause unsightly bumps, sores, and scars, usually in the armpits, groin , buttocks, and breasts. They burst and can leak blood and a stinky pus, so you may stress about it leaking onto your clothes and smelling bad. You also have to live with chronic pain . The bumps can cause itching , throbbing, burning, and shooting sensations. \"It feels like having a golf ball covered in spikes beneath your skin, which hurts every time you move,\" says Melonie Brown, a patient and the secretary of Hope for HS, a nonprofit patient advocacy and support group. This can make it hard to exercise, sleep, and work."
