        "Jan. 19, 2024 – A new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association presents hopeful findings about pregnancy among young breast cancer survivors whose genes not only carry a heightened cancer risk, but also risks of fertility problems. Among the nearly 5,000 women in the study, 22% became pregnant, most of them did so naturally, and for most, there was no evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer returning after pregnancy.",
        "Researchers have sought to better evaluate the impact of pregnancy on breast cancer recurrence among carriers of BRCA gene mutations because reproductive counseling for the women can be complicated. The study authors noted that many women fear passing BRCA gene mutations to their children. The women’s genes can also impact reproductive factors like ovarian reserve, or the reproductive potential of their ovaries based on the quantity and quality of their eggs. Many affected women proactively have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed due to a heightened risk of ovarian cancer , thus creating a narrow window of time to become pregnant between breast cancer treatment and preventive surgery."

        "Published last month, the findings showed a nearly identical risk of breast cancer recurrence among BRCA carriers who became pregnant, compared to those who did not. It’s the first large study to provide evidence of the safety of pregnancy among this group, said lead author Matteo Lambertini MD, PhD, noting that the only other study was a “very, very small” one from about 10 years ago.",
        "The new analysis included 4,732 women age 40 or younger who had early-stage breast cancer and carried gene mutations known as BRCA1 or BRCA2, which are highly predictive of a woman developing breast cancer. During about an 8-year follow-up period, the researchers compared the breast cancer recurrence rate among the 659 women who became pregnant to that of the 4,073 who did not. The average age at diagnosis of breast cancer was 35 years old.",
        "About 1 in 5 women in the study got pregnant within 10 years of diagnosis, although the pregnancy rate may not be an accurate measure of the odds of getting pregnant because it’s not known from the study how many were trying to do so. The women who got pregnant tended to be younger at cancer diagnosis, and the median age at delivery was just under 35. About 1 in 5 of the pregnancies involved assisted reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization , while the other 4 of 5 pregnancies occurred without medical assistance."

        "The authors cautioned that the analysis did reveal some differences in risks based on whether a woman had the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, which could be related to specific things about the type of breast cancer a woman had. The BRCA2 carriers tended to have a higher recurrence rate, and they also were more likely to have cancer sensitive to hormones like estrogen . But when researchers looked at all of the women in the study who had hormone-sensitive cancer, there was no overall increased risk of recurrence, ultimately suggesting that reproductive counseling for BRCA carriers should be individualized, based on the details of each person’s specific cancer diagnosis.",
        "“Overall, I would say this study shows pregnancy is safe, but for patients with a BRCA2 mutation, I would be a bit more cautious,” Lambertini said, noting that he may advise his own BRCA2 patients who have hormone-sensitive cancer to first have 5 years of specialized hormone therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence, such as taking the drug tamoxifen , before deciding to try to get pregnant."
