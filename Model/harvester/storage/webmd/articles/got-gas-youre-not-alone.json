        "Burping, belching, farting, tooting – call it what you want, but everyone does it. That’s because we all have trapped gas in our intestinal tract. Most people pass gas between 13 and 21 times every day either through the mouth or the rectum. Lifestyle habits, particularly diet, influence how much you burp or fart, and excessive gas may signal certain medical conditions.",
        "Where Gas Comes From",
        "Some common medications, such as statins to control cholesterol, omeprazole for gastric reflux disease, antidepressants, and antihistamines, can result in gas. But for the most part, intestinal gas comes from two sources: swallowed air, and the breakdown of undigested food in your large intestine.",
        "The air you swallow, usually while eating and drinking, can be belched back or it can travel all the way to the large intestine and cause flatulence, commonly called farting. Gulping your food, chewing gum, sucking on hard candies, drinking carbonated beverages, and smoking cause you to swallow air and may lead to excessive burping or farting, or both."
