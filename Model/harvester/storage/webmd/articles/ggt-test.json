        "Getting your blood drawn for a GGT blood test is as simple as rolling up your sleeve. But your doctor may suggest some extra steps to help you get ready and make sure you get the most accurate results. “It’s important for patients to talk to their doctors about all medications – including over-the-counter medications and supplements – that they are taking because they may affect the result,” Cloe says. Your doctor might ask you to stop taking certain medications that could affect GGT levels. Cloe says that ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications, antidepressants, antibiotics, and medications used to prevent blood clots can affect GGT levels. Seizure medications – including carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin – could increase GGT levels, while birth control pills and clofibrate can cause decreased GGT levels. But do not stop taking any medications unless your doctor tells you to. Even small amounts of alcohol can increase GGT levels. It’s important not to drink alcohol for at least 24 hours before the GGT test, Cloe says. How much does a GGT test cost?",
