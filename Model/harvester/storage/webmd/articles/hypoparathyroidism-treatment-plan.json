        "There are a few options when it comes to treating this condition. Your doctor will help you find the best ones for you. You might have to try a few before you find a treatment that works well. Your hypoparathyroidism care plan might include: Calcium supplements. Your doctor might have you take calcium supplements in a tablet, a liquid, or a chewable form. This can help boost the calcium levels in your blood and help with your hypoparathyroidism. Vitamin D. This vitamin can help your body absorb calcium and get rid of phosphorus. For hyperparathyroidism, doctors may give you calcitriol (Rocaltrol ). This is a prescription medication. It contains active vitamin D, which is different from a regular vitamin D supplement that you’d buy at the store."

This means that your body flushes out too much calcium. If either of these happens, your doctor might adjust your dose of vitamin D and calcium or put you on thiazide diuretics. These will help your body keep the calcium out of your urine and absorb it back into your blood. This can help reduce the risks of calcium deposits in your kidneys or kidney stones. Magnesium supplements. If you have low magnesium levels with hypoparathyroidism, talk to your doctor about a magnesium supplement. This kind of treatment can help give your body the correct amount of magnesium. Palopegteriparatide (Yorvipath ) injections. Palopegteriparatide, which is a a synthetic form of the human parathyroid hormone, was approved by the FDA to treat hypoparathyroidism in adults. It's given as a daily shot and designed to help you maintain normal levels of calcium for 24 hours. But there are risks, including your blood calcium levels becoming too high (hypercalcemia), rare bone cancer (based on findings in rats), dizziness when standing, and drug interactions."
