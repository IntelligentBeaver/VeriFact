First, you'll get medicine to make you fall asleep. Then, your doctor will put the paddles on your chest, and sometimes your back. These will give you a mild electrical shock to get your heart's rhythm back to normal. Most people only need one. Because you’re sedated, you probably won’t remember being shocked. You can usually go home the same day. Your skin may be irritated where the paddles touched it. Your doctor can recommend a lotion to ease pain or itching ."
