Then sophisticated AI algorithms evaluate that scanned data to diagnose serious skin cancers, including melanoma . There's also an app called SkinVision that allows you to take a picture of your own mole; it then uses a computer algorithm to try and give you an assessment of that mole."

Being able to monitor these kinds of changes is extremely valuable when it comes time to make a diagnosis. On the other hand, apps that try to make diagnoses without a dermatologist are currently not very helpful. The accuracy rate is still too low, but the technology is improving."
