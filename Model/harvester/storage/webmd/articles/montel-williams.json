        "In 2000, he created Mountain Movers Press, to publish the thoughts and views of today's forward thinkers.

He is also the author of the New York Times best seller, Mountain, Get Out Of My Way , an autobiographical and motivational book. He co-authored the books Practical Parenting and Body Change , a New York Times best selling fitness book. He is also donating a portion of proceeds from his latest book, Climbing Higher , a chronicle of his struggle to live a vital and productive life while facing the challenges of MS.",

        "In 1999, Williams was presented with a PRISM Award, receiving the Larry Stewart Leadership and Inspiration Award from the Entertainment Industries Council for serving as a role model for the entertainment industry. His concern and dedication to the The Montel Williams Show and its guests are evidenced by his creation of the show's After-Care Program started in 1992. The program has arranged for many guests to attend psychological counseling sessions, weight-loss programs, drug rehabilitation centers, motivational camps and treatment for eating disorders.",

He has appeared off-Broadway in The Exonerated , a play about men and women who have been exonerated from death row. He remains committed to his roots as a motivational speaker and continues to reach out to groups across the country with messages of hope and inspiration on how to move life's mountains. He also advocates for animal rights, speaks out for teen empowerment, has supported veterans' causes and anti-drug initiatives. Williams is very passionate about the many causes he embraces. He tries to live by one of his favorite quotes from Winston Churchill, \"We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give.\"",
