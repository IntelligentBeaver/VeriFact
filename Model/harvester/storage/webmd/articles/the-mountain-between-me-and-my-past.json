        "I stood at the top of the mountain in downtown Taormina, Sicily, debating how to get back to my hotel. I had just run into some friends who told me they had walked here, indicating walking as a legitimate means of transportation. It was well over 90 degrees, and I had multiple shopping bags, but time was on my side, and I was always looking for an adventure. Google maps said the nearest train was a 19-minute walk, so do I do a €5 train ride or a €50 taxi ride? The answer was obvious; I began walking toward the train. AirPods in, Lorde’s new album playing, my recent retail therapy, and the beautiful Italian coast set the perfect vibe. About five minutes in I realized what I thought was a “walk” was actually a hike down the mountain on a secluded path. Sure, there were some stairs and a relatively paved walkway, but it was narrow with many turns and, overall, not much stability. Most people would’ve turned around. When my mom hears this, she will probably scold me. But instead of turning around, I kept going. By the time I made it to the bottom, my foot was bleeding from blisters, and I was dripping sweat. I arrived at the train station, panting, legs shaking, and arms burning. I looked for a bench to sit on and found a single seat in between a few families with younger children. I smiled at the group and plopped down right in the middle of them. My body didn’t really have a choice but to sit down at that point. After striking up a conversation with the parents, I realized most had either opted to take a cab down the mountain or a cable car. After confessing that I hiked down, I felt ridiculous. Of course, I didn’t know that a cable car was an option. And yes, I could technically afford the taxi, but saving €50 was a much better option. But still, I chose to do an objectively tough hike down a mountain in the heat, without proper shoes, and carrying multiple shopping bags. Why? Perhaps the reason was almost as ridiculous as the hike was. Maybe I just wanted to prove that I could do it. To show to myself that my MS doesn’t get in the way of my independence. It feels like ever since I failed the neurological exam during my second flare, I have been chasing after a feeling. It was during my second hospitalization; a neurology resident was conducting a physical exam to test my muscle strength. The resident would lightly push my legs down with her hands, and it was my job to stop her from succeeding. To my complete shock and horror, I was too weak to stop her from pushing my legs down. I made her try multiple times until I could believe what was happening right in front of me. Nearly three years later, I still find myself chasing the feeling that, despite my MS, I am not weak."

Most people don’t realize the hardships I had to overcome in order to get to the part in my life where I can have “too much fun.” Perhaps the fun and independence I am chasing is an attempt to outweigh the pain of the past.

If I had looked around for a bit longer, I probably would have discovered the cable car! With an abundance mindset, I would have explored a third option instead of limiting myself to two objectively bad options (a hike and an overpriced taxi ride)."
