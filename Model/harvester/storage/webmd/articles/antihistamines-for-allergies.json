These are over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications that block histamine, a chemical that causes your body to develop allergic symptoms such as sneezing, itching, a runny nose, and hives."

Sometimes, you may also get an itchy rash on your skin called hives.",

Like antihistamines, doctors usually recommend that you start them a few weeks before your allergy season. There’s also a prescription steroid and antihistamine nasal spray called azelastine (Dymista) that seems to improve allergy symptoms more than either drug when used alone."
