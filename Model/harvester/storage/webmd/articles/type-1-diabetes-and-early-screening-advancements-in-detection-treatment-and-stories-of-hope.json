        "Oct. 31, 2024 -- Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, making early screening crucial for those at risk. But how do we know who is at risk? When should we screen? And what steps can we take to protect ourselves and our loved ones? In this episode, we spoke with Jeremy Pettus, MD , a board-certified endocrinologist specializing in treating diabetes and host of the Taking Control of Your Diabetes podcast , about diagnostic methods, such as blood sugar and A1C tests, the crucial role of early detection, screening recommendations, advancements in diabetes management, and his hope for the future of stem cell therapies. We also hear a powerful story from Samara, known as theT1Dmama on YouTube, about her daughter Addie’s diagnosis of type 1 diabetes."

But a blood sugar, if you do a finger stick at home or if you do go to the lab and get a glucose, that tells you what your blood sugar is right that second, which is helpful information. But another piece of information is the A1c test, and everybody who has diabetes or knows somebody with diabetes probably knows what that test is, and it's a reflection of what your blood sugars have been doing over the last two to three months. So it gives you not just what's going on that second, but again, kind of a report card over the last several months.

So if you're listening and you have a relative with type 1 diabetes, or you have type 1, you should recommend to your family members to get screened. And how to do that. Well, there's a number of ways that you can do that. So you can go to your doctor and say, \"I want to get these labs ordered.\" They are covered by insurance. They are a little unfamiliar, so there's a potential that your doctor might not know what they are.",

And if you go on the website, fill out information, they'll actually send you a kit to do at home where you can just essentially prick your finger and put some blood on a card and send it back in. Usually for free, because this is under the research umbrella. And that's a great way to get screened. So you can give your family, friends that website to do that.",

You maybe get to go to your provider twice a year, spend 15 minutes with them. So there's such a need to educate yourself, to empower yourself, because whether you have type 1 or type 2, or whatever you have, it really is a 24/7 job where you're looking at your blood sugars. If they're high, you got to do something. If they're low, you got to do something. How exercise plays into that, sleep, your anxiety level, caffeine, the list goes on and on and on of what we have to stay on top of living with this disease. So I've been really inspired, I think, by the people living with this. There is a lot of hope, there's a lot of camaraderie.",

We can take stem cells and grow them indefinitely, and make enough beta cells to give everybody with diabetes in the world back beta cells. But now we got to figure out the best way to do it safely, because I could take somebody else's beta cells and fuse them into me, but my body would reject it. I'd need these immunosuppressive medications just like I got a kidney transplant or something like that."

And what steps can we take to protect ourselves and our loved ones? In this episode, we spoke with Jeremy Pettus, MD, a board-certified endocrinologist specializing in treating diabetes and host of the Taking Control of Your Diabetes podcast, about diagnostic methods, such as blood sugar and A1C tests, the crucial role of early detection, screening recommendations, advancements in diabetes management, and his hope for the future of stem cell therapies. We also hear a powerful story from Samara, known as theT1Dmama on YouTube, about her daughter Addie’s diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.",
