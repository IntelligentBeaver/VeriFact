        "Yes, if you catch bone cancer before it has a chance to spread to your other organs, it can be cured. This is why it's important to follow-up with your doctor when you have any symptoms that worry you. The earlier you catch it, the easier your treatment process will be and the more likely you are to be cured when you go through treatment.",

        "Survival rates depend on many factors, such as your age, your overall health, the type of bone cancer you have, and the stage of your cancer. Doctors sometimes use a relative survival rate to give you an idea of your outcome. But these are estimates based on large numbers of people who had a specific cancer at a specific stage. This won't tell you what your specific chances of survival are. This is why it's important to talk to your cancer care team about what to expect in your situation.",
        "In general, the outlook for primary bone cancer is good. For instance, the five-year relative survival rate for all primary bone cancers diagnosed at any stage is about 67%. This means that 67% of people who have treatment for primary bone cancer, regardless of the kind of cancer and the stage, will be alive five years after they're diagnosed. Of course, people who are diagnosed before the cancer has spread tend to do better. But new treatments are developed all the time, so people who are diagnosed today may have even better outcomes than these numbers suggest."

It's rare compared with bone cancer that starts elsewhere and spreads to your bones (called secondary or metastatic bone cancer). There are four types of primary bone cancer. Two of these types, chondrosarcoma and chordoma, tend to affect adults older than 40-50 years. The other two types, Ewing's sarcoma and osteosarcoma, tend to affect children and teens more often. Regardless of type, the most common symptom is persistent or unusual pain or swelling in or around the affected area of your bone.
