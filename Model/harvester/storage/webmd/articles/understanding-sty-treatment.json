        "Chalazia, which look like styes but are internal infected oil glands, often disappear on their own too. But it could take a month or more for them to go away.",
        "Most of the time you can treat a stye at home. Apply a warm compress to the affected eye for 10 to 15 minutes 2 to 4 times a day for several days. After applying the compress, use your clean finger or a clean tip to gently massage the inflamed bump to try to unplug the oil gland. Doing this can ease your pain and inflammation and help the stye go away faster.",
        "Keep your eye closed while you use the compress. When the stye comes to a head, keep using the compresses to put pressure on it until it ruptures. Don’t squeeze it -- let it burst on its own. Some styes spread skin infections when they pop. If that happens, you’ll have to take antibiotics ."
