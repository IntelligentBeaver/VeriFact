        "Oct. 30, 2000 -- First thing every morning, Gene Gach checks the 50 or so pots of bromeliads that he keeps along one side of his house. Then he simply stands and enjoys the backyard of his modest Los Angeles home -- the wide, green lawn, the 25-foot stand of Chinese bamboo he grew from a single stalk, and many flowers and rose bushes. On most days a cluster of birds surrounds his bird feeder, along with a small rabbit, whom he is teaching to eat lettuce. Later, Gach will play an 18-hole round of golf, lunch with his wife, and then garden for up to two hours.",
