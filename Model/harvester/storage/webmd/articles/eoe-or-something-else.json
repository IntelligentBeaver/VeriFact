For example, you might have a hard time swallowing or keeping food down, have chest pain that antacids don’t ease, get food stuck in your throat, or other signs that your esophagus isn’t working properly. But even clear-cut symptoms can make EoE tricky to diagnose because they can closely mirror other conditions. The good news is, your doctor can run tests to tease out the right diagnosis and get you on the right path to treatment."

        "EoE happens when too many eosinophilia – a kind of white blood cell – build up and cause swelling in your esophagus, the tube of muscle that sends food from your mouth to your stomach. When the esophagus can’t do its job, you might have problems eating or keeping food down. Other symptoms might include: Stomach pain Heartburn – a burning feeling in the center of your chest – or other chest pain Vomiting even when you try meds for reflux Food getting stuck in your throat (medical emergency) Unlike temporary conditions that might come and go, or only happen sometimes, EoE symptoms are chronic, meaning ongoing. EoE is common in both children and adults, especially males in both populations. It’s seen most in white men in their 20s and 30s."

Proton pump inhibitor-responsive esophageal eosinophilia, aka PPI-REE, is so similar to EoE that some researchers view it as a subtype.

They’re a standard treatment for GERD and have been used in the past to tell it apart from EoE because EoE doesn’t always respond to PPIs. But some people with EoE do respond to PPIs; hence the name PPI-REE. For this reason, PPIs have been made part of the treatment. If they don’t work, your doctor can try another approach."
