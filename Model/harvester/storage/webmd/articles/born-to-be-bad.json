Now research is finally uncovering some of the biological traits that may be the cause of troubled behavior. At the same time, new educational techniques are helping parents steer difficult children away from a path of violence.",
        "About 10% of children are born, like Matthew, with a mix of \"challenging traits,\" says Helen Neville, RN, director of the Inborn Temperament Project at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif. These children are easily frustrated, very sensitive, emotionally intense, and have difficulty coping with change."
