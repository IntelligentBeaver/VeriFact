        "The biggest boost exercise can give to your sex life is to lower your risk of erectile dysfunction, says Jorge Chavarro, MD, of the Harvard School of Public Health. “Exercise that helps open the arteries to benefit your heart will also increase blood flow to the penis ,” he says.",
        "One Harvard study of more than 31,000 men found that physically active men over age 50 were less likely to be impotent than inactive men. The exercisers had better erections, and those who were most active saw the most benefit.",
