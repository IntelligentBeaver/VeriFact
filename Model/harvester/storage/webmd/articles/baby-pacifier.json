Silicone nipples are sturdier, don't retain odors, and are easy to clean, says Rosado, while latex nipples are softer and retain scents (which your baby may like) but are not as sturdy with repeated washings. Regardless of your (or your baby's) preference, check that the pacifier is dishwasher-safe and that the nipple is securely attached to the base. \"Give it a good tug, to make sure the nipple does not detach,\" Rosado says. Avoid pacifiers that have a gel or liquid filling, which is potentially harmful.",
