        "Uncontrolled blood sugar, or blood glucose, is a level that's outside of a healthy target range. It usually refers to blood sugar that's too high, which is a symptom of diabetes. Both extremely high and extremely low blood sugar are dangerous.",
        "Glucose is the main source of energy for your cells. You get most of it from carbohydrates in the things you eat and drink. When you eat, your body releases the hormone insulin, which helps your cells absorb glucose. People with diabetes aren't able to manage their blood glucose effectively because either their bodies don't make enough insulin ( type 1 diabetes ) or their cells don't respond to insulin ( type 2 diabetes ).",
