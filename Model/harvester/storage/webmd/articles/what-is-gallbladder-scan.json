        "Pain in your upper right belly a couple of hours after a large or fatty meal is one of the first signs that you may have gallstones. To figure it out, your doctor may want you to have a test called a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan. It's also known as cholescintigraphy or hepatobiliary scintigraphy. A HIDA scan shows how well your biliary tract is working, especially your gallbladder.",
        "Your doctor may use a HIDA scan to check how bile moves from your liver through your gallbladder to your small intestine. (Photo Credit: VectorMine/Dreamstime)",
        "Your biliary tract is a system of organs and ducts that makes, stores, and moves digestive juices (bile and pancreatic enzymes) to your small intestine to help you break down and absorb the nutrients in your food. It's made up of your liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas, and small intestine. Most of the organs of your biliary tract are in your upper belly.",
        "Since the organs in your biliary tract are important for digestion and so closely connected, anything that stops or slows the flow of bile will likely affect your whole digestive system. A HIDA scan can help your doctor figure out what's causing your symptoms."
