        "TENS , or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, is a pain relief method that uses mild electrical currents to block pain signals or change how you perceive them. It's used for back pain and for pain associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia .",
        "TENS is typically done with a TENS unit, a small battery-operated device. Some TENS devices are used in medical clinics, while others are used at home. The devices have wires connected to sticky pads called electrodes. The pads go on your skin in the area that hurts. When the machine is turned on, the electrodes carry low-voltage electric currents from the TENS machine to your body.",
        "Despite 50 years of research, scientists still aren't sure how — or even if — TENS really works. While doctors and patients often report that pain eases during treatment, patients differ on whether there are any lasting effects.",
        "If TENS does work, it may be because the electrical currents stimulate nerve cells that block pain signals. Or the treatment may trigger your body to release pain-killing chemicals called endorphins .",

One review of four studies comparing real TENS treatments to placebo versions (usually using TENS-like devices without electricity) found conflicting evidence on whether TENS was any better than the fake treatments at making lower back pain less intense.",

It's considered an alternative treatment that might help when exercise, medication, or other standard treatments aren't enough.
