        "Melanoma can spread to parts of your body far away from where the cancer started. This is called advanced, metastatic, or stage IV melanoma . It can move to your lungs, liver, brain, bones, digestive system , and lymph nodes . Most people find their skin cancer early, before it has spread. But others find out they have the disease when it’s in an advanced stage. Some people find out it has spread after they’ve had a melanoma removed, sometimes years later.",
        "Melanoma spreads when the tumor's cells travel through your body's tissues, blood, or lymph nodes. They can settle in your organs and keep growing there. They can do this because they’re sneaky. Every day, your body makes cells that have potential to turn into cancerous cells. Normally, they don’t make it past “checkpoints” in your immune system, which destroys them. But melanoma cells can use these checkpoints to avoid attack."
