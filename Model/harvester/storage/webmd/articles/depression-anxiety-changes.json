        "Depression and anxiety are very common, and they often go hand in hand. They don’t just affect your teen's mood. They can change how they think, sleep, eat, and connect with people. Anxiety can make them feel tense or stuck in thir head. Depression can drain their energy and make it hard to enjoy anything. Both can leave your teen feeling physically off and mentally foggy. It’s easy to blame stress, hormones, or just a bad day. But if things don’t get better after a couple of weeks or they start to affect your teen's daily life, it’s worth digging deeper. Knowing what to look for can help you figure out what’s going on and how to get help for your teen.."

But because it doesn’t always look like sadness, it’s often missed. Your teen may have a low-level sense of dread or a constant stream of “what if” thoughts. They may not even know what they're worried about, but they feel like something bad might happen. You may also notice they have: Constant worry about their health, school, or relationships Trouble feeling safe, even in familiar situations Tense muscles or tightness in their chest Waking up with a racing heart or sense of panic (called nocturnal panic attacks) It’s natural to worry about yourself. But if your teen's anxiety never goes away or it seems too big for the situation, it could mean they need support."
