        "Inherited metabolic disorders are genetic conditions that result in metabolism problems. Most people with inherited metabolic disorders have a defective gene that results in lack of an enzyme. According to the latest count, 1,564 of these disorders have been identified. There are hundreds of different genetic metabolic disorders, also known as “inborn errors of metabolism.”",
        "“The impact of the disorders can vary markedly from very severe to mild depending on the type of disorder that one inherits,” says Timothy Tramontana, MD, a specialist in medical genetics at the Cleveland Clinic Center for Personalized Genetic Healthcare in Cleveland, OH.",
        "Each of these inherited metabolic disorders is individually very rare. However, when considered together, they’re not so uncommon. Christina Tise, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medical genetics at Stanford Medicine in Stanford, CA, estimates that about 1 in 100 babies are born with some type of inherited metabolic disorder. But the exact number remains unknown, she adds.",
        "“It is hard to really know the prevalence of these conditions because newborn screening only screens for a small handful of the conditions we know about,” Tise says. “It is for sure a group of genetic conditions that are underrecognized. Also the definition is not clear, and many inherited metabolic disorders are yet to be identified, are under-diagnosed, and have considerable variation in age of onset from fetus/neonate to adult.”",
        "Other factors also make it hard to get a correct count. For example, many fetuses, infants, and children with such disorders will die before they are diagnosed, Tise says. And if a disorder doesn’t cause symptoms until adulthood, she adds, it may not be correctly diagnosed. Why? “They are seen as pediatric disorders even though they affect people at all ages,” Tise says."
