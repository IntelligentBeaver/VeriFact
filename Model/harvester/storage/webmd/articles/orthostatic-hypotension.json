        "When a person moves from lying down to standing, sometimes their blood pressure will suddenly drop and they will feel lightheaded. This is called orthostatic hypotension and is common in people with Parkinson's disease. Orthostatic hypotension can be severe in people with certain forms of the disease. Orthostatic hypotension can be caused by the disease itself or by the medications used to treat Parkinson's disease. Almost any of the commonly prescribed Parkinson's disease drugs can cause or worsen lightheadedness."

        "Not all forms of orthostatic hypotension require treatment. If you experience a drop in blood pressure when you stand up, but have no other symptoms you probably won't need treatment.

But, if you feel dizzy or lightheaded to the point where you might lose your balance or lose consciousness, you will need treatment.",

If you have significant symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, and it is not possible to change your medications , then your doctor will likely treat the orthostatic hypotension itself."
