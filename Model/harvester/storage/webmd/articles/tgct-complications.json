        "When a TGCT begins to grow in a joint, it can affect three different parts: Synovium, the thin lining on the inner surface of the joint Bursae, the small, fluid-filled sacs that provide a cushion between the joints and tendons Tendon sheath, the thin lining surrounding the tendons As the tumor grows, it causes tissue in your joint to thicken, swell, or make extra fluid. This puts pressure on the cartilage (tissue that acts as a shock absorber in your joints and protects the bones from rubbing together) and the bone surrounding the joint. If the tumor continues to grow, the cartilage starts to wear away. Eventually, the bones start to rub together, causing arthritis."

How much physical therapy and rehabilitation you will need depends on how severe the tumor was, where it was, and how extensive the surgery was. Arthroscopic surgery (also called arthroscopy) is a type of surgery that uses smaller incisions and special tools and a camera, usually has a shorter recovery and rehabilitation time than an open surgery. Open surgeries use a larger incision so the surgeon can see inside the joint.",

        "Rehabilitation should start within 1 or 2 days if there are no complications or issues that prevent you from starting. At the very least, you will likely have to do some range-of-motion exercises so you can use your joint again. Range-of-motion exercises help your joint: Get stronger Increase or improve endurance Maintain and increase its current range-of-motion These exercises can also promote circulation and blood flow to the area. If your surgery was on a weight-bearing joint like your hip or knee, you will need other exercises to make sure you’re up and about again. You might need a special machine called a continuous passive motion (CPM) machine. This is a device that helps your leg move without putting extra pressure on the joint, helping reduce or prevent your joint from becoming stiff and developing scars in the joint – joint adhesions. How your doctor chooses to treat you depends on many factors. Any type of therapy to treat TGCT could cause a complication, but not everyone experiences complications. It's important that you speak with your doctor so you can understand the issues involved and what your risks are so you can make an informed decision."
