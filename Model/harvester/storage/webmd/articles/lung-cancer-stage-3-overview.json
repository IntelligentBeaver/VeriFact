Depending on how progressed it is, cancer at this stage may have also spread to nearby lymph nodes and tissue. The diagnosis is serious, but treatments for stage III lung cancer, including chemotherapy , radiation , and surgery, may be able to improve your outlook. If you smoke now or have smoked heavily in the last 15 years, talk with your doctor to see if you're a good candidate for yearly lung cancer screening.",
