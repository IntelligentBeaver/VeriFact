        "Kyphosis is a condition in which your upper spine curves forward more than usual. Your spine is made up of three sections: the cervical spine, lumbar spine, and thoracic spine. When you look at a spine from the side, you can see three natural curves in these sections. These curves are necessary for you to stay upright and balanced.",
        "A healthy spine has some natural curve at the top and bottom to keep you balanced an upright. But when you have kyphosis, your spine curves forward more than is typical. (Photo Credit: PIKOVIT/Science Source)",
        "Typically, the C-shaped curve in your thoracic spine — the section in your upper and mid-back — curves about 20 to 45 degrees. But with kyphosis, it curves more than 50 degrees. This will make you look slouched or hunched over. This is why doctors sometimes call kyphosis \"round back,\" or in serious cases, \"hunchback.\"",
        "If you have mild kyphosis, this may not cause any problems aside from your upper back looking more rounded. But it can get worse over time, which can cause symptoms such as back pain , trouble keeping your balance, or breathing problems.",
        "If the curve gets worse, hurts, or makes you uncomfortable with your appearance, your doctor can fix it. The type of treatment you need depends on your age, the kind of kyphosis you have, and how it affects you.",

In some cases, the curve may be enough to cause symptoms, such as back pain, trouble balancing, or even trouble breathing. If you need treatment, there are lots of options, such as NSAIDs, physical therapy, back bracing, surgery, or a combination."

For instance, if you have postural kyphosis, you can likely fix it by strengthening your core muscles and working to improve your posture. However, if you have Scheuermann's kyphosis or congenital kyphosis, you may need physical therapy or surgery. But regardless, all treatments will take some time to achieve results.",
