        "In every issue of WebMD the Magazine , we ask our experts to answer readers' questions about a wide range of topics. In our September issue of WebMD Baby , we asked one of WebMD's baby care experts, Sara DuMond, MD, about the best ways to keep her baby out of harm's way in her room.",
        "Q: How should I babyproof my nursery?",
        "A: To start, be sure that your crib's bars are no more than 2 3/8 inches apart (so your baby doesn't get caught between them) and that your crib does not have a drop-side rail (so your baby doesn't get trapped between the crib rail and the mattress).",
        "Keep pillows, blankets, and loose stuffed animals out of the crib until your baby is at least 6 months old as they can suffocate her (you can keep her warm with thick pajamas when she's sleeping). Be sure the mattress fits snugly against the crib sides. And although they're adorable, it's best to forego crib bumpers . Young babies can suffocate in them, and older babies step on them to climb out of their cribs."
