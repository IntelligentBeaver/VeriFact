Due to this unexpected side effect, topical minoxidil came to the market in the late ‘80s and was a popular hair growth solution for both men and women.",

The enzyme activity is hard to predict from person to person and typically requires a failed trial of topical minoxidil for 6 months. Topical minoxidil can be compounded with products like tretinoin, which can increase the expression of follicular sulfotransferase."

At the molecular level, minoxidil helps to shift hairs into the growing phase, increase the growth phase (thick, longer hair!), and increase hair follicle size. Medication is needed to maintain these shifts and once discontinued, the effects of the medications are reversed. This results in a “shedding” that returns the hair to pre-minoxidil condition.
