Dogs are usually very social animals. But how much time they like to spend with other dogs or people can depend on lots of things, such as their age, breed, and health. Some dogs don’t like other dogs or may not have the energy or tolerance for group play. Doggie day care may not be a good option for them. It’s likely not a good option for dogs that “resource guard,” or protect their toys, food, or people by growling. Most day cares and boarding facilities require a temperament test before your dog can stay there. That usually involves introducing them to people and other dogs to make sure they’re friendly with both. Workers will look to see if your dog is stressed or scared while they’re there."

You want to make sure the other dogs your dog might play with are well-socialized and get along with others.

        "When choosing a doggie day care, start by asking your veterinarian , groomer, friends, and family about any facilities they recommend. Ask them what they liked and what kind of experiences their dogs had. When you have a few options our list, call the doggie day care and ask: Can I stop by anytime for a visit so I can see the day care on a normal day? Do they require all dogs to be up-to-date on vaccinations and flea /tick control? Which vaccinations do they require? Is there a required waiting time after your dog gets those? How many dogs play together at any one time? Are they separated by size? Are there both indoor and outdoor play areas in case the weather is bad? How many play areas are there? What training do staff members have? (They should be trained to understand dog body language and how to de-escalate stressful situations.) Do staff members know first aid for dogs? What’s the staff-to-dog ratio? Watching too many dogs at once is hard for both dogs and people. Some organizations recommend a maximum of 10-15 dogs per staff member. Are there webcams so I can check on my dog? What happens if my dog gets sick or hurt? Which vet do they use? Ask about pricing and when dogs can be dropped off and picked up. Are there extra fees if you’re late? What’s the cancellation policy? Is it less expensive to buy a package of day care visits? How long has the facility been in business? Can you talk to other pet parents about why they chose this doggie day care? Many doggie day care facilities offer boarding for overnight stays. If you’re interested in that, ask extra questions, such as: Can I bring bedding, toys, and food from home? If I don’t bring my dog’s food, what food will they get at day care? How often are dogs alone and how often can they play in a group? Where do they sleep? How big is their run or kennel? Does a staff member spend the night at the facility? Do rates include extras such as giving medicine, baths, playtime, or walks?"

They should be watching dogs all the time. Dirtiness or disarray. Poop should be picked up immediately, with pooper scoopers or mop buckets readily available. Fences and gates shouldn’t be rusty, broken, or sagging. Facilities should look and smell clean. No temperament test. Be wary of a day care that doesn’t require a temperament test for new dogs. The test should be done with a dog that’s similar to the size, energy, and play style of your dog.",

Half days are typically less costly than full days of care. Many centers offer packages, so buying 10 or 20 days in advance can reduce the overall cost. In general, day care ranges from about $30 to $60 per day, says Aga. Just be sure to ask if the cost includes everything or if you have to pay extra for things such as nap time, medication, or temperament tests before you can even enroll.
