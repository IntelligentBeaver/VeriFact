        "Omega-3 fatty acids (brand names: Dermapet, Eicosaderm, Welactin, and others) are a dietary supplement for long-term use in dogs and cats. They are also known as fish oil. They are usually used in addition to other medicines to control specific conditions involving inflammation (swelling) of the skin, heart, kidneys, or liver. They can also be used to aid in the treatment of arthritis and neurologic (nerve) issues. In dogs and cats, omega-3 fatty acids help with the control of itching associated with skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis ( eczema ), seborrhea, and eosinophilic granuloma complex, especially when used in combination with other medicines and treatments.",
        "Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are polyunsaturated fatty acids that are not made by the body. They must be gotten from external sources, usually foods. EFAs help with normal cell function. Omega-3 fatty acids are EFAs. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are common omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil.",
        "Dietary supplements are monitored by the FDA in the U.S., but they are not regulated under the same rules as food and medicines are. The FDA does not approve dietary supplements for safety or effectiveness, nor does the FDA approve the product label. These measures are the responsibility of the supplement company. It is important to discuss dietary supplements with your veterinarian . They can help you with product selection and dosing.",
        "Omega-3 fatty acids must be given long-term (weeks to months) before you can tell if they are helping your pet. Fish oil used with antihistamines may have a greater effect when used together than when used separately for itching and allergic skin conditions."
