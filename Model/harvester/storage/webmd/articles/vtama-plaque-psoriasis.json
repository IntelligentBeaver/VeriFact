        "Vtama is a nonsteroidal cream for plaque psoriasis . Plaque psoriasis is a condition where the immune system causes the skin to make too many new cells too quickly. These extra skin cells pile up on the surface, forming thick, raised patches that are often discolored. These patches, called plaques, usually have a white or silvery layer on top. Plaques are often found on areas like the elbows, knees, scalp, or back, but they can show up anywhere on the body. They can be itchy, sore, and sometimes they might crack or bleed.",
        "Vtama, approved in 2022, contains the active ingredient tapinarof. It is a cream that works by targeting specific receptors in the skin cells called aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR).",
