        "I have always been grateful to have been born with my best friend. Being a twin definitely creates a unique and special bond. This bond is unlike any other, hands down, in my book. Yes, we share clothes, shoes, jewelry, and yes, we both share in having psoriasis.",
        "Although my sister’s psoriasis has been milder than mine, we both understand each other's challenges when it comes to the condition. I truly believe having my twin sister has been a saving grace for me with my psoriasis. We’ve had a ready-made, two-person community to connect with and relate to. It is what has helped me in my journey as a mentor for others with psoriasis.",

As the oldest by five minutes, I’m the self-proclaimed leader between me and my sister. We often faced many challenges growing up, like bullying and self-doubt. It was my sister who I leaned on for support."

So many people deal with so much more than the physical aspect of psoriasis. A lot of people are managing depression and may even isolate themselves. Community creates the safe space that is so desperately needed.",

She’s the best Auntie and has even taken my children to activities if needed. With my sister, I don’t even have to say anything is wrong – she can see it since she knows me so well. When she notices something is off, she goes into what she does best: pouring strength into me in any way I may need. It definitely makes the difference for me, especially when I know I can put my Superwoman cape down because she is there for me."
