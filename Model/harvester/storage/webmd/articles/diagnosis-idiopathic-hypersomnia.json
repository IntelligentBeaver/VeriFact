        "One problem with diagnosing IH is that the symptoms -- mainly, the daytime sleepiness, the sleep that isn't refreshing, and the difficulty waking (sometimes called sleep drunkenness) -- can be similar to ones found in many other disorders, including: Circadian rhythm disorder, a disturbance in your internal clock that regulates your sleep Sleep-related breathing problems (like sleep apnea) Narcolepsy , a daytime sleepiness often accompanied by sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis Psychiatric disorders Medical problems (like a head injury) Neurological disorders (like Parkinson's) To determine whether it's IH or another problem that causes your daytime sleepiness, your doctor will look at your symptoms, get a medical history (of you and your family), and do a physical exam. Some medications and combinations of drugs can cause daytime sleepiness, too. So building a complete picture of the medications you take -- and how they may interact with each other -- is an important part of your doctor's search for what's causing your sleepiness. Your health care team may do several tests to rule out those other disorders before moving toward a diagnosis of IH."

Multiple sleep latency test (MLST). You'll often have this right after an overnight sleep study. The test measures how quickly you fall asleep during the day. It takes place in a controlled setting and typically consists of five scheduled naps, separated by 2-hour periods of being awake. You're given 20 minutes to fall asleep for each of the naps.
