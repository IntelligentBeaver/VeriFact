        "Like other vitamins, vitamin D is a substance needed for health but only in tiny amounts. Unlike other vitamins, it doesn't occur naturally in many foods (except seafood, mushrooms, and egg yolks), but can be made in the body. Most people know that humans use sunlight to make vitamin D, the \"sunshine vitamin.\" But modern humans don't get much sunlight, so we end up at the vitamin counter, often confused about what to buy.",
        "Our bodies make vitamin D3, cholecalciferol. At the supplement counter, you can choose from D3 or D2. Vitamin D2 is ergocalciferol, which differs slightly from D3 but behaves the same way in the body. D3 is slightly more potent.",
        "The main difference between the two supplements is how they are made. D3 comes from animal sources, although it can be made from lichen. D2 is derived from plant sources. If you are a vegan or vegetarian , you'll want to read labels closely.",
