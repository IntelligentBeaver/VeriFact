        "Prioritizing good nutrition choices is critical. Our bodies were designed to survive on food and hydration. Malnutrition is believed to lead to being overweight, obesity, and the risk, progression, and treatment of chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and others. I used to think that simply popping a multivitamin once a day was enough to get by. I gave very little thought to how much the food I ate was affecting my health. I eventually learned that nutrition isn’t just about feeding our bodies with any kind of food or vitamin supplement. Actually, it involves making sure we eat an adequate balance of the nutrients that our bodies need for metabolism, growth, reproduction, maintenance, and repair. It blew my mind when I began to understand that the human body requires six basic essential nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water. It made sense for me to begin choosing healthier foods in order to fuel my body with what it needed versus what it craved. Pizza Thursdays versus grilled salmon and sautéed vegetables. A bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit for breakfast every morning versus homemade fresh smoothies. Chocolate chip cookies versus fresh fruit. You get my point. If you have struggled with knowing where to start when it comes to diet, begin by focusing on eating more nutrient-dense food. Again, give your body the nutrition it needs to promote good health. Your body will reap the benefits.",
        "You can’t out-exercise a bad diet. I had to renew my mind when it came to exercise. I used to think that to lose weight, I had to make physical exercise my priority and then focus on nutrition. I would exercise for long hours but still eat some of the same foods that were negatively impacting my health. One of the quickest ways to short-circuit your progress of weight loss is to overindulge in food that may be wreaking havoc on your health. Sure, it may feel good emotionally to treat yourself to a cheat meal after a great workout. But in reality, you can’t out-exercise a bad diet. Some people believe that all you need to do is minimize your daily calorie intake and you’ll be fine to eat whatever you want. Just “burn the fat” in the gym. Well, try putting cheap gasoline in your car. Sure, your car will burn that fuel eventually, but what will the long-term effects be? My point is to make nutrition a priority as I mentioned earlier. Exercise is important, but not more than what you put in your body.",
        "Make eating healthy a lifestyle. Nutrition and even exercise are very subjective. There is no one-size-fits-all approach that will work for everyone. That being said, I recommend that regardless of what diet or eating pattern you choose, consider making healthy eating a lifestyle and not a short-term fix. Your goal may be to lose 30 pounds, and so you might start a program to help you achieve that goal. However, what happens after you’ve met your weight goal? Do you simply go back to eating like you used to? Hopefully not. Some people struggle with weight management and eventually regain that weight and more after starting a diet trend. I believe that can be attributed to the fact that perhaps they focused too much on the scale and the mirror instead of their overall health and longevity. My health turned around for the better once I decided to make eating healthy every day how I live instead of part of a time-based program."
