        "Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare disease that causes inflammation of your cartilage and other tissues in your body. If you have painful joints and notice changes in your ears or nose, you might have this condition.",
        "Inflammation is your body’s way to fight disease or injury. When your immune system thinks there’s a problem (like a virus or bacteria), it releases certain cells in your blood , and more blood flows to the affected area. That can cause redness, warmth, swelling, or pain.",
        "The pain from RP usually comes on suddenly, and it can happen to both men and women, and to people of all ages. But it’s more likely to start between the ages of 40 and 60.",
        "It affects people in different ways. Some get a mild case of RP once in a while, and the symptoms go away on their own. Others have lots of pain and more frequent attacks.",
        "Because it can affect key organs, RP can lead to serious illness and can be life-threatening."
