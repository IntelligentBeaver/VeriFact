        "Feb. 15, 2023 -- If you're recovering from COVID-19 or you're a long COVID patient, you may have been advised by your doctor to monitor yourself for high blood pressure . This is because research has shown that COVID can raise both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and can cause high blood pressure even if you've never had it. But those recovering from the virus should be aware of a lesser-known concern as well: low blood pressure post-COVID.",
        "Italian researchers found that some patients who already have high blood pressure and who have either recovered from COVID or have post-COVID symptoms can experience a sudden drop in blood pressure, or BP. These patients are at immediate risk for acute kidney injury, which is  when your kidneys suddenly stop working properly. Anyone can experience low blood pressure post-COVID, but according to Mayo Clinic data , women are more likely to develop it than men are. Researchers from the Czech Republic also found that older, frail post-COVID patients who have high blood pressure can develop low blood pressure, possibly because their BP medication suddenly becomes too strong for their bodies."
