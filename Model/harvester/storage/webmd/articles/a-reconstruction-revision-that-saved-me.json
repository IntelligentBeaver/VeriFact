I will never forget the phone ringing a day before my 28th birthday with the results from my biopsy of a tiny little lump I felt in my breast just a few weeks prior. I was living my best life. I had a budding career, engaged to be married in only a few months, a new home, car, I was adulting really well, and then cancer happened.",

Try to save your nipples, but likely lose them anyway. Saline or silicone or natural tissue. Everything seemed fairly straightforward. I had no idea how much pain my reconstruction would cost me throughout my years of survival."

        "Making the initial decision to reconstruct was not one I took lightly. Pictures on the internet of reconstructed chests after mastectomy were terrifying. I had never seen breast cancer like that before. It wasn’t a boob job, that’s for sure. Many pictures represented misshapen scars, indentions on the chest wall, discoloration from radiation -- all of these things are true, I just wasn’t ready to see it. I sat for many appointments and second opinions on what was going to be the right choice for me. Many times, I questioned if I wanted reconstruction. After all, these breasts on my body could kill me, so why would I want them “replaced\"?",
        "In the end, I opted for implant reconstruction with silicone implants, as I wasn’t a great candidate for natural breast reconstruction at the time. What I didn’t know was it wasn’t just a choice of silicone vs saline. Another option would be available: UTM (under the muscle) vs. OTM (over the muscle)."

        "To rewind the hands of time a bit, at that point most reconstructive surgeries were using a technique call the LAT flap -- using the latissimus dorsi muscle from the back to help stabilize the implant on the front. However, my surgeon in Denver had been perfecting reconstruction without having to compromise the back muscle – and getting good results. I felt I won the lottery when I heard there was one less scar, body part, or surgery that was needed because of my cancer diagnosis. Some patients also get a choice for DTI (direct to implant) reconstruction that is done at the time of mastectomy. My body required that I use expanders first to stretch the skin and muscle to house the implant instead of my own breast tissue.",
        "My initial reconstruction was UTM. The surgeon sliced my pectoral muscle in order to give a slope to my chest wall and help the appearance of the implant. What I didn’t know was this surgery would lead to a decade plus of physical therapy, scar tissue massage, severe neck and back pain that often led to migraines, and constant use of pain creams, ointments, and relievers.",
        "You may be wondering why. In my experience, I had been incredibly fit at the time of mastectomy. I was, after all, training for my upcoming wedding, and my one fitness goal I had was to do push-ups, even if it was just one. I wanted to train my body to do them. I reached that goal just weeks before my mastectomy. What I didn’t know was that I would never do a push-up again after that because of my UTM breast reconstruction. My chest wall had extreme muscle spasms that lasted for years. My shoulder and neck pain was unbearable at times. I was never able to execute any physical activity that utilized my chest muscles, and if I did, I would often injure myself. It wasn’t until a few years ago that I was educated on the advancements in OTM breast reconstruction, and I never realized what this revision would do for my overall health and well-being."

Over 10 years studying breast surgery and reconstruction, seeing thousands of chests, with and without reconstruction, it never dawned on me that all my suffering was because my implants were below my muscle! Crazy, I know, but I started investigating the best choice for me based on what I had learned from amazing, ground-breaking plastic surgeons.",

I knew I needed to trade some of the bad for good and vice versa. I also knew that I might not be an ideal candidate as I was often told I had “thin skin” following my mastectomy 13 years earlier. But thankfully, I had one of the best in the business."
