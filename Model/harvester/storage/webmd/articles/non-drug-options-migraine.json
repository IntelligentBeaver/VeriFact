For some of these therapies, there's scientific evidence that they can be effective. What’s more, you can generally use them along with migraine medicines for even better results."

      "content": [
        "Devices that deliver electrical or magnetic stimulation to certain nerves or areas of your brain can help treat and prevent migraines . These neuromodulation devices modulate, or change, activity in your brain to stop pain signals. While they don't work for everyone, they're thought to be safe and cause few side effects. Several types are available, such as: External trigeminal nerve stimulation (ETNS). Using electrical impulses transmitted through an electrode, this therapy gently stimulates a nerve along your forehead called the trigeminal nerve. Some studies suggest an hour of treatment with ETNS can significantly improve headache pain for people with migraine. Regular use may help to prevent migraine attacks. You can get an ETNS device without a prescription and use it at home. But talk to your doctor before you try one. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). These devices use magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in your brain via a coil placed on your scalp. Research shows that TMS may relieve pain and reduce the frequency of migraine attacks. You need a prescription for a TMS device. You can get these treatments in a doctor's office or with devices you use at home. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). These devices, applied to the side of your neck, deliver electrical impulses to your vagus nerve . This long nerve regulates many body functions, like mood, heart rate, digestion, and immune responses. Studies suggest VNS may lessen migraine pain and also prevent future attacks. You'll need a prescription for VNS therapy. But one handheld device lets you can do the treatments yourself. Implantable occipital nerve stimulation. This kind of device, which a surgeon implants at the base of your skull, sends electrical pulses to your occipital nerve. The therapy works to prevent headaches for some, but not all, people with migraine. One study found it was effective in a little less than half of those who used it. Remote electrical neuromodulation (REN). You wear a REN device on your upper arm. You use a phone app to control the device, which targets part of your nervous system that’s involved in pain control. Some studies show it can lessen migraine pain within a couple of hours. Multi-channel brain neuromodulation . You get this therapy via a device you wear as a headset. It targets six branches of the occipital and trigeminal nerves in your head. You control it through your smartphone. Studies have shown it can relieve head pain as well as other symptoms like light and noise sensitivity."

You use feedback you get from the sensors to help you make changes to better control your body. For example, if you relax certain muscles, you might be able to reduce pain. Each biofeedback treatment takes about an hour. You may need several sessions over several months. Treatments are available at hospitals, clinics, and physical therapy centers. You can also get biofeedback programs and devices to use at home with your computer or mobile phone, though not all are FDA-approved.
