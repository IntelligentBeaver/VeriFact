        "Nothing can blast the euphoria of discovering you're pregnant faster than morning sickness. For Deborah Wood, a mother of three and writer in Evanston, Ill., certain smells were killers, especially with her first pregnancy. In fact, opening a refrigerator became an occupational hazard. Just the mention of tuna -- a food she normally loves -- would make her heave. She even started carrying plastic grocery bags in her pockets for those times when a mad dash to the bathroom was impossible.",
        "She's not alone. As many as 90% of all pregnant women experience some degree of nausea or vomiting during pregnancy, says Dr. Jennifer Niebyl, head of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Iowa College of Medicine. In most cases, the symptoms are associated with a perfectly healthy baby, and they disappear by the fourth month. But some women have the symptoms longer, even lasting their whole pregnancy.",
        "The trick is finding out what helps, although that's often easier said than done. Not only is every woman different, but so is each pregnancy. \"There isn't a one-size-fits-all remedy,\" says Miriam Erick, a registered dietician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and author of \"No More Morning Sickness : A Survival Guide for Pregnant Women\" and \"Take Two Crackers and Call Me in the Morning.\"",
        "Erick advises a methodical approach. Take note of any smells or tastes that set you off, and avoid them. Then experiment with foods and drinks that soothe your symptoms. Be open to what your body's telling you, not what you've heard works for others. In fact, the old standby -- crackers and ginger ale -- isn't as effective as potato chips and lemonade for many women, although Erick doesn't know why."

        "Doctors still aren't sure exactly what causes morning sickness, but the most popular theory is that morning sickness is the body's reaction to the pregnancy hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is produced at higher levels during the first trimester than at any other time during pregnancy, says Dr. Niebyl.

Pregnant women should drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of liquid daily. Many women find that water doesn't sit well with nausea. If carbonated drinks such as ginger ale work best, Erick recommends those with the most bite, such as Schweppes or Jamaican ginger beer. Herbal teas such as red raspberry, lemon, spearmint, peach or chamomile may work. Erick says watermelon is a great \"solid liquid\" that may help.",

Dr. Niebyl says the standard B-6 vitamin is 50 milligrams, so you can break it in half. With any over-the-counter supplement, including herbs, it's always a good idea to check with your physician or midwife first, particularly to make sure the symptoms aren't related to a more serious condition that needs different treatment.",

The bands theoretically relieve nausea by applying pressure to a point located on the forearm about 2 inches above the wrist, although studies are inconclusive that they're effective. \"I never took them off,\" say Wood, 46. \"I'll never know if they really worked, or if it was psychological, or if I wouldn't have been sick anyway; but this was the only pregnancy I used them with, and it was the only time I didn't get sick.\"",
