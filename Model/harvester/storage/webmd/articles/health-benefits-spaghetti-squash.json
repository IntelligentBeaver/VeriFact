        "Spaghetti squash is a variety of winter squash, although it is ready for harvest in early autumn. When cooked, this large, hard-shelled squash yields long strands that many cooks use as a low-calorie alternative to pasta. The yellow flesh of the spaghetti squash contains many nutrients.",

It was popular in Asia for many years before catching on in the United States around 1980. Its botanical name is Cucurbita pepo, but some people call it vegetable spaghetti, vegetable marrow, or squaghetti."

Vitamin A contributes to the health of the salivary glands and tissues in the mouth. A deficiency can cause brittle teeth. Winter squash varieties contain good quantities of Vitamin A and Vitamin C. As a low-calorie food, spaghetti squash is also less likely to promote tooth decay than starchy or sweet foods."
