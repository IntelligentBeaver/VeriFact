        "If you notice a bump that looks like a pimple on your upper or lower eyelid, it might be a stye. It's an infection in the oil glands around the eyelids and most often shows up next to your eyelashes. Usually, this red, painful bump filled with pus lasts a few days, then bursts and heals. But in some cases, you'll need treatment for the infection.",

It's caused by blocked oil glands in your lid, not an infection. But it can sometimes form after a stye. Unlike a stye, it's usually not painful. Chalazia (the plural of chalazion) often last longer than styes, for weeks or months, but usually go away on their own."
