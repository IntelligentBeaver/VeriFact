        "Psoriatic arthritis causes painful, stiff, swollen joints. About 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis get psoriatic arthritis. However, you can develop this type of arthritis without having any skin symptoms.",
        "You’ll likely feel pain in your hands and feet. Psoriatic arthritis still needs to be treated with medications, but you can try some alternative treatments.",
        "One popular alternative option is fish oil supplements. You can try adding these supplements to your regular treatment routine. Fish oil is supposed to help reduce the inflammation in your body that’s causing all the pain.",
        "Fish oil has been shown to reduce tender joints and lower how much nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication you may need to take. The optimal amount of fish oil, or omega-3s, is 400 mg daily. Whether you get this in supplement form daily or by eating 3.5 oz of fatty salmon a week, you should start to see changes.",
        "Another benefit of taking omega-3s per day is improved heart function from affecting your arterial pressure, central blood pressure, and heart rate variability. These reduced risks can help keep your psoriatic arthritis from flaring up."
