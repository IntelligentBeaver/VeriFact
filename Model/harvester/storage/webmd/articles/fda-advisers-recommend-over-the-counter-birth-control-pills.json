        "May 10, 2023 -- Advisors from the FDA made strides today toward approving the country’s first over-the-counter birth control pill, voting unanimously that widening the pill’s availability would provide more benefits than harm.",
        "The FDA approval of the oral contraceptive Opill – a 0.075mg daily tablet also called the “ mini pill ” as it only contains the hormone progestin (rather than a combination of progestin and estrogen) – could happen as soon as this summer. While the agency is not bound by the advisory panel’s recommendations, a 17-0 vote will lend serious credence to the pill.",
        "HRA Pharma, the French drug company that makes Opill, is calling for the FDA to approve the drug for all reproductive females -- including teenagers.",
        "The major areas of concern for some on the advisory committee were how making pill available over-the-counter option would affect certain vulnerable populations, including adolescents and those with limited literacy capabilities. Questions came up again and again about the public’s ability to understand and adhere to the medication’s instructions."

        "Annie Frisse, MD, MPH, an OB-GYN and assistant professor at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, says that over-focusing on this potential problem does a disservice to patients nationwide.",
        "“We expect our patients for any type of medication to be able to read a pill label and administer the medication appropriately,” Frisse said. “For example, Tylenol, when taken incorrectly can be extremely dangerous, but we trust our patients to take that over the counter appropriately and not overdose or harm themselves with those pills.”",
        "And with a contraceptive proven as safe as the progesterone-only pill, the expectation is no different. With this type of birth control, adherence to the pill’s schedule (taken once at the same time daily) is crucial to its effectiveness, as its “missed-pill window” is more narrow than the combination pills that include estrogen.",
        "But as Elise Berlan, MD, a member of the FDA committee and pediatrician at ​​Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, OH, noted, adherence is “highly imperfect” even with prescription drugs.",
        "“Adolescents can adhere to daily contraceptive use… Non-adherent daily dosing is likely to compromise effectiveness but it’s unlikely to pose harm greater than non-use,” Berlan said."
