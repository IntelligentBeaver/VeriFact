But, when the disease is passed on, the results are catastrophic -- the baby may develop HIV infection. Talk to your doctor if you are thinking about getting pregnant to see what to do to lower the risk of spreading the disease to your baby.",
        "Herpes : Herpes infection in pregnant women is relatively safe until they get ready to deliver. Active herpes lesions on the genitals are highly contagious and can infect the infant as they are being born. Babies who come in contact with Herpes can suffer damage to their eyes and central nervous systems. A herpes infection in a newborn can become life-threatening, affecting multiple organ systems rather than only the genitals. Also, the virus may begin multiplying and become infectious before any skin symptoms appear. Therefore, many women with a herpes outbreak will have a C-section to prevent the transmission of herpes to the newborn.",
        "Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is a very common STD, usually diagnosed by performing a test on a swab of vaginal fluid. If contracted during pregnancy, the infection can cause vaginal discharge, burning while emptying the bladder , or abdominal pain . A pregnant woman with untreated gonorrhea may have an increased risk of miscarriage or preterm delivery. A baby who is born while the mother has an active infection can develop blindness, joint infection, or a life threatening blood infection .",
        "HPV ( Genital Warts ): This is a very common STD. The genital warts often appear as small cauliflower-like clusters which may burn or itch. If you contract genital warts during pregnancy, treatment may be delayed until after you deliver. Sometimes the hormones from pregnancy can make them grow larger. If they grow large enough to block the birth canal, the baby may need to be delivered by a C-section.",
        "Chlamydia: Chlamydia may cause an increased risk of miscarriage and preterm delivery. Newborns who are exposed can get severe eye infections and pneumonia . Make sure you are retested within 3 months, to be certain the infection is gone, even if your partner has been treated.",
        "Syphilis: Syphilis is most often diagnosed with a blood test, although a syphilitic skin lesion can also be tested. Syphilis is easily passed on to your unborn child. It is likely to cause a very serious infection to your baby that can be fatal. The infants are often premature. Untreated infants that survive tend to develop problems in multiple organs, including the brain , eyes , ears, heart , skin, teeth , and bones.",
        "Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. If pregnant women are infected with hepatitis B, they can transmit the infection to their baby through the placenta about 40% of the time. An infected newborn can become a lifelong carrier of hepatitis B leading to liver disease and even death. Luckily, early screening and the more widespread use of the hepatitis B vaccine can prevent infection. There are also medications that newborn babies can be given soon after birth that prevents the transmission of hepatitis B from the mother to the baby.",
        "Trichomoniasis: Trichomoniasis is an infection that can cause yellow-green vaginal discharge and pain with sex or when emptying the bladder . It can increase the risk of having a preterm baby. Rarely, the new baby can get the infection during delivery and have a vaginal discharge after birth. Get retested within 3 months of being treated to make sure the infection is cleared."
