        "Lipedema is an abnormal buildup of fat in your lower body. It's a long-term condition that can affect up to 11% of women. Almost all the people who have lipedema are women. Lipedema happens when fat is distributed in an abnormal way beneath your skin, usually in your buttocks and legs. Although it begins as a cosmetic concern, it can eventually cause pain and other problems.",
        "Lipedema vs. cellulite",

        "Lipedema vs. lymphedema",
        "Lipedema can be mistaken for obesity or lymphedema. Your body's lymphatic system, which helps protect you against infection, moves a fluid called lymph through your body. When lymph builds up because lymph vessels or nodes that the fluid travels through are missing, damaged, or removed, that buildup is called lymphedema. Both lipedema and lymphedema can cause swelling, but lipedema is not caused by lymph buildup."
