People are also less likely to suffer a heat-related medical event when they are properly acclimated to hot weather conditions.",
        "What is heat acclimation, exactly? Generally, it involves exposing athletes to a series of “thermal impulses,” or increases in core body temperature. The objective of each heat exposure is simple: Sweat a lot and increase core temp to at least 101.3 F for at least 60 minutes per day. Within 10-14 days, this helps the body adapt, making it easier to withstand (and perform in) intense temps.",

The adaptation that takes the longest is increased sweat rate, which for some athletes can take up to 2 weeks of daily exposure."
