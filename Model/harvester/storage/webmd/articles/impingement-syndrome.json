        "Shoulder impingement syndrome is a common cause of shoulder pain . It occurs when there is impingement of tendons or bursa in the shoulder from bones of the shoulder. Overhead activity of the shoulder, especially repeated activity, is a risk factor for shoulder impingement syndrome. Examples include: painting, lifting, swimming , tennis, and other overhead sports. Other risk factors include bone and joint abnormalities.",
