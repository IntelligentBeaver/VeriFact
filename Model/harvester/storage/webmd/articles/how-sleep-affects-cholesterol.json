People who slept 8 hours a night had the highest HDL numbers.",

Your body may produce too much of the stress hormone cortisol and the appetite-boosting hormone ghrelin, but too little leptin , which regulates body weight . This hormone imbalance can drive your cholesterol out of balance too.",

People with interrupted sleep because of sleep apnea -- when breathing stops and starts throughout the night -- often have high total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in their blood , and low levels of HDL cholesterol .
