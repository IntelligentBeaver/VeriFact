        "DTaP is a vaccine that helps children younger than age 7 develop immunity against three deadly diseases caused by bacteria: diphtheria, tetanus , and whooping cough (pertussis).",
        "Diphtheria is a respiratory disease that can cause breathing problems , paralysis, heart failure , and death. It's highly contagious and is spread by coughing and sneezing .",
        "Tetanus, or lockjaw, is caused by a bacterium often found in soil. Once it enters the body, it releases a toxin that attacks the nervous system , causing muscle spasms and death if left untreated.",
        "Pertussis, also highly contagious, causes coughing spasms so severe that in infants, it makes it difficult to eat, drink, or even breathe. It can lead to pneumonia , seizures , brain damage , and death.",
        "Before the vaccines were developed, these diseases were rampant. Vaccines protect the community by preventing the spread of disease from one person to the next, which even offers some protection to the unvaccinated. If people stopped getting vaccinated, the incidence of these three diseases would rapidly rise and thousands would get sick and perhaps even die.",
