        "What’s usually most difficult is letting go of what was. That doesn’t mean there’s an automatic erasure of your life before HIV. But parts of your life and identity do change, and there’s no way to get around that.",
        "Most of what you experience after being diagnosed involves change. As you adapt to the new and unfamiliar, it’s natural to mourn the life you knew. As challenging as it might feel, leaning into this part is the best thing you can do. How you identify, what your daily routines are, and your overall outlook on life will be affected. You’re allowed to feel your feelings about things changing.",
        "Accepting your new reality can be complicated. A form of grieving happens. It can manifest in various ways, but most common are its impacts both mentally and emotionally. You may experience stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Remember, this isn’t permanent, despite how lasting it may feel."
