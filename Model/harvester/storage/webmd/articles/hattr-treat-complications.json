It causes your liver to make the protein transthyretin (TTR) that clumps together and builds up in your body’s tissues, organs, and nerves. The clumps, called amyloid fibrils, damage your body."

        "hATTR is a systemic disease, which means it affects your entire body. It also gets worse over time, and you can have different symptoms depending on which of your organs are affected and how seriously. Symptoms usually show up when you’re between the ages of 30-65. The most common complications include heart and nerve problems, but you can also have problems with your kidneys, gut, and eyes. Carpal tunnel syndrome is often the first sign of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. Nervous system complications Neuropathy, or damage to your nerves, often is a complication of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis and includes some of these symptoms: Tingling or numbness in your legs or feet A hard time walking Weakness or pain in your limbs Getting lightheaded when standing Bladder or bowel problems Sexual problems like erectile dysfunction Sensitivity to pain and heat"

Liver transplant was once the only therapy, but the FDA has approved many new medications and clinical trials continue to test others. People diagnosed with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis can have very different symptoms and complications because of how much and where amyloid fibrils are deposited in their tissues and organs. What stage of the disease they’re in also matters. These all make treating it complicated for your doctor. Treating it becomes even more difficult because there are about 136 different genetic variations of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. Each type can have its own complications and cause damage to specific tissues and organs. Researchers now suggest your doctors use a multisystem approach, including treating the disease with therapies that are right for you and monitoring signs of the disease as it gets worse. Talk to your doctor and friends and family about your options, and be sure you’re getting the support you need."
