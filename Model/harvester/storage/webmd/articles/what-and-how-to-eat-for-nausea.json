        "When nausea strikes, it can be miserable. An uneasiness in the stomach can make it hard to function, especially when there’s a lingering threat of vomiting. As a dietitian in a gastroenterology practice, I see many patients suffering from recurrent nausea. In addition to a side effect of medications and pregnancy, nausea can be caused by common conditions affecting the stomach, including gastritis, peptic ulcers, GERD, functional dyspepsia (chronic indigestion), and gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying). Although eating may seem like the last thing you want to do with nausea, a variety of foods and diet strategies may provide relief while also keeping you properly nourished.",
        "Going too long without eating can worsen nausea . Consider the simple motto: “An empty stomach is an acid stomach.” Long stretches without food can lead to a buildup of digestive fluids that normally get utilized with digestion. This can spell trouble for multiple stomach conditions like gastritis, peptic ulcers, GERD, and dyspepsia, which tend to feel better with food as a buffer. While an overfly full stomach can also worsen symptoms, evenly spaced eating helps to regulate acid and may rid you of or prevent your nausea."
