Most people who take an opioid experience some degree of constipation, and it doesn't tend to go away as your body gets accustomed to the medication.

Most of the nausea is from the drugs' slowing effect on the bowels. If you keep the bowels moving, you're less likely to be nauseated. In many cases, the nausea induced by opioid medications will abate after a few days on a new drug.
