        "Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that involves significant changes in mood, energy, and behavior. Bipolar I is characterized by manic episodes, which involve abnormally elevated mood, risky behaviors, and impulsive behavior. These \"high\" mood episodes often (but not always) alternate with depressive episodes, which are periods of low mood, lack of motivation, and difficulty concentrating.",

        "Psychosis occurs when a person loses touch with reality. Common symptoms include delusions (unusual beliefs), hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real), paranoia (believing others are out to get you), and disorganized thoughts or behaviors.",

One of my delusions was that I was in a coma. I went to the emergency room looking for answers. While in the ER, doctors conducted several neurological tests, including the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and a CT scan. They wanted to rule out other brain issues for what I was experiencing, as psychiatric disorders usually appear earlier in life.",
