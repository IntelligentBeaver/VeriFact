        "Although ankylosing spondylitis mainly affects the joints of the spine , it may also affect other parts of the body. One such part is the middle layer of the eye, called the uvea. Inflammation in the uvea is also called uveitis. Since your iris (the colored part of your eye) is also part of the uvea, this kind of inflammation can also be called iritis. Between 30 and 40% of people with ankylosing spondylitis will develop uveitis or iritis at some point.",
