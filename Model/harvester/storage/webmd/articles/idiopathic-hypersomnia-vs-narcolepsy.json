Here’s a look at both; their similarities and differences; and how doctors figure out which one you might have."

        "These two sleep disorders – or, clinically speaking, central disorders of hypersomnolence (CDH) – look a lot alike. Hypersomnolence means sleeping too much. Both conditions make you feel very sleepy or tired during the day even after a full night’s sleep. The need to sleep can strike at any time and make it hard to work or drive, which can be dangerous. But there are some subtle differences. People with idiopathic hypersomnia may sleep a lot at night – often up to 12 or 14 hours – and still find it very hard to wake up in the mornings and after naps. You might wake up feeling confused and disoriented."

But they soon feel sleepy again. Narcolepsy may also come with these other symptoms that idiopathic hypersomnia typically does not: Visions as you’re falling asleep or waking up, often that someone is in the room with you Sleep paralysis : Not being able to move as you’re falling asleep or waking up Fragmented sleep: Waking in the night and being unable to get back to sleep. It can be insomnia , vivid dreams , acting out dreams, or sudden leg movements that wake you. Memory problems: Not being able to remember things that happened or conversations you had because you were half-asleep. You can fall asleep while working, eating, driving, or talking. Cataplexy : A sudden episode of muscle weakness where your muscles go limp while you’re awake like they do when you're asleep. This only happens in type 1 narcolepsy and usually in response to a strong emotion like surprise or happiness."

        "The American Academy of Sleep Medicine offers self-tests on its website to screen for both of these sleep disorders. If you think you may have idiopathic hypersomnia, ask yourself the following questions: Are you very sleepy even though you sleep 8 to 10 hours a night without interruption? Has this happened daily for more than 3 months? Do you feel unrefreshed and sleepy even after naps? If you think you may have narcolepsy, ask yourself: Do you get sudden urges to sleep during the day even after a full night’s sleep? Do you doze off while working, eating, or speaking with someone? Do you feel alert after a nap, then quickly feel sleepy again? If you answer “yes” to at least one of these questions, see a sleep specialist for a sleep study. Before you say “No way am I sleeping overnight in a lab,” you should know that many sleep studies take place in your own bed. The doctor sends a monitoring device and instructions home with you. The study will help rule out other conditions that may make you too sleepy, such as sleep apnea. A sleep specialist will also perform a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) to measure how sleepy you are during the day. You’ll try to take naps at set times during the day. Falling asleep quickly is a sign that you could have either condition. But doctors can often distinguish between the two by calculating how many sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) you have. These are REM sleep periods that happen within 5 minutes of falling asleep. Most people with idiopathic hypersomnia have less than two, but with narcolepsy, you have two or more."
