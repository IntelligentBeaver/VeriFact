In the making of a relationship, she says, several variables come into play -- such as personality, which includes your character and your temperament. \"Your character is formed by everything you grew up with,\" she says. \"And your temperament is built by your biology. Together they create who you are.\"",

And like some of us, it can be fickle. \"One moment chemistry rules and the next moment your upbringing will rule,\" Fisher says. As in: \"I'm madly in love with this guy.\" to \"What I am thinking? He's a different religion.\"",
