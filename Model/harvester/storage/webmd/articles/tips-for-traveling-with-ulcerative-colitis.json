        "Now that I’m older, it’s more like seeing new places, meeting new faces ... and discovering new bathrooms! In my pre- IBD days, that would not have been part of my itinerary. It would have never crossed my mind to think about how my diet or medication could affect my activities or might halt travel plans. It was all about simple enjoyment -- spending time with my family and being in the moment.",
        "It’s interesting how priorities can shift and life plans change to accommodate an illness. Now, the planning and packing agenda becomes more than just choosing the right shoes for an outfit. I have to think about how to handle medications, purchasing and preparing meals and snacks in advance, and making sure I have both an ice pack and a heating pad."

        "In 2015, a terrible flare landed me in the hospital. After discharge, I was still struggling with keeping down food and water. That’s common after a flare. It usually takes several weeks to months to readjust. When you can go back to a “new” normal of diet and activities depends on the degree of inflammation and current medications.",
        "In fact, one thing doctors don’t widely discuss with you is how to plan to move forward after recovering from a flare. I was torn between wanting to jump immediately into everyday activities, especially outdoor activities, and feeling uncertain and scared how my body would respond. I was terrified of possibly being in an embarrassing situation and not being able to get out of it fast enough.",
        "And I think I may have manifested that fear into reality. Several days after being discharged from the hospital, I was invited to a close friend’s wedding. She was having an outdoor wedding near a campsite an hour away from home. I was still very much symptomatic and running to the bathroom after every meal and every sip of water or tea. My travel plans went as far as getting up from my bed to the downstairs powder room, the master bathroom in my parents’ room, or the upstairs hallway bathroom -- whichever was available for touring. My younger sister also has IBD, so it was good that we had more than one restroom!"
