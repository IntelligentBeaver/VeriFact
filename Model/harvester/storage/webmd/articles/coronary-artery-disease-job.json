        "Know your legal options. Your employer can’t retaliate against you for requesting accommodations, Rhodes says. If you feel like you are facing retaliation or being pushed to quit, find a local employment attorney for advice. You can also file a complaint yourself with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). They will notify your company within 10 days and investigate whether there’s valid reason to believe discrimination occurred. The average time to investigate and resolve a charge is around 10 months."
