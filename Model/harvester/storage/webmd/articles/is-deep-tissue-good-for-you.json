        "A deep tissue massage may be described as a \"next-level\" massage – scuba diving versus a casual swim.",
        "Deep tissue massage is more than skin deep. Your muscles are lower in your body. Massage therapists use slower strokes and direct pressure to help relieve pain, stiffness, and tension.",
        "When you have regular tension or pain, bands of rigid tissue are normally to blame. These bands (or adhesions) can block blood flow and cause pain, limit movement, and increase inflammation . In a deep tissue massage, your therapist will work to break down these bands to relieve pain and help you to move your body with ease.",
        "Classic massage therapy is different from deep tissue massage. One focuses on stress relief and relaxation, while the other (deep tissue) helps you with a specific problem like pain, stiffness, limited movement, or an injury.",
        "You may be surprised to know that there are more than 80 types of massage. These range from more relaxing (think spa day) types to more intense kinds for rehab or pain relief."

The strokes are slow, with your masseuse using their fingers, thumbs, and elbows. Usually, athletes, runners, and people who sit for long periods of time get deep tissue massages."

Look for a massage therapist trained in sports massage to help loosen tight muscles and help you rebound from injury.",

        "An hour of deep tissue massage costs anywhere from $50 to $150. What you'll pay for a massage depends on where you get it, who's doing it, and what you add to your massage. An in-home massage is typically more expensive than one done in a spa, rehab center, or physical therapy clinic. Also, a therapist with more experience will cost more.  If you add things like hot stones or aromatherapy (lavender, chamomile, etc.), the cost can go up.",
        "There is little evidence that massage of any kind can release toxins. But deep pressure movements may relieve pain from lactic acid that hangs out in the muscles. The reason you might feel sore after a workout is because of the lactic acid released with activity. Massage may help move lymphatic fluid and reduce inflammation. Your lymph nodes (small nodules in places like your underarms or neck) work by filtering fluid in your body. Lymphatic massage (often included with deep tissue massage) can relieve pain and inflammation. For people who have had one or both breasts removed (mastectomy), deep massage of the lymph area can help."
