        "Myositis refers to a group of conditions that cause inflammation in muscles, but it can also refer to the muscle inflammation itself. This inflammation often leads to weakness , swelling, and pain over time, making it harder to do everyday activities, such as climbing stairs or reaching over your head. Experts aren’t completely sure what causes myositis, but they think it could be triggered by infection, injury, autoimmune conditions, or drug side effects. There’s no cure, but there are things you can do to ease symptoms. The best way to treat myositis depends on what’s causing it.",

Polymyositis is rare, affecting fewer than 25 in 100,000 people each year. You’re more likely to develop it if you already have another autoimmune disease."
