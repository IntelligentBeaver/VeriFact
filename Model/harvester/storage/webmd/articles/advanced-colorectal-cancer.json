        "Colorectal cancer is a tumor that starts in your colon or rectum, the end of your large intestine. When it spreads to other parts of your body -- most often to your liver, lungs , or bones -- doctors use the word “advanced” to describe it. Your doctor may also call it metastatic or stage IV disease. Although it’s outside your colon or rectum, it's still colorectal cancer, and doctors treat it with drugs for that disease.",
        "For most people, there's no cure. But treatments can help you feel better and live longer. Scientists are also researching and testing many new therapies. Some use your body's own immune system to find and destroy cancer cells. This may be an option if other drugs don't help or stop working.",
