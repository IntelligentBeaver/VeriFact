        "B-cell therapy uses drugs called monoclonal antibodies to attack white blood cells known as B cells that cause nerve damage. The FDA has approved three such drugs for MS. Ocrelizumab ( Ocrevus ) treats relapsing forms of MS, including: Clinically isolated syndrome Relapsing-remitting MS Active secondary progressive MS in adults Primary progressive MS in adults It may lower relapses and slow the disease. Ofatumumab ( Kesimpta ) also treats relapsing forms of MS, including: Clinically isolated syndrome Relapsing-remitting MS Active secondary progressive MS in adults Ublituximab-xiiy ( Briumvi ) is a third treatment for relapsing forms of MS, including: Clinically isolated syndrome Relapsing-remitting MS Active secondary progressive MS in adults You may have fewer relapses, and the progression of your MS may slow down. These drugs are new versions of the cancer medication rituximab (Rituxan ). Rituximab isn’t approved to treat MS, but doctors sometimes prescribe it as an \"off-label\" treatment."
