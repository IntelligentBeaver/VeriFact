        "Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a serious genetic disorder that affects the adrenal glands. Those are two small organs on top of the kidneys that make hormones to help your body work the way it should. But sometimes they can’t make the hormones you need, which can be life-threatening. While there’s no cure, treatment can help manage symptoms. People with CAH may need a mix of medication and mental health support. Surgery might also be necessary in some cases."

        "People with classic CAH need daily hormone replacement therapy for life. This wards off mild symptoms and lowers the chances of adrenal crisis. That’s a life-threatening condition that mostly affects people who have salt-wasting CAH, a severe form that makes you less able to keep sodium and water in your body. Medications used to treat classic CAH include: Glucocorticoids . Also called corticosteroids, these drugs are the go-to treatment for classic CAH. They boost levels of cortisol in the body and help lower extra androgens. You take them every day by mouth, usually as a pill. Types of glucocorticoids typically used to treat classic CAH include: Dexamethasone Hydrocortisone Prednisolone Prednisone Hydrocortisone is preferred for babies and young kids because it’s short-acting and less likely to stunt their growth. Children may need three to four doses a day. As they reach adulthood and stop growing, they can often switch to a longer-acting medication, usually taken once or twice daily."

          "text": "Newborn girls, or infants assigned female at birth, may have outer genitals that look more like male sex organs. In the past, doctors recommended early surgery to make the clitoris smaller or to create a more typical vaginal opening. But there’s controversy over this practice, especially when it comes to babies and toddlers, who can’t give their consent. A growing number of experts suggest delaying surgery that isn’t medically necessary until your child is old enough to decide if they want to change the appearance of their sex organs. Talk to your doctor or a psychologist who works with people who have classic CAH to learn more about what’s right for your family.",
