        "If your doctor or midwife has concerns about your or your baby's health toward the end of your pregnancy, they might suggest speeding up the process. This is called inducing labor, or induction. Instead of waiting for labor to start naturally, your doctor or midwife will use drugs or a procedure to start it sooner.",
        "Induction can be the right choice for some, but it has risks. And it doesn't always work. If it doesn't, you may need a C-section. Most experts say it's best to let labor begin on its own and progress naturally unless there's a clear medical reason to induce.",
        "\"The only reason we recommend an induction is because it's our job to keep an eye on you and baby and make sure that everyone comes out of this process safe,\" says Jessica Vernon, MD, a board-certified OB/GYN and an associate medical director at Oula, a midwifery-based women's health start-up in New York City. \"It's always a conversation between you and your provider, and understanding the risks and benefits and alternatives. And if you want a second opinion, you can always talk to another provider.\"",
