        "Your aortic valve is part of your heart, a strong muscle that pumps blood through your body. The aortic valve controls the blood flowing out from the heart. It opens every time your heart contracts, or squeezes. This allows blood to flow out into the aorta. Then the aortic valve shuts tight to keep blood from seeping back into the heart. Learning about aortic valve anatomy and aortic valve function can help you understand aortic valve conditions and how to keep your heart healthy."

        "The aortic valve is one of four valves in your heart. Heart valves help the blood in your heart to keep moving in the right direction. Each valve is made of flaps that work together to act as a door. The flaps open to allow blood to pass through and then close to keep the blood from moving back the other direction.",

Most of the time, there are three cusps in the aortic valve, but some people are born with two cusps instead of three.
