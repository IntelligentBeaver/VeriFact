        "Your regular doctor is a good place to start. They can test you for depression and help manage your symptoms. If your depression goes untreated, it may get worse and last for months, even years. It can cause pain and possibly lead to suicide, as it does for about 1 of every 10 people with depression.",
        "Recognizing the symptoms is key. Unfortunately, about half the people who have depression never get diagnosed or treated."
