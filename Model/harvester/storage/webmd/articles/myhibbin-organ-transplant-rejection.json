        "If an organ in your body (such as the heart, kidneys, or liver) is not working well enough because of an illness or injury, you may need an organ transplant . An organ transplant involves surgically removing an organ from one person (who could be someone living or someone who has died) and placing it in your body.",
        "After a transplant, organ transplant rejection can happen if your body’s immune system recognizes the new organ as “foreign” and attacks it. Normally, your immune system protects you from harmful substances by recognizing and destroying things that do not belong in your body, like bacteria or viruses. These harmful substances have special proteins called antigens on their surfaces. Once they enter the body, the immune system recognizes their antigens as foreign and attacks them.",
        "Every person’s organs have unique antigens on their surface. If you get a transplanted organ from another person, your immune system may recognize those antigens as different. As a result, your immune system may respond, causing inflammation and damage to the transplanted organ. To prevent transplant rejection, people who receive a transplant take immunosuppressive (anti-rejection) medicines that calm down the immune response so the body will not attack the new organ.",
        "Myhibbin (mycophenolate mofetil) is an immunosuppressive medicine. It was approved by the FDA in May 2024 to prevent transplant rejection in people who have had a heart, kidney, or liver transplant. Myhibbin is used along with other immunosuppressive medicines."
