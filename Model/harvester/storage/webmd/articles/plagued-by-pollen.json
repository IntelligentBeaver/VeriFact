        "Warmer weather may feel good after a long, cold winter, but spring can be rough on the nose and eyes . That's because hay fever , a seasonal allergy to pollen , kicks in just as the sunnier days arrive. Never been near a bale of hay, you say? You may still have hay fever, caused by the pollen from a variety of trees, grasses, and weeds. The allergy's hallmarks-stuffy nose, watery eyes , and fatigue -are a minor annoyance for some and bring full-blown misery to others.",
        "Hay fever is not the only kind of spring allergy , but it is the most common. As many as 50 million people in the United States have allergies -- and nearly 36 million of them have hay fever, says the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI).",

Hay fever treatments are plentiful, including over-the-counter products, prescription drugs , and allergy shots .
