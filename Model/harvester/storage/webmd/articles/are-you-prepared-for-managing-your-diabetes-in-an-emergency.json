        "Last summer, as I sat down to dinner with my sister and brother-in-law in their home in Norman, OK, the sky suddenly turned black. Severe thunderstorms kicked up, followed by TV reports of tornadoes circling the area. Abandoning our food, we crowded into their steel-reinforced pantry/tornado shelter, listening as the TV broadcast a street-by-street report of the twisters’ paths.",
        "This was serious business: Only a few months earlier, a monster tornado had cost several residents their lives.",
        "As a first-timer, it was both frightening and a bit exhilarating to be caught in a situation I had never experienced before. Thunder cracked above as the wind picked up speed. Although we were supposed to stay put until the “all clear,” once or twice, my sister or brother-in-law poked their heads out of the shelter door to track the twisters on TV, where storm chasers recorded those that had made landfall, signaled by sharp bursts of sparks as they hit live electric wires. Only when daylight arrived would it be possible to assess the damage."
