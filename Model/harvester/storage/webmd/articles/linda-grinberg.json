Personally frustrated with research obstacles and timely access to\npromising therapies, transformed Grinberg from a corporate executive into an\nAIDS activist, committed to funding cutting-edge research and making safe and\neffective treatments rapidly available. Grinberg has spearheaded several\ncoalitions, bringing together diverse representatives of many prominent AIDS\norganizations and recently sponsored a multi-disciplinary research workshop on\nstructured treatment interruptions.
