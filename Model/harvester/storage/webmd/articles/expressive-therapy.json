        "This field began in the 1940s when psychologists started paying attention to their patients’ drawings. The sketches sometimes told them more about what a person was thinking or feeling than they learned from talking to that patient.",
        "In an expressive therapy session, a trained therapist guides you through the process of expressing yourself through art. It’s usually a mix of different activities, but sometimes therapists focus on just one. For example, writing or keeping a journal might be better for someone who is new to therapy. If you’ve been in therapy for a while, you might be more interested in dance or drama. You can try expressive therapy by itself or along with talk therapy .",
