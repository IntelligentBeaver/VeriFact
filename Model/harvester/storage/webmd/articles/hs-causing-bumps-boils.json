        "A boil, also called a furuncle, might start out as a tender or sore, swollen spot on or under the skin in a darker color than the rest of your skin. On Black skin, it might be purple or a darker flesh tone. On lighter skin, it could look pink or red. It can range from the sie of a pea to a golf ball. They usually grow quickly and spread to other areas of the body. They can also join with other boils to form a cluster. This is called a carbuncle . Boils eventually fill with fluid or pus. You may see that they have a white or yellow center at this time. As the pus builds up, the pain can get worse. When the boil drains, it will hurt less. Sometimes a boil drains on its own. You might notice oozing, weeping or crusting. But they usually need to be opened and allowed to drain."
