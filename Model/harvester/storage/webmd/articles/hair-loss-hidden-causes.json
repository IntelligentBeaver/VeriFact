        "Hereditary hair loss affects about 30 million women in the United States, the American Academy of Dermatology says. Women with this trait tend to develop thinning at the hairline, behind the bangs, or they might notice more scalp showing or a widening part, Badreshia-Bansal says. The condition develops slowly and may start as early as your 20s.",
        "How to know for sure? A scalp biopsy can show if the hair follicles have been replaced with smaller follicles. That's a surefire sign of hereditary hair loss, she says. Applying minoxidil 2 % or 5% ( Rogaine ) to the scalp can stop further thinning, she says."
