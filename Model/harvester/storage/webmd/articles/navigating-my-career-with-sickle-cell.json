        "One area I've been reflecting on lately is how sickle cell has influenced my career journey. Living with a chronic illness affects more than just physical health. It shapes how we navigate work, relationships, and our sense of identity. For me, learning to manage sickle cell in professional spaces has been a long process of unlearning silence, confronting guilt, and eventually embracing honesty.",
        "My first job was at the Emirates Stadium, where I served food and drinks on match days. It was part-time, flexible, and allowed me the freedom to choose my work schedule. That flexibility made it manageable, and like most young people, I was just excited to be earning money. But even then, I remember how physically drained I felt after each shift. I didn't think much of it at the time; I just pushed through.",
        "Things shifted when I started working in retail more consistently. I took on a job in a department store. I began working both Saturdays and Sundays to fund driving lessons and cover university-related expenses. That's when I started to develop an unhealthy relationship with my health and work. I rarely called in sick, even when I knew I should have. If I did, it wasn't due to a sickle cell crisis. I'd tell my manager I had a stomach bug or the flu instead. I felt ashamed of my condition and convinced myself that revealing it would lead to judgment or pity."

I carried the same behavior into this new space, showing up unwell, underperforming, and deflecting concerned questions with vague excuses.
