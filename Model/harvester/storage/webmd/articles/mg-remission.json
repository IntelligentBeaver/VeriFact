But there are medical definitions for remission. You can read more about them by searching online for \"Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Post-intervention Status (MGFA-PIS).\" When talking about remission and myasthenia gravis, your doctor may use terms such as: Complete stable remission. Your doctor finds no evidence of disease activity or muscle weakness during a checkup, and you haven’t been on medical treatment for at least one year. This kind of remission is rare, but it’s possible. Pharmacological remission. You don’t have myasthenia gravis symptoms, but you still need medication or some form of treatment to control your disease. Most people who get to remission fit into this category. Minimal manifestations. Your disease is well-controlled, but you still have some muscle weakness and fatigue that comes and goes. But your symptoms aren’t so bad they stop you from daily activities.

But it’s important to check in with your medical team regularly even if you feel good. They can update you on the latest myasthenia gravis treatments and which ones might be right for you. Make sure you ask about vaccines at your next appointment. Most are safe for people with myasthenia gravis, and they can lessen the chances you’ll get very sick from certain infections, such as flu or COVID-19. Keep in mind that there’s no cure for myasthenia gravis, so you can still have an exacerbation or crisis after you get to remission. Your symptoms may worsen during pregnancy or when you: Take certain drugs. Taper off treatment. Have surgery. Get a bacterial or viral infection.",
