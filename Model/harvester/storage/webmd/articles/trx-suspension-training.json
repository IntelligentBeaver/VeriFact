        "TRX is a super-intense workout that can be adapted, but it's not for everyone. You need to have a basic level of fitness and coordination to get the most out of even the simplest TRX workouts and to be safe.",
        "You should have a trainer working with you to be sure your technique is on target to help avoid injuries.",
        "It is a great workout for you if you have limited time and space and are trying to get in or maintain top condition.",
        "If you are out of shape or new to the gym, go for a slower, beginner TRX workout to build strength and muscle. Add a good aerobic activity like walking to get you in top shape before lunging into using TRX as an aerobic workout.",
        "Do not attempt TRX if you have a medical problem, pain, or balance issues unless your doctor says it is OK. Otherwise, you will be setting yourself up for injury.",
        "Is It Good for Me if I Have a Health Condition?",
        "A solid aerobic program with some added strength-building is ideal for you if you have diabetes, as long as you have cleared it with your doctor. All of that muscle you build will burn more calories.",
        "Make sure you start out at the level of training that is right for you. You may need to check your blood sugar before, during, and after any intense workout. You will also have to talk to your doctor about what changes may be needed in your diabetes treatment plan.",
        "Aerobics and strength building are also keys in bringing down your weight, blood pressure , and “bad” cholesterol to help prevent heart disease .",
        "If you already have heart disease, you will need to check with your doctor before starting this or any other exercise program .",
        "If you have knee or back injuries, arthritis, or physical limitations of any kind, have your doctor clear you for TRX. By working with an experienced trainer, you may be able to develop a TRX program that works the rest of your muscles without putting added pressure on any painful joints or injured joints.",
        "If you have been doing a tough suspension workout like TRX before becoming pregnant, chances are your doctor will let you continue for a little while as long as you are not having any pregnancy-related problems. You will be able to take the stress off your joints and modify the workout to meet your changing needs. Work closely with a trainer who is very experienced working with pregnant women to be sure this is safe.",
