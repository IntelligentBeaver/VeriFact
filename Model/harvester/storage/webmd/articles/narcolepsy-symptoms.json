        "Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder that causes uncontrollable, severe daytime sleepiness that often happens at the wrong time and place. The daytime sleep attacks may come without warning, and you can have them multiple times a day. People with narcolepsy tend to sleep at night in fragments, waking up often.",
        "Estimates suggest that about 1 in 2,000 people have narcolepsy. But many experts believe that because sleepiness is a common symptom and narcolepsy is relatively rare, it is not the first thing doctors think of leading to a missed diagnosis.",
        "There could be 10 years between when symptoms begin and when you get a diagnosis. About half of adults with narcolepsy report that symptoms began in their teenage years. For most, narcolepsy begins between ages 15 and 30.",
        "You can get treatment for narcolepsy. It’s most effective when it combines medications with lifestyle changes like a regular nighttime sleep schedule and scheduled naps during the day."
