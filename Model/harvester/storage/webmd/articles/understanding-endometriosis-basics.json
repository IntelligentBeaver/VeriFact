        "Endometriosis is a common condition in women. It's chronic, it's painful, and it often gets steadily worse.",
        "Normally, the tissue that lines a woman's uterus, known as the endometrium, is found only in the uterus. But when a woman develops endometriosis, microscopic bits of this tissue grow on other organs such as the ovaries, the outer wall of the uterus, the fallopian tubes, the ligaments that support the uterus, the space between the uterus and the rectum, and the space between the uterus and the bladder. In rare cases, they can spread outside the abdomen and grow on other organs, such as the lungs.",
        "Just like the endometrium, the tissue responds to the hormones estrogen and progesterone by thickening, and it may bleed intermittently. But because the tissue is growing in other tissues, the blood it makes cannot escape. This causes irritation to the surrounding tissue, which causes cysts, scars, and the fusing of body tissues. This can eventually bind the reproductive organs together and lead to infertility ."
