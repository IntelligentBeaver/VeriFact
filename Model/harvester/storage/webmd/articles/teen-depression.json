And when you add hormone havoc to the many other changes happening in a teen's life, it's easy to see why their moods swing like a pendulum. Yet findings show that one out of every eight adolescents has teen depression. But depression can be treated as well as the serious problems that come with it. So if your teen's unhappiness lasts for more than two weeks and they display other symptoms of depression , it may be time to seek help from a health professional."
