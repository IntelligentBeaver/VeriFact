            "Medications: Powerful anti-inflammatory drugs called corticosteroids, usually prednisone, are tried first to help with symptoms. Your child will take these for a long time (sometimes for years). They can work quickly but often have side effects, some serious. Long-term use of corticosteroids may affect your child's bone growth and eyesight. Another drug, called methotrexate, is often given along with prednisone. Sometimes, non-steroid medications may be prescribed. They include IV immunoglobulin, azathioprine, cyclosporine,  hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil , and tacrolimus . For very severe symptoms, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs or rituximab may be used. Always ask your child's doctor about the expected side effects.",
            "Physical therapy (PT): Your child's therapist will teach them stretches and exercises to strengthen muscles and prevent weakness.",
            "Speech therapy: JDM can damage the muscles your child uses to talk. Speech therapy can help.",
            "Dietary help: Muscle weakness in your child's tongue , throat, and neck can make it difficult for them to chew and swallow food. Soft foods can be easier to eat. A registered dietician can show you how to make a proper, balanced food plan. More protein may be recommended to make up for muscle damage. If eating is especially difficult, your child may need a feeding tube."
