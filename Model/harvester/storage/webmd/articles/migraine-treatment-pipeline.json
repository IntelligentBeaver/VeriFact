        "Chronic migraine can be very exhausting and affect your quality of life. If you have chronic migraine — migraine with pain, nausea, or sensitivity to light or sound for 15 or more days per month – you’re not alone. Up to 15% of people experience migraine attacks at some point in their lives, but only between 1% and 2.2% experience chronic migraine. And while the number of people getting chronic migraine isn’t increasing, research shows that the condition is causing more disability.",
        "The difference between treating acute migraine attacks (those that occur occasionally) and chronic migraine lies in the approach. The goal is to lower how often you get a migraine or prevent it entirely. There is a lot of ongoing chronic migraine research to find treatments for this painful condition, and more and more people are finding relief.",

Researchers are now studying more treatments, from ones that prevent migraine attacks from starting to “abortive” drugs that stop them as they begin."
