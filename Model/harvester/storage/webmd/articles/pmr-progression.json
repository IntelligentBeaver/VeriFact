        "If you’re diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), your doctor will most likely recommend that you start a treatment of a low-dose glucocorticoid such as prednisone . Most of the time, you’ll get better. But sometimes your symptoms don’t improve, or even get worse. And about half of all people with polymyalgia rheumatica eventually relapse. If you do notice that symptoms return, or worsen, it’s very important that you let your doctor know. PMR often worsens if it’s left untreated. You may get stiffer and stiffer, until you can no longer go to work, run errands, do things with your family, and generally do all the activities of daily living. But with the right treatment, your symptoms should get better, and you’ll be able to live your life much in the way you’re used to."
