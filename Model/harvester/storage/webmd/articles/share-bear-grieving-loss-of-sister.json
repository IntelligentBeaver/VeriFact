        "Growing up, my sister, Mary, and I shared a bedroom. When I was about 11, I received a teddy bear as a gift. Inside the bear was a music box, and I enjoyed hearing the music coming from that bear so much that I made the little thing play and play until off to sleep I went. Of course, Mary, being one year older, took every opportunity to let me know how childish I was, but nothing stopped me.",
        "One night I pretended to be asleep, and when that brown bear ran out of music, just who do you think came over to my bed to make the bear play again? Yep, my dear sister Mary, that's who. I sprang up in bed and said, \"Gotcha!\" She confessed that every night when I fell asleep first, she would come over and make my bear play for her.",
        "We both grew up. About four years ago, Mary was at my house having a not so good day. She had contracted hepatitis C in her late teens, but after years of the virus lying dormant, it began wreaking havoc on her body, especially her liver . On this day, she said she just didn't have any good memories from her past. I ran up the stairs and into the bedroom. I put our little bear behind my back, and back down the stairs I flew."
