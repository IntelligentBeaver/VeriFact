        "How can we talk about food allergies without talking about meal planning?! When my daughters were younger, I used to cook the same meal for the entire family, but I realized that I didn’t always enjoy the food they could eat. I wanted cheese made from dairy! I’ve learned to cook one main entree and split the rest of the meal to accommodate the entire family. Now we have pasta dishes made with cheese and pasta dishes made without cheese, and it works for us!",
        "When it comes to daily life, eating at home is by far the easiest way. Still, I wanted to enjoy my food without being overwhelmed. I know what they can eat, what brands to buy, and which favorites work for the entire family. The most planning involved is simply making sure I purchase the right products and decide what to cook for the day. Some of our staple foods include chicken nuggets, fries, gluten-free pastas, bread, sunflower seed butter, various deli meats, lots of fruit and vegetables, fresh poultry, and plenty of snacks. Sounds typical for a family with young children, right? The challenge is that we cannot and do not always want to eat at home. We are a family on the go.  What is the plan for the day? What’s on the menu?"

        "For starters, we always eat a full breakfast at home. The busier the day, the bigger the breakfast. Next, where are we going? Will they have safe food for the girls? Do they have food options on the way to our destination? Menu planning is already a daily task for all parents, but for me it is the primary concern. Menu planning outside the home usually includes looking up allergen menus, checking for cross-contamination, and making phone calls to hosts or restaurants. For this reason, we ALWAYS travel with a backup plan. Whether we are going to run errands or to a family function, we are going to have snacks.",
        "Meal planning is more than food being cooked at home -- it’s an entire lifestyle. It involves making alternative selections for well-known recipes, lots of research, but most importantly, it involves being prepared. Food alternatives are not always accessible, nor are they always available at regular grocery stores. Sometimes purchasing safe products includes going to multiple places. It involves learning where to go to purchase the food options that are best for your family."
