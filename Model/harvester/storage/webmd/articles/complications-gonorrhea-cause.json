        "Untreated gonorrhea can cause infections of the fallopian tubes , cervix , uterus, and abdomen . This is called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). It can permanently damage the reproductive system and make you infertile (not able to have children).",
        "PID is treated with antibiotics. If you put off treatment, the infection can scar the fallopian tubes. This raises your risk for chronic pelvic pain and ectopic pregnancy . A healthy pregnancy starts when a sperm fertilizes an egg in the fallopian tube. The fertilized egg moves into the uterus within a few days. The embryo then settles into the uterine lining, where the baby grows and develops for the next 9 months or so.",
        "In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tube, where an embryo is unable to develop. Scarring caused by PID can block a fallopian tube, preventing the embryo’s passage to the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency because it can lead to uncontrolled bleeding and even death to the mother."
