        "Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a group of genetic conditions that cause the growth of tumors that affect the nervous system. These tumors occur along the nerves anywhere in the body. It's not a type of cancer, but sometimes the tumors in NF can become cancerous. About 1 in 2,000 babies are born with NF. Four million people have been diagnosed with it around the world.",
        "Symptoms of neurofibromatosis can vary from person to person, depending on the type, and they may worsen over time. Your doctor can help manage your or your child's symptoms and try to prevent complications. Although there's no cure for neurofibromatosis, lifelong care options – which can include medications, targeted therapies, surgery, speech or physical therapy, devices to help you hear and see better, and mental health support – may help to manage symptoms and shrink tumors.",
