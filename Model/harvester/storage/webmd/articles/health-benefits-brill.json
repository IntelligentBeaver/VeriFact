        "Search “what is brill fish” online, and you’ll find that it’s one of many types of flatfish. Brill may be known by other names, such as California sole, round-nosed sole, flounder, and Jordan’s flounder. In the U.S., brill’s official name is petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani). Its home range in the Pacific Ocean stretches from Alaska to Baja California.",
        "When caught, most brill weigh 1-2 pounds. Adult female brill measure up to 24 inches in length, while adult males grow up to 18 inches. Like other types of flatfish, brill spend most of their time on the ocean floor. They position their flat, oval-shaped bodies sideways with one side lying on the ground. As they grow, the eye facing the ground moves to the side facing up, making this fish “right-eyed.” Their bottom side is typically whitish-pink, while their top side is light or dark brown."
