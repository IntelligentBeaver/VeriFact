        "The types of abnormal cells that form oligodendroglioma are called oligodendrocytes. They surround your brain and spinal cord. When they’re normal, they support your nerve fibers located there.",

Secondary brain cancers are more common than primary ones. Those are cancers that start in other parts of your body, such as your breasts or lungs , and spread to your brain.",

        "Most of these cases are adults. Children and infants can also get oligodendroglioma, but it’s even more rare."

        "Oligodendroglioma is a rare type of brain tumor. Doctors classify these tumors as grade 2 (slow growing) or grade 3 (faster growing and more aggressive). The most common first symptom is seizures, though headaches, memory issues, weakness, and vision changes can also happen. Treatments like surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy can help manage it, but oligodendroglioma isn't considered curable because it often comes back. Many people, especially with grade 2 tumors, can live for years, sometimes more than a decade after diagnosis."
