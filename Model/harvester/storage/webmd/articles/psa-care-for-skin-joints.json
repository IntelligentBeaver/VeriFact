        "Managing psoriatic arthritis symptoms is more than just taking your medications. Simple lifestyle changes and home remedies can protect your skin, nails, and joints too. There are things you can do to: Relieve symptoms like joint pain or fatigue Lower your risk of joint injury or nail damage Help your medications work better Help prevent psoriasis skin outbreaks Simple changes to how you do daily tasks can prevent joint injuries and pain from psoriatic arthritis. Try protective tools and gadgets to prevent finger injuries. Use grips or jar openers when you grasp or twist a lid. Lift heavy objects with both hands. Push doors open with your body, not your outstretched hands. Switch your stance. As you work at your desk or watch TV on your sofa, move body positions often. Sit up straight instead of slouching in a chair. Good posture and positioning helps prevent joint injury and fatigue, and it keeps your joints working well. Get regular exercise. Exercises like swimming, walking, or biking are easy on your joints. They help keep your muscles toned and your joints flexible. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist before you start an exercise program. And start slow. Overdoing it can cause joint pain or a psoriatic arthritis flare."
