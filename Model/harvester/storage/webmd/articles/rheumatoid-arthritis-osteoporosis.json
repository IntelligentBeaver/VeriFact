        "When you have rheumatoid arthritis (RA), you expect painful or stiff joints. But did you know RA also can make your bones weaker and more likely to break?",
        "That's because RA raises your risk of getting osteoporosis, a condition that makes your bones porous or not as dense and strong as they should be to hold up your weight. When this happens, even a minor slip or tumble can cause a painful crack or fracture. The bones most likely to break are in your hips, spine, and wrists.",
        "Osteoporosis is very common, especially as you age. People at higher risk include women, particularly after menopause; people with thin frames; smokers; and people who don't get enough calcium or aren't active.",
        "There are reasons RA makes you more likely to get osteoporosis:"

        "Inflammation : When you have RA, you have inflammation all over your body, especially in your joints. They can swell and break down. That can weaken your bones around the joints affected by RA, like the joints in your hands. Our bodies are always making new bone to replace bone that breaks down. But RA inflammation breaks this cycle. It speeds up your bone loss and slows the making of new bone to replace it. Your bones get weaker, and that leads to osteoporosis. Inflammation also may make it harder for your body to absorb nutrients it needs to keep your bones strong, like calcium or vitamin D.",
        "Pain makes you inactive: RA can make you feel stiff, achy, or so tired that you don't feel like getting off the couch. Physical activity, like walking, helps keep your bones strong. If you don't exercise, your bones can get weaker over time. If RA keeps you from being active, you're at higher risk for osteoporosis.",
        "Steroid drugs: Corticosteroid drugs like prednisone (Deltasone) can weaken your bones if you take them for a long time. Some people with RA need to take these medications to help with bad flares of inflammation. The drugs can quickly ease pain and swelling so you can get moving again. But they can make it harder for your body to absorb calcium and vitamin D in your diet. These nutrients help you build strong bones. Your osteoporosis risk is even higher if you're a woman past menopause and have taken steroids for 6 months or more."
