        "Surgery is an important part of treatment for most people with breast cancer . Depending on the size of the cancer and other factors, your surgeon will remove just the part of your breast that contains cancer (lumpectomy ) or the whole breast (mastectomy ). Either type of surgery can change your appearance. Your breast(s) will look different afterward. You might embrace your new look. Or you may decide to have breast reconstruction, using implants or tissue from other parts of your body to restore the size and shape of your breast. The choice is up to you. Some people choose not to have breast reconstruction and instead opt to \"go flat.\" If you decide to get breast implants, you have options. Picking the right type of implant for you is a very personal decision – one you'll make after discussing your options with a plastic surgeon. That conversation will be easier if you go into it knowing how breast implants work, what their risks and benefits are, and how long they last."

        "Breast cancer implants consist of a round or teardrop-shaped outer shell made from a rubber-like material called silicone. The outer surface is either smooth or textured (uneven). The inner shell contains saline or silicone gel. Saline implants are filled with salt water. The water is sterile, meaning it's germ-free. Some saline implants come prefilled. Others are filled during the implant surgery. Silicone implants contain a thick silicone gel. The silicone makes them feel more like a natural breast. Another type of silicone implant, nicknamed the \"gummy bear\" implant, has been in use since the mid-2000s. It's made from a thicker silicone gel that holds its shape better than saline or regular silicone implants, even if the outer shell breaks open. A newer kind of implant called the Ideal implant combines the benefits of saline and silicone breast implants. It's filled with saline, but it has an inner and outer shell that help it hold its shape like a silicone implant. Benefits of saline breast implants Saline implants have been around since the 1960s, and they have a long history of safety. Most implant procedures today use saline. Saline implants also cost less than silicone ones. If a saline implant ever forms a hole or tear (ruptures), your body will harmlessly absorb any salt water that leaks out."

        "Saline implants may not look as smooth or feel as soft as silicone. Because they're filled with fluid, you might notice some rippling in the breast. And if the implant ruptures, your breast will gradually flatten out and get smaller. Removing the old implant and replacing it with a new one requires a minor procedure. Benefits of silicone gel breast implants Silicone gel has a thicker texture, which makes these implants look and feel more like natural breasts. They're soft enough to move when you touch them, but still firm enough to hold their shape. Silicone gives the breasts a smoother look that's less likely to ripple than saline implants. Drawbacks of silicone gel breast implants Between 9% and 24% of silicone implants rupture. When ruptures happen, they're hard to detect. Doctors call them \"silent ruptures\" because you usually can't see or feel the silicone leaking. Silicone that leaks out can irritate tissues around the breast and cause scar tissue to form. The scar tissue could cause problems in your breast, including: Lumps Pain Swelling Changes in the size or shape Hardened scar tissue, called capsular contracture Loss of feeling in the breast"

        "If a silicone implant ruptures, you'll likely need to have it removed. The surgery is more complicated than it would be with a saline implant because you may also need a capsulectomy procedure to remove scar tissue from around the implant. The scar tissue that forms around the implant is called a tissue capsule. To find leaks before they cause problems, the FDA suggests getting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ) screening three years after the silicone implant surgery, and every two years after that. There have been some concerns that leaking silicone breast implants might increase the risk for breast cancer, pregnancy problems, and connective tissue diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus . So far there is no evidence to link silicone implants with any of these health problems. A very small number of people with breast implants have been diagnosed with breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma . BIA-ALCL affects people with saline and silicone implants equally. But it happens more often with textured implants than with smooth ones. There have also been rare reports of squamous cell carcinoma and other types of lymphoma growing in the capsule around the implant."

        "Breast reconstruction surgery can be done at the same time as mastectomy (immediate reconstruction) or at a later date (delayed reconstruction). Even with immediate reconstruction you'll need at least two surgeries. Breast implant placement is a two-step process. Step 1: Breast tissue expansion In the same surgery as mastectomy or later, the surgeon will place a tissue expander in front of or behind your chest muscle. The expander looks like a deflated balloon. You'll visit the doctor's office every week or two to get injections of saline into the balloon through a port in your skin . The saline will slowly stretch your skin to the breast size you want. This process can take a few months. You may feel some pressure or discomfort as your skin stretches. Some doctors use carbon dioxide instead of saline to stretch the skin. Carbon dioxide may be less uncomfortable than saline. Step 2: Implant placement The next step is to remove the tissue expander and replace it with the saline or silicone implant. You may need to wait to have the implant placed until you finish chemotherapy or other treatments. Some surgeons attach surgical mesh to the chest muscle to form a pocket that holds the implant in place. The mesh gives the implant a more natural shape."

But you'll have to wait at least four months after implant placement to give your breasts time to heal and settle into their final position. A small number of women can have the implant placed in the same procedure as mastectomy. After the surgeon removes the breast tissue, the plastic surgeon places the implant without using a tissue expander. Direct-to-implant reconstruction works best if you are young, have small breasts, and are healthy overall."

You can decide to remove the implants and go flat, or get an implant replacement. Your plastic surgeon may also remove scar tissue and do a breast lift during the replacement procedure."
