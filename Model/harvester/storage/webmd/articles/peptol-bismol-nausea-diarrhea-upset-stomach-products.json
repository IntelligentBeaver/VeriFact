        "Pepto Bismol products are usually used to help with nausea, heartburn , indigestion , upset stomach, or diarrhea. The active ingredient in most Pepto Bismol products is bismuth subsalicylate. It seems to work by coating and protecting the inside of your stomach. It also seems to reduce inflammation and can lower the amount of liquid going into your intestines, making your poop less watery.",
        "There are two Pepto Bismol products specifically for nausea: one is a dietary supplement containing ginger, and the other uses meclizine to prevent and relieve nausea. Meclizine seems to work by blocking the effect of a substance in your body called histamine. Ginger contains chemicals that may help ease nausea. There are also two children’s Pepto Bismol products for tummy troubles: one is a dietary supplement containing calcium, and another contains calcium carbonate. Calcium antacids neutralize your stomach acid. This helps reduce indigestion, heartburn, and upset or sour stomach.",
