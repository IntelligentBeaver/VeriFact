While some persimmons are spherical, others have the shape of an acorn or pumpkin. In size, they can be anywhere from the size of a half-dollar to a small grapefruit.",
        "When choosing a persimmon to eat, it is important to know whether it is astringent or non-astringent.

American persimmon varieties are only astringent. The most popular is the Hachiya persimmon.",
