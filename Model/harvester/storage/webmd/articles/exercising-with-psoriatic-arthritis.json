        "When diagnosed with an autoimmune disease like psoriatic arthritis, the idea of exercising can be hard to imagine and hard to physically carry out. I understand the need for exercise. It is good for me. It's good for the heart and the rest of the cardiovascular system when I exercise regularly. I am told to exercise 3 or more days a week for at least 20 to 30 minutes at a time. That doesn’t seem like a lot, but I struggle with this.",
        "I like to take walks with my dog, but with the heat in the summer in the South, we can’t walk far. It’s difficult to breathe in the hot, humid air for both my dog and for me. I don’t do well when I get overheated, and so I end up too exhausted to do anything else the rest of the day. Swimming and water aerobics have always been wonderful ways to move around and take the weight off the joints. I love the feeling of weightlessness in the water. I can spend hours in the water and not even realize how much exercise I have been doing. Also, water exercises in the pool can be outdoors or indoors. So living in a hot state like mine, I can always take it inside."

        "If I am moving my joints and getting my heart rate up, it doesn’t really matter the choice of movement unless it is something that is too much stress on the joints or the body as a whole. I love to dance. I was introduced to belly dancing almost 14 years ago, and I love the fluidity of it and how I can isolate certain areas of the body that may need more work on certain days and not touch other areas that are too inflamed or painful to move. I feel better when I am belly dancing, and the music is fun to listen to while moving.",
        "With psoriatic arthritis comes fatigue, pain, and decreased mobility. On days with more fatigue, more pain, and decreased mobility, I find it so difficult to get myself moving, let alone exercising. On days like this, I move a little bit at a time, taking baby steps to increase my movement throughout the day toward a form of exercise that works best for me. I may not get a full 30 minutes on these days, but at least I keep moving. The fact is that moving is better than lying around all day. The only time I choose to skip exercise altogether is when I am flaring. If everything is inflamed more than the usual state, and if my fatigue is so bad that I find it difficult to lift my water bottle to my mouth to drink it, then I should not try to exercise on that day. I wouldn’t want to injure myself."

        "My exercise of choice is dancing, and I especially love to belly dance. As a child, I was a ballet dancer, but ballet is out of the question for me now. The stress on the body as a ballet dancer does not make any sense with a disease of the joints like psoriatic arthritis. I find that the movement of belly dancing keeps my body fluid, and my joints do well with the smooth movement. I can isolate each body part and work on those areas that don't have too much inflammation. I may work on the arms, neck, head, and chest on the same day and the hips, legs, feet, and lower back on a different day.",
        "I also can do the belly dance movements while seated, and I can do this on days when I am more fatigued and have less energy to stand for 20 to 30 minutes for a belly dance workout. I can still work my upper body and lower body. I have started teaching chair belly dance movements to others with psoriatic arthritis and other spondylarthritis diseases as well. All have agreed that the movements are amazing! They are fluid, and body parts can move smoothly."

        "Having psoriatic arthritis has made me understand that my joints and my body as a whole need movement. I may not always be able to exercise as I would like, but I find time to move, even if just to stretch and stand up and walk around my house to get everything moving. I have come to realize that if I do a little bit of movement or exercise each day, it becomes easier, and I look forward to doing it each day. I feel better when I move.",

I can put on my favorite music playlist and start moving with belly dancing. The belly dancing for me is the most fun. I can make it easier or harder depending on how I am feeling, and I can do it standing or in a chair. Even remarkably simple belly dance movements can help my joints to move more smoothly because of the movements themselves being so fluid."
