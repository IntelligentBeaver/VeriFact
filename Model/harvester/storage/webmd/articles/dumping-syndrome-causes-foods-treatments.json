        "Dumping syndrome is a cluster of symptoms you may have when your stomach moves food into your small intestine faster than it should. For this reason, it's also sometimes called rapid gastric emptying. When food moves through your stomach too fast, your intestine gets a large amount of poorly digested food. This causes symptoms such as nausea , belly cramps, bloating, and diarrhea. It may also cause fast changes in your blood sugar.",

        "Dumping syndrome is usually caused by changes to your stomach after surgery. For instance, dumping syndrome is common after gastric bypass surgery, in which part of your stomach is removed. The good news is that the symptoms usually go away with time. Although you may find dumping syndrome alarming at first, it is not life-threatening. You can control it by making changes in what and how you eat."
