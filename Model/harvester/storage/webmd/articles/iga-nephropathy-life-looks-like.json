        "Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is a disease that damages the tiny filters inside the kidneys. It affects each person in a different way. Some people with IgA nephropathy don't have any problems for many years and may never have any significant issues. Others develop kidney failure and need dialysis or a kidney transplant. When you have IgA nephropathy, it's important to take care of your kidneys to keep them healthy. To do that, you may need to make some changes to your daily routine. Eat a kidney-friendly diet, see your doctor for regular checkups, take the medicines your doctor prescribed, and watch for symptoms of kidney damage. Learn what day-to-day life looks like with IgA nephropathy. And find out how to manage your disease and protect your kidneys."

        "A well-balanced diet and exercise will help you feel better while you treat IgA nephropathy. One of the most important diet changes you can make is to eat less salt. Extra salt raises your blood pressure. High blood pressure narrows and weakens the blood vessels inside your kidneys so less blood can flow through them. A lack of blood in your kidneys can damage these organs. The guidelines for people with CKD recommend targeting an intake of less than 2 grams of sodium per day. (One tablespoon of salt contains about 2,300 milligrams of sodium.) Ask your doctor how much salt is safe for you. You may also need to eat less protein because it can be hard for your kidneys to process. Also try to eat less saturated fat and cholesterol. Cut out or limit high-fat foods like beef, butter, and whole milk. Fat and cholesterol form sticky deposits called plaques in your arteries . Plaque can damage the blood vessels in your kidneys. Kidney disease can make you lose muscle. To keep your muscles strong, try to exercise as often as you can. A daily walk, swim, bike ride, or resistance training with weights can improve your overall health and muscle strength."
