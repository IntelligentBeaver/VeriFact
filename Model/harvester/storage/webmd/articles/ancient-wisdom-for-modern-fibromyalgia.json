        "Fibromyalgia is an unorthodox diagnosis and therefore requires unorthodox solutions. Living with fibromyalgia, you experience mental, physical, and emotional symptoms. I found that the best way to approach an intersectional diagnosis is with a holistic approach that considers all parts of you. This doesn’t look like Western medicine’s typical treatments. Instead, I’ve relied on the rest of the world’s ancient wisdom for finding balance and harmony for the mind, body, and spirit. With fibromyalgia, the goal is not to find a magic cure, but to achieve the quality of your life you deserve. Pursuing alternative methods has helped me achieve this goal and drastically transformed my life for the better.",
        "At first, I relied solely on the muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and anti-inflammatory medications my doctors prescribed. Although those treatments all served a function at some point, they ultimately began negatively affecting me and were not long-term solutions. To find relief elsewhere, I began scheduling weekly massages. My massage therapist introduced me to the idea of focusing on holistic health practices such as nutrition and movement. Understanding, introducing, and practicing holistic health approaches does not happen overnight. Creating a lifestyle change took years of guidance, trial and error, and discipline."

        "I’ve been fortunate to find guidance and inspiration from so many beautiful communities worldwide. During my study abroad in South Africa I spent time at a holistic health clinic that used herbal remedies, cupping, acupuncture, and various Ayurvedic therapies to treat their patients. During my internship in Vietnam, I was introduced to the healing power of their herbal teas, including the Reishi mushroom powers. In pursuit of knowledge, I was not only introduced to methods of healing that have been used long before me to treat people but also to a connection to people that often as a chronic illness warrior I don’t experience.",
        "Exploring communities who accept, understand, and treat their bodies holistically was empowering. Instead of focusing on Band-Aids over symptoms, we can address all parts of you. A community emphasis on healing and connection reminds you that your body is not built wrong. That you’re not malfunctioning because you cannot keep up with the demands of society. But instead, you are tasked with constantly reconnecting and grounding yourself. Now when I drink my herbal teas and focus on breath work, I do not feel alone in my pursuit of healing. I feel connected to the hundreds of years of people who found solace in these sacred practices. The healing rituals that continue to be practiced, from South Africa to Vietnam, and to me in Chicago."
