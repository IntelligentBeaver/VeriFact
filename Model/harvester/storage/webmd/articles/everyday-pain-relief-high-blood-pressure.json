        "Side effects and risks. Experts believe that acetaminophen is safe for people with high blood pressure. Very high doses of acetaminophen can cause serious liver damage. Long-term use of acetaminophen in high doses -- especially when combined with caffeine (Excedrin) or codeine (Tylenol with codeine) can cause kidney disease. Acetaminophen doesn't reduce swelling, like aspirin and other NSAIDs do. It may be less helpful in treating pain that's caused by inflammation, such as some types of arthritis.",

        "Benefits. Aspirin eases pain and lowers fevers. It can also reduce inflammation, which means that it can treat the symptom (pain) and sometimes the cause (swelling.) Aspirin also lowers the risk of heart attacks and strokes, particularly in people at high risk of these problems. Usually, only very low daily doses -- 81 milligrams or one baby aspirin -- are recommended for cardiovascular protection. Other NSAIDs (like ibuprofen ketoprofen, or naproxen sodium) and acetaminophen do not have this effect. However, you should never start taking aspirin daily without talking with your doctor first.",
        "Side effects and risks. Aspirin can impair the effects of common blood pressure medicines like A CE inhibitors (such as Lotensin, Capoten, and Vasotec) and beta blockers (such as Coreg, Lopressor, and Corgard.) If you use any medicine for high blood pressure, ask your doctor if it's safe to use aspirin. Aspirin can also cause heartburn, upset stomach, pain, or ulcers even in very low doses. It can be dangerous for people with liver disease, gout , juvenile arthritis, or rheumatic fever. Pregnant women shouldn't use aspirin, since it can harm the mother and cause birth defects. Unless your health care provider says it's OK, children and teenagers should not use aspirin because it puts them at risk of Reye's syndrome. Some people have an allergy to aspirin. It can cause wheezing, hives , facial swelling, and shock. Rarely, aspirin can cause ringing in the ears and hearing loss. While inflammation can cause pain, it's often a key part of the body's natural healing process. Since this medicine at high doses can prevent inflammation, it can also slow down recovery after certain injuries."
