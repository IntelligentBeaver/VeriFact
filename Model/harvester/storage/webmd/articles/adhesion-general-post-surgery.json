        "Adhesions are scar tissue that form between two structures or organs inside the body that are not normally connected to each other. Adhesions may appear as thin sheets of tissue similar to plastic wrap or as thick fibrous bands.",
        "The adhesion develops when the body's repair mechanisms respond to any tissue disturbance, such as surgery, infection, trauma, or radiation , resulting in inflammation. Although adhesions can occur anywhere, the most common locations are within the abdominal cavity, the pelvis, and the heart ."

        "Abdominal adhesions: Abdominal adhesions are a common complication of surgery, occurring in up to 93% of people who undergo abdominal or pelvic surgery. Abdominal adhesions also occur in about 10% of people who have never had surgery. Most adhesions are painless and do not cause complications. However, adhesions cause about 60% of small bowel obstructions in adults. Adhesions typically begin to form within the first few days after surgery, but they may not produce symptoms for months, years, or even never. As scar tissue begins to restrict motion of the small intestines , passing food through the digestive system becomes progressively more difficult. The bowel may become blocked. In extreme cases, adhesions may form fibrous bands around a segment of an intestine. This constricts blood flow and leads to tissue death.",
        "Pelvic adhesions: Pelvic adhesions may involve any organ within the pelvis, such as the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, or bladder , and usually occur after surgery. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) results from an infection (usually a sexually transmitted disease) that frequently leads to adhesions within the fallopian tubes. A woman's eggs pass through their fallopian tubes into their uterus for reproduction. Fallopian adhesions can lead to infertility and an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancy in which a fertilized egg develops outside the uterus. Endometriosis, a condition in which tissue normally found inside the uterus grows in other parts of the body such as the bowel or fallopian tubes, may also be caused by pelvic adhesions. Pelvic adhesions are believed to contribute to the development of chronic pelvic pain .",
        "Pleural adhesions: Adhesions may form around the lungs after pneumonia, tuberculosis, rheumatologic or autoimmune disease (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), or surgery.",
        "Heart adhesions: Scar tissue may form within the membranes that surround the heart (pericardial sac), thus restricting heart function. Infections, such as rheumatic arthritis, may lead to adhesions forming on heart valves and can lead to decreased heart efficiency."
