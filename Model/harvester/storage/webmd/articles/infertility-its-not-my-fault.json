        "April 3, 2000 (Atlanta) -- A friend of mine, whom I'll call \"Tom,\" found himself in his wife's gynecologist 's office, masturbating into a cup. Tom didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Infertility is no laughing matter, but as he found out, a sense of humor helps.",
        "Surprisingly, most male infertility testing is done at gynecological offices. Men are just as likely to be infertile as women (40% of cases are attributed to men, 40% to women, and 20% to both). But women typically seek treatment first. When the cause of the problem doesn't lie with them, they often have to drag their husbands to the gynecologist.",

And like Tom, many will have a tough time imagining that they could be the cause of their wife's inability to conceive. \"Men come in embarrassed, scared, and incredulous,\" says Larry Lipshultz, M.D., the clinical director of the Laboratory for Male Reproductive Research and Testing in Houston, Texas. \"Incredulous that they have a problem, given that they feel so healthy.\""

Of these, only some 40 sperm survive ejaculation and the toxicity of the vaginal environment to reach the egg and become serious contenders for conception . That's not many, even with a sperm count of 300 million. But when sperm counts fall below normal, the chances of conception plummet.

Heads that are rounded, pinpointed, or crooked are signs of impaired sperm formation that can make it difficult for the cells to reach the egg. \"It's important that sperm move quickly and straight forward,\" says Schriock, \"because they have to swim through layers of cells around the egg before they can penetrate the egg itself.\""
