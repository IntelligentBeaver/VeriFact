Chemotherapy is $2,000 to $3,000, and then radiation can be $5,000 or $6,000. (Note: These are costs for treatment at a specialist. Prices at a general veterinary practice may be much less. Costs may also vary a lot depending on where you live.)",

But it all depends on the tumor type, when it is found, and how it is treated."
