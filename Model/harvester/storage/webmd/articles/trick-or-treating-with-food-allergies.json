        "I am one of those people who likes to start celebrating all things fall as early as right after the Fourth of July, hardly giving summer a chance to complete its season. Halloween is admittedly one of my favorite holidays, second only to Christmas. I love the fun, the décor, the excitement, the playfulness, and the innocence of it all. Trick-or-treating, trunk-or-treating, costumes, candy, bobbing for apples, caramel apples, you name it! I love it. It is natural for parents to want to share things that they love with their children. So naturally, when my son was diagnosed with anaphylactic peanut allergy, it felt like a punch in the gut to us both. I felt as though the innocence of this fun holiday would be swept away before he ever got the chance to enjoy it with carefree abandon.",
        "Can My Child Enjoy Halloween with Food Allergies? Yes!",
        "Just as I never allowed food allergies to stop us when it came to dining out, cooking, or doing arts and crafts, I knew we would find a way to overcome this obstacle as well. Having food allergies doesn’t mean that people cannot still live a whole, full life. They just need to be creative in doing it differently. Halloween remains a fan favorite in our home because we made an intentional effort to find innovative ways to create that same magic despite a food allergy."

It’s one less opportunity for exposure. I know of some who have their child wear gloves that appear to match the costume, but mainly serve as an extra barrier to touching allergens. Remind your child that if they do accidentally touch an allergen-containing candy to let you know, so you can help them clean their hands. One way allergens can enter the body is by touching the face, and then entering the eyes, nose, or mouth. We remind our child with food allergies frequently to avoid touching his face until he can get home to wash his hands well."

We then have a second person go through the candy for a “second eye” to catch any mistakes. A common phrase we use when we clean out candy is, “When in doubt, throw it out.” Any candy that is not allergen-friendly is either donated somewhere or given to the Switch Witch."
