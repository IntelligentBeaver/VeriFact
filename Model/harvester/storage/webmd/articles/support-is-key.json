        "Do you have psoriatic arthritis? Does someone you know and love have psoriatic arthritis? If so, it is so important to provide not only yourself with a support system, but also support your loved ones with it as well. How do you build a support system? What does it look like and feel like? And how can you help support your loved ones dealing with PsA every day?",
        "Building your own support system when you are battling a chronic illness is crucial. First and foremost, you must identify your needs. Try to consider what you need and want from your support system, what you value in others, and also what boundaries you want to set. After identifying your needs, it is vital to build relationships with people who positively affect your life, uplift you, are trustworthy and reliable! Sometimes, it can be family, sometimes it can be friends, and sometimes it can be people you work with or live near. Don’t be afraid to reach out to family and friends who are willing to help you. You can share your needs and concerns with them."

I always try to tell my family and friends how much I appreciate all that they do for me on a daily basis, and I make sure they know I will always be there for them as well.

You just never know when you will meet someone you relate to, who gets you, who listens to you, and will be there for you no matter what."

        "Trust is another huge component to building your support system. You want family, friends, colleagues, and neighbors you can trust. Without trust there is no way to feel comfortable or safe to ask for help. Asking for help can be really difficult, but if you feel like you can trust someone and be open and honest with them, then you know they will support you no matter what you are dealing with. Once the trust is there, your bond will strengthen and your support system will be unbreakable!",
        "Doctors and therapists can also be a part of your support system. If you find yourself struggling and don’t have a lot of family or friends you can rely on, your doctors or therapists can be the ones that support you. Make sure you have a team of doctors you can talk to openly about your needs and concerns, and also doctors that are available in case an emergency comes up. Finding doctors and therapists  who are empathetic and listen to you is so important. Stay away from any doctors or therapists who gaslight you, don’t listen to your needs, and dismiss your symptoms.",
        "If you have a family member or friend dealing with PsA, it is crucial to offer them support right away. Be patient, understanding, and empathetic. It can be extremely hard to understand what they are going through, but you need to be a great listener and let them vent. Let them tell you how they feel and what they are going through. Let them just have a shoulder to cry on when they need it the most. Sometimes, just letting them vent about their day, their feelings, and what is bothering them will make a huge difference. Tell them you are there for them through the good times and the bad times. Tell them that they can rely on you if they need you. Tell them they can trust you with anything you tell them. You can even educate yourself about PsA to become more knowledgeable about their symptoms and what you can do to help."

        "Another way to support your loved ones dealing with PsA is to ask them if they need anything or if they need help with anything. I am someone who never asks for help or wants to ask for help. If someone in my support system asks me, I am more than willing to share what I need or want, and also what I need help with. It makes me feel more comfortable to share if they ask me first. Just by asking, you are opening the door for a conversation, and you are also showing you are there for them and ready to help in whatever capacity that may be. They may just need a hug, some words of encouragement, maybe a ride to the doctor, help with grocery shopping, someone to go with them to the doctor, or just a nonjudgmental ear to listen. You never know what your loved one may need or want, but just by asking, you’re offering your support in so many ways."
