I played rec volleyball. I had just bought a house. I was doing all of the things for someone my age, but I had this dark shadow over my life that no one could figure out.",

But over time, my itching was so bad I would wake up with bloody and torn sheets from scratching so vigorously. My family thought it was a nut allergy, and they would adjust to make sure I didn't come in contact with nuts. With all of these changes, my symptoms persisted."
