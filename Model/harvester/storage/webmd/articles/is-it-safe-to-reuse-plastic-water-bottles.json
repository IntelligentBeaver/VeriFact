        "Plastics are made from oil or natural gas, which are made of molecules called hydrocarbons. When you heat hydrocarbons to very high temperatures, they break down into smaller molecules called monomers. There are many types of hydrocarbon monomers, such as methane, ethane, propane, and butane.",
        "To make plastic, monomers are joined together to make a larger molecule called a polymer. The different types of plastic polymers are made of different combinations of monomers. These polymers are formed into pellets, powders, flakes, or liquids, which are the raw plastic material.",
        "At the bottling factory, the raw plastic is put into a machine that heats it to a high temperature so that it becomes a liquid. The liquid is then injected into a bottle-shaped mold where it hardens.",
        "There are two groups of polymers: thermoset and thermoplastics. Thermoset plastics are made of polymers made with chemical bonds that can’t be reversed. Once these plastics are molded, they can’t be broken down. Bakelite is an example of thermoset plastic. Because they can't be broken down, thermoset plastics aren't recyclable."

        "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical that's used when polycarbonate plastic (RIC of \"7\" and sometimes \"3\") is made. Polycarbonate plastic is used to make water bottles (like Nalgene), shatterproof windows, eyeglasses, and epoxy resins that coat some metal food cans and water supply pipes. BPA may leach into foods and liquids in polycarbonate containers. This is worrying to some people because studies suggest a link between BPA exposure and increased blood pressure, type 2 diabetes , and heart disease. It may also have possible health effects on the brains and prostate glands of fetuses, infants, and children. About 10 years ago, the FDA said that BPA cannot be used in baby bottles, sippy cups, or epoxy resins used in packaging for infant formula."
