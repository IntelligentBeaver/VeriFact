        "Most people in the U.S. get enough of this nutrient. If you're not sure, you can ask your doctor if you should get a blood test to check your vitamin B12 level. With age, it can become harder to absorb this vitamin. It can also happen if you have had weight loss surgery or another operation that removed part of your stomach, or if you drink heavily. You may also be more likely to develop vitamin B12 deficiency if you have: Atrophic gastritis , in which your stomach lining has thinned Pernicious anemia, which makes it hard for your body to absorb vitamin B12 Conditions that affect your small intestine, such as Crohn's disease , celiac disease , bacterial growth, or a parasite Misused alcohol or drank heavily, which can make it harder for your body to absorb nutrients or prevent you from eating enough calories. One sign that you lack enough B12 may be glossitis, or a swollen, inflamed tongue. Immune system disorders , such as Graves' disease or lupus Been taking certain medications that interfere with the absorption of B12. This includes some heartburn medicines including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as esomeprazole (Nexium ), lansoprazole (Prevacid ), omeprazole (Prilosec OTC ), pantoprazole (Protonix ), and rabeprazole (Aciphex ), H2 Blockers such as famotidine (Pepcid AC ) and certain diabetes medicines such as metformin (Glucophage ). You can also get vitamin B12 deficiency if you follow a vegan diet (meaning you don't eat any animal products, including meat, milk, cheese, and eggs) or you are a vegetarian who doesn't eat enough eggs or dairy products to meet your vitamin B12 needs. In both of those cases, you can add fortified foods to your diet or take supplements to meet this need. Learn more about the different types of vitamin B supplements ."
