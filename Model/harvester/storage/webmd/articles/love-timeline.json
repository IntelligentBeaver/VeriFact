After \"limerence\" wears off, certain things become painfully apparent.",
        "So-called \"fatal attraction\" is another reason why love affairs end. In fatal attraction, a quality that one initially finds attractive in a lover is the same quality that sinks the relationship. For example, we may fall for a person's delightful sense of humor, but then come to see it as flakiness. Attractive qualities are usually two-sided. If a sexy and charming partner cheats, it's because they are charming and sexy to other people, too. A thrilling person may actually be dangerous. A doting, attentive lover may be overly possessive.",
