        "Spirometry is the most common. It's a simple, quick, and painless way to check your lungs and airways. You take a deep breath and exhale into a hose attached to a device called a spirometer. It records how much air you blow out (called forced vital capacity or FVC) and how quickly you do it (called forced expiratory volume or FEV). Your score is lower if your airways are swollen or constricted because of asthma or other lung diseases . Your doctor may want you to have several spirometry lung function tests to monitor your asthma over time. You might have spirometry before and after you take medication to see if the medication helps. Your doctor may also want readings taken during exercise to see how your airways react to exercise.",
        "Challenge tests are lung function tests used to help confirm a diagnosis of asthma. You inhale a small amount of a substance known to trigger symptoms in people with asthma, such as histamine or methacholine. After inhaling the substance, someone tests your lung function. Because challenge tests can trigger an asthma attack, you should have them done only by someone with experience.",
        "Peak flow meter tests measure how well your lungs push out air. Although they are less accurate than spirometry, these lung function tests can be a good way to regularly test your lung function at home -- even before you feel any symptoms. A peak flow meter can help you know what makes your asthma worse, whether treatment is working, and when you need to seek emergency care. The peak flow meter is a handheld plastic tube with a mouthpiece on one end, which you breathe into. Your doctor might ask you to use the peak flow meter each day and write down the readings. After a couple of weeks, you report the results to your doctor.",
