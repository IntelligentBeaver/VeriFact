        "When you have endometriosis , sex can hurt. But that doesn’t mean you have to give up being intimate with your partner. You just need to make a few tweaks in your approach to sex. There are ways to lessen or even get rid of the pain. About two-thirds of women with endometriosis report some kind of sexual issue. Every woman is different, of course. Some report no dyspareunia , or pain during intercourse. Others hurt during and after. The pain may last for hours after sex and even up to a few days. Women describe the discomfort differently, too. Reports range from mild pain to sharp, stabbing pain to deep, aching pain. Some say any penetration hurts, while others say that only deep penetration brings discomfort."

Sex may be most painful if the endometriosis is behind your vagina in the space between the vagina and lower uterus . Sometimes endometriosis can even adhere the vagina to the rectum. Penetration can pull or stretch the irritated tissue, causing pain. If the endometriosis is elsewhere, such as on your ovaries , then you may have no pain or less pain during sex.

While you may feel awkward talking about it with your partner, that discomfort is probably less than the pain you’ll continue to feel if you don’t speak up.
