        "Fibroids are tumors that grow from muscle tissue in the uterus. They are not cancerous. They can be as small as a pea or larger than a grapefruit. They can grow outside the uterine wall, inside the uterine cavity, or within the uterine wall. Many women have multiple fibroids of different sizes.",

That’s because it’s hard for doctors to tell fibroids from the thickening of uterus muscles that occurs during pregnancy. Smaller fibroids are harder to detect on ultrasound, especially later in a pregnancy.",
