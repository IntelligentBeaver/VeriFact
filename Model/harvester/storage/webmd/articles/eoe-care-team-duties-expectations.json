Sometimes, doctors call this a “scope.” The test involves a small camera on a long flexible tube that the doctor puts down your throat and into your esophagus . They take photos and small tissue samples (biopsies) of your esophagus, and sometimes your stomach and small intestine as well. A pathologist (a scientist who studies diseases) will look at your biopsy under a microscope. If they see inflammation or eosinophils (white blood cells), your doctor can diagnose you with EoE. A gastroenterologist can monitor your progress with the disease as you try treatment or other therapies. You may have multiple endoscopies with your GI doctor as part of your management. Along with medications and diet therapy, one of the treatment options for EoE is a procedure called esophageal dilation. If your esophagus has a stricture (narrowing), a GI doctor can perform this procedure, which involves stretching out the walls of your esophagus to enlarge it."

        "Although EoE symptoms affect the esophagus, which a GI doctor focuses on, the disease itself is a chronic allergic/immune condition. Allergies play a big role in EoE. Around 70% of people with EoE have symptoms of one or more allergic disorders, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis (eczema), or food allergies. You may already be under the care of an allergist for one or more of these issues if you have EoE. An allergist should be involved in your EoE care because oftentimes, you need a food allergy assessment to see what foods may be helping cause your symptoms. Your allergist can do a prick test to see which foods cause a reaction. You may also need diet therapy, which your allergist can help design and guide you through. Typically, this involves removing all major allergens (wheat, milk, egg, nuts, soy, fish, and shellfish) from your diet and adding them back in, one at a time, to see how your system reacts. Your allergist will work closely with your gastroenterologist through this monitoring process."
