        "By Lisa Lundy, multiple sclerosis case manager, as told to Keri Wiginton It’s normal to worry about the cost of multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment. You may wonder how you’ll predict anything about an unpredictable disease. While you don’t want to get yourself in a panic, you do want to prepare for what may come. But first, take a breath. Try not to think about your financial future for a moment. Center yourself by knowing that help is out there. Many people have been down this road before. When you’re ready to set up a plan, keep an open mind. The support you need may not come from one source."

Maybe you get a little more fatigued, or you can’t walk as far. But you may never need to pay for lots of extra care. With that said, long-term care insurance can be a good investment if you ever need in-home care. And it’s probably not a bad idea for anyone in the working world to think about short- and long-term disability insurance. Anything can happen to anyone, really. But I’m always grateful and glad to hear when people with MS can rely on these kinds of backups."
