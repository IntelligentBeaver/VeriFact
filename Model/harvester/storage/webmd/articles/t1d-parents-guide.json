Insulin lets blood sugar into your cells so your body can turn it into fuel. Without insulin, blood sugar builds up in your bloodstream. That can cause severe, even life-threatening, harm to major organs like your heart, kidneys, and eyes. T1D is less common than type 2 diabetes (T2D). A child with T2D can still make insulin, but their body can’t use it well."

Fasting blood sugar test: Your child will need to fast (go without food) for at least 8 hours to take this test. If they have T1D, their blood sugar level will be 126 mg/dL or higher. A1c (glycated hemoglobin) test : This blood test can reveal your child’s average blood sugar for the past 3 months. A result of 6.5% or higher (on two separate tests) points to T1D. Antibody screening: A special test can reveal if your insulin-making cells are under attack from your immune system. It looks for special proteins called antibodies in your blood. This screening can help find people who are at risk for T1D before they have symptoms."

You’ll likely have to adjust some habits and make changes to your daily routine. As you do, here are a few things to keep in mind. Keep T1D supplies handy. Put together a small bag with everything your child needs for daily care and in case of an emergency. They should always have this with them, whether they’re at school, a sleepover, or a soccer game. If you live somewhere hot, use an insulated bag with ice packs. Educate other caregivers. Make sure everyone who watches your child, like a sitter or their grandparents, knows about their T1D. Explain when and how your child may need insulin and how to reach you with any questions. Practice good dental care. T1D puts your child at risk for cavities and other issues with their teeth and gums. (Dental problems can also make their T1D worse.) Urge your child to brush their teeth twice a day, and schedule regular dental checkups."
