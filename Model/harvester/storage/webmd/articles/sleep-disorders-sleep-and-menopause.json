        "Menopause is a stage in a woman's life when their ovaries stop producing the hormones estrogen and progesterone and they stop having their monthly menstrual cycle (their period). It is a normal part of aging and marks the end of a woman's reproductive years. Menopause typically occurs in a woman's late 40s to early 50s. It can also lead to sleep problems.",
        "When the ovaries no longer produce adequate amounts of estrogen and progesterone (as in menopause), the loss of these hormones can bring about various symptoms, including hot flashes (a sudden feeling of warmth that spreads over the body) and sweating .",
