        "It’s unfortunate, but many of us who live with schizophrenia also smoke. (About 62% of us, research shows. That’s a higher percentage of smokers than found in the general population.)",
        "Smoking helps us manage and cope with stress. But it causes a variety of health conditions – coronary heart disease, asthma, and cancers, to name a few. Combine that with the statistic that, in the U.S., people with schizophrenia die about 28 years earlier than people without a serious mental health condition. It'd help if we quit smoking altogether.",
        "In an effort to understand why so many of us smoke, I did some research and found that nicotine can increase and regulate dopamine and glutamate levels when you have schizophrenia.",
        "Nicotine is known to alter the release of virtually all major neurotransmitters and stimulates the release of dopamine in broad target areas throughout your brain. It suggests that smoking helps correct dopamine deficiency in your prefrontal cortex and relieves some of schizophrenia’s negative symptoms. It’s unclear how nicotine is linked to positive symptoms. More research is needed."
