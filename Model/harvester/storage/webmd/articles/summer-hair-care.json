        "Summer doesn't have to be the season of bad hair days. With some extra TLC, your hair can look great on the steamiest days. Here are some hot-weather tress-taming tips from Krant and Julia Papworth, a celebrity hairstylist who has worked with stars including Cameron Diaz, Elijah Wood, and Sarah Silverman.",
        "But let's face it: When the air is so thick with humidity it feels like molasses, frizz is going to happen. Don't waste your summer trying to fight frizz. Instead, find an easy go-to hairdo like a slick pony, high bun, or side braid for those high-humidity days."
      ],

        "Start summer with a trim . You'll get rid of split ends and refresh your style. You might need a mid-season cut, too. Hair really does grow faster in the summer. That's because there are more hairs in the anagen, or growing, stage during late spring and summer than in the dead of winter, Krant says.",
        "Shield your strands from the sun . Make a daily habit of applying a hair care product that contains UV filters (these can be in spray, gel, or cream formulas). These products protect hair from sun damage and help keep color-processed hair from fading. If you'll be spending lots of time outdoors, wear a wide-brimmed hat. Not only will it keep your strands from getting scorched, it will also protect your scalp and ears, areas that are vulnerable to skin cancer.",
        "Saturate strands before taking a dip. If your hair is drenched with clean water or leave-in conditioner, it won't absorb as much saltwater or pool chemicals, Papworth says. It's also a good idea to try to rinse your hair after a swim. If there isn't a shower nearby, keep a spray bottle filled with fresh water.",
        "Switch to a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner . You may be washing your hair more frequently to deal with summer's sweat and grime. Papworth also suggests using a clarifying, or anti-residue, shampoo once a week to clear away product buildup and chemicals. Just be sure to follow with a deep-conditioning treatment.",
        "Skip the hot tools . At least once or twice a week, give your hair a break from blow dryers, flat irons, and curling irons. Papworth recommends washing your hair at night and piling it up in a bun, a braid, or ponytail before you head to bed. \"When you wake up, you'll have a nice beachy wave,\" she says. It's the perfect look for weekends, or make it work-ready with accessories like a thin headband or pretty barrettes.",
        "Outwit frizz. Hair that's healthy and well-maintained is your best defense against frizz. Along with regular trims and conditioning, a drop or two of an anti-frizz oil or serum can help smooth hair and add shine. (Papworth likes products that contain argan oil.) Use only \"a teeny tiny drop\" of oil, Papworth advises, or you can end up weighing down your hair, especially if it's fine or limp."
