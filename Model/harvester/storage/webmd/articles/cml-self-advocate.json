You'll be a better advocate for yourself and will feel more confident talking with your doctor if you understand the condition. Read about CML and your treatment options from credible sources. Start with your doctor. When you take to the internet, be careful not to fall down the rabbit hole of false information on social media. Instead, search credible sources like these cancer organizations: American Cancer Society (ACS). This nonprofit organization works to improve the lives of people with cancer. The ACS website has information about leukemia and support programs for people with cancer. Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS). LLS is the largest nonprofit organization dedicated to blood cancers. It sponsors research and offers free education and support for people with leukemia and lymphoma. National Cancer Institute (NCI). NCI is the U.S. government's agency for cancer research. Its mission is to help people with all types of cancer live longer and better lives. If the amount of information you find feels too overwhelming, ask a friend or family member you trust to help you sort through it."
