        "An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a condition where the lower section of your aorta —  in your abdomen — weakens and bulges outward. Your aorta is the major blood vessel supplying blood from your heart to the rest of your body. It runs all the way down into your abdomen , the part of your body between your chest and pelvis.",
        "The walls of your aorta are strong and flexible, so they can manage the flow of blood being pumped from your heart. Certain things, such as smoking, some medical conditions, and older age, can weaken the walls of the aorta. When that happens, it becomes harder for it to manage the constant pressure of blood flow. Aneurysms can happen anywhere on your aorta, but about 75% happen in the abdominal area.",
        "An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a serious condition because if the enlarged part of the aorta were to burst, the bleeding could be life-threatening."
