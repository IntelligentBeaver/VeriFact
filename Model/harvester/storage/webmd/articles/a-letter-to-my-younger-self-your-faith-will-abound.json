        "You will be OK. Yes, you will face many challenges, but you will have the internal strength to face them all. Some of your battles will be harder than others, but your faith will abound.",
        "It is annoying to you now that you have to attend church one to three times a week. You will sing gospel songs that you may not even believe or understand the power of the lyrics. You will hear testimonies about various things the congregants share, but there will be one that will resonate with you when you turn 28 years old. On the day you are diagnosed with breast cancer, through your tears, you will remember the testimony that Sister D.W. gave in front of the church when you were 7 or 8 years old. When she shared that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer, the elders and prayer warriors surrounded her to pray for healing. You will probably be sneakily playing tic-tac-toe with your best friend Sheryl and not really paying attention. And then some time later, when Sister D.W. gives another testimony that her cancer was gone, it won’t be clear if her healing was from just the prayers, but also from some sort of treatment regimen. You were probably playing hangman with Sheryl, so you did not hear the details. But you will remember and reflect on those two testimonies during your own moment of crisis, with the assurance that God is indeed real and that there is hope. In that moment when a soft voice spoke to you to say, “You are not going to die” and you believed it (and still do) perhaps because of Sister D.W.'s testimonies.",
        "After your diagnosis, you will revisit your faith (after you stopped attending church when you turned 18 years old). The gospel songs that you were forced to sing as a child will make more sense to you as an adult who’s facing a trial, and you cling to their meanings. One such song is “Amazing Grace” by John Newton:"
