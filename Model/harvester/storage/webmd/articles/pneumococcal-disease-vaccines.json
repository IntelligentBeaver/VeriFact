        "When you think about vaccines, you probably think of the COVID and flu shots. But there’s one important shot to help you fight respiratory disease, including pneumonia. It’s called the pneumococcal vaccine. Pneumococcal vaccines protect against pneumococcal disease, a potentially serious bacterial infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus. The vaccine is now recommended for more people than ever. Since 2024, the CDC recommends this shot for anyone 50 or older. That's because older people are one group that has a higher risk of developing other medical conditions after pneumococcal disease. But you can protect yourself and prevent these problems with the pneumococcal vaccination, says William Schaffner, MD, a professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. While anyone can get it, you have a higher risk if you are younger, older, or have an underlying health condition. “The best way to protect yourself is to get the pneumococcal vaccine if current guidelines say you need it,” says Schaffner. Here’s a closer look at pneumococcal vaccines and the different types. Learn about vaccine benefits, who should get it, and when. Plus find out where you can get it and what you can expect after you get vaccinated."

        "Pneumococcus bacteria love to hang out in your respiratory tract. In fact, pneumococcus can live quite comfortably in your nose and throat without any symptoms. Research suggests that up to 10% of adults and 60 % of school-aged children are carriers. They carry the bacteria in their mucus and saliva. Even without symptoms, carriers can pass the bacteria to others when they sneeze or cough. And this can put older adults and those with underlying medical conditions at risk. You could get a range of pneumococcal conditions. Mild infections include ear or sinus infections, but invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) can lead to potentially deadly complications like pneumonia. While anyone can develop complications, you have a higher risk if you’re over 65 or have a chronic heart or kidney condition. Pneumococcal disease complications Pneumococcal pneumonia kills about 1 person out of 20 who get it. Pneumococcal meningitis kills about 3 people out of 100 with it. Pneumococcal bacteremia, or an infection of the bloodstream, kills almost 1 person out of 5 with the infection. “That’s why we so strongly recommend vaccination for these groups, to help keep them protected,” says Schaffner."

          "text": "To prevent pneumococcal disease, make sure your child gets all four doses. Kids younger than 2 have a higher risk for serious pneumococcal infection. Babies also have a higher risk for complications such as pneumonia or meningitis. But the vaccine can prevent hospitalization, life-threatening disease, and death. It’s safe to get the pneumococcal vaccine with other shots, like the flu shot, an updated COVID-19 shot, or even the shingles vaccine. “Since viruses like the flu and COVID-19 also increase the risk of getting pneumococcal disease, they are also important for prevention,” says Schaffner. You can even get your flu and pneumococcal vaccines at the same time. Studies show that taking both vaccines together is safe.",
