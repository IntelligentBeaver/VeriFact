You'll find it in leafy greens and some vegetables (vitamin K1) and in meats, cheeses, and eggs (vitamin K2). Adults rarely have vitamin K deficiency, but it can happen with certain medications or conditions. Newborns have a higher chance of having vitamin K deficiency because of low transfer from the placenta and breast milk. Vitamin K is available in multivitamins, single-nutrient supplements, injections, and drops. You can also get it through various foods. Although the side effects of vitamin K are rare, they can include trouble breathing and liver issues."
