        "Feb. 7, 2024 – Chemicals used to make everyday plastic items like food containers and cosmetic packages may be linked to the rise in preterm births, according to a new study.",
        "Preterm births are those that occur before the 37th week of pregnancy , and the CDC warned earlier this month that they are on the rise.",
        "For the study, the researchers looked for chemicals called phthalates in about 5,000 U.S. mothers by analyzing their urine at various points during their pregnancies. Phthalates have long been known to affect hormone functions that can sometimes affect other body processes.",
        "The findings were published in this month’s edition of The Lancet Planetary Health . The researchers concluded that exposure to several specific phthalates may significantly increase the risk of preterm birth and may be linked to as many as 56,595 preterm births annually.",
        "The report authors specifically called for manufacturers to seek an alternative chemical for a phthalate known as DHEP , which helps make plastic flexible and is used in an array of products, including furniture upholstery, garden hoses, baby pants, toys, and medical tubing."

        "\"Our findings uncover the tremendous medical and financial burden of preterm births we believe are connected to phthalates, adding to the vast body of evidence that these chemicals present a serious danger to human health. There is a clear opportunity here to lessen these risks by either using safer plastic materials or by reducing the use of plastic altogether whenever possible,\" said study lead author Leonardo Trasande, MD, in a statement .

        "Among annual U.S. live births, about 8% of babies have low birth weight, and about 10% are preterm, the authors noted. Low birth weight and low gestational age (the time between conception and birth) are known predictors of health problems both in early life and throughout a person’s lifespan. Babies with low birth weight or short gestational age are at increased risk of poor academic performance later in life, as well as heart disease and diabetes, according to NYU Langone Health."
