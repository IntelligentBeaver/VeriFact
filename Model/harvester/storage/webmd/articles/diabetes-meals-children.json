        "Like all children, kids with type 1 diabetes need nutrient-rich foods that help them grow and keep them at a healthy weight. Over the course of a day, your child should get about 15%-25% of their calories from protein, 25%-35% calories from healthy fats, and about 40%-60% from carbohydrates.",

Steer your child toward complex carbs such as vegetables and whole grains.  They have vitamins and minerals that will keep them healthy, and fiber, which helps control blood sugar levels."

Your child’s glucose levels can drop if they skip a meal or snack or don’t eat as many carbs as expected. It can also happen if they take their insulin at the wrong time or exercises more than usual without eating extra snacks or adjusting their insulin. If your child’s levels are low, give them a sugary food. Regular soda, orange juice, or even cake frosting raises glucose levels quickly.",
