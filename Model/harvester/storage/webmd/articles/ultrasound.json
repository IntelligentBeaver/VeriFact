        "A prenatal ultrasound test uses high-frequency sound waves, inaudible to the human ear, that are transmitted through the abdomen via a device called a transducer to look at the inside of the abdomen. With prenatal ultrasound, the echoes are recorded and transformed into video or photographic images of your baby.",
        "The ultrasound (which your doctor might call a sonogram, abdominal ultrasound, abdominal sonogram, or level I ultrasound) can be used during pregnancy to show images of the baby, amniotic sac, placenta, and ovaries. Major anatomical abnormalities or birth defects may be visible on an ultrasound.",
        "Most prenatal ultrasound procedures are performed topically, or on the surface of the skin , using a gel as a conductive medium to aid in the image quality. However, a transvaginal ultrasound is an alternative procedure in which a tubular probe is inserted into the vaginal canal. This method of ultrasound produces an image quality that is greatly enhanced. It may be used early in pregnancy to get a clearer view of the uterus or ovaries if a problem is suspected. It can also be used to determine how far along you are in your pregnancy (gestational age). Transvaginal ultrasound is also used to evaluate the cervix for problems such as shortening which may increase your risk of early labor."
