One of the best ways to protect your back is with a mattress and sleep positions that support it, says Lauren Polivka, PT, DPT, a physical therapist at Balance Gym in Washington, D.C. “If you don’t have the right support system, you can set yourself up for injury.”",
        "Make bedtime a haven for your back by:",
        "Instead, sleep either on your side or your back, using pillows for support. If you prefer your side, the best aid is a body pillow that can support your weight between your knees and help align your arms. Back sleepers should put a pillow between their knees ."

        "Getting the right mattress. No matter how comfortable a squishy-soft feather bed may seem at first, a firmer mattress is usually the best for your back, Polivka says. “The types of beds where partners can choose a different level of support can be good, because differences in body structure and size can make what’s comfortable for one person different from another.”",
        "Keep your bed in shape. If you’re waking up stiff and sore, check your mattress. How long has it been since you replaced it? “It’s the same as with running shoes: you put a lot of pressure on the mattress and deforming the foam over time,” Polivka explains. Twice a year, flip the mattress over and check for divots, dents, wear and tear and breakage. If there are spots where the mattress isn’t springing back the way it used to, it’s time to spring for a new one. Consumer Reports recommends that you consider changing your mattress if yours is at more than 5 to 7 years old.",
        "Sleep smart. The worst sleep position for your back? On your stomach . “It puts your neck in a more extended, rotated position -- because you can’t sleep face down -- and that puts the most strain on your joints,” Polivka explains.",
        "Rising and shining. Do you jump (or roll grumpily) out of bed when the alarm clock rings? Don’t. Instead, take a minute to stretch fully and let your body wake up before getting a move on. This can help prevent injuries, Polivka says."

A little-known fact: You can hurt yourself just as much while lifting something small as you can while hoisting a huge, heavy box. “I’ll see people who’ve bent over to pick up a coin and they’ve thrown their back out,” says Nessler.",
        "Use the right form and technique to bend, lift, and reach. “When I check in at the doctor’s office, I’ll see a receptionist rummaging in a file cabinet below her, bending down at the waist with her hips straight,” says Polivka. “It makes me cringe!”",

        "The squat lift. This is for heavy objects. Get your body as close to the object as possible, plant your feet shoulder width apart, squat down, wrap your arms around it, and stand up, using the power of your legs. “Whether it’s a baby or a heavy box, keeping the item as close to your trunk as you can allows your trunk to act as the stabilizer,” says Nessler.",
        "The “golfer’s lift.” This is for small objects like that dropped coin. It would be silly to do a full power squat lift for a coin or a pen. Instead, put all your weight on one leg, and using the opposite hand, brace yourself with one hand on a desk, chair, or other sturdy object. Then bend straight from the hip, letting the non-weight-bearing leg come off the ground a little behind you as you pick up the object.",
        "The “crane lift.” This is for heavier objects when you can’t use a squat lift -- like groceries in a car trunk or a baby in a crib. Stand with your knees shoulder width apart, as close to the object as you can get. Bend at the hips, sticking your buttocks out behind you. Grab the item and lift, pulling it as close to your body as you can as you lift up. Put it down the same way."
