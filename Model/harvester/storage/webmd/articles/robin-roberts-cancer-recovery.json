        "''Aahh! ABBA!'' Robin Roberts exclaims. She takes a spin around the floor and waves her arms as the opening bars of ''Dancing Queen'' fill the air.",
        "What a difference 2 and a half years makes. That's when ABC's Good Morning America anchor was in isolation at New York City's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Her 5-foot-10-inch frame was down to a gaunt 115 pounds as she fought her way back from high-dose chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant. Those treatments were the only option for curing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in which the body's bone marrow doesn’t make enough healthy blood cells .",
        "Roberts was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007. She acknowledges that was a blow. ''But breast cancer, you kinda know what that is, and you know people who've gone through it,'' she says.",
        "The MDS diagnosis, which came in 2012, was much harder. ''I had never heard of it. I didn't know anyone who had MDS.''",
        "Without fully functional red blood cells , white blood cells, and platelets, people with MDS are vulnerable to anemia , infections, and uncontrolled bleeding. In nearly 1 in 3 cases -- especially in cases of ''secondary MDS,'' which follows chemotherapy or radiation for cancer, as Roberts' did -- MDS progresses to acute myeloid leukemia . But Roberts heartily disagrees with those who refer to it as ''pre- leukemia .'' ''There's nothing 'pre' about it. It's full on!''",
        "Today, she bubbles over with good health, goofing around in a photo studio in midtown Manhattan. She cheerfully hefts prop numbers ''1'' and ''0'' in the air to celebrate WebMD Magazine 's 10th anniversary, displaying sculpted delts and triceps that even Michelle Obama might envy. An hour later, having changed from a fitted blue dress into jeans and a rust-colored quilted jacket (''you'll get more out of me this way,'' she promises), Roberts curls up on a couch to talk about her top 10 ''health heroes'' -- the people and organizations who helped her through her health battles."
