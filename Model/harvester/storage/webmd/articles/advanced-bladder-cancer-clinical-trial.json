        "Most cases of advanced bladder cancer can't be cured, and many people go through several different types of treatment to try to slow its progression and control their symptoms. Doctors are constantly trying to improve treatments to get better outcomes. Recent clinical trials have led to drug breakthroughs. A combination of two newer types of medications – a targeted therapy drug called an antibody-drug conjugate and an immunotherapy drug called a checkpoint inhibitor – is now the recommended treatment for many advanced stages of bladder cancer. And an immune checkpoint inhibitor is also part of the main treatment for earlier stages of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Researchers are focused on learning the best uses for these and other types of drugs, and developing new ones. Here's some of what they're investigating:"
