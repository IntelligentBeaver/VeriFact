        "Breastfeeding is when you feed your baby breast milk, usually directly from your breast. It’s also called nursing or chestfeeding. Making the decision to breastfeed is a personal matter. It's also one that's likely to draw opinions from your friends and family.",
        "Many medical experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, strongly recommend breastfeeding exclusively (no formula, juice, or water) for 6 months. After the introduction of other foods, it recommends continuing to breastfeed through the baby’s first year of life.",
        "How often you should breastfeed your baby depends on whether your baby prefers small, frequent meals or longer feedings. This will change as your baby grows. Newborns often want to feed every 2-3 hours. By 2 months, feeding every 3-4 hours is common, and by 6 months, most babies feed every 4-5 hours.",

        "Breast milk provides the ideal nutrition for infants. It has a nearly perfect mix of vitamins , protein, and fat -- everything your baby needs to grow. And it's all provided in a form that's more easily digested than infant formula. Breast milk contains antibodies that help your baby fight off viruses and bacteria. Breastfeeding lowers your baby's risk of having asthma or allergies . Plus, babies who are breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months, without any formula, have fewer ear infections , respiratory illnesses, and bouts of diarrhea . They also have fewer hospitalizations and trips to the doctor.",
        "Breastfeeding has been linked to higher IQ scores in later childhood in some studies. Breastfed infants are more likely to gain the right amount of weight as they grow, rather than becoming overweight in childhood. The AAP says breastfeeding also plays a role in the prevention of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Breastfeeding has been thought to lower the risk of diabetes , obesity , and certain cancers as well, but more research is needed.",

After about 3 days, your milk will start to come in, though this may take longer for first-time parents. You may notice your breasts becoming firmer as this happens, and they might leak sometimes. If your breasts become too full with milk, you may experience some discomfort. Your nipples can become sore or cracked early on.",

But don't hesitate to reach out to your health care provider if you are struggling to get a good latch or having a lot of pain. They can help you figure out the issue or connect you with a lactation consultant, a specialist in breastfeeding education."

      ],
      "bullets": [
        "Cradle position. Rest the side of your baby's head in the crook of your elbow with their whole body facing you. Position your baby's belly against your body so they feel fully supported. Your other “free” arm can wrap around to support your baby's head and neck or reach through your baby's legs to support the lower back. This position can be convenient for older infants but is often hard for newborns, as it offers limited support. Still, it might be worth trying if you haven’t had much success with other positions.",
        "Football position. If you’re recovering from a C-section , this position will help you find an ideal latch while avoiding pressure on your belly. It also works well for twins and premature babies. Line your baby's back along your forearm to hold your baby like a football, supporting their head and neck in your palm.",
        "Side-lying position. This position is great for night feedings in bed. Side-lying also works well if you're recovering from an episiotomy, an incision to widen the vaginal opening during delivery. Use pillows under your head to get comfortable. Then, snuggle close to your baby and use your free hand to lift your breast and nipple into your baby's mouth . Once your baby is correctly “latched on,” support the head and neck with your free hand so there's no twisting or straining to keep nursing.

            "Awareness . Watch for your baby's signs of hunger, and breastfeed whenever your baby is hungry . This is called “on-demand” feeding. In the first few weeks, you may be nursing 8-12 times every 24 hours. Hungry infants move their hands toward their mouths, make sucking noises or mouth movements, or move toward your breast. Don't wait for your baby to cry. That's a sign they are too hungry.",
            "Be patient . Breastfeed as long as your baby wants to nurse each time. Don't hurry your infant through feedings. Infants typically breastfeed for 10-20 minutes on each breast.",
            "Comfort . This is key. Relax while breastfeeding, and your milk is more likely to “let down” and flow. Get yourself comfortable with pillows as needed to support your arms, head, and neck, and a footrest to support your feet and legs before you begin to breastfeed."

      ],
      "bullets": [
        "Sore nipples. You can expect some soreness in the first weeks of breastfeeding. Make sure your baby latches on correctly, and use one finger to break the suction of your baby's mouth after each feeding. That will help prevent sore nipples. If you still get sore, be sure you nurse with each breast fully enough to empty the milk ducts. If you don't, your breasts can become engorged, swollen, and painful. Holding ice or a bag of frozen peas against sore nipples can temporarily ease discomfort. Keeping your nipples dry and letting them “air dry” between feedings helps, too. Your baby tends to suck more actively at the start. So begin feedings with the less-sore nipple.",
        "Dry, cracked nipples. Avoid soaps, perfumed creams, or lotions with alcohol in them, which can make nipples even more dry and cracked. You can gently apply pure lanolin to your nipples after a feeding, but be sure you gently wash the lanolin off before breastfeeding again. Changing your bra pads often will help your nipples stay dry. If possible, only use cotton bra pads.",
        "Worries about producing enough milk. A general rule of thumb is that a baby who's wetting six to eight diapers a day is most likely getting enough milk. Never give your infant plain water. Your body needs the frequent, regular demand of your baby's nursing to keep producing milk. Some women mistakenly think they can't breastfeed or produce enough milk if they have small breasts. But small-breasted women can make milk just as well as large-breasted women. Good nutrition , plenty of rest, and staying well-hydrated all help, too.",
        "Pumping and storing milk. You can get breast milk by hand or pump it with a breast pump. It may take a few days or weeks for your baby to get used to breast milk in a bottle, so begin practicing early if you're going back to work. Breast milk can be safely used within 2 days if it's stored in a refrigerator. You can freeze breast milk for up to 6 months. Don't warm up or thaw frozen breast milk in a microwave. That will destroy some of its immune-boosting qualities, and it can cause fatty portions of the breast milk to become super hot. Thaw breast milk in the refrigerator or a bowl of warm water instead.",
        "Inverted nipples. An inverted nipple doesn't poke forward when you pinch the areola, which is the dark skin around the nipple. A lactation consultant can give you tips that allow women with inverted nipples to breastfeed successfully.",
        "Breast engorgement. Breast fullness is natural and healthy. It happens as your breasts become full of milk, staying soft and pliable. But breast engorgement means the blood vessels in your breast have become congested. This traps fluid in your breasts and makes them feel hard, painful, and swollen. Alternate heat and cold, for instance, use ice packs and hot showers, to relieve mild symptoms. It can also help to release your milk by hand or use a breast pump.",
        "Blocked ducts. A single sore spot on your breast, which may be red and hot, can signal a plugged milk duct. This can often be relieved by warm compresses and gentle massage over the area to release the blockage. More frequent nursing can also help.",
        "Breast infection (mastitis). This occasionally happens when bacteria enter the breast, often through a cracked nipple after breastfeeding. If you have a sore area on your breast along with flu -like symptoms, fever, and fatigue , call your doctor. Antibiotics are usually needed to clear up a breast infection, but you can most likely continue to breastfeed while you have the infection and take antibiotics . To relieve breast tenderness, apply moist heat to the sore area four times a day for 15-20 minutes each time.",
        "Stress. Being overly anxious or stressed can interfere with your let-down reflex. That's your body's natural release of milk into the milk ducts. It's triggered by hormones released when your baby nurses. It can also be triggered just by hearing your baby cry or thinking about your baby. Stay as relaxed and calm as possible before and during nursing. It can help your milk let down and flow more easily. That, in turn, can help calm and relax your infant.",
        "Premature babies may not be able to breastfeed right away. In some cases, parents can release breast milk and feed it through a bottle or feeding tube.",
        "Warning signs. Breastfeeding is a natural, healthy process. But call your doctor if: Your breasts become unusually red, swollen, hard, or sore. You have an unusual discharge or bleeding from your nipples . You're concerned your baby isn't gaining weight or getting enough milk."
