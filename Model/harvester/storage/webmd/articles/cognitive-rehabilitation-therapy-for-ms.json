        "Issues with cognition include trouble remembering names, organizing your daily activities, paying bills, and even keeping up with your multiple sclerosis (MS) care, including taking medications and attending doctor appointments.",
        "Cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) can help. Think of it like physical therapy for your brain — you do mental exercises or practice activities that target the areas where you are having difficulty.",
