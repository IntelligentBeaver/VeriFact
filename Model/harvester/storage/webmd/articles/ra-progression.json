        "RA comes in two types: seropositive and seronegative. People with seropositive RA have very high levels of antibodies called anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCPs). Some research has found that people with seronegative RA have more active disease and more inflammation. But other studies haven’t found any difference in severity between the two RA types.",
        "When does rheumatoid arthritis start?",
        "RA often starts between ages 30 and 60. Children and young adults can get the disease too, but not as often."
