        "Michael Schiavo has been arguing that the feeding tube sustaining his wife, Terri, should be removed and that she should be allowed to die. However, her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, say that Terri does respond to them and that she might recover.",
        "Her recovery could be decades off -- if it comes at all. But the Schindlers say that's preferable to removing her life support system and allowing Terri to starve to death. She's been in a coma ever since she had a heart attack in 1990.",
        "The quandary is that Michael claims Terri didn't want to be kept alive by heroic means, but she didn't prepare a document known as a living will or an advance directive that would have advised medical and legal officials how to proceed in a situation like this one. Complicating the case is Terri's medical trust fund of $700,000, which Michael stands to inherit."
