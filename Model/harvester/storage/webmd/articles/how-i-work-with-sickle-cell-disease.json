        "Others in the sickle cell disease community have asked me a few times whether it’s wise to disclose having sickle cell when applying for a job. Based on my own experiences, my answer is “yes.” It would be best to inform your employer of your health condition so they can adjust to accommodate your needs.",
        "Sickle cell is not the defining trait of anyone, and I have been privileged to interact with so many other people with sickle cell who have outstanding careers in various industries. The courage, strength, and persistence it takes each day to live in a world not designed to support sickle cell patients must be commended, not rejected. However, this wasn't always my stance, especially at the start of my career journey.",
        "After graduating with my first degree from a university, I was determined not to mention that I had sickle cell to potential employers. At the time, I didn't want my health condition to affect any possible employment opportunities. As a new graduate with zero work experience, and as a Black man, the odds were stacked against me. I was adding a chronic health condition to the mix, which felt like I was sealing my fate for unemployment."

I couldn't focus at all in the office. The crisis was in my legs, so I could barely walk around in the office. My manager noticed the difference in my behavior, and I eventually was honest about having sickle cell."

Having the option for flexible working meant that when I felt fatigued or in a crisis on the way, I could work from home.
