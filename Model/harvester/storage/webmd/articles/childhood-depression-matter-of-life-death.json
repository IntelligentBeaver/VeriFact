        "While it is easy to blame childhood depression on 21st century life -- too much stress, too little \"quality time\" for families, too much exposure to violence, too little extended family, and too many children of divorce -- the reality is that depression has probably been stalking children for generations. For example, the 19th century American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in the often-quoted poem The Children's Hour writes of \"Grave Alice,\" who is accompanied by \"laughing Allegra and Edith with golden hair.\" Readers of any era are led to believe that \"Grave Alice\" is not a happy-go-lucky child.",
        "Experts tell WebMD that childhood depression is nothing new, but what is \"new\" is the realization that depressed children have a significant risk of suicide and that depressed children, even children with bipolardepression -- characterized by mood swings from \" mania \" to depression, do meet a set of defined criteria."
