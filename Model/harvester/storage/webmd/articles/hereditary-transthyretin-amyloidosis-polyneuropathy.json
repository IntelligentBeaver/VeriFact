        "Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) with polyneuropathy is a rare disorder passed down in families that gets worse over time. It’s a result of a change in a gene, also called a mutation. The mutated TTR gene in the liver makes abnormal shapes of a protein called transthyretin. These abnormal transthyretin proteins clump together in various organs and nerves to form deposits called amyloids. The deposits of amyloid damage organs and tissues. hATTR can cause serious complications and death. But symptoms can be managed through drugs and therapies.",
        "Your doctor might also use the word \"amyloidosis\" when talking about the condition. That's because hATTR is one of a group of diseases also known by that name.",
        "When you have hATTR, you may have a variety of symptoms when too much amyloid protein starts to collect in the nerves that branch out from your brain and spinal cord. This can affect your senses. For instance, you may be less likely to feel pain or heat, or you might have trouble walking. Or it could affect your hearing or vision."

They will take a little bit of tissue from your body, often a small piece of fat from your belly or side. This is quick and does not need a hospital stay. The doctor numbs the skin and then uses a needle to pull out some of the fat cells. Then a lab runs tests on these cells. A type of bone scan called scintigraphy may be done first, and if it detects amyloid deposits in the heart, a heart muscle biopsy may not be needed.",
