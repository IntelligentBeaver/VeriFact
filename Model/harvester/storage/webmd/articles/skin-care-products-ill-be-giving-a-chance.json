        "Forget New Year's; back-to-school season is probably the most stressful and confidence-inducing event to occur in a young adult’s life. But I’m approaching my last two quarters of school until I graduate, and I won’t be the youngest kind of adult for long, which means this is my last foray into the routine of it all. As I grow older, the back-to-school season loses its fanfare, and I think I’ve reached the point where my brass band and marching montage has been reduced to an air horn or two.",
        "The last time a peer from school pointed at one of the thick patches of discolored skin on my arm with a look of confused disgust on their face – almost as if they couldn’t decide what they wanted to express when they asked, just as loud as it was obnoxious, “What is that?” – was in sixth grade.",
        "Horrific, but also the one and only time such a comment made me want to disappear from the face of the earth in the same fashion that a snake eats itself from the tail up. And I’ll be honest, the most I’ve ever had to put up with reactions from this are from children who like to be all up in your business and your face and touch marks on your body that are not on theirs. The rude and curious habits of children. I can’t fault them for it. (I will be annoyed, though.)",
        "Students my age never make that kind of discernment. Rather, they approach curiosity in a level-headed, recommendation-styled approach. I’ve been asked, “Have you ever tried this?” And the this in question is never something condescending. They never ask if I have steroids (that’s one thing I often bring up in rebuttal) or if I put on lotion twice a day or if I took gluten out of my diet. They show me the pretty packaging for some skin care products that sometimes, most times, mention that they’re perfect for people with atopic dermatitis and hyperpigmentation on their website copy."

        "Most college students that I meet have eczema or other skin conditions that require a meticulous internal search engine to find effective products for their skin. And people love to share those kinds of things. There’s nothing quite like the community of consumption. So in honor of the skin refresh routine I’ll be partaking in the week and night before school officially starts, I want to share some things I learned about considering products. Skin care is personalized, after all, so hopefully this introduces some things for you to think about as you continue your own skin care journey.",
        "My first – and favorite – product regimen comes from everything included in good light‘s The Astral Collection. Prior to using it, I never had a specific order for the products on my face. I didn’t even understand the differences between toners, serums, acidic oils, and creams. Face wash and moisturizer seemed like enough to me, but having used this complete set, I am now in full support of highly sensorial routines to restore your skin barrier. I don’t think these products do anything for eczema in particular. Feeling refreshed and moisturized does go a long way, though, and I feel as though these products breathe seamlessly along the skin."

Because I have dark skin, eczema presents itself differently on me. My rashes aren’t red, they are often darker than my skin color, exactly to the point that it looks like I have hyperpigmentation (only) or psoriasis (which I have been wrongly diagnosed as having before)."

The first thing you should always consider is what you want from a product, and what kind of ingredients you should look for that are compatible with your skin. Dry, oily, combination. I like lightweight products that don’t wear down makeup if I were to wear it. Powdered makeup products work best on me, so as I look for complementary skin care, I like to test the texture. Will it hold, soak, or be stuffy (in terms of moisture)?",
