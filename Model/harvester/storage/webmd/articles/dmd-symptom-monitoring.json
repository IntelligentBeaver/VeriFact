You move forward and learn ways to help your child function and slow DMD's progression. With early treatment, physical activity, and support, your child can live a longer and better-quality life. Keeping track of your child's symptoms and abilities helps make sure they get the therapies they need as soon as possible, and it lets you and your family prepare for what's next. Your child's health care team will do regular testing to see how their condition is progressing. There are things you can watch for at home, too."

You may have noticed signs of DMD in your child's preschool years when they first had trouble walking, jumping, running, or climbing stairs. Usually, muscle weakness starts in the hips and pelvic area and worsens with age, moving to the arms, legs, and trunk. Doctors recommend that kids with DMD start treatment with medications before their physical symptoms start getting worse, often by age 4 or 5."
