        "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive procedure that uses magnetic pulses to treat and prevent the symptoms of depression and other conditions. The electromagnet releases a pulse that excites nerve cells in a region of the brain related to mood.",
        "It’s an option when medication and psychotherapy aren’t enough.",
        "“An electrical current runs through the ring of the wand, and that creates a magnetic pulse that points down toward your head through your skull into the brain,” says Larisa Karpova, MD, a psychiatrist at LifeStance Health in Wellesley, Massachusetts. “It’s not painful, but you may feel a tingle.”",
        "There are two types of TMS: deep TMS and repetitive TMS (rTMS). Deep TMS uses a coil called an H coil that reaches deeper and wider areas of the brain. The coil for rTMS concentrates on areas of your brain closer to the surface. Sometimes doctors call it “surface TMS.”"
