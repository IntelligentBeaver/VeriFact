        "Often, they fail to grasp the complex struggles I face daily. They offer well-meaning, yet misplaced, advice. They make assumptions that lead me to feelings of isolation and disconnection.",
        "In this post, we’ll explore ways to bridge the gap of understanding to maintain meaningful relationships while chronically ill.",
        "I believe the disconnect of understanding, when it comes to chronic illness, is the invisible nature of it all. People hear you’re dealing with a lifelong disease and expect you to look like it. In reality, chronic illness, especially MG, looks different on everyone.",
        "There isn’t one way to present. Common misconceptions like “You don’t look sick” invalidate those of us living with invisible illnesses. The invisible aspect makes it hard for others to understand, but communicating those unseen struggles out loud helps."
