        "What Causes Dry Skin?",
        "Dry skin, also known as xerosis, is a very common skin complaint that we have likely all experienced at some point. Xerosis happens when your skin doesn’t have enough hydration and moisture. This may look like a rough, dry skin texture accompanied by flaking, scaling, and itching. To understand why dry skin happens, a basic understanding of skin structure is needed.",
        "Our skin is divided into three main layers. The epidermis sits on top, followed by the dermis and subcutis beneath it. The outermost layer of the epidermis is called the stratum corneum. It’s made of an intricate balance of lipids and proteins. A healthy stratum corneum is vital to maintaining your skin’s natural function as a barrier, ensuring that harmful substances stay out while preventing dryness caused by excess water loss through your skin. When that intricate balance is disrupted and the amount of lipids in the stratum corneum decreases, its ability to bind with water doesn’t work, and water is lost through your skin."

        "If you want to tackle dry skin, the key is to keep it well-moisturized! There are many ingredients to look for in skin care products that can help you. Ceramides are naturally occurring lipids or fats in the skin and play an important role in the structure and function of the stratum corneum. You can think of them as the glue that holds skin cells together, preventing water loss through your skin. Using a moisturizer with ceramides can help lock in moisture and hydration. There are several ceramides, and many moisturizing creams contain more than one kind to offer the best results. You can also look for products that utilize other moisturizing ingredients, such as hyaluronic acid, squalene, petrolatum, glycerin, and niacinamide. Used together, these ingredients are even more effective in achieving smooth, hydrated skin."
