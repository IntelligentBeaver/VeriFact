        "Itvisma (onasemnogene abeparvovec-brve) is a gene therapy that the FDA has approved to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in adults, teens, and children 2 or older who have a confirmed mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. SMA is a rare genetic condition in which a faulty or missing SMN1 gene leads to the production of less SMN protein, which is needed for proper functioning of specific nerves that control muscles (motor nerve cells). Over time, motor nerve cells perish, leading to muscle weakness, trouble moving, a hard time breathing or swallowing, and, in severe cases, even serious disability or death.",
        "Itvisma works by delivering a healthy copy of the SMN1 gene directly into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). This helps motor nerve cells make the SMN protein they need for normal muscle movement and strength. By directly targeting the root genetic cause of SMA, Itvisma may improve motor function and reduce the need for continuous long-term treatments."

This approval is especially important because it offers a new targeted treatment option to older children, teens, and adults with SMA – groups that had fewer choices earlier.
