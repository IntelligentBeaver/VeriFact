        "Migraines are a rather common ailment. In the US, 18% of women and 6% of men had at least one migraine attack in the last year. While migraines can affect people of any age, they are more likely to occur between puberty and the age of 40.",
        "Alcoholic drinks can cause two kinds of headaches if you have migraines. The first is a migraine within a few hours after drinking. The other is a delayed hangover headache . Research has shown that people with migraines drink less alcohol because alcohol is a migraine trigger .",
        "In some cases, drinking alcohol can cause a migraine attack 30 minutes to three hours later. A delayed alcohol-induced headache (DAIH) will usually happen the following day. DAIHs can affect anyone who drinks alcohol, but people with migraines are more susceptible.",
        "Drinking red wine in small amounts can have some benefits for your heart and health. However, red wine is considered one of the primary migraine triggers.",
        "Red wine has a history of being linked to headaches. Celcius, who lived between 25 BC and 50 AD, described his own head pain after drinking wine. Red wine may be a headache trigger because of the presence of phenolic flavonoid radicals, which are more common in lower-quality wines."
