It lets your brain merge images from both eyes to process what you see. When your eyes can’t align in this way, you have convergence insufficiency (CI).",

Unlike other vision problems, like nearsightedness or farsightedness , the shape of your eye is not the cause of convergence insufficiency. Instead, it’s due to trouble with the way your eyes work together."
