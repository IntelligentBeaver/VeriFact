        "Amoebas are single-celled organisms. The so-called brain -eating amoeba is a species discovered in 1965. Its formal name is Naegleria fowleri . It usually lurks in warm freshwater bodies or untreated, contaminated waters. When it finds its way inside the human body, it causes a rare, yet deadly infection and inflammation in the brain and eventually destroys the brain tissue by “eating” it. Doctors call this disease primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). You can only get it when contaminated water with the brain-eating amoeba travels up your nose.",
