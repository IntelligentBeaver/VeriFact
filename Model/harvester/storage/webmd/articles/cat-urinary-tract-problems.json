        "In addition to treating the pH level and strengthening the bladder wall, an important part of treating a cat UTI is to make sure that your cat stays well-hydrated. This will help flush out the bladder and avoid the buildup of harmful bacteria.",
        "To make sure your cat is staying hydrated, you can introduce tasty fluids like bone broth. Make sure the broth has no sodium. Not only will this provide necessary hydration, but bone broth also contains nutrients and minerals that can help fight the infection. The amino acids (organic compounds that form protein in the body) found in bone broth, including glycine , and arginine, have been shown to reduce inflammation.",
        "Why Does My Cat Keep Getting UTIs?",
        "If your cat has diabetes, thyroid disease, or cancer , talk to your vet about treatment options. You can also help your cat by reducing stress, keeping their litter box clean,  feeding them a proper diet, checking for underlying diseases, and helping with weight management.",
        "Cat urinary tract issues are serious, and you should not ignore the symptoms. Call your vet if you think your cat has a UTI or other urinary tract problem."
