        "Lounging poolside or lakeside, playing at the beach or in the park --  let's face it, whatever you're doing outside between May and September feels oh-so-good on your skin in the summer sun. But extra daylight and arms-baring temperatures make this time of year a super-stressor on your skin. All that sun and heat \"means you have to get your warrior paint on,\" says David Colbert, MD, founder of New York Dermatology Group. \"People tend to subject their skin to more damage in warm weather.\"",
        "So how can you enjoy the outdoor season and still prevent long-term wear and tear on your face and body -- all the way to Labor Day and beyond?",

        "The sun's rays cause about 90% of injury to the skin, which means sagging, wrinkles, uneven pigmentation, thickening, and general signs of aging, Colbert explains. Short of walking around in outfits that even Hester Prynne would find conservative (which works -- clothing is a good first line of defense against the sun's rays), there's not much you can do to completely protect yourself from the scarlet letter of UV damage. But certain products and ingredients have proven to be reparative and have protective qualities. To get through the summer with healthy, glowing skin, stock your skin care arsenal with these powerful, protective weapons."
