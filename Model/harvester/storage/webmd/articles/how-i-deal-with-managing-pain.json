There are many options out there that can help get you the relief that you need, which can include any of the following: a combination of prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, topical ointments, massages, acupuncture, or others.",

I didn’t want to add another pill to my already existing daily meds regimen, but this is a completely personal choice. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having to take medication if needed!"
