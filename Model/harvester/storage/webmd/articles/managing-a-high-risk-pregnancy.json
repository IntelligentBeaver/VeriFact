With proper management, however, most women who develop preeclampsia have healthy babies. No one is sure what causes preeclampsia. You have a higher chance if you’re older, if you’re overweight, or if you had high blood pressure or diabetes before you got pregnant. Carrying more than one baby also raises your risk.",
        "Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Women with gestational diabetes may have healthy pregnancies and babies if they follow the treatment plan from their health-care provider. Usually, the diabetes resolves after delivery. However, women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. You may need a C-section instead of vaginal birth to prevent injury to your baby. Your risk of gestational diabetes goes up if you are over 25, are pregnant with multiples, are overweight , or have had gestational diabetes or a very large baby in the past, or if someone in your family has diabetes.",
        "Depression. Between 14% and 23% of women get depressed during pregnancy. It’s more likely if you've been depressed before. Pregnancy may be linked to depression because of hormonal changes, exhaustion, stress at home, and a lack of support. In turn, depression may be linked with problems during pregnancy and delivery, low birth weight, and preterm birth. After birth, depression can make it harder to care for yourself and your baby. Ask your doctor or midwife about treatment with talk therapy or medicine. Go over the risks and benefits of taking medicine while pregnant or breastfeeding."
