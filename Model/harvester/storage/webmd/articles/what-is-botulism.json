The spores from the bacteria can be breathed in, can get into open wounds, injected, or taken in from certain food sources.  Taking extra care when preparing, canning, and preserving foods at home can prevent botulism. Also, keeping honey out of your child's diet until after they turn 1 year old can protect them from infant botulism. Seek care right away if you or your child has any symptoms of botulism. Immediate treatment is important for effective treatment."
