        "The FDA has approved cosibelimab, a new drug for adults with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), a type of skin cancer . It is the first and only PD-L1 blocker approved to treat adults with CSCC that has spread to other parts of the body or is too advanced for surgery or radiation.",
        "CSCC is the second most common skin cancer in the U.S., affecting 1.8 million people each year. Most cases can be treated with surgery, but around 40,000 become advanced and harder to treat, leading to about 15,000 deaths annually. Advanced CSCC can cause serious problems, especially in the head and neck, where it can damage blood vessels, nerves, and organs like the eyes and ears. It’s even harder to treat in people who have a weak immune system because the cancer is more aggressive, and treatments can have stronger side effects.",
        "Cosibelimab, marketed under the brand name Unloxcyt, is a human monoclonal antibody, a type of drug that uses your body’s immune system to fight cancer. It works by blocking a special protein (PD-L1) carried by the cancer cells that allows the cells to hide from the immune system, promoting their growth and spread. In this way, Unloxcyt prevents tumor cells from evading the immune system, helping it to detect and attack cancer cells more effectively. Unloxcyt can also trigger the immune system to kill cancer cells directly, which sets it apart from other treatments for advanced CSCC. The medication needs to be injected as a 60-minute infusion every three weeks."
