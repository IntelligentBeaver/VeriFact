Their diet in the wild includes a combination of sweets from the forest, small animals, and insects. Their typical eating patterns in the wild can be hard to mirror when kept as pets, so as a new sugar glider owner you’ll need to know what to feed your glider, how often to feed it, what foods to avoid, and what to do if you notice your sugar glider has stopped eating."
