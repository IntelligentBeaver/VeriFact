        "Nov. 22, 2023 – Children whose parents received a reminder notification that their child was due for vaccination against human papillomavirus were 56% more likely to get the potentially life-saving shot, a new study shows.",
        "A Mayo Clinic-led research team worked with six primary care clinics in Minnesota to analyze differences in HPV vaccination rates of 9,242 children, ages 11 and 12, based on how the children’s parents and their doctors were reminded that the children were due for the vaccine. The parents were sent reminders in the mail, and the providers received audit charts via intra-office mail showing how many of their patients had been vaccinated.",
        "The parent reminders led to nearly 35% of eligible children getting a dose of the HPV vaccine , and the provider feedback led to 30% of patients getting a shot of the vaccine. When the researchers analyzed both efforts combined, the vaccination rate was 40%, which was significantly higher than the typical HPV vaccination rate of 22% among children whose parents or providers didn’t get the extra communications. The study only looked at whether children got at least one dose of the vaccine, which is typically given in a series spaced up to a year apart. The results were published this week in the journal JAMA Pediatrics ."

Nearly everyone will be exposed to HPV at some point in their lives, according to the CDC . The virus spreads via intimate skin-to-skin contact such as through having sex, so the vaccine is recommended to be given early in life before people become sexually active. Most people who have HPV don’t know that they have it, which makes it difficult to prevent the spread of the virus."
