When considering substitutions, there may be an individual, for example, that is allergic to peanuts, cow’s milk, and all tree nuts except for coconut. For that person, coconut milk may be an option they could discuss with their allergist, even though it is lumped in with other tree nuts, because it may serve to open doors for them in substituting for cow’s milk. What works for one person may not work for another. The hope is that by learning about potential options, doors will reopen that may have been temporarily closed due to a food allergy diagnosis."

It is important to not just trust brand messaging such as “vegan” and assume it will be safe. Read every label, every time, each individual ingredient. Often, marketing messages such as “vegan” can be misleading, and you may find your allergen lurking in the ingredients."
