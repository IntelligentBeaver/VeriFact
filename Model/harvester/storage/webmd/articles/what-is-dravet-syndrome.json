        "After the first febrile seizure, children who have Dravet syndrome tend to have many seizures. Some may last many minutes, or they have a series of seizures. Some seizures affect only one side of the body.",
        "Babies with Dravet syndrome are more likely to have febrile seizures, but they also have seizures that aren’t necessarily related to a fever. Children with the condition can get a seizure when their body temperature rises -- from a hot bath or a warm summer day -- even when they’re not sick. Bright light, stress, or too much excitement may also trigger one."
