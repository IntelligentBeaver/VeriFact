        "Obesity can affect your health and quality of life in so many ways. Carrying extra weight increases your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. It's also linked to depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. But it's important to know that the causes of obesity are complex and often include genetic and physical factors that are beyond your control. Losing just 5% to 10% of excess body weight can help reduce many health risks , but weight loss isn't easy. If you've struggled to get down to a healthy weight, you should know that this is something you can talk to your doctor about. They can help you choose a weight loss program or treatment to help you manage your weight . GLP-1 receptor agonists are an increasingly common treatment option that can help you lose 10% or more of your starting weight. You may also have already tried other weight loss medicines. These include: Bupropion-naltrexone (Contrave) Orlistat (Alli, Xenical) Phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia)"

        "GLP-1 is short for glucagon-like peptide-1. It's a hormone your intestines release when you eat. GLP-1 triggers your pancreas to release insulin, which moves glucose from your blood into your cells for storage. That lowers your blood sugar. GLP-1 also stops the release of glucagon, another hormone your pancreas makes that raises your blood sugar. And GLP-1 slows the movement of food from your stomach to your intestines, which helps keep you feeling full longer. GLP-1 agonists work like the GLP-1 your body makes.
