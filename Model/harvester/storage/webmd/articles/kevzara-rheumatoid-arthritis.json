        "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a type of autoimmune condition , which means that the body’s immune cells attack its own healthy cells. In people with RA , their immune systems attack the lining in their joints, which causes swelling (inflammation). This can cause the joints to become red, warm, stiff, and painful. Over time, the swelling can cause permanent damage, which can make the joints very painful and difficult to use."

        "Most people with RA have issues with the same joints on both sides of the body. For example, if one knee is affected, the other knee is usually also affected. Although RA may start in only a couple of joints, it can spread to other joints if it is not treated. It most commonly causes issues in the wrists, hands, elbows, shoulders, feet, and knees.",
        "If a person with RA is having symptoms, their disease is considered “active.” Some people with this condition will have periods of “remission,” when the pain or stiffness goes away for some length of time. Everyone with RA has a different experience. For example, some people will have their symptoms come and go over time. Others will have “flare-ups,” where symptoms become much worse. These flare-ups may be due to stress, too much activity, or changes in treatment.",
        "The key to treating RA is to reduce the swelling in the joints. This can help reduce pain and stiffness. It can also help prevent permanent damage to the joints. It is important to start treatment for RA as soon as possible after receiving a diagnosis, so that the damage to the joints does not become severe."
