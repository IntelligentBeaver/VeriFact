        "Lactose intolerance and dairy allergy sound a lot alike. Many people think they’re the same thing. But their causes and their effects on your body are very different. So, if you have one of these conditions, understanding dairy allergy vs. lactose intolerance is important.",
        "Lactose intolerance is a digestive problem. If you have it, your body can't make enough lactase, an enzyme you need to digest lactose. That’s a kind of sugar found in milk and other dairy products. When lactose isn't properly digested in your stomach and small intestine, it moves into your colon , where it’s broken down by bacteria and causes bloating and gas. It can be uncomfortable, but it’s not dangerous.",
        "Dairy allergy is an immune system problem. If you have it, your body reacts to the proteins in milk and other dairy products as if they’re dangerous invaders. It releases substances that cause allergy symptoms . This allergic reaction can be mild ( rashes ) to severe ( trouble breathing , loss of consciousness).",
