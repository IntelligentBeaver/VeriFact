        "Low-carbohydrate foods are the hot trend in the food industry. Manufacturers, restaurants, and grocery stores have raced to keep pace with consumer demand, offering everything from beer and ice cream to breads and chocolates. For example, Albertson's grocery store used to carry just a few low-carbohydrate items; today, they offer more than 200 low-carb products.",
        "So what does this proliferation of low-carb foods mean? Can these products really help you lose weight and get healthier? Read on, and we'll help you answer these questions and sort out the confusion surrounding our national obsession to lose weight the low-carbohydrate way.",
        "First of all, if you buy a food labeled \" low carb ,\" there's no guarantee that it's much lower in carbohydrates than foods that don't carry such a label. Since there are no nutrition labeling guidelines or legal definitions for low-carbohydrate foods, it's totally up to the manufacturer.",
        "It makes little sense to pay more for a so-called ultra-low-carbohydrate light beer containing 2.6 grams of carbohydrate and 95 calories, when a basic light beer has 3.2 grams of carbohydrate and 96 calories! So buyer beware: Read that label before you hit the checkout line. After all, most foods with the low-carb label are certainly not lower in price than their regular counterparts."
