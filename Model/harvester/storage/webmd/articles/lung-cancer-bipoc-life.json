        "By Sydney Barned, MD, as told to Kara Mayer Robinson I’m a 40-year-old doctor based in Annapolis, MD. About 7 years ago, my life took a profound turn. I went from thinking I was a healthy adult to being diagnosed with inoperable stage IV lung cancer . I was 33 years old at the time, living in Washington, DC, in the middle of a medical internship on my way to becoming an internal medicine hospitalist , which is a doctor that works inside a hospital. I’d already had treatment for an abnormality in my left lung. But I was having new symptoms, like persistent wheezing , so I went to the hospital right away. They gave me tests and X-rays. Since I’m a doctor, I examined the X-rays myself. They looked normal, but after I read the report I realized something more could be going on, so I requested a chest CT scan. Fortunately, my health care provider listened to my concerns and agreed to do the chest CT. It showed a mass. My pulmonologist , who happened to be a fellow Black female, acted fast and arranged for more tests. Within about a month, I had a diagnosis of stage IV lung cancer. I then started treatment with targeted therapy."
