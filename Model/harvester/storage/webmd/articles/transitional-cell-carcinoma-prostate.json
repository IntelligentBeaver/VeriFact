          "text": "But if the cancer stays confined to the place it started – either the prostatic urethra or the prostatic ducts – it’s possible to remove it completely. Some studies found men with this kind of cancer who got surgery had a survival rate of 100%. That means they were just as likely to live at least another 5 years as men who don’t have cancer. That’s similar to the survival rate for other kinds of prostate cancer that are caught early.",
