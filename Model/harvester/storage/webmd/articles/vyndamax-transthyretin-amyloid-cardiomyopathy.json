        "There are two types of ATTR-CM (see table below). In both types, there is a buildup of a protein called transthyretin (TTR). TTR protein is made in the liver, brain, and retina of the eye. It helps to carry a thyroid hormone (thyroxine) and vitamin A (retinol) around the body. In ATTR-CM, the TTR protein is weak and unstable. This causes the protein to build up in the heart and other organs. The heart muscle becomes thick and stiffens, which leads to heart failure .",
