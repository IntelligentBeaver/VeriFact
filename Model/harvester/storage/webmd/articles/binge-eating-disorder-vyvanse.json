        "Vyvanse is the brand name for the medication lisdexamfetamine dimesylate. It's part of a group of drugs called central nervous system stimulants. They work by boosting the amounts of certain brain chemicals so you feel more alert and aware. They also speed up your heart rate and breathing rate, and they raise your blood pressure .",
        "In your blood throughout the day, Vyvanse slowly changes into another medication, dextroamphetamine . This drug increases dopamine, a chemical that's linked to your brain's motivation and reward systems. When you eat something delicious or hug someone you love , for example, your body releases dopamine and you feel pleasure.",
        "Experts think that when you have BED, food may trigger your brain to make extra dopamine. One theory is that taking Vyvanse could keep your dopamine levels up so you don't try to feel better with food. But it's not known exactly how or why the medicine helps."
