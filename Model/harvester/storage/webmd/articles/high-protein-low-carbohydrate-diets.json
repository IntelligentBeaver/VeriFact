Many people choose to follow this type of diet for weight loss, but they’re also used for other health issues, such as high blood sugar, diabetes, and prediabetes. There are many approaches to high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets, with different guidelines on the types and amounts of carbs allowed.",

Other popular high-protein, low-carb diets include the Paleo, South Beach, and keto diets. These programs generally recommend that dieters get 30%-50% of their total calories from protein.",

The American Heart Association recommends getting 10%-35% of your daily calories from protein. This is about 46 grams of protein for adult women and 56 grams for adult men.",
