        "When you have psoriasis , your symptoms can be better at certain times and worse at others. When things are bad, you may have thick, silvery scales on your skin and dry, itchy red patches that can hurt. There's no cure for psoriasis , but some things can help keep your skin cells from growing too fast and forming scales and patches.",
        "One of those things is natural sunlight. In some cases, being in the sun for short periods of time can help a lot. Some people even notice their scales and patches disappear in warm climates during the summer.",
        "This is because the sun gives off a kind of light called ultraviolet (UV) light. There are two types: UVA and UVB. UVA light by itself doesn't do much to ease psoriasis symptoms , but UVB light can slow down the growth of your skin cells, which helps with scaling and inflammation . UVB also helps your body make vitamin D , which is good for your skin and bones.",
        "Sunlight is only one way to get UVB exposure. You can use artificial sources at home or in your doctor's office. That's called phototherapy."
