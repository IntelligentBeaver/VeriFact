        "Fast forward almost a year after my initial diagnosis, and I just received my second biologic infusion. You receive this immunosuppressant treatment through an infusion every 6 months, and it’s a therapy that depletes all of your B cells, which prevent illness and infection by fighting off foreign invaders (viruses, etc.). In MS, your immune system flags your nerves as foreign invaders and attacks their protective layer (de-myelination). By depleting your B cells, a biologic will stop your body from attacking your nervous system, making it a highly successful treatment for MS. The tradeoff is that without your B cells, you are immunosuppressed and at higher risk for infection. Because of this biologic, I have been stable with no flares for 7 months, making the sacrifice worth it.",
        "Infusion days can last anywhere between 4 and 7 hours. In the last year alone, I’ve had 6 hospitalization days and 3 infusion days. So, I’ve mastered the perfect packing list to get you through these long days, and I'm here to share my advice with you:"

        "Wear layers. Your body temperature will fluctuate during treatments, and most infusion centers and hospitals tend to be VERY cold. Wear something flexible and cozy!",
        "Wear slip-on shoes. Crocs are my go-to because they slide on easily and have a good grip. After getting steroids, Benadryl, and the biologic medicine pumped into your system, you won’t exactly feel steady on your feet.",
        "Bring: an eye mask, noise-canceling headphones, and a neck pillow. Every time I’ve had an extended hospital visit or infusion, I’ve tried to take a nap that is always uncomfortable. Whether it's the fatigue from the MS, the high dose of Benadryl they give you, or just the long days, you WILL want to sleep. I’ve taken the best naps of my life with these three things; you’ll thank me later!",
        "Eat beforehand. Sometimes after the infusion begins, I lose my appetite. It's important to eat beforehand so you’re nourished for extended periods.",
        "Bring snacks. I always bring (healthy) snacks if I get hungry or just want a treat to pass the time! I've brought lunch boxes with carrots, blueberries, Siete chips, Kind granola bars, Koia protein shakes, and even lunch bowls. The nurses usually have a fridge for storing perishables, so don’t be afraid to (nicely) ask.",
        "Get a ride. You will be drowsy, tired, wired, or exhausted by the end of the day, and it probably isn’t best to drive. I am sure your friends or family will want to support you, and this is the perfect way to do so."

        "Bring entertainment. Pack a book, journal, tarot cards, laptop, or an iPad! I’ve gotten very anxious during my infusions, so it's always great to have my favorite comfort show on hand. The first time I watched Grey's Anatomy was during my first hospital stay. Two hospitalizations and 3 infusion days later, I still haven’t finished the show.",
        "Ask for an arm sleeve. The worst part of infusions for me is the IV site. Inserting the IV, having it inside me, and removing it make me extremely uncomfortable. So, my nurses offered me an arm sleeve to cover the IV site. Without having to look at the IV for 6 hours, I begin to forget it's even there. This was a game-changer for my anxiety!",
        "Bring company. There’s no shame in needing some company! My first infusion, I brought my mom, and she sat with me the entire day. The second time, I brought a friend to hold my hand during the hard parts (injecting the IV is the worst for me). And the third time, I brought a friend to travel with me and check in on me. It goes a long way not to feel so lonely.",
        "Prepare for allergic reactions. Unfortunately, I’ve had an allergic reaction every time. This is a common side effect of infusion therapy, and it's important to tell your nurse when you feel any symptoms! For me, the reaction is a scratchy and sore throat, so I always pack cough drops. When this happens, we stop the infusion, inject Benadryl into my IV, and wait 45 minutes. My advice: It can be a bummer to delay your infusion day, but use this as an opportunity to stand up and stretch. My warning: Benadryl can burn going into the IV; just breathe, and it’ll go away within 5 to 10 minutes."
