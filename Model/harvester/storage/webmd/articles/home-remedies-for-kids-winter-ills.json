        "According to the CDC, wrongly giving kids antibiotics for viral infections , and taking antibiotics just long enough to feel better but not finishing the medication , are creating antibiotic-resistant bugs. When you really need to knock down an organism in your child, these \"superbugs\" may laugh off the antibiotics and take over. So what should a parent do instead, as cold winds blow and illnesses flare?",
        "\"Parents are the frontline clinicians,\" Richard P. Walls, MD, a pediatrician in private practice in La Jolla, Calif., tells WebMD. Walls served on a complementary and alternative medicine task force created several years ago by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). \"While families should not believe everything they read on the Internet, I try to teach parents how to assess both wellness and illness.\"",
        "Walls says he believes in the \"Three to Five Day Rule.\" If a child comes down with a viral illness, they should be markedly better in three days and almost well in five days. If there is deviation from this, the pediatrician should be called. \"Fever in the first 24 hours is normal,\" Walls says. \"If the fever starts after a few days, though, a secondary infection might be setting in.\" If the child not better in five days, a trip to the doctor also may be in order. Parents need to use their best judgment -- does this seem like a cold or might it be something different?"
