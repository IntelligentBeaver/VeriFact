        "There’s no denying 2020 was a bad year, but for Denver’s Kate Zerbi it was a living nightmare. She kicked off 2020 with a new diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and a painful breakup, and things got only worse from there.",
        "First, she had a near-fatal case of COVID-19 with long-term health impacts. Later, flesh-eating bacteria entered her body through a microscopic cut she didn’t even know she had. “It was high up in my groin , so there was nothing to amputate to stop the spread. Either the antibiotics were going to work, or I was going to die,” Zerbi says.",
        "Little did she know that Scout, the German shepherd puppy she got in February of 2020, would become her emotional support animal (ESA) and, she says, “the reason I didn’t give up.”",
        "At night, when panic would set in, Scout became Zerbi’s security blanket. And during the day, Scout senses when Zerbi is about to lose her balance or buckle over in pain. The dog runs to her owner’s side before it happens to provide physical or emotional support."
