        "Vertebrogenic pain is a type of chronic (ongoing) pain in your lower back caused by damage to vertebral endplates. An endplate is a layer of bone and cartilage at the top and bottom of each of your back bones. When these endplates are damaged, they can cause nerve pain.",
        "Vertebrogenic pain is a newer term that comes from a big shift in the science of low back pain. For a long time, doctors thought most chronic lower back pain was caused by arthritis or a disk issue. Disks are the squishy cushions that go between your vertebrae.",
        "But researchers have learned that vertebral endplates are filled with nerve fibers that can cause pain when they’re compressed. That could explain a lot of cases of low back pain and point to more effective treatment.",

Researchers have found that in spots where a disk has broken down, the vertebral endplates on either side often have changes, including more pain nerve fibers than normal.
