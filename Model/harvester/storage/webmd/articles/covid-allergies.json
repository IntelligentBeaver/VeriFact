        "If you experience symptoms such as sneezing or coughing, it can be tough to tell if you're dealing with allergies or COVID. One of the best ways to tell COVID from allergies is to know the differences in symptoms. While some symptoms occur in both conditions, some only occur in one or the other.",
        "During allergy season, it can be especially difficult to find out if you have COVID, allergies, or something else like the flu or a cold. That's because symptoms such as sneezing or coughing can happen with all of them.",

You won't get a fever if you have allergies, but you can definitely have a fever if you have COVID, says Mitchell Grayson, MD , division chief of allergy/immunology at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Likewise, body aches aren't related to allergies but can indicate that you may have COVID, he adds.",
        "Allergies tend to occur at the same time every year (if you have seasonal allergies), while COVID tends to occur when the virus is circulating in the community, which tends not to be on a strict seasonal rotation, Grayson points out."
