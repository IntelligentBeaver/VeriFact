        "The pharma company Genentech surveyed more than 2,200 patients, about half of whom are considered \"medically disenfranchised\" because they don't have good access to medical care. About two-thirds of medically disenfranchised Black and Hispanic people said they don't feel like the health care system treats all patients fairly. About half said they skipped follow-up appointments or stopped seeking care because they didn't feel understood, and 1 in 3 don't participate in clinical trials or get vaccinated due to a lack of trust."
