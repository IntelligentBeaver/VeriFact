Increased blood sugar happens when your body’s insulin doesn’t work as well as it should. Type 2 diabetes is a common long-term (chronic) health condition. Some people with type 2 diabetes can control their blood sugar with diet and exercise. Other people need at least one medicine to control their blood sugar.",

Mounjaro doesn’t have to be used on the same day each week, if there are at least 3 days (72 hours) between doses. You also don’t have to use it at the same time of day from week to week.",

This helps to reduce pain and irritation where you get the shot. It also helps your body absorb the Mounjaro completely so it can work to lower your blood sugar.",

The vial must be used with a syringe and needle. “Single-use” means that even if there seems to be some liquid left in the pen or in the vial after you give a dose, you should throw the pen or vial away. You can ask your health care provider to show you how to use Mounjaro before you use it for the first time. Read the instructions for use, which you can get from your pharmacist or online .
