        "Four months. From the time my dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer to the time that he died was just 4 months. It’s hard to believe that more than 21 years have passed since that experience and how it changed my personal and professional passion to create a world where pancreatic cancer patients can thrive. And while we still have a lot of work to do, there have been continuous incremental advances over the last 20 years -- most recently, advancements in the role of genetic and tumor testing for patients and family members -- that give me reason to be very hopeful about what lies ahead and the opportunity to significantly change patient outcomes.",
        "Like most, I knew very little about pancreatic cancer before my father's diagnosis, but as soon as I heard those words, I went online and quickly learned there was a lack of information, resources, and research devoted to the disease. Back then, very little was known about pancreatic cancer -- only a handful of researchers were studying it and the 5-year survival rate was just 4%. I was angry that my dad and thousands of other patients were given no hope. They were offered no treatment options and sent home to get their affairs in order."

        "I have always been inspired by patient advocates, witnessing firsthand what patients and their families do for PanCAN in honor of their loved ones to change the future for pancreatic cancer patients, but I had a newfound realization about the importance of patient advocates when I became a patient myself."

I also had genetic testing done, which is standard for breast cancer patients, to determine what treatments might be best for me and to understand my family’s risk of certain kinds of cancer. After that experience, I was so incredibly grateful to the breast cancer advocates who had come before me and pushed for early detection and better treatments for the disease.",
