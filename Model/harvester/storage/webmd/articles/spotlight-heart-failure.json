        "By J. Emanuel Finet, MD, as told to Marijke Vroomen Durning, RN As a cardiologist who works mainly with heart failure patients, I’ve seen a significant increase in treatment options since I first began practicing. Most importantly, there are new drugs that help these patients live longer, like the combination sacubitril-valsartan pill. Among other things, this drug helps preserve or recover the heart’s “ejection fraction.” As heart failure progresses, the ejection fraction (a measurement that shows how much blood is pumped out of the heart’s left ventricle) usually drops. The ventricle is one of the two lower heart chambers. Medications such as sacubitril-valsartan can help keep the heart from failing further. Other new agents that help heart failure patients are called sodium-glucose transporter inhibitors 2 (SGLT2 inhibitors). These include empagliflozin or dapagliflozin. They help not only patients with weaker hearts, but also those with stiffer hearts. The drugs help lower elevated blood sugar too, which is especially helpful in heart failure patients with diabetes. There is no one-size-fits-all regarding heart failure therapies, though. When we see our patients, we must talk about the various treatment options and personalize their care."

        "And, of course, there are many new mechanical and technological options. When I started practicing medicine, those options were not common, or they didn’t exist at all. For example, we can now replace heart valves without surgery in select patients. Patients can also have cardiac resynchronization therapy to get their heartbeat back in sync, and help the heart pump more efficiently. We also have a new device called the cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) device, but it’s not yet in widespread use. The CCM device is implanted like a pacemaker, but instead of changing the heart’s rhythm, it improves how well the heart contracts. The better the contraction, the better the heart pumps blood. We can also insert new and improved mechanical circulatory support devices (“mechanical hearts”) for heart failure for patients with very weak hearts and poor quality of life. These devices include the HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device. They can be the best treatment choice, or they can act as a bridge for some select patients until they get their much-needed heart transplants."

The researchers hope the drugs may decrease the production of the abnormal protein that causes the stiffness and prevent disease progression.
