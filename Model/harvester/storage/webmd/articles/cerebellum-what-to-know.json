        "The cerebellum is a major structure of your hindbrain responsible for a wide range of functions, including coordinating your movements. It is important in processing some types of memory. Over half of the nerve cells in our brains are found in the cerebellum, and during several important mental processes, the cerebellum plays an essential role and receives information from the other regions of the brain.",

A narrow midline area called the vermis connects the two hemispheres of the cerebellum. On the surface of the cerebellum is tightly folded gray matter."
