        "Around 1 month of age, our son’s fussing morphed into full-blown, hours-long screaming sessions that dominated our evenings and left me and my husband utterly drained and discouraged.",
        "The only thing that seemed to slightly help was swaddling his tiny body in a blanket, holding him close, and bouncing on an exercise ball. Those weeks were a blur of fatigue and frustration. And lots and lots of bouncing.",
        "Colic is characterized by bouts of intense, nonstop crying for more than three hours a day and more than three times a week. Babies with colic seem inconsolable. They may arch their backs and clench their fists. And the crying usually kicks in like clockwork, often in the evening hours.",
        "Though the exact cause of colic isn’t yet understood, it’s possible it has something to do with babies’ developing digestive systems. The theory makes sense, since babies with colic appear to be in pain and may even pull up their legs and pass gas."

If you’re breastfeeding, talk to the pediatrician about temporarily nixing possible allergens from your diet, such as milk products.",
        "Another potential trigger is the pain of trapped gas. Take extra time burping your baby after feeding. If you’re bottle feeding, position your baby a bit more upright during feeding so they swallow less air. Pumping a baby’s legs or giving them time on their bellies (while supervised) is worth a shot too."
