        "Can I do water aerobics if I can’t swim?",
        "You don’t need to know how to swim to enjoy water aerobics. Exercising in the pool is a great way to stay active. In aqua aerobics, you’re not actually swimming, and most classes are in the shallow end of the pool.",
        "If there are any moves in deeper water, you can wear a flotation vest. You can also wear a belt to help you stay above the water. Another tip — position a water noodle between your legs. Put it higher in the back than in the front. This helps with your balance.",
        "Will my hair get wet during water aerobics?",
        "It depends on the type of water aerobics workout you are doing. If you’re sticking to low-impact exercises, your hair should stay dry. That’s because you’ll likely be in the shallow end of the pool, and you won’t be fully underwater.",
        "But if you’re swimming or doing certain pool exercises where you move through the water more intensely, your hair may get wet.",
        "Do you sweat during water aerobics?",
        "You are still sweating during water aerobics — even if you don’t feel it. The water helps you stay cool, though. So, you’ll exercise without feeling the sweat. It’s a great option to not feel overheated.",
        "But be careful about getting dehydrated. Because you don’t feel the sweat, make sure to drink plenty of fluids before and after your aqua workout.",
        "Is water aerobics good for losing weight?",
        "Water aerobics may help you lose weight. People lost weight after a low-intensity, 12-week water aerobics program. The pool sessions went for 50 minutes, twice a week.",
        "What water temperature is best for water aerobics?",
        "The Aquatic Exercise Association suggests the best water aerobics temperature is between 83 F and 86 F (28 C and 30 C).",
        "Water that’s too cold can cause muscle stiffness or limit your movement. And warmer water can make your body overheat. The suggested range is ideal for comfort and flexibility during your water workout."
