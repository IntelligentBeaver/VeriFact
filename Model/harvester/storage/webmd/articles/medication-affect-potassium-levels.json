Medicines that boost potassium may do so in different ways. Some directly add more potassium to your body. Others slow your kidneys’ removal of the potassium you’ve gotten from other sources.

Even a small increase in potassium can have big effects on your health – especially if you already have kidney disease. That's why it's important to check your medicine cabinet for these medicines and talk to your doctor about them."
