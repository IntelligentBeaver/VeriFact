        "Half a century ago, Danish scientists noticed specific Inuit populations had lower rates of heart disease. Researchers believed that was due to their diet, which was rich in fatty fish. Fish and other seafood are excellent sources of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3s), and the researchers thought that the lower rate of heart disease was because of the omega-3s in the fatty fish.",
        "There is evidence from modern studies that omega-3s are good for your heart and blood vessels. Fish, especially cold-water fatty fish (such as salmon, mackerel, and tuna) are the best sources of omega-3s. Because of this, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend 8 ounces of seafood per week for adults who aren't pregnant or nursing and who eat 2,000 calories per day. The American Heart Association recommends eating two 3-ounce portions of fish, especially fatty fish, per week. A 3-ounce portion is about the size of a deck of playing cards."
