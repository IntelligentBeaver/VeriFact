        "Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) is a rare condition. It causes damage to your nervous system that gets worse over time. As a result, you may have abnormal movements, trouble walking or speaking, difficulty swallowing, and hearing and vision loss.",
        "It happens because nerves in your body are getting thinner. You need these nerves to send signals between your body and brain. These signals allow you to move the way you want.",
        "FA also affects the cerebellum in your brain. This part of your brain is important for moving and balancing. But FA doesn’t affect other parts of your brain, including those you need to think and reason. So you’ll still be able to think the same way you would if you didn’t have FA."
