        "Because many types of leukemia show no obvious symptoms early in the disease, leukemia may be diagnosed incidentally during a physical exam or as a result of routine blood testing. If a person appears pale, has enlarged lymph nodes , swollen gums , an enlarged liver or spleen , significant bruising, bleeding, fever, persistent infections, fatigue , or a small pinpoint rash , the doctor should suspect leukemia. A blood test showing an abnormal white cell count may suggest the diagnosis. To confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific type of leukemia, a needle biopsy and aspiration of bone marrow from a pelvic bone will need to be done to test for leukemic cells, DNA markers, and chromosome changes in the bone marrow.",

Bosutinib ( Bosulif ) and ponatinib ( Iclusig ) can be used during any phase of CML if a person is resistant to or cannot tolerate the other drugs. Still another drug, omacetaxine mepesuccinate ( Synribo ), is approved for those whose CML has progressed after treatment with two or more of the previous medications. Asciminib (Scemblix) can also be used after two or more of the previous medications have already been tried or if the person's cancer cells have a T315I mutation."

Known as a molecular targeting drug, it attacks the genetic alterations that cause white blood cells to grow out of control. Gleevec doesn't cure CML, but it can result in long-term remission and survival of CML. This drug was shown to be superior to prior therapies such as busulfan , hydroxyurea , and interferon alpha. There are now five other drugs - asciminib ( Scemblix ), bosutinib ( Bosulif ), dasatinib ( Sprycel ), nilotinib ( Tasigna ), and ponatinib ( Iclusig ), that can be used in CML if the leukemia becomes resistant to Gleevec.",
