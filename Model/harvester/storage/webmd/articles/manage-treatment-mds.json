        "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of disorders that affect bone marrow – the spongy tissue inside your bones where new blood cells are made. Bone marrow contains stem cells, or parent cells that divide and make new cells. MDS prevents new blood cells from becoming mature; MDS also causes the bone marrow to make abnormal stem cells that crowd the bone marrow so you don’t make enough normal blood cells. If you don’t have enough healthy blood cells, it can lead to symptoms like shortness of breath, tiredness, and bruising. MDS is a chronic disease. That means you can't cure it, but you can manage its symptoms and live better with it. Your doctor can prescribe medications and other treatments to slow the disease and relieve symptoms. You'll feel better if you also take good care of yourself during treatment. Eat healthy foods, get enough rest, and protect yourself from infections."
