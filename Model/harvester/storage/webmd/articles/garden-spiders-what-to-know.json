        "The garden spider is a member of the orb weaver family, Araneidae. Garden spiders are found all across the U.S. They're also called writing spiders or corn spiders in some places. To help you identify them, here are some basic facts that you should know.",
        "What do garden spiders look like? Garden spiders are fairly large. Females can be almost an inch long, not counting their legs. Males are a lot smaller, usually only measuring about a quarter of an inch. These spiders have a small head topped with silver hairs and an oval-shaped abdomen with a black and yellow pattern. The pattern includes a thick black stripe in the middle of the abdomen with four white spots on the stripe."

But if they keep building webs in heavily trafficked areas, you can help relocate them to a different part of your yard. Slip on a pair of gardening gloves and move the spider to a safe space out of the way, being careful not to startle it. If you’re uneasy about handling the spider, use a broom to clear away the web when the spider isn’t in it, and it will move on to a new location."
