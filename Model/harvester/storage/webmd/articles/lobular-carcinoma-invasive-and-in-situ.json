        "“Like other breast cancers, ILC often spreads first to the nearby lymph nodes, particularly those in the armpit, called the axillary lymph nodes,” says Thompson. “From there, it can spread to distant organs. Interestingly, ILC has a unique tendency to metastasize to unusual locations, such as the gastrointestinal tract, ovaries, peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity), and bones.”",
        "Is lobular carcinoma worse than ductal?",
        "In general, both types of cancer have the same prognosis. Some research, says Tiersten, suggests that invasive lobular cancer’s prognosis is slightly worse.",
        "Does invasive lobular carcinoma always come back?",
        "No. In fact, most people who have had breast cancer will not have a recurrence. In ILC, the cancer can come back, mostly within 5 to 10 years, but some may not return for decades, says Kruse. Certain factors help predict your risk. These include the stage at which it was diagnosed, how fast it developed, how well you responded to treatment, and whether your cancer was hormone-driven."
