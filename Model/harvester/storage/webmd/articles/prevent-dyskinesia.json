        "When you have Parkinson's disease, you might have sudden, uncontrolled, often jerky movements. These twitches or twists can happen in your face, arms, legs, or upper half of your body.",
        "The movements are different for everyone. Some people have them all day, while others have them before or after they take their medicine. Dyskinesia often starts a few years after treatment with the drug levodopa .",
        "Whether you already have dyskinesia or are looking to avoid it, there are things you can do to prevent or ease the uncontrolled movements.",
        "Levodopa changes . Your doctor may suggest that you change the amount of medicine you take or how often you take it. That way you can get enough of the drug to control Parkinson’s symptoms, but not so much that it triggers dyskinesia. Sometimes just a small change can make a big difference.",
        "Try other medications . Other types of Parkinson’s medicines, including dopamine agonists, COMT inhibitors, or MAO-B inhibitors, may help you prevent or at least delay dyskinesia. Doctors sometimes prescribe them instead of levodopa or in addition to it. Although these drugs are less likely to cause movement issues, they often cause other symptoms, like nausea and hallucinations. They may also prescibe amantadine and clozapine ."
