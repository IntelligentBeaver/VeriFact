        "Like Rodney Dangerfield, cabin fever (or the winter blues or winter malaise ) is a condition that doesn't get much respect, or much formal attention, from some healthcare professionals.",
        "But winter depression and its symptoms -- inactivity, crankiness, sleep loss, and simply feeling down in the dumps -- is real to millions of people and could be more intense in 2002 because of anxieties over world events that range from terrorist attacks to a shaky economy.",

But they can be more severe, often in individuals more vulnerable to stress. You'd expect them to have a harder time dealing with the stresses of the economy and world events.\""
