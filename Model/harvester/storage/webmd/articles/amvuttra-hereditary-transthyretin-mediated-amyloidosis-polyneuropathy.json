This can lead to painful sensations, difficulty with movement and strength, changes in your digestive system and other bodily functions.",

        "Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR) is a rare, long-term, progressive disease that causes a buildup of a protein called transthyretin (TTR). TTR protein is made in the liver, brain, and retina of the eye. It helps to carry a thyroid hormone (thyroxine) and vitamin A (retinol) around the body. People with hATTR have a change (also called a mutation) in the TTR gene, which causes a change in the shape of the protein. A collection of the abnormal protein is called an amyloid deposit.
