        "Your body makes certain proteins to help you grow new blood vessels. The main one is called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). When you have wet AMD, your cells make too much VEGF. This causes abnormal blood vessels to form under the back of your eye. Also called choroidal neovascularization (CNV), these abnormal blood vessels are weak and break easily. As a result, blood and fluid can leak into your eye. If left untreated, wet AMD creates swelling and scar tissue under the center of your retina. This can permanently damage the light-sensitive cells of your eye (macula)."

And you probably won’t even see the needle. You may be able to go back to your normal activities right after treatment. But it may take a few visits for you to know how you’ll feel afterward. You may not have any problems with your treatment. But shots for wet AMD may cause short-term side effects. These are usually mild and go away in 1-2 days. You may: Feel like you have sand in your eye See air bubbles that look like floaters After you get the shot, tell your doctor right away if your eye starts to hurt or you have vision problems that get worse. This could be a sign of a serious complication like infection."
