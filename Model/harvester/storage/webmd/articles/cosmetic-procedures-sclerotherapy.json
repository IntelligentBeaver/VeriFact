Sclerotherapy involves an injection of a solution (generally either a salt or sugar solution) directly into the vein. The solution irritates the lining of the blood vessel, causing it to collapse and stick together, and the blood to clot. Over time, the vessel turns into scar tissue that fades from view.",
