        "Commotio cordis is a medical condition that happens when your heart suddenly stops beating (known as cardiac arrest). It usually happens due to a serious blow or injury to the chest that causes abnormal electrical activity in the heart.",
        "The condition is rare. It's most commonly seen among athletes aged 11-20 who play contact sports such as football or martial arts. The average age of those who have commotio cordis is 15. It can also happen in sports that involve blunt objects such as baseballs, softballs, hockey pucks, or lacrosse balls.",
        "Commotio cordis is an extremely dangerous condition and can lead to death. It's the second-leading cause of sudden cardiac death among athletes. If it occurs, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and medical attention are needed right away to restore the heartbeat as soon as possible, or the odds of survival are very low."

        "Commotio cordis is a life-threatening medical emergency that causes your heart to stop beating. It's usually the result of a blow to the chest, often during sports such as football or martial arts. It also can happen if you're hit hard in the chest by something like a baseball, softball, hockey puck, or lacrosse ball. If you think someone has commotio cordis, a quick response can be the difference between life and death. Call 911, send someone to locate an AED (a type of defibrillator), and begin CPR. If you have commotio cordis, once you're stabilized, doctors will try to confirm what made your heart stop."

It would have to hit your chest at a certain angle and a speed of 40 miles per hour or more. The punch also would have to land during a specific part of your heart's cycle when the electrial system is vulnerable to disruption."
