        "Bipolar disorder and depression have many similarities. But they also have some key differences. It's important to know how to tell one from the other to get the right treatment.",
        "Depression is more than just feeling low. It's a deep sadness or emptiness you can't shake. You might feel hopeless, worthless, and restless. You might lose interest in things that you used to enjoy. Depression (also called major depressive disorder or MDD) often goes hand-in-hand with sleep problems, changes in appetite, and trouble concentrating. It can lead to suicidal thoughts or actions. People with depression might have some days that are better than others. But without proper treatment, their mood tends to remain low.",
        "Bipolar disorder (sometimes called manic depression) is different. If you have it, you have extreme mood swings. You may go through periods of depression (similar to MDD). But you also have periods of great highs.",
        "Bipolar refers to the opposite ends, or poles, of the emotional spectrum -- the highs ( mania ) and the lows (depression). You might be severely depressed for a period of hours, days, weeks, or even months before entering a manic period. The mania could range from several days to 2 months or longer. It's also possible to have a type of bipolar disorder in which you have manic and depressive symptoms at the same time. You might feel sad and hopeless but also be very agitated and restless."
