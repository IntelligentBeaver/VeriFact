Then, at age 32, I sat down to nurse my 8-day-old son and noticed that I was dizzy and that my left arm had begun to tingle. When I stood up, I collapsed. I was rushed to the emergency room. It turns out I had a heart attack. One of my arteries was almost completely blocked due to high cholesterol.",
        "I’ve since learned I have a genetic form of high cholesterol. My doctors put me on medication. They also warned me that to see real improvement, I would need to dramatically alter my diet, too. Over the last 13 years, I’ve made some easy but important changes."

This is more flavorful and is rich in probiotics that may improve heart health since they help lower blood pressure. When I throw burgers on the grill for my family, I make mine a turkey burger.",

Tofu is a great source of heart-healthy protein -- I’ve found that if I toss tofu with oriental seasonings, coat it with cornstarch, and bake it in the oven, it’s delicious and crispy."
