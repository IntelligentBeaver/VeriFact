        "You may also get a heterophile antibody test, a rapid and specific test for mono. It checks your blood for special antibodies that your body makes to fight off a viral infection . This test isn’t always accurate, especially in younger children, and it takes several days for it to show the presence of the antibodies after a child starts to feel ill. The “monospot” is one test that checks for heterophile antibodies.",
        "Sometimes the test may be negative if it was done too early. It can be repeated after 2 weeks, or more tests may be needed.",
        "You may also get an EBV test if you don’t seem to have a typical case of mono. This blood test checks for Epstein Barr virus. Doctors usually don’t need EBV test results to diagnose mono. But it can help them find out if the Epstein Barr virus is to blame. It’s a common virus, and although it can cause mono, you could have the virus and not be sick."
