        "When Essential Tremor significantly interferes with daily activities, long-term drug treatment is needed. Drugs most commonly used to treat the condition include beta-blockers such as propranolol ( Hemangeol , Inderal LA , Inderal XL , InnoPran XL ) and an epilepsy drug called primidone (Mysoline). Gabapentin ( Neurontin ) and Topiramate ( Topamax ), other drugs used to treat epilepsy and migraine , help some people.",
        "With the use of medication , people with essential tremor may see improvement in their ability to control their tremor and improvement in activities such as drinking from a cup or using food utensils. More specialized motor functions, such as being able to thread a needle, may still be too difficult. However, for most people, essential tremor is not disabling.",
        "Your health care provider will determine which treatment is best for you based on your medical history. The goal of treatment is to help provide maximum improvement in function while minimizing the side effects of the medication you are taking.",
        "For people with mild Essential Tremor, drug therapy is usually not necessary. Tremors may be lessened by minimizing exposure to emotional stress and avoiding substances, such as caffeine and nicotine, which may increase tremor. In social situations, a person with mild tremor can take a beta-blocker or drink a small amount of alcohol, if such treatments are approved by a doctor. Although alcohol may lessen the tremor, there is the danger of slowly increasing your intake."
