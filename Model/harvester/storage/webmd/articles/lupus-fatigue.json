        "If you or a loved one is living with lupus, fatigue is likely to be one of the most difficult symptoms. Up to 80% of people with lupus say that fatigue is a primary symptom. About 40% of people with lupus have fatigue that’s severe and doesn’t go away. Just about everyone with lupus will struggle with fatigue at one time or another.",
        "Fatigue isn’t the same as just feeling tired. When a healthy person gets tired, they can go to bed and get up feeling better the next day. If you have fatigue related to lupus, it may feel like you can’t possibly get enough rest. Even if you sleep more than you used to, it may feel like it’s never enough.",
        "You may find that it’s harder to do physical and mental work. The effort needed to do everyday tasks may be overwhelming. You may find you can get a few good hours in each day before you just hit a wall of fatigue."

        "Lupus is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease . It affects many different parts of the body, including your nervous system , skin, joints, kidneys, and other organs. It’s not clear what causes lupus. So, it’s not clear what causes lupus-related fatigue either.",
        "While doctors don’t really know exactly why lupus causes so much fatigue, there are lots of factors that may have something to do with it. These include:"
      ],
      "bullets": [
        "Not enough physical activity. Most people with lupus don’t get enough exercise . If you feel fatigued, it might be harder to go for a walk or spend a few minutes on the treadmill. But, this lack of activity also can make your fatigue worse.",
        "Obesity. More than half of people with lupus are overweight or obese . Some studies suggest that people with lupus who also are obese tend to have worse fatigue.",
        "Trouble sleeping. Many people with lupus have trouble sleeping . If you are waking up a lot at night or having trouble falling asleep, this can lead to more tiredness and fatigue throughout the day.",
        "Anxiety and depression . About 1 in 4 people with lupus have depression and anxiety. Depression and fatigue often go hand in hand. Some studies have suggested that this is even more true in lupus than it is in other health conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS).",
        "Vitamin D deficiency . Most people in general don’t have enough vitamin D, but the problem is especially true among people with lupus. This may be in part because of a tendency to avoid going outside in the sun. People with lupus who don’t have enough vitamin D also report worse fatigue.",
        "Pain. Many people with lupus have pain and arthritis in their joints as well. This pain may contribute to fatigue. People with lupus who report more pain also tend to report greater feelings of fatigue.",
        "Medications. The medicines you’re taking to help with the lupus or other health conditions might cause you to feel fatigued. Medications that can cause fatigue or difficulty sleeping include: Prednisone Pain medicine Antidepressants Blood pressure medicine Muscle relaxants Cold and allergy medicine Ask your doctor if fatigue is a common side effect of anything you’re taking.",
        "Other health conditions. If you have lupus, you’re also at greater risk for having other conditions, including fibromyalgia . However, studies vary a lot with regard to how common this is. Some suggest 10% of people with the most common type of lupus have fibromyalgia. Others suggest it’s as high as 70%. Thyroid disease and anemia (low iron) also may play a role in fatigue when you have lupus."
