        "High blood pressure, also called hypertension, can cause a multitude of serious health issues if left untreated. These include heart attack , stroke , kidney failure, and heart failure as well as vision problems. High blood pressure is a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye disease that can cause vision loss.",
        "Doctors often initially recommend patients modify lifestyle factors in order to reduce blood pressure, focusing on healthy eating and regular exercise. Antihypertensive drugs can also be prescribed for patients whose blood pressure remains stubbornly high. However, there has been some research that suggests a connection between some classes of blood pressure medicines and AMD.",
        "It can be difficult to draw definite conclusions from the studies showing a connection between some antihypertensives and wet AMD, the more serious form of AMD that can cause sudden vision loss, according to Vaidehi Dedania, MD, a retinal ophthalmologist and surgeon at NYU Langone Health. This is because the studies tend to encompass a diverse group of individuals with varying health issues."
