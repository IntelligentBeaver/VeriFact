        "With schizophrenia, we have a life expectancy shorter than the general population. But I’ve often wondered how our diagnosis affects us as we age.",
        "Schizophrenia spans a lifetime for most of us diagnosed with it. While it often begins in the late teen or early adult years, complications can emerge as we age. We have to remember that schizophrenia affects our whole body, not just our brain.",
        "According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), schizophrenia can shorten some lives by as much as 28.5 years. We tend to age faster, due to a combination of factors. They include a higher risk for other health conditions that contribute to a shorter life expectancy as we age.",
        "We’re at higher risk for congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, cancer, Parkinson’s disease, and dementia. We also may experience additional mental health conditions, like depression and anxiety, as we age."

        "I recently read an article by Harvard Medical School that found schizophrenia and aging may share a biological basis. The study showed that people with schizophrenia and older adults have two types of brain cells with similar sets of changes in gene activity. Researchers hope to find new ways of treating cognitive decline in schizophrenia and aging.",
        "Remission in schizophrenia is a period of 6 months or longer when your symptoms are less severe. While there’s no cure for schizophrenia, recovery and remission are possible for many.",
        "The best thing to improve your physical and mental health as you age is to stick to your treatment plan. Make sure to be proactive and monitor any side effects that arise, because antipsychotic medications can cause different side effects in older adults. Notify your health care provider if you notice new symptoms or side effects. Any changes in medication should be made under your doctor’s supervision."
