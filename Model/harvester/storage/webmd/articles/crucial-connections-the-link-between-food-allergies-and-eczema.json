        "Being part of mom support groups has been an invaluable source of connection and understanding for me. These groups offer a safe haven for mothers to share, vent, and ask questions about their journey through motherhood. However, in these communities, I've noticed a recurring theme – the same questions cropping up repeatedly. What has stood out the most for me are the inquiries about allergies and the signs of potentially severe food allergy symptoms. In the past 5 years, my life has become a crash course in food allergy management, and every day continues to bring new revelations on this subject. This post is dedicated to shedding light on food allergy symptoms, particularly eczema (atopic dermatitis) and the often-overlooked connection between the two.",

        "Our daughter began showing symptoms of food allergies when she was just 4 months old. What's fascinating is that she was exclusively breastfed until she reached 9 months. This means that the allergens she reacted to were coming through my breastmilk. Despite our concerns, her pediatrician repeatedly dismissed her symptoms as \"baby acne\" and assured us that there was no need to worry. We were also bombarded with articles from well-meaning friends and family, all emphasizing the rarity of allergens passing through breastmilk"

As caregivers, we have a keen sense when something isn't right with our children. Our daughter's skin was inflamed, itchy, scaly, and raised. She would incessantly scratch her face, mouth, and legs day and night. It got to the point where we had to put gloves on her hands. After extensive observation, we decided to get her allergy tested at 9 months, and she was diagnosed with allergies to the Top 8 allergens*. While the diagnosis was a gut punch, it also provided clarity. Our daughter's allergies have transformed our lives and our perspective on the world",

        "Understanding the difference between intolerance and allergy is crucial. While I've avoided consuming dairy for most of my life due to digestive issues, my daughter's dairy allergy results in more severe symptoms. An intolerance affects the digestive system, while an allergy impacts the immune system. Immediate symptoms of a food allergy can include eczema, hives, wheezing, itching or tingling around the lips or mouth, swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat, coughing, shortness of breath, or vomiting. If you observe any of these symptoms in your child after eating, it's essential to seek medical attention promptly.",
        "Eczema (atopic dermatitis): More often than not, eczema is the initial symptom of an allergy. Eczema, or atopic dermatitis, results from a combination of factors, including immune system activation, genetics, environmental triggers, and stress. It causes your immune system to react excessively to irritants or allergens, often leading to dry, itchy skin and rashes in specific areas like the face, elbows, knees, hands, and feet."
