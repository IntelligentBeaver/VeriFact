        "June 14, 2023 – American track star Tori Bowie, who was found dead in Orange County, FL, earlier this year, died while in labor, according to a recently released autopsy report. She was 32 and 8 months pregnant at the time.",
        "The autopsy report listed respiratory distress and eclampsia as potential complications, The New York Times reported . Bowie’s exact date of death is unknown because she was not heard from for several days and was found May 2 in her home with no signs of foul play. Her death was confirmed May 3 by U.S.A. Track and Field.",
        "A native of Mississippi, Bowie competed at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and won three medals , including a gold in the 4x100 meter relay.",
        "Her death spotlights the increased risk of pregnancy complications experienced by Black women. Black women are three times more likely to die of a pregnancy-related cause than white women, according to the CDC .",
        "The pregnancy complication listed on Bowie’s autopsy report, eclampsia, typically occurs as a complication of a condition called preeclampsia, which affects Black women 60% more often than white women, according to the Preeclampsia Foundation . Preeclampsia is a pregnancy disorder in which a woman has high blood pressure and a specific protein is found in their urine. According to the Cleveland Clinic , eclampsia is considered a preeclampsia complication, but “it can happen without signs of preeclampsia.” When eclampsia occurs, a woman experiences seizures, severe distress or confusion, and may lose consciousness."
