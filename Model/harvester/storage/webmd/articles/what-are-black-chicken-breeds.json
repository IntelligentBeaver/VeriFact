The Black Australorp has black feathers with a greenish sheen, while the regular Australorp has white feathers and skin. The Australorp is renowned for its high egg production, with backyard-kept birds producing approximately 250 eggs annually. The dual-purpose chicken breed can also be used to produce meat.",
        "Crèvecoeur chicken. This rare French chicken breed has a solid black beak, plumage, and shanks. The Crèvecoeur chicken also has a unique “V” comb that gives it a disgruntled appearance. The bird makes a great pet due to its docile temperament, moderate egg production, and striking appearance. You can also harvest this chicken for its savory meat.",
        "Spanish chicken. The visually arresting Spanish chicken has smooth, greenish-black feathers and a flowing tail. The male Spanish chicken has a large, erect comb, while the female has a floppy comb. The White-Faced Black Spanish variation has a large white face and white earlobes that stand out from the black body. This breed produces large quantities of white eggs, but the chickens require attentive care in extreme temperatures.",
        "Sumatra chicken. This glamorous black chicken breed originated in Borno, Java, and Sumatra as a fighting bird, but today, it's kept by backyard chicken raisers. The chicken has black bones, dark skin , green-black feathers, a purple face, and a long, majestic tail. The Sumatra chicken can be an excellent choice if you want an ornamental chicken that will add beauty to your backyard. A hen will also lay modest quantities of small white eggs. But these birds can be flighty and difficult to handle, making them a challenge for inexperienced chicken owners.",
        "Xichuan black-bone chicken. This all-black bird originated in the remote region of Xichuan County in China. Local residents used the black-bone chicken to create medicinal remedies for diabetes, menstrual abnormalities, and other conditions. Today, Xichuan chickens remain rare and understudied."
