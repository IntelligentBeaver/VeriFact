        "Your lungs are where your blood picks up oxygen before carrying it to cells in the rest of your body. When you breathe in, air flows into your lungs through your windpipe or trachea . Your windpipe divides into two tubes called the bronchi, which lead to your left and right lungs.",

        "When you have \"popcorn lung,\" those tiny air passages get irritated and inflamed. That leads to scarring that makes them narrower. That makes it harder for you to get enough air."
