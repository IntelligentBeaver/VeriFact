Mention any symptoms you’ve had recently, even if they seem to be unrelated to the condition. EoE is often connected to other conditions, like allergies and acid reflux , so your symptoms may vary. Jot down specifics about each of your symptoms. For example, when did you first notice them? How often do you have them? Does anything help or make them worse? Have you ever tried a different diet ? If so, did it change your symptoms? Swallowing is an important part of EoE. Think about your swallowing and write down anything you think will help your doctor understand what’s going on. For example, is it hard to swallow? When you try to swallow, does food get stuck? Do you ever feel food going up the back of your throat?"
