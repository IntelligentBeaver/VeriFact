        "Your pancreas is a gland that makes enzymes to digest your food and hormones to regulate your blood sugar levels. Your pancreas is shaped like a comma and located deep in your belly, between your spine and your stomach. The head of your comma-shaped pancreas is on the right side of your belly, tucked into where your small intestine starts. The body and tail of your pancreas extend to the left, across your belly. Because it's so deep inside your belly, you may not have any symptoms or signs that anything is wrong until your condition is advanced.",
        "Because your pancreas is deep in your belly, you may not have symptoms of pancreatic cancer until after it has grown large or spread to other organs. (Photo Credit: Science Photo Library/Getty Images)",
        "The pancreas has a couple of types of cells: exocrine and endocrine cells. Exocrine cells make enzymes that help you digest food. About 90% of pancreatic cancer start as adenocarcinoma tumors in these exocrine cells. Usually, it starts in the cells that surround the pancreatic duct that feeds digestive juices into your small intestine.",
        "Endocrine cells make hormones like insulin and glucagon that help regulate your blood sugar. Less than 10% of pancreatic cancers start in these endocrine cells. These cancers are called pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and they tend to grow slower than pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors.",
