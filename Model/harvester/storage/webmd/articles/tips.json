        "Because milk is the leading food source of calcium and vitamin D, if you eliminate dairy products from your diet, it makes it difficult to get enough of those nutrients that are so important for bone health. Dairy products are naturally high in calcium and other essential nutrients and many dairy products are fortified with vitamin D .",

Lactose-free cow’s milk is comparable to regular cow’s milk because it is protein-rich and has a similar nutritional profile overall. The number of calories in lactose-free milk depends on the percentage of fat in the milk."
