You can also find open-sided \"thong style\" panties held together by straps in the front and back that rest on top of the hip bone. They are reusable, washable, and typically available in a range of colors. You can get day styles as well as overnight ones, which are designed to hold more urine. Like pads, this underwear is designed to be absorbent, to keep moisture from your skin, and to control odor."
