        "While living with type 2 diabetes for almost 20 years, I didn’t always have a good relationship with exercise or regular physical activity until about 5 years ago.  Unfortunately, the process of losing my sight gave me the fuel that I needed to get better.",
        "When I got serious about adding exercise to my lifestyle, I was also dealing with vision loss and had to be careful about what exercises I chose to do.  My retina was completely detached from the right eye, and the one in my left eye was also beginning to detach. It left me with a new dilemma to face. I couldn’t even do moderately intense workouts without my eyes bleeding from the retina. So I enlisted the help of my brother, who is a certified personal trainer. He helped me learn how to do the exercises that wouldn’t increase the pressure in my eyes, causing them to bleed.",
        "After a few months of doing low-impact exercises, I began to be able to increase the intensity of my workouts. I was losing weight and building muscle, which led to more regulated blood sugar levels.  Soon after that, I was able to do HIIT workouts without experiencing the bleeding."

        "This period of my life was very significant for me and helped me to stay focused during the pandemic lockdowns. While a lot of folks slowed down, I took advantage of the time and opportunity to get my health back on track. It was very difficult for a lot of people because of the isolation, but pouring all of my effort and concentration into my body and mind truly helped me to work on myself. After the lockdowns, I continued my workout routines and I felt I was doing well.",
        "Then in 2022, I started having some difficulty keeping my numbers down even with the HIIT workouts. This time, I asked some colleagues about how these workouts affected my blood sugar levels. I found out that my body’s adverse reactions to these workouts may have been because of increased stress levels and adrenaline from the intensity of the workouts."

        "The best way that I could describe these types of workouts is lots of stretching.  I did these types of workouts for about 3 months. I enjoyed the stretching because it made my body feel very relaxed after the workout, but I was so used to the HIIT workouts that I felt like I needed to increase the intensity a little bit.",
        "Eventually, I found a nice spot between moderate and high intensity. Now, I have been consistent with these workouts. I work out at home using an app that has hundreds of workouts for me to choose from. I am definitely seeing a difference in my blood sugar levels and my body. I can’t wait to see what my A1c will show next month.",
