        "Methylene blue has been around since it was invented in the 19th century by a German chemist. The textile industry first used it for dyeing purposes. Later, bacteriology, microscopy, and chemistry labs used its color-changing properties in experiments and tests.",
        "About 125 years ago, a German physician began using methylene blue as a medical treatment for malaria. Since then, its uses have evolved. Currently, it’s FDA-approved only for treating methemoglobinemia, although doctors also use it off-label for other conditions."

        "Methylene blue is a blue liquid solution that’s FDA-approved to treat a rare blood problem called methemoglobinemia, where red blood cells can’t carry oxygen the right way. You get it as an IV infusion in your vein, and it often works after just one dose. Doctors sometimes use it for other things too, like treating certain types of shock, poisonings, or during cancer surgery to help find lymph nodes . Some early research also suggests it might help fight infections like COVID-19 or even have benefits for aging and brain health, but those uses are still being studied."

        "Can methylene blue be used with Lugol's iodine solution?",
        "Yes, this technique is called double staining. Lugol’s iodine is a solution of potassium iodide with iodine in water. Your doctor may use both Lugol’s iodine and methylene blue together to diagnose a problem during an endoscopy . Typically doctors use this particular double staining method to find squamous cell carcinoma or other precancerous cells in the esophagus.",
        "Does vitamin C interact with methylene blue?",
        "If you take vitamin C with methylene blue, it can boost its effects. When you combine the two, their antioxidant power increases. You should only ever take methylene blue under the care of a doctor. Discuss any other medicines or vitamins that you are taking with them.",
        "How long does it take for methylene blue to work in humans​?",
        "The IV infusion of methylene blue takes less than 30 minutes in a clinic. Usually this one dose is enough to stop symptoms and treat the problem. If you still have symptoms of methemoglobinemia after one hour, your doctor may give you a second dose."
