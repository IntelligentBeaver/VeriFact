        "Although some medications are considered safe to take during pregnancy , the effects of other medications on your unborn baby are unknown. According to the CDC, about two-thirds of women in the U.S. take one or more prescription medications during pregnancy . Yet most medications have not been adequately studied for their safety during pregnancy. One report notes that more that 90% of the medications approved by the FDA from 1980 to 2000 had insufficient data to determine safety in pregnancy. Therefore, it is very important to pay special attention to medications you take while you are pregnant, especially during the first trimester , which is a crucial time of development for your baby.",

Your doctor will weigh the benefit to you and the risk to your baby when making their recommendations. With some medications, the risk of not taking them may be more serious than the risk associated with taking them.",
