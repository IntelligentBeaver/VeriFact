After treatment, in l971, he\nparticipated in Hazelden’s counselor training program, and in l972 helped start\nthe Hazelden Family Program. Instead of confronting people with their\n\"dysfunction,\" the Hazelden Family Program assumes that people are\ncapable of change when they better understand what’s happening in their\nlives.",
        "After 20 years as manager of family services at Hazelden, Williams is now\nretired, spending his summers on a boat on the Mississippi River. The rest of\nthe year he helps his wife, Patricia Hampl, with research for her writing and\ndoes some writing of his own.",
