But when you have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), your symptoms are likely to eventually come back. Still, remissions in CLL can last a long time. And when your cancer returns, you can choose to have more treatment. This can often lead to another remission.

        "There’s no sure way to stay in remission, but a healthy lifestyle helps you take care of your whole body. Stay active This includes being physically active throughout your day. It can help you stay strong and boosts your energy and mood. Try for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity on most days. Try things like brisk walking at 2.5 miles per hour or faster. You can also do yard work or bike less than 10 miles per hour. If you’re not active now, work up to that. Also, be sure you move around throughout your day instead of sitting a lot. Being active isn’t just about working out. And you don’t have to go to a gym to do it. Eat a balanced diet You’ll also want to eat lots of vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and lean protein. And limit saturated fat, added sugars, and sodium. Many studies have linked this way of eating to a lower risk of conditions including heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.  And it can help you feel and live better overall."
