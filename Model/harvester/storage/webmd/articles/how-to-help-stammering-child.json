        "Stuttering is a disruption in the normal patterns of speech.  It’s sometimes called stammering or dysfluency. It can take many forms. For example, someone who stutters might repeat a sound or a syllable, especially at the beginning of the word, such as \"li- li- like.\" Or they might use a prolonged sound such as \"ssssssee.\" Sometimes they may completely stop talking or leave out sounds. Or they'll repeatedly interrupt speech with sounds such as \"uh\" or \"um.\"",
        "Anyone can stutter at any age. But it's most common among children who are learning to form words into sentences. Boys are more likely than girls to stutter. It often starts between the ages of 18 and 24 months and tends to come and go up to the age of 5.",
        "About 1 out of every 5 children at some point have a problem with speech that seems serious enough to cause parents concern. And about 1 out of every 20 children will develop stuttering that lasts for more than 6 months. The fact that stuttering at times seems serious or continues for more than 6 months doesn’t necessarily mean that it will be a lifelong problem. Knowing what to look for and how to respond to your child's stuttering will go a long way toward preventing that.",
        "If your child stutters, listen attentively to what they are saying. Maintain normal eye contact without showing signs of impatience or frustration. (Photo Credit: E+ / Getty Images)",
        "Stuttering isn’t uncommon. For many children, it's simply part of learning to use language and putting words together to form sentences. It may come and go, and last for a few weeks or for a couple of years. Most children (50%-80%) outgrow it by puberty. But for some, stuttering becomes a lifelong condition that causes problems in school and in adult life, including self-esteem issues and communicating with other people. About 1% percent of the world's population stutters, according to the Stuttering Foundation."
