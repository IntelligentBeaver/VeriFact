        "What are stem cells ?",
        "In all animals, stem cells are like blank slates. They start out without any clear identity, but can divide and grow into many different types of cells, like muscle or blood cells .",
        "What is stem cell therapy?",
        "Stem cells are being used to treat illness and heal injuries in pets. They are injected into the body to repair muscles, joints, and ligaments that have been damaged by arthritis or injury. Some cancers are treated with stem cells taken from the pet's own bone marrow. And research is underway to test stem cells for diabetes treatment , and to treat animals that have lost control of their bladders.",
        "Does stem cell therapy for pets work the same as in humans?",
        "Yes. The basic idea is the same, but because there are fewer regulations for treating animals, stem cell therapy is used more often in pets than in humans."

        "Does it work?",
