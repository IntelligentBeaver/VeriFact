It’s a problem with specific nerves in the brain that control the eyes -- most often, the third cranial, or oculomotor, nerve, which helps us move our eyes and raise our eyelids. In some cases, it also affects the sixth cranial nerve , which turns our gaze out, and the fourth cranial nerve, which moves our eyes up and down.",
