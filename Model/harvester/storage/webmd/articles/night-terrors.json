In a survey of Canadian college students, 17% said food influenced their dreams and of that group, 44% said eating dairy (cheese, milk, ice cream, pizza) gave them disturbing dreams. But the study authors cautioned that this link could be due to eating the food late at night/poor digestion, the influence of folklore, or a dairy sensitivity, and not necessarily because cheese has something in it that triggers nightmares. If you have night terrors, you should avoid greasy and fatty foods close to bedtime, mainly because these are hard to digest and could affect your sleep.",
