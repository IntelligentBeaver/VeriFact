        "Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is a condition that causes a certain type of protein to build up in your kidneys. It progresses differently in everyone. Your kidneys might still work well years later. Or you could quickly develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD), also known as end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure. This means your kidneys can no longer filter waste. The good news is that there are ways to slow the damage. Ask your nephrologist (kidney doctor) which medications might work for you and if there are other ways you can protect your kidneys."

        "IgA is a protein your immune system makes. It attaches to germs and signals your immune system to protect your body from infection. But when you have IgA nephropathy, this protein doesn't work like it should. Instead of sticking to germs, it clumps together in your kidneys. This signals your immune system like usual, triggering inflammation . The buildup of IgA in your kidneys slowly damages tiny filters called glomeruli that clean your blood. Some people live with IgA nephropathy for 10 or more years without symptoms. But eventually, damage from IgA nephropathy can badly scar your kidneys and lead to other issues."

Damaged kidneys leak a protein called albumin into your urine. Foamy urine is a sign of this. There are several medications that people can take to reduce protein in the urine.
