        "Tick paralysis is a disease that causes tingling and numbness all over the body in people bitten by ticks . The numbness can lead to weakness.",
        "While the symptoms can be alarming, treatment is simple: remove the tick, and you’ll usually feel better in a couple of hours. Tick paralysis isn’t common, but you should take it seriously because in very rare cases, if untreated, the disease can affect your lungs and make it hard to breathe . That can be fatal.",
        "In the U.S., tick paralysis is most common in the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountain states, and the Southeastern part of the country. The American dog tick, Rocky Mountain wood tick, and dermacentor ticks are most likely to cause tick paralysis. But 40 kinds of ticks can cause tick paralysis, and the symptoms depend on the species of tick that bit you.",
