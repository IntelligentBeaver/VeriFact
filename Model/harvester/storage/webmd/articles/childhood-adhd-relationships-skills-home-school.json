        "While most children learn social cues by observing and adjusting over time, kids with ADHD often miss the small but important signals that help them know how to act around others. This affects family life too. It can make getting along with brothers and sisters – something that can be bumpy sometimes in all families – tough. Research shows that sibling relationships tend to involve more conflict in families with a child who has ADHD. Understanding why this happens is the first step in helping your child develop better social skills. There are some common behaviors that can make relationships tougher for kids with ADHD: Your child may seem distracted or not listening. It might seem like they're ignoring others when they're really having trouble focusing. They may struggle to follow directions . They may miss key details or forget what was just said, especially during group play or classroom activities. They're always on the go. Sitting still, waiting, or playing calmly can be challenging, whether it's during dinner, class, or playtime."

You might say, \"Did you notice your friend looked upset when you interrupted?\" You can also use books, TV shows, or real-life examples to point out inappropriate behavior and how others react through body language and facial expressions. Make role-playing part of learning. Role-playing can help your child practice challenging social situations, like taking turns or coping with emotions when things don't go their way. Practicing these responses at home can build your child's confidence before they use them with others. Choose the right social settings. Small, low-pressure environments work best. Set up one-on-one or small group play dates with children who show strong social skills and can be good role models. Give them chances to practice. Practice at home matters, but real growth happens with other children. Look for social activities where your child can take part and try out new skills with their peers."

          "text": "Since ADHD can affect relationships with siblings and parents, it can help to strengthen those bonds if you involve your child in family activities without singling them out. Kids with ADHD can be extra-sensitive to criticism. They can often feel like they're always making mistakes or constantly falling short. Putting too much focus on their mistakes can hurt their confidence. Instead of pointing out every error, guide them with patience and encourage their efforts. This helps them feel supported instead of punished and builds their self-esteem. It's important to remind your child that they're valued for who they are, not just how they behave. By offering positive reinforcement and a loving relationship, you help them feel secure and capable of growing.",
