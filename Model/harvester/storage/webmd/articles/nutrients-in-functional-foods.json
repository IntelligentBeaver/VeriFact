        "How much do you need? Getting 2 grams of either plant stanols or sterols daily can bring down bad cholesterol ( LDL ) by 5% to 15% in a few weeks. If you already eat butter, margarine, or oil-based spreads, switching to one with extra plant stanols or sterols might be a good move, says Christine Gerbstadt, MD, RD, author of Doctor's Detox Diet . It's easy to overdo fats, though, so eat these margarines and oils in moderation."

        "What is it? Fiber is naturally in plant foods: fruits, vegetables, beans and other legumes, and whole grains . Food scientists have created powdered fiber with no real flavor. It's added where you'd never expect to find it: in hot dog buns, sugary cereals, even yogurt. On the label it may be called inulin, maltodextrin, polydextrose, or chicory fiber. It often comes from different sources than the dietary fiber in oats, whole wheat bread, or bran cereal.",
        "How does fiber help the heart? It's well-known that fiber can bring down your cholesterol level. Eating enough fiber can also lower your chances of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes , and obesity. The problem is that most people don't get enough.",
        "\"Fiber added to bread or cereal can be a good thing,\" says Susan Moores, MS, RD. But scientists don't know whether adding refined fiber to foods will give you the same health benefits as eating fiber naturally found in foods. The best bet is to follow a healthy diet that includes foods that are naturally high in fiber: beans, vegetables, and whole grains, Moores says.",
        "How much fiber do you need? Women need about 25 grams of fiber daily, while men need about 38 grams a day. Your body needs two kinds of fiber. Soluble fiber, which slows digestion, can be found in beans, nuts, and grains including oats. Insoluble fiber, which helps food pass through the body, and can be found in vegetables and whole grains."

        "How much omega-3 do you need? The American Heart Association advises people to eat fish at least twice a week to get enough omega-3s. A 4-ounce serving of salmon has 2 grams of omega-3s. If you have a heart condition, ask your doctor if you need higher amounts of omega-3s.",
