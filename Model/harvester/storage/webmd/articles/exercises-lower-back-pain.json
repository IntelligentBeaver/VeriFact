        "Lower back pain is a common experience for many adults. It can often result in pain, tingling, and/or numbness in the lower body. There are many causes of lower back pain, the most common include muscle strain and ligament strain.",
        "There are two types of back pain: acute and chronic. Acute back pain lasts a few days or weeks. Most lower back pain is acute. Chronic back pain lasts longer than 12 weeks and is less common, but can have the same causes as acute back pain.",
        "There are preventative measures you can take to relieve episodes and prevent future pains. Stretching and focused back and abdominal strengthening exercises are two of the best ways to ease lower back pain. Strong abdominal and hip flexor muscles help improve posture, and strong glutes help support the back while walking, standing, and sitting. Having strong muscles improves your mobility."
