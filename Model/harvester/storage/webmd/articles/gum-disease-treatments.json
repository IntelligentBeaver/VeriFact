During a typical checkup, your dentist or dental hygienist will remove the plaque and tartar (plaque that builds up and hardens on the tooth surface and can only be removed with professional cleaning) from above and below the gumline of your teeth. If you have signs of gum disease, your dentist may recommend professional dental cleaning more than twice a year. These cleanings aren’t treatments for active gum disease. But they’re important preventive measures.",

In this procedure, your plaque and tartar from above and below your gumline are scraped away (scaling) and rough spots on your tooth roots are made smooth (planing). Smoothing these rough spots removes bacteria and provides a clean surface for your gums to reattach to your teeth. Scaling and root planing is done if your dentist or periodontist finds you have plaque and calculus (hardened plaque, also called tartar) under your gums that need to be removed.",
        "Medications . There’s no magic pill or cream that can cure gum disease, Sahl says. Still, your dentist may prescribe medication as part of your treatment. Some options include: Antiseptic chip or antibiotic microspheres: You insert these tiny gels or particles into pockets in your gum, and they release medication slowly over time to help reduce the size of the pocket and get rid of bacteria. Antibiotic gel: You spread this on gum pockets after a deep cleaning to help control infection. Enzyme suppressant: You take this tablet after a deep cleaning to block certain enzymes in your mouth from breaking down gum tissue.",
        "Flap surgery/pocket reduction surgery. During this procedure, your gums are lifted back and tartar is removed. In some cases, irregular surfaces of the damaged bone are smoothed to limit areas where disease-causing bacteria can hide. Your gums are then placed so that tissue fits snugly around your tooth. This reduces the space between your gum and tooth. It also decreases areas where harmful bacteria can grow and lessens your chance of serious health problems caused by gum disease.",

Grafts serve as a platform for the regrowth of bone, which restores stability to your teeth. New technology, called tissue engineering, encourages your body to regenerate bone and tissue at a faster rate.",
        "Soft tissue grafts. These can reinforce thin gums or fill in places where your gums have receded. Grafted tissue, most often taken from the roof of your mouth, is stitched into place. That adds tissue to your affected area.",
        "Guided tissue regeneration. Performed when the bone supporting your teeth has been destroyed, this procedure causes your bone and gum tissue to grow. Done along with flap surgery, a small piece of mesh-like fabric is inserted between your bone and gum tissue. This keeps your gum tissue from growing into the area where your bone should be. That allows your bone and connective tissue to regrow and better support your teeth.",

            "Professional dental cleaning. During a typical checkup, your dentist or dental hygienist will remove the plaque and tartar (plaque that builds up and hardens on the tooth surface and can only be removed with professional cleaning) from above and below the gumline of your teeth. If you have signs of gum disease, your dentist may recommend professional dental cleaning more than twice a year. These cleanings aren’t treatments for active gum disease. But they’re important preventive measures.",
            "Scaling and root planing. This deep cleaning is done under a local anesthetic. In this procedure, your plaque and tartar from above and below your gumline are scraped away (scaling) and rough spots on your tooth roots are made smooth (planing). Smoothing these rough spots removes bacteria and provides a clean surface for your gums to reattach to your teeth. Scaling and root planing is done if your dentist or periodontist finds you have plaque and calculus (hardened plaque, also called tartar) under your gums that need to be removed.",
            "Medications . There’s no magic pill or cream that can cure gum disease, Sahl says. Still, your dentist may prescribe medication as part of your treatment. Some options include: Antiseptic chip or antibiotic microspheres: You insert these tiny gels or particles into pockets in your gum, and they release medication slowly over time to help reduce the size of the pocket and get rid of bacteria. Antibiotic gel: You spread this on gum pockets after a deep cleaning to help control infection. Enzyme suppressant: You take this tablet after a deep cleaning to block certain enzymes in your mouth from breaking down gum tissue."

            "Flap surgery/pocket reduction surgery. During this procedure, your gums are lifted back and tartar is removed. In some cases, irregular surfaces of the damaged bone are smoothed to limit areas where disease-causing bacteria can hide. Your gums are then placed so that tissue fits snugly around your tooth. This reduces the space between your gum and tooth. It also decreases areas where harmful bacteria can grow and lessens your chance of serious health problems caused by gum disease.",
            "Bone grafts. These use fragments of your own bone, synthetic bone, or donated bone to replace bone destroyed by your gum disease. Grafts serve as a platform for the regrowth of bone, which restores stability to your teeth. New technology, called tissue engineering, encourages your body to regenerate bone and tissue at a faster rate.",
            "Soft tissue grafts. These can reinforce thin gums or fill in places where your gums have receded. Grafted tissue, most often taken from the roof of your mouth, is stitched into place. That adds tissue to your affected area.",

Done along with flap surgery, a small piece of mesh-like fabric is inserted between your bone and gum tissue. This keeps your gum tissue from growing into the area where your bone should be.
