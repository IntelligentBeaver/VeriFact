        "Thanks to advances in medicine, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has gone from a life-threatening cancer to a chronic illness you can live with for years. But the drugs and treatments needed to manage the illness can become costly. You will most likely need to continue some sort of treatment even if you do not have any symptoms or are in remission (tests show no signs of the disease). Most people take medications for the rest of their lives, although research has shown people in remission may be able to stop treatment. The costs of long-term medicines and treatment for CML are often higher than treatment for other blood cancers. Costs have gone up over the years as the price of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies – a common type of medication taken daily to manage CML – has increased. Your out-of-pocket costs will depend on many things, including: What treatment or medication works best for you If you have medical insurance, and what coverage you have if you do (including your prescription coverage) Other effects of your cancer (such as other medical conditions, reactions to treatment that require hospital and emergency department visits, etc.) High medication costs impact many Americans, but there are some ways you can lessen or manage the financial burden."

        "When you talk to your doctor about treatment and drug options, ask if taking a generic medication is an option. Generic drugs have the same active ingredient as brand-name medicines but may have other differences – such as colors or flavorings – that do not impact how the drug works. Often, drug companies wait several years after a brand-named drug has been on the market before developing generic drugs because of patent protections. The generic versions typically cost less because the companies don’t have to go through the same animal and human trials they did with the brand-name drug. Generic versions of drugs often offer the same or similar results and safety as brand-name options – but usually at a much lower cost. In some cases, generic drugs also help to lower the cost of the brand-name drug, too. But people react differently to different drugs and may have different side effects and reactions, so it’s important to talk to your doctor about the best options for you."

        "Whether you’re taking generic or brand-name medicines, prices can vary greatly from pharmacy to pharmacy. It's important to shop around and find the best price, especially since you’ll likely be taking the medications for a long time. Most pharmacies will give you a price quote over the phone, or you may be able to find prices online. When calling stores or pharmacies, ask about possible savings clubs or programs that can provide medications at reduced costs, especially at big retail or club stores. Sometimes, you can also receive a discount for ordering several months at a time, or getting the drug via mail order. If you have insurance, call and ask if they have a mail-order pharmacy that could ship your medications to your home. Sometimes these pharmacies offer discounted rates. Online sites such as WebMDRx and GoodRx can also help you easily compare prices. When renewing or choosing a medical plan with prescription coverage, also be sure to consider what medication they cover and the cost. Call and ask about the coverages and cost of the different drugs under the different plans to find the best option. Keep in mind that you may need to switch medications in the future."

GoodRx also offers discounts for many prescriptions that can be used at local pharmacies. Some online pharmacies will not go through your insurance and you must pay out of pocket, but the cost can still be lower than your copay or deductible at another pharmacy. When ordering anything online, make sure you buy from a credible and safe pharmacy. Online pharmacies certified by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy operate based on national quality standards. Also, be wary of pharmacies that do not require a recent prescription for medication from a doctor who is currently treating you.
