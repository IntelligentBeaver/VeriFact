I would love her to time the pregnancy for when she is healthiest,\" says Jeanne Conry, MD, PhD, president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \"For a woman who is overweight or obese, the No. 1 factor for predicting a healthy baby is how healthy she is.\"",
        "Before you get pregnant you should shoot for a body mass index (BMI) of less than 30. Being overweight can raise your chances of a condition called preeclampsia , or can cause other health problems such as high blood pressure or gestational diabetes . Now's the time to make sure you exercise , eat healthy, and lose any extra pounds. If you smoke, drink, or use illegal drugs, stop.",
        "Make a plan. Meet with your doctor for a pregnancy planning checkup. If you have any underlying health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure , asthma, or depression, get them under control. Talk to your doctor about medications you take -- prescription or over-the-counter -- including supplements . They will probably suggest a prenatal vitamin or multivitamin with at least 1,000 micrograms of folic acid as soon as you start thinking about becoming a mom. Folic acid helps prevent major birth defects of a baby's brain and spine, and you need to start taking it before you get pregnant. The minimal folic acid supplementation is 400 micrograms a day starting prior to pregnancy.",
        "Vaccinations and tests. Make sure you're up to date on vaccinations like measles , chickenpox, tetanus , diphtheria, pertussis , and the flu. If you're unsure whether you've had the vaccines, your doctor can do a simple blood test to check. In any case, it won't hurt to get them again. Your doctor may also want to do screening tests for genetic conditions like cystic fibrosis . This would be a good time to talk to you doctor to see if any prepregnancy screening tests are right for you."
