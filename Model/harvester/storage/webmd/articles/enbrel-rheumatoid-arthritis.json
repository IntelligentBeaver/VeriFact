        "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a type of autoimmune condition, which means that the body’s immune system attacks its own healthy cells. In people with RA , the immune system attacks the lining in the joints, which causes swelling (inflammation). This can cause the joints to become red, warm, stiff, and painful. Over time, the swelling can cause permanent damage, which can make the joints very painful and difficult to use. Although RA may start in only a couple of joints, it can spread to other joints if it is not treated. It most commonly causes issues in the wrists, hands, elbows, shoulders, feet, and knees."

If a person with RA is having symptoms, their disease is considered “active.” Some people with this condition will have their symptoms come and go over time.
