        "Aplastic anemia is a rare blood disorder. When you have this serious but treatable disorder, your bone marrow — the spongy stuff inside your bones where your blood cells are made — stops making enough new blood cells . Sometimes, it stops making just one type of blood cell, but more often you become low on all three blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.",
        "Aplastic anemia can develop slowly or it may come on suddenly. If your blood count gets low enough, it can be life-threatening.",
        "Anyone can get aplastic anemia, but it's more likely to happen when you're in your late teens or early 20s, or when you're 60 and up. It's more common in developing countries. Each year in the U.S., about 300 to 900 people learn they have this condition."
