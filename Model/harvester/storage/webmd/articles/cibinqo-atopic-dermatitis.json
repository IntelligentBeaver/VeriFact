        "Atopic dermatitis , a type of eczema, is a long-term (chronic) condition of the skin that is caused by an overactive immune system . The overactive immune system weakens the skin barrier, causing the skin to become inflamed (swollen), irritated, and dry. This causes itchiness and a rash that can appear on many parts of the body. The most common parts of the body are the face, hands, feet, wrists, and the backs of the knees. The rash can be very different for different people, and may be red, dry, cracked, swollen, or bumpy. In some people, it also oozes and crusts over."
