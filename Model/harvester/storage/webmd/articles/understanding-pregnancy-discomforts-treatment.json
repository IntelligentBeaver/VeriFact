        "To relieve sharp pains or cramps from stretched abdominal muscles and ligaments, rest or take a warm bath or shower. Regular exercise will strengthen and tone your abdominal muscles. Take care to avoid exercises while lying on your back for more than a few minutes at a time after the first trimester, since this may decrease blood flow to your developing baby.",

Special exercises to strengthen abdominal muscles can also help reduce backache. Try a pregnancy girdle or elastic sling to support your abdomen. Wear shoes or shoe inserts designed for pregnant women, and avoid high heels.",
        "Don't stand for long periods. Sit straight. Sleep on a firm mattress. Lying on your side with a pillow between your legs may provide some relief."

Call your doctor immediately if you think you have been exposed to any of these.
