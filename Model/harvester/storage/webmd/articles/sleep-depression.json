These medications can be addictive, so it is important to use them with caution and let your doctor know if you feel dependent on them for sleep. They should not be used with alcohol. Also used are Ramelteon, a melatonin agonist, and the new drugs daridorexant (Quviviq) and suvorexant (Belsomra), an orexin receptor antagonist.

The FDA has also approved a prescription oral spray called Zolpimist, which contains the sleep drug Ambien's active ingredient, for the short-term treatment of insomnia brought on by difficulty falling asleep. There are other types of sleep aids in addition to hypnotics, including benzodiazepines like Ativan, Halcion, and Restoril. These medications can be addictive, so it is important to use them with caution and let your doctor know if you feel dependent on them for sleep. They should not be used with alcohol.
