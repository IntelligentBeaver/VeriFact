        "By Krystel El Koussa, as told to Stacey Jones It was complicated to get my myasthenia gravis diagnosis. I got diagnosed late 2022. I'm originally from Lebanon. I have a bachelor of arts in cinema and television. I moved to Montreal in early 2021. I have been working as a production coordinator in movies for over 3 years. Around August 2022, I started feeling extreme weakness in my upper body – my arms and my fingers, especially. I couldn't tie my hair correctly. I couldn't put on my bra and other small things that people usually do every day with no difficulty. And on top of that, I was a new immigrant here and I didn't have a family doctor."

        "A few weeks later, I started feeling weakness in my lower body, too. My legs were really weak. One day, I was rushing to get on the metro (subway train), and everybody got in, but I fell. I didn't know what was happening and I tried getting up on my own. I had to just wait for my muscles to relax to be able to get up. I tried to book another appointment online. It was almost an hour and 15 minutes away from me, and it had started snowing. But I really needed to see a doctor. After the examination and tests, he said it's probably nothing – everything looks totally fine. I kept telling him I feel something is wrong. I really know my body. I’d never felt this tired. And I never used to fall out of nowhere. Before I went to see the doctor, I had fallen four times in 2 days. So, he said, just to be sure, I'm going to refer you to a neurologist and I'm going to order a brain MRI and a full spine MRI."

        "Day after day, I started getting worse. My left eye began closing by itself. It didn’t occur to me that the eyelid is a muscle. The first time I went to the ER was on Nov. 28, 2022. I spent more than 12 hours there. What's weird about this disease – and really kind of annoying – is that when you relax all your muscles and don't talk, don't eat, don't really walk or use any of your muscles, your symptoms can kind of vanish. So, by the time I saw the doctor in the ER that night, my symptoms weren’t visible anymore. He just looked at me and saw a completely normal person. I explained everything that was happening with me. I told him I had my referral to the neurologist, but my symptoms are getting worse day by day and I don't even know when they will call. I told him I urgently need to be seen by a doctor, by a neurologist specifically. We did a lot of tests in the ER that night. The ER doctor told me that everything looks fine and, unfortunately, you're going to have to wait to see the neurologist. I was really frustrated. I told him I had waited a long time, and I can't wait anymore. Every day I woke up with a new symptom."

        "It's been quite an adjustment because even after recovering from the surgery, I still have the disease. I used to really be active – get groceries, then go get coffee with a friend, see a movie at night, come home, and cook and clean – all that we do as young people. I‘ve had to learn to be patient with myself, and my body, after going through all these changes. The main meds that I take for MG, and that most of the patients take, are steroids. Because of the steroids, I gained a lot of weight in a really short period of time. I had a lot of bad side effects that I needed to get used to and to monitor. I think it's changed a lot in me in a sense that I appreciate even the smallest things. Even just having hot chocolate with a friend or watching a good movie, going on a small road trip, everything feels different because I escaped death. I'm doing much better thanks to physical therapy. Taking care of my mental health has helped me a lot. I'm looking forward to going back to work. I know it might be a challenge to go back after all of this time, but I'm ready. Hopefully, everyone will be understanding and have patience when I have bad days. Life is too short to give up now."
