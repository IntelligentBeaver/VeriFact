Although various medicines can help reduce the risk of these issues, many people with diabetes may still get chronic kidney disease (CKD).

        "Over time, the high blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes can damage organs in the body. Many people with diabetes will develop damage to their kidneys. Damaged kidneys do not work as well as they should, leading to a condition called chronic kidney disease (CKD) . This condition can get worse with time, eventually leading to serious loss of kidney function and even kidney failure.",
        "High blood sugar levels may also damage the heart and blood vessels ( cardiovascular disease ). This increases a person’s risk of serious cardiovascular issues, such as a stroke, heart attack, and heart failure. People with CKD are more likely to develop heart issues because kidneys that do not function correctly place more stress on the heart. People with diabetes who also have CKD and cardiovascular issues are at a higher risk of dying from these conditions."

        "The key to treating diabetes and related health issues is to control blood sugar levels. If a person has high blood pressure, they should also take medicines to help control their blood pressure.

        "Kerendia has a unique way of helping to slow down damage to the heart and kidneys. The active ingredient, finerenone, blocks the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which is found in the kidneys, heart, and blood vessels . This receptor can be too active in people with diabetes. By blocking MR, Kerendia helps the kidneys remove sodium from the blood. It can also help to reduce swelling (inflammation) and the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the heart and blood vessels. Over time, this may help to reduce the risk of serious health issues."

Over time, the drug may slow down the damage to your heart, blood vessels, or kidneys, making you less likely to have a serious heart or kidney problem. Studies show that as you keep taking the medicine, your risk should continue to decrease from where it would be if you were not taking the medicine. But these studies only lasted 4 years. It is not yet clear how much your risk will change after more than 4 years of taking the medicine.",
        "Since Kerendia works by slowing the damage to your heart and kidneys, it is important to keep taking it even if you can’t tell that it is working. It is also important not to stop taking any of your other diabetes, heart, or kidney medicines.
