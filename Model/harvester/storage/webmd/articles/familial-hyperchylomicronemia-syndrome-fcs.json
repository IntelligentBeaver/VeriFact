        "Familial hyperchylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare disorder you get from genes passed down from your parents. When you have it, your body isn’t able to break down (metabolize) fat. Specifically, FCS prevents you from breaking down fats (lipids) called triglycerides. Sometimes FCS is called lipoprotein lipase deficiency.",
        "When you have FCS, fatty droplets called chylomicrons build up in the plasma of your bloodstream. Chylomicrons help move triglycerides to different parts of your body for energy and fat storage. When chylomicrons build up, this is called chylomicronemia syndrome. Chylomicronemia syndrome causes increased levels of triglycerides in your bloodstream.",
        "Typically, FCS causes symptoms that affect your quality of life such as pain and inflammation of certain organs.",
        "Only one to two people per million have FCS. You can get it at any age, although it’s more common to get a diagnosis before age 10. Around 25% of people with FCS get a diagnosis in their first year of life. It affects all genders, races, and ethnicities equally.",

        "FCS happens because of a mutation in certain genes related to an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase (LpL). You have to get the mutated gene from both your parents to have the disorder.

But you may be at a higher risk of other health disorders caused by abnormal levels of lipids in the blood.",
        "Researchers know of at least six genes related to FCS. The disorder happens when you get a mutation in any of these genes. Some of these genes help encode LpL itself, and some encode other proteins that help LpL work correctly. Mutations in these genes either mean you don’t have LpL at all in your body or your LpL can’t work the way it should.",
        "Enzymes are proteins that speed up processes in the body. Your pancreas makes the LpL enzyme. Normal LpL breaks down chylomicrons in your bloodstream so your body can use them for energy. When LpL doesn’t work the way it should, or you don’t have enough LpL, your body can’t break down fat and your chylomicron levels – and therefore, your triglyceride levels – skyrocket."
