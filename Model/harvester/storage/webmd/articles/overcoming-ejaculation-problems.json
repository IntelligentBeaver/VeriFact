        "Well, if men and their partner don't mind how long it takes them to ejaculate, then it really doesn't matter. For example, Ian Kerner, PhD, a sex therapist and author of She Comes First , advises men to bring their partners to the brink of orgasm before having intercourse. Then, if he's prone to premature ejaculation , it doesn't matter since both of them come away satisfied.",
        "Conversely, if a man takes longer than average to ejaculate, but both partners enjoy marathon sex sessions, then delayed ejaculation can be a real plus.",

After studying data gathered by the National Health and Social Life Survey, sociologist Edward Laumann, PhD, estimated that a third of American men complain that they ejaculate too quickly. They want to last longer during intercourse to prolong the pleasure, both for themselves and their partners.",
        "Delayed ejaculation affects a much smaller number of men -- as few as 3%, according to some estimates. It's one of the most poorly understood ejaculation problems. Some men cannot reach orgasm at all, at least not with a partner.",
        "Retrograde ejaculation is the least common of the ejaculation problems. It causes semen to back into the bladder during orgasm instead of exiting by way of the penis . The semen is then later flushed out when you urinate. Retrograde ejaculation can be caused by diabetes, nerve damage , various medications , and surgery that disturbs the sphincter muscle. It's harmless and won't interfere with the feeling of orgasm. (It can also make for an easy post-sex clean-up.) But since it does affect fertility , some men may need treatment if their partners are trying to get pregnant ."

By adopting a masturbation technique that involves intense pressure, friction and speed, some men train themselves to respond to a level of stimulation no partner could duplicate -- at least not without coaching, which the man usually is reluctant to provide.",
