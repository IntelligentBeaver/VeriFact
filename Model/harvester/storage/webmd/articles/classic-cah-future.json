        "Adrienne Marks had just returned home from working a 12-hour night shift as a cardiac nurse. Suddenly, she felt dizzy. Her vision blurred as she fell to the floor. It was morning, and her roommate wasn’t home. Barely conscious, she dialed 911. An extra dose of cortisol would’ve helped her feel “1,000 times better” within minutes. But she was too weak to give herself an emergency hydrocortisone shot. And when first responders arrived, they said they couldn’t do it for her. At least not legally. After “practically begging,” they agreed to put the hydrocortisone into the syringe and steady her shaky hands so she could give herself the shot. “There’s no Epi-Pen version of Solu-Cortef ,” says Marks, referring to the name brand of the medication. “It’s not a one-two punch kind of thing.” She was born with salt-wasting classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). She’s always needed steroids to replace crucial stress hormones her body can’t make. She didn’t fully understand the medical dangers of classic CAH as a child. But that near-death adrenal crisis in her early 20s “was a big wake-up call.”"

        "While people with classic CAH can make eggs or sperm, and many have children, your child could have issues that might cause so-called subfertility, Finlayson says. If they were assigned female at birth, their sex organs might look a bit different on the outside. But they should ovulate if they’re taking medication to curb extra androgens. The obstetrician can adjust treatment if they’re trying to have a baby. The same can be done throughout pregnancy. “My endocrinologist told me that once you get towards the end of pregnancy or go into labor, you may have to bump up your steroids to manage that physical stressor,” Marks says. “But I’m friends with a lot of women with CAH who have kids, and they’re very healthy and doing well.”"

In some people assigned male at birth who have classic CAH, noncancerous lumps (adrenal rest tumors) can grow in the testicles. If they’re big enough, these masses can damage sperm production or make it harder for sperm to pass through the testicles. Raising the steroid dose may shrink the tumor, Finlayson says. If that doesn’t help, they’ll need to talk to a urologist or fertility specialist about next steps. When the time comes, your child might also want to meet with a genetic counselor.
