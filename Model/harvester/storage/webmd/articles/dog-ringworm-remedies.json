        "Despite what you might think, ringworm isn’t actually a worm at all. Instead, it is a type of fungal infection that causes scaly bald patches in steadily growing rings. When it occurs in humans, there is also a ring of raised, irritated tissue around the infection, which is where ringworm got its name. It can also be called athlete’s foot if it’s on the feet or jock itch if it’s found on the groin .",
        "While ringworm is not fatal, it is an uncomfortable condition that can cause your dog to lose its fur and may infect you as well. Puppies and senior dogs are the most seriously affected age groups. They can develop body-wide ringworm infections if they don’t receive treatment.",
        "There are several types of fungus that cause ringworm, but they can all be treated the same way. Since ringworm is a fungus, it requires specific treatments to resolve the infection. Ringworm can come back if you aren’t careful, so it is important to be thorough when treating this problem and caring for your dog afterward."
