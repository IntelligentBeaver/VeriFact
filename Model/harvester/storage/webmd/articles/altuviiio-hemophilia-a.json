        "Hemophilia A is a rare, inherited condition that is passed down from parents to their children. People with this condition have low levels of a blood protein called factor VIII, which keeps the blood from clotting the way that it normally would. Due to these low levels, the body has trouble stopping the flow of blood once a person has started bleeding. This is referred to as a prolonged bleeding event.",
        "This condition can be mild, moderate, or severe depending on a person’s factor VIII levels. Because of the way that this condition is inherited (“X-linked”), males are most often affected and usually have more severe forms of the condition. Females can also be affected but tend to have milder symptoms."
