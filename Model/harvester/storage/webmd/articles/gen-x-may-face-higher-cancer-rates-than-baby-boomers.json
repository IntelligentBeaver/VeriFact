        "June 21, 2024 -- Gen-Xers are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer than generations that came before them, according to a new study published in JAMA Open Network.",
        "Researchers from the National Cancer Institute examined health records of 3.8 million people diagnosed with malignant cancer in the U.S. from 1992 to 2018. Cancer rates were determined for members of Generation X (people born between 1965-1980) and baby boomers (born between 1946-1964).",
        "Computer modeling showed that when people in Gen X turn 60, starting in 2025, they are more likely to be diagnosed with invasive cancer than previous generations, including baby boomers. In fact, the researchers wrote, “Generation X is experiencing larger per-capita increases in the incidence of leading cancers combined than any prior generation born from 1908 through 1964.”",
        "“For the first time since the Greatest Generation, we have a generation with a higher rate of cancer than their parents. It's my generation. Gen X,” said F. Perry Wilson, MD, director of the Clinical and Translational Research Accelerator at Yale University in New Haven, CT. Wilson is also a columnist for Medscape, WebMD’s sister site for health care professionals."
