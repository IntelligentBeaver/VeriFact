        "Being overweight or having diabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting gallstones . But in general, a sensible diet is the best way to prevent them. Avoid crash diets or a very low intake of calories (less than 800 calories daily). Seek out good sources of fiber -- raw fruits and vegetables , cooked dried beans and peas, whole-grain cereals and bran, for example -- and avoid eating too much saturated fat . A high-fiber, low-fat diet helps keep bile cholesterol in liquid form. However, don't cut out fats abruptly or eliminate them altogether, as too little fat can also result in gallstone formation.",
        "Researchers have found that drinking coffee may reduce the risk of gallstones.",
        "Recent studies have shown that moderate consumption of olive oil (about 2 tablespoons a day) may actually lower your chances of developing gallstones. An ingredient in olive oil evidently helps reduce cholesterol levels in the blood and gallbladder . Researchers have found that the incidence of gallstones is relatively low among people who live in areas where olive oil consumption is high."
