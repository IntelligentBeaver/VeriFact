        "You’ve probably heard that the gut and the brain communicate with each other, but do you know about the gut-skin connection? Issues with gut health may be showing up on your face as rosacea, and rosacea may indicate you have gastrointestinal disease.",
        "What Is Rosacea?",
        "Rosacea is a skin condition that affects the face. It’s marked by inflammation that causes reddened skin, visible blood vessels or a rash on the nose and cheeks, and skin thickening. Rosacea can also affect the eyes, making them sore, watery, or dry.",
        "An estimated 14 million people in the U.S. have rosacea. Those with fair skin, women, and midlife and older adults are more prone to rosacea.",
        "Rosacea symptoms can come and go, and there’s no cure. However, there are ways to manage rosacea with diet and lifestyle habits, including supporting gut health.",
        "Inflammation Is the Source",
        "Inflammation contributes to skin redness and rash in rosacea. Like the gut, the skin has its own community of microbes (mostly bacteria), which may become disturbed and cause rosacea flare-ups. Rosacea may also be triggered by circumstances that cause blood vessels in the face to open up and result in reddened skin, including high temperatures, strong sunlight, alcohol, hot beverages, and spicy foods."
