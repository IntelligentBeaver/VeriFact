        "June 19, 2025 — For most of my life, if you asked me if I was fit, I would say yes without hesitation. I spent my childhood playing year-round sports, was on a D1 lacrosse team in college, became a certified trainer, and spent more than a decade as a fitness director for a major women’s magazine.",
        "By pretty much any objective measure, my fitness hovered somewhere above average. More than that, I loved it: the stress relief, the sense of accomplishment, the high after a tough workout; the grit I developed in (and out) of sports. It wasn’t hard for me to feel connected to and passionate about exercise.",
        "But as I sit here in the midst of a stressful season of life — a few months out from unexpected abdominal surgery, among other joys — I am so very far from that version of me.",
        "I know I don’t have the speed, strength, or cardiovascular endurance I’ve had in the past. And for the first time (maybe ever), I’m not sure what to call myself."

Her basic threshold: one pullup or two full pushups. So at the end of every day, whether she was sick, or traveling, or crazy with work deadlines, she would do one of those two things. It may not sound like much, but, in less than 15 seconds a day, it has enabled her to maintain a very long streak of being a continuously active person.",
