        "While growing up, I never thought twice about the food I ate. I carelessly ate anything and everything I wanted. A free cookie from the bakery on grocery trips, anything that caught my fancy at the local county fair, cupcakes at birthday parties, all the Halloween candy my heart desired, and even classic PB&J on heavy rotation for school lunch. Nothing was off the table, and the adventure of being a foodie had both my heart and my palate.",
        "As I grew into my teen and young adult years, date nights, and lunch with co-workers brought its own twists and turns with added introductions to other cultures and food finds I had never heard of before. Then came marriage, where I indulged in impressing my husband with my skills in the kitchen and determined to be a self-taught chef and baker. I wasn’t the best at first, but I tried and tried again until I had my own arsenal and wide array of tried-and-true recipes that were perfected."

I felt chained down and as if my little foodie world was crumbling. As a parent, I wanted to share all I enjoyed in life with my son, from golfing and hiking to cooking at home and finding the most amazing dining from around the world.",
        "“Where there’s a will, there’s a way” is a quote our family lives by, especially following multiple food allergy and intolerance diagnoses for a few of my children. As of this article my oldest went from toddler to teenager with just peanut and shellfish anaphylactic allergies. In 2022, he was diagnosed with seven additional food allergies, and then in 2023 was able to add back several foods but was now anaphylactic to pecans and garlic. My second oldest is dairy intolerant, and my second to youngest is gluten intolerant. This makes any meal or snack time cumbersome in its own way whether at home or on the go."

        "So how do we dine out? We focus on one. Just one meal. Just one item off the menu. Just one restaurant. For example, with my oldest that is anaphylactic to peanuts, pecans, shellfish, and garlic, we started off with pancakes at a fast-food restaurant. Finding that one food item at a chain restaurant opened doors for our family on busy days, RV trips, outings with church groups, and more! For my daughter that is dairy intolerant, she was able to have those same pancakes and just skip the butter on top. My gluten-intolerant daughter chose to make lemons out of lemonade since nothing looked promising here for her, and she opted for the dessert ice cream sundae that was a safe choice. We all had a good laugh and made the most of the idea of having dessert for breakfast.",
        "Much of navigating food allergies and intolerances includes making substitutions, living life differently, and being flexible. Having the same thing every time we go to this fast-food spot might seem boring for some, but all three of my kids with dietary restrictions love feeling included and “normal” by enjoying something on the go with the rest of the family. In fact, they look forward to that “one” special food find!",

        "Choose a time of day that is not known to be busy during a “rush” dining time for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Call or go in-person and ask to speak with a manager. Let them know your allergies and see if they can accommodate you. Ask if they have food allergy procedures in place and are familiar with making dishes allergy friendly. Ask if they are familiar with cross-contact, and ask if your meal can be made on a clean, designated area or other means to avoid cross-contact.",
        "Take a chef card with you. This can be something you print off an online template or make your own on a business card. Just include your name, allergens, and that you are avoiding these due to an anaphylactic allergy and must also avoid cross-contact. Keep it simple.",
        "Avoid high-risk establishments such as buffets and bakeries where cross-contact is prevalent."

If you are ever in doubt, don’t risk even one bite. Consider your interactions with the establishment as an interview. Not everyone will get hired to be on your team. There is always a kind way to express gratitude in knowing that this is not a good fit. We can still be polite in parting ways when we realize the establishment cannot accommodate our requests.",
        "As you conquer finding just one item, just one meal, just one restaurant, you will get better and better at practicing your elevator speech of what you are avoiding, as well as how to order it directly and simply.  Additionally, a silver lining is that we tend to become “regulars” at our favorite spots, and the staff begins to know us and just how to make our special regular orders.  Finally, always carry two epinephrine auto-injectors and if a reaction does happen, “epi-first and epi-fast.” While we make every effort to avoid allergic reactions, mistakes can and will happen, so the best thing we can do is be confidently prepared to react."
