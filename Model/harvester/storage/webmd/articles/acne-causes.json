        "No one factor causes acne. Acne happens when oil (sebaceous) glands become active at puberty, stimulated by male hormones from the adrenal glands in both boys and girls. Oil is a natural substance that lubricates and protects the skin . Under certain circumstances, cells that are close to the surface block the openings of sebaceous glands and cause a buildup of oil underneath. This oil stimulates bacteria, which live in everyone's skin. The bacteria generally cause no problems, but when stimulated, they multiply. That causes surrounding tissues to become inflamed.",
        "If the inflammation is near the surface, you get a pustule; if it's deeper, a papule (pimple); deeper still, and it's a cyst. If the oil breaks through to the surface, the result is a \"whitehead.\" If the oil becomes oxidized (that is, acted on by oxygen in the air), the oil changes from white to black, and the result is a \"blackhead.\" Common sites for acne are the face, chest, shoulders, neck, and back -- where oil glands are."

The oral retinoid isotretinoin ( Absorica , Amnesteem, Claravis, Myorisan , and Zenatane ) is reserved for people with severe (nodular or cystic) or widespread acne. Isotretinoin shrinks the size of oil glands, the origin of acne. Without active, plump oil glands, acne actively diminishes. Side effects can include dry skin , elevated cholesterol and triglycerides , and birth defects . Women of childbearing age must practice birth control before, during, and after treatment (about one month) with isotretinoin. The use of isotretinoin requires rigorous testing ( cholesterol , pregnancy , triglyceride , cholesterol , liver function, and bone marrow function) and follow-up for the prescribed period (5 or more months). It is reserved for the most severe or widespread types of acne that do not respond to other treatments.",

The hormone therapy consists of low-dose estrogen and progesterone ( birth control pills ) or antiandrogen medications such as aldactone ( Spironolactone ) -- oral, or clascoterone ( Winlevi ) -- topical.
