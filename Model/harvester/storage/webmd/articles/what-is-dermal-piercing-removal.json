        "If you have a dermal piercing, you’ll need to get it removed once your body starts to reject it. This usually happens after several months to a few years. A simple procedure can remove the jewelry if it doesn’t come out naturally. Follow your piercer’s instructions on wound care to help it heal well. Contact your piercer and doctor if you have any signs of infection."

        "How long will a dermal piercing last?",
        "Dermal piercings don't last forever. They are considered “long-term temporary” by piercing professionals and should last from 6 months to a few years. Piercings that are done on more protected areas of the body, where they don’t get touched as often, usually last longer.",
        "Do dermal piercings hurt?",
        "There will likely be some pain when you get a dermal piercing. But the procedure is quick, and any discomfort is unlikely to last long. You may feel more or less pain depending on the skill of your piercer and your personal pain tolerance. Local numbing agents can also help reduce pain.",
        "How do dermal piercings stay on your body?",
        "Dermal piercings are attached to the skin with an anchor. The anchor is implanted using a small incision or piercing needle. The skin heals over the anchor to keep it in place, and the visible part of the jewelry screws onto the anchor."
