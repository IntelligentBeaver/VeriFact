        "A rotator cuff tear is a rip in the group of four muscles and tendons that stabilize your shoulder joint and let you lift and rotate your arms (your rotator cuff). It’s also called a complete tear or a full-thickness tear.",
        "It’s a common injury, especially in sports like baseball or tennis, or in jobs like painting or cleaning windows. It usually happens over time from normal wear and tear, or if you repeat the same arm motion over and over. But it also can happen suddenly if you fall on your arm or lift something heavy.",

Although it also damages your tendon , the tissue connecting your muscle to your bone, your tendon remains attached to your arm bone. You may still be able to use your shoulder and arm with this kind of tear.",
        "Complete tear. This type is also called full-thickness tear. It happens when the injury to your rotator cuff muscle causes your tendon to completely detach from your bone. With this kind of tear, you may feel serious pain and weakness that prevents you from being able to use your shoulder and arm."
