It’s important to take the time to look after yourself when you have this condition. Here are some things I do that may help you manage your life so you feel better.",

        "A good diet is essential to help you feel your best when you have sleep apnea. Make sure to avoid processed foods, drink water, and eat plenty of vitamin-rich food. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats should be staples. It may also be a good idea to take a high-quality multivitamin. A good diet makes you feel good, and this will allow you to get better quality rest at night.",

Something as simple as walking or other light activity can be beneficial. I like lifting weights a couple of times a week and going for walks when I can for energy throughout the day."
