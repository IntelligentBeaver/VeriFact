        "Lynkuet (elinzanetant) is a new nonhormonal medicine taken by mouth to help manage moderate to severe hot flashes linked to menopause. Hot flashes, also called vasomotor symptoms (VMS), can cause sudden feelings of heat, sweating, and sleep problems. Lynkuet works by blocking two brain receptors – neurokinin-1 (NK1) and neurokinin-3 (NK3) – that help control body temperature and sleep patterns.",
        "This is the first medicine approved that targets both of these receptors at the same time. By doing so, it may help reduce how often hot flashes happen and how intense they feel. It may also help improve sleep, which is often disrupted during menopause.",
        "Hot flashes affect up to 80% of women going through menopause and can last for many years. These symptoms can interfere with daily life, sleep, and overall well-being. Hormone therapy has been the main treatment, but it's not right for everyone. Some people can't take hormones due to health risks, while others prefer to avoid them. Lynkuet offers a new option for those looking for relief without using estrogen or progestin."
