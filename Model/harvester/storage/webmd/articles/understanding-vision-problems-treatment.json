LASIK is safe and effective for most patients with nearsightedness, but only up to a certain level.

LASIK can also be used to treat lower levels of farsightedness. Higher levels of farsightedness can only be surgically corrected with a refractive lens exchange -- the natural lens is replaced with an intraocular lens that is more powerful, thereby focusing the light on the retina."
