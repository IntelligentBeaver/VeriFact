        "Vizz (aceclidine) , is an eye drop designed to help people who have presbyopia , which is a decline in your eye's ability to focus clearly on things close to you. Things at a distance may or may not be affected by presbyopia. Presbyopia is part of the normal aging process and just seems to happen as you get older. It's similar to, but not exactly the same as, being farsighted ( hyperopia ). Both of these problems make it hard to see things clearly up close, but the reasons are different.",
        "Your eyes focus light rays to send images of what you are looking at to your brain. When you are farsighted, the light rays do not focus the way they should, making things up close seem blurry. Presbyopia happens because the lens of your eye becomes less flexible with age. The muscles around your lens can also weaken as you grow older. This leads to you having a harder time with close-up vision. Symptoms of presbyopia can include needing to hold reading material at arm's length, blurry vision at a normal reading distance, or having headaches or tired eyes when working on things close to you."

Some people in the studies had an astigmatism (when your cornea, or the clear front part of the eyeball, is not completely round). Some people had previously had some type of laser eye surgery or lens replacement surgery .",
        "People in the studies used two drops – of Vizz, a placebo eye drop (meaning a drop without medicine in it), or brimonidine – in each eye once daily. They were told to separate the first drop from the second drop by two minutes. The drops were used every day for 42 days. Vision was evaluated on days 1, 15, and 28. The timing of these evaluations ranged from 30 minutes to 10 hours after using the eye drops. Efficacy was defined as being able to see more clearly up close (being able to read at least three more lines) without compromising distance vision (losing one line or five letters or more at a distance)."
