        "People with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) often have other medical conditions related to their digestive issues. These health problems can be the cause of EPI, or they may happen because of it. Sometimes they simply overlap with EPI, and doctors don’t know why. Work with your doctor to make sure you get the right diagnosis and treat all your health problems. It’s the most common cause of EPI in adults. When the pancreas becomes inflamed and stays that way for years, eventually its cells stop working the way they should, including those that can cause EPI. Many things can lead to chronic pancreatitis, including heavy alcohol use, smoking, genetic problems, and autoimmune disorders. Your doctor will want to start treatments to restore your digestion, help your pancreas work as well as it can, and ease any belly pain you might have. Cystic fibrosis. This inherited disease is the second most common cause of EPI. Cells in the lungs and digestive system make thick, sticky mucus, which causes blockages in certain organs. In the pancreas, it keeps digestive enzymes from moving to the intestines, where they help break down fats and other nutrients. That leads to EPI. Good nutrition is important for treating cystic fibrosis and EPI. You’ll need to work with a dietitian to make sure you get what you need. You’ll also take vitamin supplements and get pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy."

You can have surgery to remove a tumor or cyst, but it may not always cure EPI, since the operation itself may damage the pancreas.
