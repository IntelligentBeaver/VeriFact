        "Overall, patients and allergy experts alike seem optimistic about a new, small device that can be carried easily and has a good shelf life. Looking ahead, it may also be “easier to teach children how to use it,” Carver said.",
        "The convenience and ease of use could help patients, caregivers, and health care providers to feel comfortable with stocking and using epinephrine in the first place, said Paul Williams, MD, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine and president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.",
        "“One thing that happens in food allergic patients is that avoidance works well for them,” he said. “They don’t have to use their epi, so they forget how to use it and don’t carry it with them.”",

        "Although many people are excited, Golden said, some aren’t yet ready to trust the new product, especially if they’ve used an auto-injector in the past and don’t mind using it again in the future. Others have said they’re waiting on more studies, such as real-world evidence that needle-free products work as well as “gold standard” auto-injectors."
