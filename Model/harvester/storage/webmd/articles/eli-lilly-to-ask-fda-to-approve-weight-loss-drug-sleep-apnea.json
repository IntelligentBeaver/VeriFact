        "April 17, 2024 – Preliminary clinical trial results showed the obesity drug tirzepatide was highly effective at treating obstructive sleep apnea , according to information sent to investors of the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly.",
        "Indiana-based Eli Lilly sells tirzepatide under the brand name Zepbound, which was approved by the FDA in November to treat overweight and obesity. Tirzepatide is also marketed under the name Mounjaro to treat diabetes, and it's among the same class of drugs as other well-known weight loss and diabetes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy.",
        "Sleep apnea is a disorder where regular breathing is interrupted or obstructed during sleep, and it's linked to serious health problems affecting the heart, kidneys, and metabolic system. Many people with sleep apnea use a device called a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine while they sleep to treat the condition.",
        "The newly announced results came from a pair of studies that followed people with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who also had obesity. People in the study took tirzepatide, which is given by injection, for one year. One study evaluated people who were using a sleep apnea device called positive airway pressure during sleep, and another study included people who didn’t use the device. People in both studies taking tirzepatide had significant reductions in sleep events and also lost about 20% of body weight. About 70% of people in the studies were men."
