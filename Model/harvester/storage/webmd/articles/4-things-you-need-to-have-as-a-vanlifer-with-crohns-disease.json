        "Van life and Crohn’s disease – two things that you may or may not have heard of before, but most likely not in the same sentence. But for me, just these two things summarize a huge part of my life.",
        "I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease at the beginning of 2020, right before the COVID pandemic began. For years before that, I had mentioned to friends and family that I wanted to buy a van and convert it into a tiny home to live out of and travel the country with. The main response was that I was crazy. But my Crohn’s diagnosis was the biggest incentive for me to essentially say, \"Screw what everyone says, I want to do this and I’m going to make it happen!\"",
        "Fast-forward to today. I have been traveling and living out of my van for almost 3 years full time, and my Crohn’s symptoms have never been better. Before I moved into my camper van, I was extremely worried about managing flares without a proper bathroom setup. But over the years, I’ve figured out everything you need to both live comfortably in an 80 square-foot van and manage all Crohn’s symptoms and other related aspects. Here’s some recommendations for anyone with Crohn’s disease who’s considering van life or tiny living:"

Since it has to be refrigerated, I always keep an extra week or two stocked in my fridge in case I’m planning on leaving town, or in case of any delays in refills.

You can have a black tank like an RV, a compostable toilet, or even incinerating toilets in some fancy RVs. I didn’t want to spend a ton of money on just a toilet, so that eliminated most of my options. I ended up going with what I believe is the No. 1 best option not only to stick to a small budget, but for space saving, ease of use, and minimal cleanup as well!"

So it was important for me to have a somewhat private bathroom area in my van, especially when dealing with Crohn’s symptoms.

Even on long roadtrips, it makes a massive difference being able to pull over and cook something for lunch rather than having to buy fast food. This has helped my Crohn’s symptoms dramatically, as I’m able to have all the foods with me that I know aren’t triggering."
