        "Also known as atypical pneumonia, \"walking pneumonia\" is a mild form of pneumonia , which is a lung infection. It is common in children aged 5-15 years old and adults younger than 40. As the symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections, you could have walking pneumonia and not even know it.",
        "Walking pneumonia vs. pneumonia",
        "There are many kinds of pneumonia, and walking pneumonia is one of the least serious types. The symptoms are usually milder and don't require bedrest or a hospital visit. Walking pneumonia is usually diagnosed after a physical or an X-ray of the chest. In typical types of pneumonia, the X-ray would show one part of your lung that's affected. But if you have walking pneumonia, the X-ray will show the affected area as patches that are spread out.",
        "Another difference between atypical pneumonia and pneumonia lies in their symptoms. With walking pneumonia, you may have a dry cough and a lower fever. With pneumonia, your fever could be higher (101-105 F) and your cough may have phlegm (filled with mucus).",
        "About 5%-10% of cases of walking pneumonia turn into pneumonia.",

Stage II is red hepatization, where red and white blood cells multiply due to the bacteria infection (your lungs become red). In Stage III, gray hepatization, the damage to your red blood cells causes your lungs to become gray in color. During Stage IV, the resolution stage, your airways improve and the inflammation in your fluid and damage to your cells goes away. This is the stage when you'll begin to feel better."
