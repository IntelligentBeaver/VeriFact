        "Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR) is a rare disease caused by a gene mutation you inherit from one of your parents. This means the gene – in this case, the transthyretin (TTR) gene – is different from a normal one. The mutation causes your liver to produce an amyloid protein that clumps together and builds up in your tissues, organs, and nerves. The clumps damage your tissues and organs over time. Symptoms depend on which of your organs are affected and how much. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy affects your nerves, so you might have: Tingling or numbness in your legs or feet A hard time walking Weakness or pain in your limbs Lightheadedness when you stand up Bladder or bowel problems Sexual problems like erectile dysfunction hATTR is a progressive disease, which means it gets worse over time. There is no cure, but treatments continue to improve. Talk to your doctor, friends, and family about your options, and be sure you’re getting the support you need."

        "Liver transplant was once the only way to treat hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. But there are many new FDA-approved medications and clinical trials testing new therapies. Talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for you, and be sure they include ways to reduce your body’s production of amyloid proteins and manage your symptoms. Gene silencers Gene silencers break down the TTR protein and stop your body from producing it. Eplontersen (Wainua), inotersen (Tegsedi), patisiran (Onpattro), and vutrisiran (Amvuttra) are approved by the FDA for gene silencing in adults. They work by targeting the protein at the mRNA level, so your liver stops creating it. A large international study on inotersen found it reduced TTR by as much as 74% in some people. A separate clinical trial on patisiran also found people taking the drug after 18 months had improved quality of life compared to those who had taken a placebo (a pill with no active ingredient). Inotersen and patisiran could also benefit some people who’ve had liver transplants, but more long-term studies are needed to know how well gene silencers like these work."
