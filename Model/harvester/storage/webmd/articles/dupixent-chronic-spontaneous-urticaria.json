        "Dupixent helps treat chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) by calming a type of inflammation that leads to itching, redness, and welts. In CSU, certain immune cells can become overactive and release substances (such as histamine and cytokines) that trigger symptoms.",
        "Dupixent works by blocking two proteins in the immune system called interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13). These proteins play a key role in the inflammatory response that contributes to CSU. Dupixent attaches to a receptor, known as IL-4R alpha, which helps stop the inflammatory signals from spreading. By interrupting these pathways, Dupixent is thought to help reduce the immune system’s overactivity, leading to fewer flare-ups and improved symptoms.",
        "People taking Dupixent for CSU may also have a gradual decline in blood levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) . (IgE is a type of antibody your immune system makes when it overreacts to an allergen.) This suggests that Dupixent may have a calming effect on allergy-related inflammation."
