        "Dr. Arefa Cassoobhoy: 4 new weight loss drugs were approved recently, and more are sure to come. So, the question is, should you try one?",
        "The truth is weight loss drugs CAN help. You may want to try one if you’re obese, or if you’re overweight with a condition like type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure.",
        "So, how much weight can they help you lose? About 10% of your excess weight.",
        "Now that may not seem like a lot, but it’s a realistic goal to start with. And, once you tackle that first 10% you can set a new goal.",
        "Just remember, these drugs won’t lose the weight for you. But they will give an added boost to your diet and exercise plan.",
        "If you think this is something you want to try, talk to your doctor.",
        "For WebMD I’m Dr. Arefa Cassoobhoy.",
        "If you're overweight or you have obesity, losing 5% to 15% of your body weight can improve your heart health and lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. But losing weight can be hard to do. If diet and exercise haven't helped you reach a healthy weight and stay there, prescription weight loss drugs might help.",
        "The FDA has already approved a group of weight loss drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists. Medicines like liraglutide ( Saxenda ), semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy), and tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound) act like the hormone glucagon-like peptide in your body. They slow digestion and make you feel less hungry to help you lose more weight. These drugs also lower blood sugar levels to treat type 2 diabetes.",
        "One form of semaglutide, Wegovy, is for adults with overweight or obesity who have at least one weight-related condition or cardiovascular disease. It now also comes as a daily pill to help you lose extra body weight, maintain long-term weight loss, and lower your risk for serious cardiovascular problems. You'll likely take the pill along with a lower calorie diet while increasing your physical activity."
