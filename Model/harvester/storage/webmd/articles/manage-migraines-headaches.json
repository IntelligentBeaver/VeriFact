        "Sound familiar? If you're one of the 36 million Americans who get migraines, you probably know that the awful pain is no ordinary headache. Migraines are defined as moderate to severe pain lasting 4 to 72 hours, usually on one side of the head. The pain gets worse with exercise, and it may come with nausea, vomiting, and light and sound sensitivity, says Robert Cowan, MD, director of the Headache Program at Stanford University.",

        "Stick to a schedule . \"The best advice is to be as consistent as possible in your daily activities,\" Cowan says. \"Going to bed and waking up around the same time -- even on the weekends -- eating your meals on a schedule, exercising aerobically every day for at least 20 minutes: all will help protect you from getting migraines.\""
