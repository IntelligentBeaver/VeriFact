        "April 17, 2024 – Across the U.S., warmer days have beckoned an earlier spring, and with that, an earlier pollen season and worse seasonal allergies . Pair that with an ongoing respiratory virus season – particularly influenza A and B – and insurance and regulatory issues that have created barriers for patients to get inhalers in 2024, making this a tough time of year for those who struggle with allergies and asthma control.",
        "In Chicago, for instance, adults and kids appear to be having an uptick in allergy and breathing concerns related to the warmer weather, said Juanita Mora, MD, a doctor and CEO at Chicago Allergy Center and a national volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association.",
        "“Climate change is making allergy seasons longer, with a median of about 20 days longer around the country, which leads to increased carbon dioxide levels, more pollen and environment triggers,” she said. “With pollen levels rising, you really want to get started on nasal steroids and antihistamines, as well as preventive and maintenance inhalers for those who use them.”"

        "Some people with asthma have faced challenges, in particular, because GlaxoSmithKline discontinued Flovent inhalers at the start of this year. Although authorized generic versions have replaced the popular corticosteroid, patients have expressed concerns about what to do, especially if their insurance doesn’t cover the generic version sold by GSK.",
        "In March, three companies – GSK, Boehringer Ingelheim, and AstraZeneca – announced a $35 monthly cap on out-of-pocket costs for their inhaler products, which begins June 1. Mora calls the move “a game-changer,” especially for patients with large deductibles. But until then, patients are keeping a watchful eye on changes with their medications as seasonal flares happen and potential formulary updates are announced.",
        "“The generic isn’t always available, and paying out-of-pocket costs can be difficult for families as well,” she said. “Patients need access to their medications to keep their asthma under good control, which is extremely important at this time of year.”",
        "In Chicago, flu cases remain elevated, Mora said, noting that patients can still receive a vaccine, even though it’s not the typical season for influenza. People who recently traveled for spring break or to see the eclipse, for instance, may have gotten the virus and brought it home, and it could continue to spread at schools and gatherings. As graduation season, Mother’s Day, Memorial Day, and other spring and summer celebrations approach, people should continue to take precautions, she advised."

Grass pollens begin to spread before the grass turns green, for instance, so she recommends that people use their inhalers or allergy medications year-round and create a plan for their use.",
        "Current events may also shift that plan, so it’s important to remain aware and talk to your doctor about how to respond, she said. During the summer of 2023, for instance, wildfires across the country led to more particulate matter and spikes in air quality levels, and asthma patients used their rescue inhalers more often."
