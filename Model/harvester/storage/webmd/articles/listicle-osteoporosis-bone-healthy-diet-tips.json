        "As you get older, it becomes more important to take care of your bones to maintain their density and avoid fractures. This often means following a list of restrictions. Changing your habits isn't always easy, but with a bit of creativity, positivity, and commitment, you can turn these restrictions into a list of additions and substitutions that will supply your body with calcium, vitamin D, and other essential nutrients to help keep your bones strong.",
        "Calcium plays a central role in maintaining bone health. Dairy products, such as milk or plain yogurt; fatty fish, such as salmon, sardines, and tuna; and soy-based foods, such as tofu, are excellent natural food sources that support a calcium-rich diet. Your doctor may also prescribe calcium supplements to help you reach the recommended daily dose based on your bone density and age.",
        "When it comes to your bone health, the goal is to make your plate look like a rainbow. Choose green vegetables like kale, spinach, or broccoli. Add purple foods such as plums or purple cabbage. Strawberries and tomatoes can bring a touch of red to your meals. Other colorful and healthy choices include papaya, oranges, and pineapple. All of these foods contain calcium, magnesium, potassium – vitamins that are essential for bone health.",
        "When it comes to bone health, vitamin D has three vital functions: It helps you get calcium from food, restores bones, and keeps muscles strong to prevent fractures.",
        "Orange juice, mushrooms, egg yolks, dairy products, and fortified almond or soy milk are very good sources of vitamin D. If you take calcium supplements, it's common for your doctor to prescribe vitamin D to help with calcium absorption.",
        "More than 300 processes in your body need magnesium. This mineral helps calcium strengthen your bones and supports the absorption of vitamin D. Foods high in magnesium that you can add to your diet include almonds, pumpkin seeds, legumes, and quinoa. Avocados, spinach, and dark chocolate are also good sources of this mineral.",
        "Not getting enough protein stops the formation of new muscle, skin, and bone tissue. Depending on your level of physical activity and exercise, to estimate how many grams of protein you should eat each day, multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36 minimally. To reach your daily goal, a good strategy is to choose low-salt, calcium-rich proteins, such as fatty fish, legumes, and dairy products.",
        "Too much sugar interferes with calcium absorption, causes your body to get rid of calcium through your urine, and slows the cells that build new bone. If you have a sudden craving for something sweet, add honey to a bowl of strawberries, fresh white cheese, or nuts, which are all high in calcium. Honey is a natural sweetener with anti-inflammatory properties."
