        "Call for help . Arranging reliable care for your baby can help you get back into the work mind-set while feeling reassured that your baby is being well cared for in your absence. Ask any candidates for referrals, and ask your friends whether they've used the person or service and what their experiences have been. And start the search early, says Glass. \"You can always get a car seat last minute, but a decision on what type of care you'll need for your child takes some research and time.\"",
        "Start slow. Jumping from maternity leave to full-time work can be a shock, so if possible, ask your employer to let you start off with a part-time schedule for as long as you feel your workplace culture will allow -- from a few weeks to a couple of months, says Glass. Alternatively, you can find out if your boss will be willing to let you schedule your first day back later in the week, say, on a Thursday. That way, you have only two days of work and then you get the weekend with your baby. \"You're not diving into the deep end with the schedule, but easing yourself back into it,\" Glass says."
