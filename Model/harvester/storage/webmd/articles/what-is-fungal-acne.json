        "Fungal acne is a skin condition called pityrosporum folliculitis. It is one of many types of folliculitis, an infection in your hair follicle. It's caused by an overgrowth of a yeast called Malassezia that most people have naturally on their skin. But, when your hair follicles are damaged (for instance, when you shave) or blocked, the yeast can grow into the hair follicle and cause an infection.",
        "It's often confused with acne because it can cause whiteheads, but fungal acne breakouts often look like a rash with clusters of bumps that are similar sizes and shapes. It's also usually itchy, unlike regular acne.",

But if you get it, your doctor can prescribe you an antifungal medicine that you either spread on your skin or take by mouth that should clear it up. If you keep getting fungal acne, your doctor may prescribe an antifungal for you to take long-term."

But the main difference in symptoms between regular and fungal acne is that fungal acne tends to be itchy whereas regular acne doesn't.",
