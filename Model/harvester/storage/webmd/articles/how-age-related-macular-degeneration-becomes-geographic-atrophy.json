        "There are two kinds of AMD. If you have dry AMD, your macula slowly gets thinner over time. If you have wet AMD, which is less common, abnormal blood vessels grow in your eye and lead to damage. With wet AMD, you may have faster and more severe vision loss. About 10%-15% of people with dry AMD will go on to develop the wet form.",
