        "Don’t rest too much. Too much rest can weaken your muscles, which can in turn increase reinjury. Find an exercise program that is safe for your knees and stick with it. If you're not sure which motions are safe or how much you can do, talk with your doctor or a physical therapist.",
        "Do exercise. Cardio exercises strengthen the muscles of the heart, but not the joints. It is weight training mixed with keeping your muscles limber. Cardio is important for keeping your weight stable and you feeling stronger overall. For cardio , some good choices include walking, swimming, water aerobics, stationary cycling, and elliptical machines. Tai chi may also help ease stiffness and improve balance.",
        "Don’t risk a fall. A painful or unstable knee can make a fall more likely, which can cause more knee damage. Curb your risk of falling by making sure your home is well lit, using handrails on staircases, and using a sturdy ladder or foot stool if you need to reach something from a high shelf."
