        "MYTH. Some people think nicotine itself causes cancer, but there’s actually very little research to back that up, Hatsukami says. Though nicotine is very addictive, it’s the way it gets into your body that can be dangerous, she says.",
        "Tobacco smoke is made up of thousands of chemicals, including more than 70 that cause cancer. “Nicotine delivered though cigarettes is very harmful -- that’s the most toxic way,” she says. “But if you deliver nicotine through medicinal nicotine replacement products, the harm is dramatically less. There’s no cancer associated with nicotine products, minimal risk of heart disease, and no respiratory problems because you’re not inhaling the nicotine.”",
        "Those products work to help you quit smoking. “We do know that when you administer nicotine over time and gradually wean people off, as is done in the patch or gum, it can help smokers quit,” King says."
