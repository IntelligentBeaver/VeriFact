        "Growing up, Lauren Singer thought her older sister, Jodie, was just a little quirky. “She would do funny things. In the grocery store, she would sometimes throw a tantrum or sing,” Singer says. Other people weren’t as accepting. “Some people would point at her and laugh, and that would make me very upset.”",
        "Jodie has autism, a developmental disability that affects her communication and social skills. When Singer was in sixth grade, she volunteered with Sunday/Funday, an enrichment program at the Jewish Community Center in Scarsdale, NY, for kids like Jodie with developmental disabilities.",
        "I started to understand that a lot of behaviors people think are abnormal just represent different ways that people think. They aren’t necessarily negative.",
        "Through her volunteer work, Singer became more aware of what it means to live with autism, and she learned that being different isn’t always a bad thing. “I started to understand that a lot of behaviors people think are abnormal just represent different ways that people think. They aren’t necessarily negative.”",
        "Singer has always been interested in science, and after her sophomore year at Scarsdale High School, she spent the summer in the lab of autism researcher Joseph Buxbaum, PhD, at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. “After working with children and adults with developmental disabilities, I was interested in researching a treatment that could immediately help people,\" she says."
