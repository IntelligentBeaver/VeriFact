Blood is supposed to flow through the veins and to the heart , but when a valve in a vein becomes damaged, blood pools, flows backward, and puts pressure on vein walls -- causing bulging, painful varicose veins.",

Unlike vein stripping, it is minimally invasive -- you can go out in shorts the same day, rather than needing a two-week recovery."
