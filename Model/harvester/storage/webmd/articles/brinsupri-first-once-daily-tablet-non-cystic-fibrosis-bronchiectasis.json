        "Brinsupri (brensocatib) is a new oral medicine approved to treat a long-term lung disease known as non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) in adults and children ages 12 or older. It works by blocking an enzyme called DPP1, which normally activates certain proteins in white blood cells that cause inflammation in the lungs. By stopping this process, Brinsupri may help reduce lung damage and lower the number of flare-ups that result in worsening cough, increased mucus, shortness of breath, and fatigue that you may experience with NCFB.",
        "Brinsupri is the first and only medicine approved by the FDA that is made specifically for NCFB, which affects about 500,000 people in the U.S. and many more around the world. NCFB widens and damages the airways in your lungs, making it harder to clear mucus. This can lead to trouble breathing and frequent lung infections that often require antibiotics or hospital care while also affecting a person’s emotional health and overall well-being. Until now, there were no approved treatments that directly targeted the inflammation behind this disease."
