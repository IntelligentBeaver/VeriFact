        "Does It Work?",
        "You'll probably lose weight on this diet, since most of its foods are low in calories, fat, and sodium, and high in fiber. One study found that people who followed a raw foods diet lost a significant amount of weight.",
        "You'll also get nutritional perks. Most of what you eat will be high in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and disease-fighting phytochemicals.",
        "But there are lots of drawbacks. The diet is difficult to follow and inadequate in many essential nutrients, such as protein, iron, calcium, vitamin B12 , and more.",
        "Plus, contrary to the claims of many raw food fans, cooking does not make food toxic but instead makes some foods digestible.",
        "Cooking also boosts some nutrients, like beta-carotene and lycopene, and kills bacteria, which helps you avoid food poisoning. There is no scientific evidence that raw foods prevent illness.",
        "Is It Good for Certain Conditions?",
        "It is not recommended for any specific health conditions. But losing extra weight is good for general health.",

        "In general, cooking makes your food more easily digestible and safer.",
