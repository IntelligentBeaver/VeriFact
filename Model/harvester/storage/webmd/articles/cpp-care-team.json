        "Central precocious puberty (CPP) is when your child's body releases certain hormones too soon. This causes early physical growth and sexual development (aka precocious puberty) in girls before age 8 and boys before age 9. Left untreated, CPP may lead to below average height (short stature) as well as social and emotional problems. Treatment for central precocious puberty typically includes medication to slow or delay early puberty. Your care team may recommend other therapies or surgery if another medical condition or factor is causing your child's CPP."
