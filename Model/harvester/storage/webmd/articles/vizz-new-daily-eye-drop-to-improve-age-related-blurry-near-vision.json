        "Vizz (aceclidine ophthalmic solution) is a new prescription eye drop approved to treat presbyopia, a common condition that makes it harder to see things up close as you get older. It's the first and only eye drop in the U.S. that uses aceclidine, a new type of medicine for this purpose.",
        "Vizz works by gently narrowing the size of your pupil. This creates a pinhole effect that helps you focus better on nearby objects without blurring your distance vision. A single daily dose can provide a quick improvement in your near vision that can last for up to 10 hours.",
        "Presbyopia usually starts in your mid-40s and affects nearly 128 million adults in the U.S. Many people use prescription reading glasses or contact lenses to manage it. Vizz offers a new nonsurgical option that doesn't require wearing glasses.",
        "Why was it approved?",
        "The FDA approved Vizz after reviewing results from three clinical studies that looked at how well it worked and how safe it was. In these studies, people who used Vizz once a day were able to see things up close much better within 30 minutes, and the effect lasted for up to 10 hours. These results were seen across different groups of people."
