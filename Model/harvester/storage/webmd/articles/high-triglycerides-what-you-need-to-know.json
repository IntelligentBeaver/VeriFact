        "You’ve probably heard of cholesterol. You might even know if your levels are too high. But what do you know about your triglycerides? More than a third of adults in the U.S. have high levels of triglycerides, a type of fat (lipid) in the blood that your body uses for energy.",
        "A lipid profile test checks your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. (Photo credit: iStock/Getty Images)",
        "Triglycerides are the most common type of lipid in your body. They come from fatty foods such as butter and from unused calories that your body stores in fat cells. When your body needs energy, it gets it from triglycerides. You do need some triglycerides to be healthy, but you don't want too many.",
        "Studies have consistently linked high triglyceride levels to heart disease, heart attacks, and stroke, especially in people with low levels of \"good\" HDL cholesterol and those with type 2 diabetes . So if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or other things that make you more likely to get heart disease , your doctor will likely want to keep a check on your triglyceride levels.",

        "If you’re a healthy adult, you should get a lipid profile every 4-6 years. Children should have it done at least once between the ages of 9 and 11, and one more time between 17 and 21. If you’re making changes to your diet or taking medication for high cholesterol or triglycerides, get a lipid profile afterward.",
