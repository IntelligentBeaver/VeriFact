        "Hemophilia B is a rare genetic disorder that makes it hard for your blood to clot. If you have a cut, scrape, or other injury, you will bleed for longer than people who don’t have a bleeding disorder. The typical image of someone with hemophilia is that they cut themselves and have a hard time stopping the blood. But bleeding can also occur internally, inside your body, like in your muscles and joints. Bleeding can happen spontaneously, meaning that there’s no cut or bump that might have caused it.",
