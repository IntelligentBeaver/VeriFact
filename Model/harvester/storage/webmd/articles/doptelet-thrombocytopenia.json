        "Doptelet ( avatrombopag ) is a prescription medicine for thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts). The FDA approved it in 2018 for adults with thrombocytopenia with long-term (chronic) liver disease to take before a medical or dental procedure, in 2019 for adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) when other medicines did not help enough, and in 2025 for children ages 1 year to under 6 years with ITP when other medicines did not help enough. Doptelet comes as a tablet and as granules (for younger children) that you take by mouth."

        "Thrombocytopenia is when your blood has too few platelets (also called thrombocytes). Platelets are blood cells made in the soft, spongy tissue inside your bones (bone marrow). Their job is to form clots that stop bleeding when you are injured. If your platelet count is low, it may take longer for your body to stop bleeding.",
        "Your platelets can be low for many reasons. Your bone marrow might not make enough, your body might destroy them, or your spleen may store too many of them. A hormone in your body called thrombopoietin (TPO) signals the bone marrow to make platelets by attaching to special proteins called receptors. Doptelet also attaches to those receptors and works together with TPO to increase the number of platelets your body makes."
