        "Everyone gets a sore throat from time to time, but sometimes the tonsils in your mouth can become infected. However, tonsils are not the only vulnerable glands in your mouth. Adenoids , located higher up in the mouth — behind the nose and roof of the mouth — can also get infected. Enlarged and inflamed adenoids, called adenoiditis, can make breathing difficult and lead to recurring respiratory infections. Adenoiditis is most common in children, but sometimes, it can affect adults as well.",
