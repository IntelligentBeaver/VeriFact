And if you’re not able to leave the house or you live far from friends and family, you may feel isolated and alone. These issues are common for many older adults – even more so for those with RA.

        "Stay active. There’s almost no problem exercise can’t solve or prevent. It lowers blood pressure and blood sugar, and helps with weight loss. It also eases joint pain and inflammation, and strengthens muscles so you’re less likely to fall. Studies show that older adults with RA can benefit from most types of exercise, especially a combination of strength training and cardio – the kind that gets your heart rate up. If you’re not active now, start slowly and work up to at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days."
