        "It’s a beautiful bright sunny day. The perfect day to grab brunch with friends then hang out at the pool. I have the cutest dress and new swimsuit to wear. Ugh! Wait, I have to shave my legs! Anyone with psoriasis on the areas that are typically shaved understands how frustrating this task can be. After years of shaving and trying hair removal products, I’ve finally found the best method.",
        "For a long time, I dreaded shaving my legs due to the psoriasis lesions on my skin. It was so easy to nick myself, so I had to go very slow. Shaving created so much anxiety to the point that I didn’t wear my legs out often to limit how much I shaved. One can imagine how it feels to get tired of pants, jeans, or tights, especially during the summer. I also learned that all razors weren’t created equal. Eventually, I found a favorite with the easiest glide and blades. I still didn’t care for shaving, but it became a little bit easier once I started using that brand."

        "Eventually, I would stop using razors and soon change to off-the-shelf hair removal products. I was so excited to see that I could just rub something on my leg, let it sit, then wipe it off. It didn’t take long for me to figure out the cons and a product that was seemed so perfect. The moment I rubbed the cream on my legs, I noticed the strongest chemical smell. It was awful! It took forever to get rid of that odor. A burning sensation would follow, and I couldn’t get this stuff off fast enough! My legs were way too sensitive to for such a strong product, and the psoriasis lesions became even more tender than they already were.",
        "The pain and smell from hair removal products made me go back to the tedious task of shaving with razors. Then one day I got bold enough to try waxing. Why on earth did I do that?! Not only was it painful, but some areas were also impacted by the hot wax strips and again way too harsh for my skin. I was so desperate for something that didn’t take so long and cause so much anxiety to simply remove hair."

        "Finally, I found the perfect match, which has been my routine for 2 years now. Sugaring! You’d think I would stop trying things that have to be snatched from my skin … crazy, I know! Ha-ha! That’s how much I hated shaving, and I am glad I stayed determined. Sugar paste is applied in the opposite direction of hair growth, then pulled off in the direction of the hair growth. The paste is made of sugar, lemon, and water and applied at body temperature, which prevents the risk of burning. The experience was so much better than what I experienced with waxing. The hair grows back thinner, and I only have to go every 6 weeks or so. To top it off, I noticed my skin felt so much smoother after my appointments. Sugaring itself serves as an exfoliating process for the skin. I must mention that the first few times wasn’t as easy, since I had shaved in the past. But after a few sessions, it became a breeze."
