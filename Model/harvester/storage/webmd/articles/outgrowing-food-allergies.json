        "We are all looking forward to that day to say that we have outgrown food allergies. With built-in anticipation, we remain hopeful that we can be that family that no longer has food allergies. So far, we have outgrown five allergens: wheat, soy, almonds, strawberries, and more recently, dairy. Only a handful more! Yes, we are a family that has multiple allergies. Every allergen counts.",
        "Although very exciting, this is what they don’t tell you: The fear never goes away. It may decrease, but does not go away completely. Well, let me clarify: The caretaker’s fear does not go away. I can’t say the same for my daughters as they delightfully dive right in with every new food. My 8-year-old daughter grew out of wheat and soy allergens by 2, almonds by 6, and dairy by 8. My 6-year-old daughter grew out of strawberries by 5, almonds by 6, and can now tolerate baked dairy with anticipation of growing out of it by the end of the year. I still get nervous when they eat those foods. I limit the intake amount, I try not to send those items to school, and I sometimes ask them how they feel after eating the known allergen. It is not my recommended advice to do these things, but it is simply my comfort zone."

        "Every allergen is a relief in different ways. The ability to eat soy and wheat allergies introduced my girls’ favorite food, chicken nuggets. The ability to eat almonds opened the door for almond milk, which allowed more milk options when eating outside of the home. Strawberries opened the door for all fruit and fruit drinks. Not having the dairy allergen allows the girls to eat pizza at the birthday parties, how exciting!",
        "We still have a combination of eggs, shellfish, peanuts, and other tree nuts to remove from the list. Only time will tell. There is not anything unique or special that we did to encourage the outgrown allergy, as this is a common question. Although hopeful for the growth of other allergens, we are prepared if they do not outgrow all of them. This is a journey that we have been on for 8 years now. Who knows what the future may bring?",
