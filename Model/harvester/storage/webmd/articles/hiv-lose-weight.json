        "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can keep you healthy. And weight gain can be a sign your treatment is working. But it’s possible for people to pack on too many pounds when they’re in treatment for HIV. That could lead to excess weight, obesity, or other health problems. That might leave you wondering about the safest way to lose weight. John Koethe, MD, assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, says there’s ongoing research into this kind of treatment-related weight gain. He says researchers are trying to figure out the best drug regimens to counter the effects. But we don’t have answers yet. For now, Koethe says the weight loss guidelines for people with HIV and treatment-related weight gain are the same as those for anyone else. “The mainstay being high fiber, low fat, and portion control, along with adequate exercise,” he says. Studies show that a balanced diet, along with physical activity, can be good for people with HIV. So talk to your doctor about your weight gain. They can set you up with a registered dietitian who works with people living with HIV. Here are some tips they might give you."

        "There isn’t a specific food that’ll help you lose weight. But a healthy diet pattern can boost your odds of success. And good nutrition isn’t just important for your waistline. It’ll support your immune system and help your ART work better, says Lauri Wright PhD, chair of the University of North Florida Department of nutrition and dietetics. Kristen Matthews, a registered dietitian who works with people who have HIV at the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic, agrees that a balanced diet will put you on the right track. But you don’t have to make big changes all at once. “Pick one goal that’s doable,” she says. “Even the smallest thing can make a big impact.” Here are some of their tips: Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables. Fiber, vitamins, and minerals can support both weight loss and your immune system. Aim for at least 4-5 servings a day. But that’s just a minimum. “The more plants, the better,” Matthews says."

Carbs trigger the release of glucose, or sugar. If you don’t use it all, your body can store extra glucose as belly fat. But you can lessen this blood sugar spike if you pair carbs with protein, healthy fats, or fiber. This kind of “food pairing” can help you turn glucose into energy “a little bit better, and prevent fat gain in the central region,” Matthews says."
