        "Guttate psoriasis is a type of psoriasis that shows up on your skin as red, purple, or brown, scaly, teardrop-shaped spots. Many people experience it as a child or young adult, usually after an infection. The itchy spots tend to go away on their own.",

        "Plaque psoriasis shows up as large, scaly patches on your skin. The patches form large plaques; guttate psoriasis forms small red or pink patches that don’t always have scales. The patches usually have healthy skin around them.",
        "Plaque psoriasis happens at any age, usually between 20 and 30 years old or 50 to 60 years old; guttate psoriasis happens in children and young adults under 30. A bacterial infection like strep throat usually causes guttate psoriasis, while plaque psoriasis can occur as a result of many triggers including genetics.",
        "If you or your child has guttate psoriasis, it’s most likely to show up on the torso, arms, or legs. Plaque psoriasis usually happens on the elbows, knees, scalp, ears, and lower back. Guttate psoriasis doesn’t appear on your palms, the soles of your feet, or nails like other forms of psoriasis."
