        "Nasal polyps are painless, teardrop-shaped growths that form in your  nose or sinuses. They’re most common where the sinuses near your eyes and cheekbones drain into your nose. Nasal polyps are not cancer and may never cause symptoms or need treatment. But sometimes they can lead to congestion, loss of taste and smell, trouble breathing, or repeat sinus infections.",
        "Up to 80% of people who had surgery saw their polyps return within 12 years, so be sure to address the underlying causes.",
        "Some people with nasal polyps become sensitive to common pain relievers like aspirin or ibuprofen. To relieve these symptoms, doctors first try medications such as nasal or oral steroids or biologic drugs like dupilumab (Dupixent), mepolizumab (Nucala) or omalizumab (Xolair), which are given as a shot every two to four weeks. These medicines often can shrink polyps, but they can have drawbacks, including side effects and cost.",
        "Surgery to remove polyps is usually only an option when medicines don’t help. Surgery might not be right for you if you have a bleeding disorder or a serious heart or lung problem."
