        "Breath of fire is often compared to how you breathe when hyperventilating, but the two are very different. Breath of fire is quick-paced, rhythmic, and sustained for a long period of time. Your inhale and exhale time is equal, with no pause in between breath. You should have two to three cycles of breathing in and out per second once you master breath of fire.",
        "When practicing, inhale and exhale through your nostrils, keeping your mouth closed unless a trained instructor tells you otherwise. The power behind your breath comes from deep in your core at your belly button and solar plexus. When you breathe out, your navel and solar plexus press inward to your spine.‌"
