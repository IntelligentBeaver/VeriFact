        "Takhzyro (lanadelumab-flyo) is a biologic medicine used to prevent hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in people who are 2 years or older. During an HAE attack, swelling under the skin happens in different areas of the body. While swelling in the throat area is not particularly common, when throat swelling does occur, it can be deadly because it can close off your airway. Certain situations or triggers can cause these attacks to happen. Common triggers for attacks include stress, surgery, medical or dental procedures, infections, and tiredness. People with HAE have to take medicine to prevent these attacks from occurring and need to have a rescue medicine readily available to treat any breakthrough attacks.",
        "In 2018, Takhzyro was approved by the FDA as the first monoclonal antibody that is injected under the skin to help prevent swelling attacks in people with HAE. Monoclonal antibodies are medicines made in a lab that can directly target pathways in your body that lead to your symptoms."

        "Most people who have HAE have a problem with a protein called C1 inhibitor — they either do not make enough of the protein or they make enough of the protein, but it does not work right. When levels of the C1 inhibitor protein are too low, it causes the body to make too much of another protein called plasma kallikrein. Plasma kallikrein is responsible for releasing yet another protein in the body called bradykinin.",
        "When there is too much bradykinin in the body, it causes your blood vessels to leak fluid into the surrounding tissues. This causes the symptoms of HAE, including swelling and pain, often in the face, hands, feet, genitals, stomach, or throat. Takhzyro is an antibody that attaches to kallikrein in your blood. Once attached to kallikrein, Takhzyro blocks it from working, thus lowering the amount of bradykinin that your body makes. This helps prevent the fluid leakage that causes swelling, lowering the number and severity of HAE attacks that you have."
