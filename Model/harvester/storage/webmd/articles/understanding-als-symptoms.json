        "ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, affects the nerves that control your voluntary muscles. Those are muscles you use for actions such as moving your arms and legs, talking, and chewing. ALS is considered a motor neuron disease. Lou Gehrig was a baseball player in the 1930s whose career was cut short at age 36 by the condition. He died less than 2 years later.",
        "It can show up differently in people based on things such as sex, age, and race. Your sex can also play a role in what type of ALS you get and how quickly it gets worse.",
        "ALS symptoms in women can differ from those in men, depending on what caused your disease. Knowing about these differences may help you spot your symptoms and start treatment sooner so you might slow down the progression of ALS. It could also help researchers find better treatments.",
        "ALS can be sporadic (unknown cause) or familial (caused by your genes). About 90%-95% of people with ALS have the sporadic type. Early symptoms of sporadic ALS can be different in women and men.",
        "Symptoms can start as a weak feeling in your hands or feet. The disease attacks the brain cells that control a lot of your muscle movement. Eventually, it weakens your diaphragm, a muscle needed for your lungs to work. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure. ALS still has no cure."
