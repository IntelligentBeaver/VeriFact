        "April 14, 2023 – Using artificial intelligence to analyze a recording of someone’s voice could cut the duration of an Alzheimer’s screening from several hours to less than 10 minutes.",
        "Currently, Alzheimer’s screenings can involve brain scans and analysis of cerebral fluid collected from the spine via a procedure called a lumbar puncture. Researchers from universities in Texas and Georgia compared the results of those standard tests to their new AI-powered voice screening.",
        "The experimental technique identifies subtle changes in a person’s voice that could indicate cognitive problems and Alzheimer’s disease before symptoms are evident. Results of the study were published earlier this year by the Alzheimer’s Association in Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring .",
        "“If confirmed with larger studies, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to study vocal recordings could provide primary care providers with an easy-to-perform screening tool for at-risk individuals,” said researcher Ihab Hajjar, MD, of the University of Texas Southwestern, in a statement . “Earlier diagnoses would give patients and families more time to plan for the future and give clinicians greater flexibility in recommending promising lifestyle interventions.”"
