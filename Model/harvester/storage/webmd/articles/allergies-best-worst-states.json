        "Allergies happen when your body’s immune system reacts to an allergen such as pollen, pet dander, or mold. They’re one of the most common medical conditions, causing millions of people to reach for tissues and eye drops each year to manage symptoms. Symptoms are worse for people in certain regions of the U.S. due to high pollen counts, large amounts of trees and flowers, or other factors in the environment. For the past 20 years, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) has produced an annual list of the best and worst cities and states for those with allergies. The list considers the 100 most populated cities. These states are on the list based on several factors including: The scores for trees, grass, and weed pollen The amount of over-the-counter allergy medicine use The number of board-certified allergy doctors in the area Common allergy triggers that are often different in certain parts of the country include: Tree pollen (early spring) Grass pollen (spring and summer) Ragweed pollen (fall) Dust mites and cockroach droppings (year-round) Dander from pets (can be year-round but might cause worse symptoms in winter, when houses are closed up) Spores from indoor and outdoor fungi and molds (seasonal and year-round)"

When you’re outside, wear hats, sunglasses, and other coverings to keep the pollen out of your hair and eyes. Take your shoes off before coming inside. Wash your bedding regularly. Change clothes after time outdoors. Keep your windows closed during peak pollen times (early mornings and late evenings are normally OK). Wipe off pets when they come inside and bathe them regularly. Use HEPA allergy-friendly air filters for your HVAC system. Consider buying an air filter/purifier for your home. Vacuum and clean floors and fabric furniture at least weekly. Clean window treatments (blinds and curtains) and rugs at least once a month."

While most cities in these states aren’t on the high-allergy list, many people still notice symptoms during this time of year. The culprit?

        "Allergies are treated in four main ways: Avoiding the things that cause your allergies. Staying away from allergy triggers may involve moving states or avoiding being outside when pollen counts are high. Allergy medication. Antihistamines are the most common allergy medications and are available over-the-counter or as a prescription. They block a chemical called histamine in the body which causes allergic reactions – sneezing, a runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, and hives. These meds can be taken as needed, but many doctors will recommend daily use (starting before allergy season) for best effects. Note: Some of these medications, like Benadryl, may make you drowsy, so be careful driving or working after taking them. Also, check with your doctor if you’re pregnant or nursing. Drugs like Allegra, Claritin, and Zyrtec may cause less drowsiness. Nasal steroid sprays. Nasal steroid sprays help prevent and calm inflammation in your nasal tissues and airways. Like antihistamines, they are available over the counter or by prescription. Doctors also suggest using these a few weeks before allergy season starts or year-round to help ease your symptoms of congestion, sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes. Using nasal sprays correctly is key. Follow the instructions on the package or ask your health care team for a demo to be sure."
