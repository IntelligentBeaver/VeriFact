But experts warn that precautions are needed to ensure that disguises are the only frightening things on All Hallows' Eve.",

She says that major therapy is required when the tendons and nerves are severed when a child or adult uses an inappropriate knife or uses one incorrectly. Physical therapy to prevent scarring from permanently disabling a hand can last for eight to 12 weeks."
