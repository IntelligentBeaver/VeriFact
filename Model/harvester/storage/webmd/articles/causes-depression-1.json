Children, siblings, and parents of people with severe depression are more likely than the general population to have depression. Multiple genes interacting with one another in special ways probably lead to the various types of depression that run in families. Yet, despite the evidence of a family link to depression, it's unlikely that there is a single \"depression\" gene. Rather, many such genes, each with a small effect, contribute to depression when they interact with the environment.",
