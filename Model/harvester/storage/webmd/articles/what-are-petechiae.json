        "Petechiae are tiny red, flat spots that appear on your skin. They are a sign of blood leaking from capillaries under your skin. Capillaries are the tiniest blood vessels that connect arteries to veins. They help move oxygen and nutrients from your bloodstream to your organs and tissues. They also carry waste away from your organs and tissues.",
        "Petechiae sometimes appear in clusters and may look like a rash. If you have tiny red, purple, or brown spots on your skin , they could be petechiae. They're not a disease, but a symptom. Several things, from a severe coughing fit to an infection, can cause petechiae.",
        "Often, petechiae are nothing to worry about. Still, it's always a good idea to check with your doctor if you're not sure where these spots came from. Some conditions that cause petechiae are very serious.",
