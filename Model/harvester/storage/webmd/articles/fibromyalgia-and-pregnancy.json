        "If you have fibromyalgia and are thinking about getting pregnant , it's important to learn all you can about both conditions. Sometimes, symptoms of fibromyalgia -- such as pain, fatigue , and depression -- are thought to be signs of the pregnancy itself. As a result, they may be undertreated. In addition, the added stress of having a baby may cause fibromyalgia symptoms to flare, making you feel much worse.",

        "It is also important to visit your ob-gyn for routine prenatal care visits. During a visit, your doctor may screen you for depression and work with you to treat these symptoms."

        "With pregnancy, there's a tremendous increase in the amount of hormones in your body. Along with weight gain, your body is out of balance, and your shape takes a different form. Most women experience nausea and fatigue, especially during the first three months of pregnancy. Is it any wonder that fibromyalgia symptoms are often misdiagnosed and thought to be a normal part of pregnancy?",
        "There are few studies on fibromyalgia in pregnant women. However, a study at Temple University found that women with fibromyalgia had more symptoms of pain during pregnancy than women who did not have fibromyalgia. Also, fibromyalgia symptoms seemed to be exacerbated during pregnancy. Pregnant women with fibromyalgia may experience significant pain, fatigue , and psychological stress, especially in the first three months."
