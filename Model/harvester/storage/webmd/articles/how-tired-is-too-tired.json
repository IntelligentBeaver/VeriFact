        "Fatigue is a lingering tiredness that is constant and limiting. With fatigue, you have unexplained, persistent, and relapsing exhaustion.

If you have chronic fatigue, or systemic exertion intolerance disease, you may wake up in the morning feeling as though you've not slept. Or you may be unable to function at work or be productive at home. You may be too exhausted to even manage your daily affairs.",
