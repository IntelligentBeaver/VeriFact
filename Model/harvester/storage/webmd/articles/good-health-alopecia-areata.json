        "Many healthy people live with alopecia areata, a condition where your hair falls out in patches. Even if you have mild or severe hair loss, you may still be in very good health. With alopecia areata, your immune system attacks your hair follicles, which leads to hair loss. Your hair may come out in patches or clumps about the size of a quarter. Losing hair doesn’t mean you’re not healthy. Even though alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease, most people who have it are healthy. For most, hair loss is their only symptom."
