        "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease in which your immune system attacks your joints, most often in the hands and feet. That inflammation can eventually damage or destroy the cartilage and bone. There is no cure for RA, but there are ways to manage the condition’s symptoms and progression.",

Surgery isn’t the first line of treatment for RA in your feet and ankles. Your doctor will likely suggest lifestyle changes, medications, custom foot inserts, and other treatments.",
