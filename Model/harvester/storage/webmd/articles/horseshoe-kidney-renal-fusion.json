        "Horseshoe kidney, also called renal fusion, is a condition that starts before a child is born.",
        "As a baby develops in the womb, their kidneys move into position just above the waist -- one on each side of the body. But sometimes that doesn’t happen as it should. Instead, the kidneys fuse together at their base, forming a U or horseshoe shape. It usually happens between weeks 7 and 9 of the pregnancy .",
        "The condition isn’t common -- about 1 in 500 babies have it, boys more often than girls. And many kids won’t have serious health issues because of it.",
        "However, about one in three children with fused kidneys will also have a problem with their heart , blood vessels, nervous system, reproductive or urinary systems, digestive system , or bones. There’s no cure for renal fusion, but your child’s doctor can help them manage those conditions."
