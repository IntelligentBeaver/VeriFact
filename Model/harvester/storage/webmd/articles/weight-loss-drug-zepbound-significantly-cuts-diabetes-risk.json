        "Aug. 20, 2024 – The weight loss and diabetes drug tirzepatide, sold under the brand name Zepbound, was highly effective at reducing the risk of progressing from prediabetes to the more serious condition of type 2 diabetes , according to a glimpse of early study results released Tuesday by drugmaker Eli Lilly.",
        "Tirzepatide is sold under the brand name Zepbound for weight loss and under the name Mounjaro for diabetes. The medicine works like other well-known diabetes and weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. Tirzepatide is known as a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, meaning it works in two ways to mimic hormones released in the gut that can affect appetite and caloric intake. It can also impact insulin production.",
        "These latest results are from a phase III clinical trial of tirzepatide, which is usually the largest phase of examining a drug’s effects and safety. Called the SURMOUNT-1 trial, this new analysis included 1,032 adults who had prediabetes and overweight or obesity. Results were compared among people who took a placebo, or one of three dosages of tirzepatide (5 milligrams, 10 milligrams, or 15 milligrams) that were given weekly as a shot for 176 weeks, which is more than 3 years."
