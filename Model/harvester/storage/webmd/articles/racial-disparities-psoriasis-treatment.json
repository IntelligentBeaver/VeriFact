        "Search online for psoriasis images, and you'll mostly find photos of white people. But that doesn’t reflect the reality of this skin condition. People with dark skin get psoriasis, too. Fewer African Americans and Hispanic people have a diagnosis than white people. But that doesn’t necessarily mean fewer people of color live with psoriasis. This skin condition is often missed or undertreated in people of color. When you don’t get treatment for psoriasis, you could end up with more severe symptoms. Research shows that Black and Hispanic people report more embarrassment and problems in their daily life from psoriasis than white people do. With so few images of psoriasis on brown skin, it's important to learn what psoriasis looks like on skin of color and what treatments are available. Then you can have an informed talk with your doctor and get the help you need to manage your skin symptoms."

Nearly 2% of Hispanic Americans and 1.5% of Black Americans have a diagnosis of psoriasis. The real numbers of people who have the condition are probably higher. A lack of access to health care and other barriers prevent many people of color from getting diagnosed and treated."

        "How psoriasis looks depends a lot on your skin tone. On light skin, the plaques appear red. On dark skin, they may look brown or purple, which can make them harder to see. Dark or light scar -like spots are another sign of psoriasis on dark-toned skin. The spotting is due to the effects of psoriasis inflammation on skin pigment cells, and it should fade in time. Psoriasis tends to be more severe and widespread in people of color. In studies, Black people had psoriasis over more parts of their body than white people – including on their scalp. The appearance of psoriasis plaques on dark skin can be easy to confuse with other skin conditions. Psoriasis sometimes looks like lupus or a skin rash called lichen planus."
