        "In 2010, rescuers saved 33 Chilean miners trapped for more than two months in a San José mine while 1 billion people around the world watched with bated breath. And on the scene reporting live — in both English and in Spanish — was NBC correspondent Natalie Morales.",
        "“After the miraculous rescue operation, the Chilean president gave a speech, which I simultaneously translated live on MSNBC that evening,” Morales says. “The ability to speak to people in Spanish and to be able to share the passion and all of the emotion of the story to our audience in the U.S. was an absolute highlight of my career.”",
        "Born in Taiwan to a Brazilian mother and Puerto Rican father, and raised in Spain, Brazil, Panama, and the U.S., Morales’ multicultural upbringing was rich soil for a fruitful journalism career. Still, she had modest expectations.",
        "“I saw myself with a career in journalism, but I always thought it was going to be in local news,” Morales says. “I never dreamed I would be the first Latina news anchor at the Today show — a person people would tune in to watch Monday through Friday on a main network.”"
