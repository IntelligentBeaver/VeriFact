        "Immune cell inhibitors are medications that put the brakes on your immune cells and stop them from working like they normally do. They help treat relapsing MS (RMS) by targeting the immune cells attacking your myelin sheath. Typically, immune cells attack foreign substances in your body to help protect you from viruses, bacteria, and other harmful things. When you have MS, these cells attack myelin. By “turning down” the activity of immune cells, immune cell inhibitors prevent this process."

        "The exact process immune cell inhibitors use to treat MS depends on their type. Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made proteins that mimic natural antibodies. Antibodies are proteins your immune system makes to help destroy harmful substances in your body. Because researchers create these monoclonal antibodies to recognize very specific proteins, they can have a very specific effect. Researchers are still studying which exact cells attack myelin so that they can hone in on them. For example, they’ve pinpointed a marker called CD20 on B cells that they think are involved in myelin damage. When monoclonal antibodies “recognize” CD20 on a cell, they attach to it and kill it. Immunomodulators are medications that modulate, or change, the action of immune cells so they work differently. Researchers don’t fully understand how they work to treat MS, but their main effect seems to be preventing these cells from multiplying. With fewer myelin-attacking immune cells around, less damage happens. One immunomodulator doctors prescribe for MS, mitoxantrone (Novantrone), is in a class of drugs called antineoplastics. It’s a chemotherapy drug that also treats cancer."

        "The FDA has approved several medications in the immune cell inhibitor category to treat RMS. There are different kinds of immune cell inhibitors, including: Immunomodulators Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone, Glatopa) Teriflunomide (Aubagio) Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) Cladribine (Mavenclad) Monoclonal antibodies Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) Natalizumab (Tysabri) Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) Ofatumumab (Kesimpta) Ublituximab (Briumvi) In August 2023, the FDA approved natalizumab-sztn (Tyruko), which is a biosimilar to natalizumab. A biosimilar is a drug that has a very similar makeup to an already-approved biologic drug. Biosimilar drugs aren’t an exact copy of the biologics they mimic, but they’re close enough that they’re just as safe, work as well, and work in the same way. Often biosimilars are less expensive than biologic drugs."

Of the side effects you may have from these treatments, the most serious include: Kidney problems Liver problems Risk of birth defects in your baby if you’re pregnant Severe immune system responses Severe infections Skin cancer Thyroid problems Triggering of hepatitis B infection Both natalizumab (Tysabri) and ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) carry the risk of causing a rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML usually leads to death or severe disability over a period of weeks or months. Black Box Warnings When a treatment has serious risk, the FDA gives it a “black box” warning. These immune cell inhibitors have black box warnings: Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada). This drug can cause rare but serious cases of stroke and tears in the lining of arteries in the head and neck. These problems can lead to permanent disability or death. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone). This medicine comes with enough side effects that doctors don’t often prescribe it for MS. Its black box warning notes potential heart problems, bone marrow cancer, and damage to certain sex organs. If you take it or ever have taken it, your doctor will want to examine your heart function yearly."
