        "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a rare inherited disorder that can lead to serious chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While there's no cure, treatments and lifestyle changes can help you manage your symptoms and protect your lungs from further damage. COPD is a group of lung conditions that includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The most common symptoms people have as lung disease develops due to AAT deficiency are: Wheezing Shortness of breath A chronic cough with phlegm Repeated colds Pneumonia Ronald Crystal, MD, chairman of genetic medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, said people are most often diagnosed with AAT deficiency after they visit their doctor due to breathlessness. “They go up a flight of stairs and they're short of breath. They walk up the subway stairs and they're short of breath. They try to run, say after a bus or something, and they're short of breath,” says Crystal, also a pulmonary doctor who has treated more than 500 people with the disease."

        "Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a protein made by your liver that moves throughout your body in your bloodstream. One of its main functions is to protect your body from an enzyme called neutrophil elastase. Your immune system produces this enzyme to help fight inflammation or infection. But if it's left unchecked by AAT, it can harm the fragile tissues in your lungs. Without enough AAT, the neutrophil elastase damages more and more of your lung cells. As the damage continues through the years, lung disease can develop. The situation is worse for people who smoke. Smoking causes emphysema and other symptoms to develop much faster. “If you're not a cigarette smoker and you have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, you don't develop the emphysema until age 55 or so,” says Crystal. “But if you are a cigarette smoker, or if you've been a cigarette smoker, you can develop the disease at ages 35 to 40.”"

If your lung disease is due to AAT, it's more likely to affect the lower areas of your lungs, Crystal says.

        "There are several treatments available to address the symptoms of COPD.  But augmentation therapy (sometimes also called replacement therapy) is the only specific therapy for AAT deficiency. It uses alpha-1-antitrypsin protein from healthy human donors to increase your levels of the protein. You get it in regular IV infusions. The goal is to increase the alpha-1-antitrypsin protein in your body, so it can protect your lungs from the neutrophil elastase enzyme. While this treatment doesn’t cure AAT deficiency or fix damage already done, it can help protect your lungs from further harm. “You can't give back lung function. You can't give back normal air sacs.
