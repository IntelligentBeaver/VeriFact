        "When you start a weight loss program, you usually see results fast. At first, your body uses glycogen , a sugar stored in your muscles and liver that serves as a quick energy source. Glycogen is stored with water, so burning it releases water weight. But when you use up the stored glycogen and start burning fat, weight loss slows down.",
        "Also, when you reduce your calorie intake, your metabolism slows down to help you save energy. You burn fewer calories as your body tries to adjust, making it harder to lose weight. This is called metabolic adaptation, and it’s one reason a super-low-calorie diet can backfire. Losing muscle mass along with fat can further slow your metabolism.",
        "Another possible reason for a plateau is based on what doctors call the set point theory. The idea is that your body has a baseline weight that it tries to maintain. If you go below it, your body produces hunger-boosting hormones to try to get you to increase your calorie intake."
