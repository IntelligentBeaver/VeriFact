        "March 18, 2025 – As vaccination rates among people decline, a growing number of pet parents – often influenced by misinformation – are skipping vaccines for their pets, too, leaving animals vulnerable to serious illnesses.",
        "About 6 in 10 veterinarians say that more pet owners are turning down rabies shots or other core vaccinations for pets after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a survey . Public skepticism about human vaccines is spilling over to attitudes about vaccinating pets, veterinarians and experts said.",
        "\"People tend to generalize their feelings about vaccinations,\" said Lori Kogan, PhD, a psychologist and professor of clinical sciences at Colorado State University and chair of the Human-Animal Interaction Section of the American Psychological Association.",

About 11% of dog owners and 12% of cat owners have concerns about the safety, efficacy, or importance of vaccines for their pets, the study showed. While most cats and dogs still get their shots, many don't – ranging from 6% of dogs missing rabies vaccines to 33% of cats unprotected against feline herpesvirus-1."
