        "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal condition that affects as many as 15% of adults living in the United States. It’s marked by a variety of symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, gas, and bloating. Kate Scarlata, MPH, RDN is a registered dietitian nutritionist and author with more than 30 years of experience working with IBS and other digestive disorders. She wrote her latest book, Mind Your Gut: The Science-Based, Whole-Body Guide to Living Well with IBS , with Megan Riehl, PsyD, a psychologist specializing in gastrointestinal disorders. I talked with her about IBS and her latest book. Here are some key takeaways from our conversation:",
        "What causes IBS?",
        "The exact cause of IBS is unknown, but factors such as abnormal intestinal movements, changes in the microbes that live in the colon, genetics, intestinal infections, and adverse childhood events such as trauma or sexual abuse increase IBS risk. Irritable bowel syndrome runs in families, and this is especially true for women and their children. Gastroenteritis, which is the inflammation of the stomach and gut lining that’s caused by a virus or bacteria, can result in IBS. Younger people, women, and those with severe symptoms of gastroenteritis are more likely to develop IBS after having an intestinal infection. Antibiotic use is associated with IBS, too."

        "In the 1950s, IBS was thought to be a psychosomatic disorder. We now know that IBS is a complex condition that results from a combination of factors, including how the gut and brain communicate with each other. Your gut and brain are constantly sending signals to each other that influence how the gut moves, your mood, appetite, and behaviors. Changes in the community of beneficial bacteria that live in the gut, which also help protect the gut barrier, can affect this cross-talk. Gastrointestinal motility issues are also a factor in IBS. Motility disorders result when the nerves or muscles in the gut don’t function in a coordinated manner, resulting in constipation, diarrhea, and other issues. A lower threshold for pain in your internal organs, known as visceral hypersensitivity, also plays a role in IBS."

Evidence shows a low FODMAP diet can reduce symptoms in 50%-80% of people with IBS.",

We adapted IBS guidelines from the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for Mind Your Gut that focus on eating three meals a day and modification of common triggers, such as alcohol, caffeine, wheat bran, and fatty or spicy foods, for IBS symptom relief.

        "We know that the central nervous system influences the digestive process, and that some of that happens through the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS is in the gastrointestinal tract and is often called the \"second brain.” The term gut-brain axis (GBA) refers to how the gut and brain constantly communicate. The beneficial bacteria that live in the gut are capable of creating and regulating neurotransmitters (compounds that allow nerve cells to communicate) that impact mood. A dysregulated, or imbalanced, GBA, which is part of IBS, can affect digestive and mental health conditions. We often say that in IBS, the brain and gut are \"screaming at each other\" and that this over-amped connection can intensify what’s happening in the gut.",

        "First, don’t self-diagnose! Symptoms of IBS can mimic other conditions, and some of them, such as ovarian cancer, are life-threatening. Visit your doctor and get evaluated. Once your doctor is sure that there are no other underlying GI problems, they can make a reliable diagnosis of IBS by asking you about your symptoms and using a set of criteria created by the Rome Foundation.",
        "Discuss with your GI doctor or primary care physician how you can benefit from nutrition and GI behavioral therapies. If you don't have access to specialty providers, Mind Your Gut and digital apps such as Nerva (a gut-directed hypnosis app) and Mahana IBS (a cognitive behavioral therapy app) are helpful.
