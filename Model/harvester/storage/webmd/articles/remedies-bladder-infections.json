        "Bladder infections are a common type of urinary tract infection (UTI) . Bacteria enters your urethra and moves to the bladder , where the bacteria can multiply quickly. Anyone can have a bladder infection, but they are particularly common among women.",
        "Approximately 40 to 60 percent of women will develop a bladder infection or UTI in their life, and about one in four women will have a repeat infection. Women are at increased risk for a bladder infection since they have a shorter urethra than men. As a result, the bacteria has less distance to travel to reach the bladder.",

This situation may make it more difficult to treat the infection or take a longer course of treatment. Cases of bladder infection in men are always considered complicated bladder infections since their longer urethra should stop this type of infection from occurring."
