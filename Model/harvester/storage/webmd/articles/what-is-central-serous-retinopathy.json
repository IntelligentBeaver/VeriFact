        "Central serous retinopathy (or CSR, also known as central serous chorioretinopathy, or CSCR), is a disease of the eye, most notably the retina . This condition results from fluid building up underneath the center of the retina: i.e., the macula. This fluid leaks from the choroid, a blood vessel layer located underneath the retina. When this fluid leaks, it is often due to the macula becoming separated from the eye, giving the fluid enough space to build up.",
