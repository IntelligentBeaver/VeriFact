This is when you get an infection in your heart valves or your endocardium, which is the lining of your heart. While IE is rare, it’s more common with HCM. It can lead to serious, life-threatening complications, so it’s best to lower your risk. Find out facts about IE, learn more about HCM, and take steps to prevent infection."

        "IE happens when bacteria or fungi get into your bloodstream and reach your heart. It’s usually caused by two types of bacteria: streptococcus and staphylococcus. Normally, your body kills bacteria before it causes problems. But if you have a heart condition like HCM, the tissue in your heart valves and lining may be rough. This makes it easier for bacteria to attach to it. Bacteria may enter your bloodstream from something as simple as brushing your teeth or as complex as open heart surgery, which is a treatment you may get for HCM."

If IE develops slowly, it’s called subacute or chronic IE. It may take weeks or months to develop. You can lower your risk by limiting your exposure to infection and to: Use good oral hygiene. Avoid piercings and tattoos. Take antibiotics if your doctor recommends them."
