        "Follicular phase. In this 14-day phase, the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) released by your pituitary gland urges small sacs called follicles in your ovaries to produce an egg or ovum. Usually, only one ovary produces an ovum during each cycle. Many follicles in an ovary respond to this stimulation, but the most responsive follicle is called the dominant follicle. An egg forms within it, whereas the remaining follicles shrink and disappear.",
        "Ovulatory phase. In this phase, ovulation takes place over one to two days. After the egg is developed in the dominant follicle, the pituitary gland secretes luteinizing hormone (LH), which is a signal to the ovarian follicle to release the ovum into the fallopian tube. This tube is connected to the upper part of the uterus. Once sperms enter the vagina, they travel through the uterus to reach the fallopian tube. If this happens during the ovulatory phase, they have a chance to meet the egg and fertilize it.",
        "Luteal phase. In this 14-day phase, once the egg has left the ovary, the remnant follicle cells form the corpus luteum. Depending on whether fertilization has occurred, the corpus luteum exhibits different behaviors and is eventually discarded at the end of the cycle. This means that over the course of your reproductive years, you might produce hundreds of corpus luteums."
