        "It was 2003 and I had made a decision to drop out of college to continue working full-time as a result of some financial troubles.  I was working at a plant as a quality control lab technician. I was going through a lot of mental and physical stress that got worse as the year progressed.",
        "Prior to 2003, I was enrolled in college and working full-time. The strain of life, along with my finances, began to weigh heavy on me and eventually caused me to make the critical decision of quitting school. In October of that year, my body began to feel tired and I felt pain all over my body. I dealt with the symptoms for about a month before my body began to shut down on me and one day, I noticed that it was difficult for me to stay awake. This happened for almost 24 hours.",
        "A friend of mine suggested that I go to the ER because I didn’t look well. When I got there, they told me that my blood sugar level was about 550 and the doctor asked me if I knew that I had diabetes. I told him I had no idea, and he began explaining what was happening to me."

On Nov. 29, 2003, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and was told that the reason for my diagnosis of type 1 was because of my young age. I was 20 years old.",

I spent 2 weeks in the hospital being treated for the kidney infection and learning what my treatment would be when I left there.  I was terrified of needles and didn’t like the idea of having to take insulin injections and prick my fingers several times a day."

Even today I still wonder, “How would life have been if I had received an accurate diagnosis?“ Maybe all of this could have been avoided if I had known what questions to ask and the appropriate time to ask them. At that age, all I knew was that other family members had diabetes, but no one really talked about how to manage it."
