        "In 2016, during my senior year of college, I went through one of the darkest periods of my mental health journey. I was truly financially independent for the first time, finishing my degree, working 50+ hours per week between two retail jobs, and trying to manage all the new adult responsibilities on my plate. Health care costs, for one, became a new expense for me — one that I couldn’t afford.",
        "My bipolar disorder and anxiety had previously been treated with financial help from my parents, but that was no longer the case in 2016. Paying for psychiatry appointments to get my medications refilled every three months wasn’t feasible anymore, and this quickly became an issue when I began my fall semester in 2016. I figured I could last a while off my medications while I figured things out or saved up money, and that plan backfired in a major way.",
        "On Oct. 1, 2016, I attempted to take my own life after battling a severe depressive episode for months. Thankfully, I was taken to the hospital by my best friend and ended up being held there under the Baker Act, the psychiatric hold law here in Florida. I wasn’t able to access my phone or leave the hospital for 72 hours."
