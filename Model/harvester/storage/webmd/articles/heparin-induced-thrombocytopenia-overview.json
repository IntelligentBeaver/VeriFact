        "What is the difference between HIT and DIC?",
        "Both HIT and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are health conditions that involve abnormal clotting and bleeding. But HIT is caused by heparin exposure, and DIC is caused by various underlying illnesses. Another difference is in how they begin. HIT tends to happen more quickly, and DIC happens gradually. Most people with HIT don't have DIC, but severe HIT may trigger DIC.",

        "Stop taking heparin and switch to a different blood thinner. Your doctor will decide if you need more treatment.",
        "How long does it take to recover from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia?",
        "Your platelet counts will usually return to normal within a week of stopping heparin. But antibodies responsible for HIT can stay in your blood for several weeks, even after your platelet counts have recovered, increasing your risk of thrombosis."
