Some immune cells in our bodies called T cells have proteins on their surface that bind to PD-L1. When these proteins bind to each other, the T cells in our body get turned “off,” which stops them from killing cancer cells. Keytruda acts on proteins on the T cell and prevents these proteins from binding to PD-L1 proteins on the tumor cell. This turns the T cell back “on” and allows it to do its job of attacking and killing the tumor cell."

        "Keytruda was studied in people with advanced RCC who had not gotten any prior treatment for their cancer. People in this study got either Keytruda plus an oral medicine called axitinib, or another oral chemotherapy medicine used to treat RCC, called sunitinib. This trial looked at overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS), which measured how long people lived without their disease progressing. It also looked at objective response rate (ORR), which measures the percentage of people who had either a complete or partial response to treatment. There were 861 people in this trial. The median age was 62, with a range of 26 to 90, and 38% were 65 or older. Most people were male (73%). Seventy-nine percent of people were White and 16% were Asian. People in this trial were followed for an average of 43 months. At that time, the median OS was 45.7 months in the Keytruda group, versus 40.1 months in the sunitinib group. The PFS was also longer in the Keytruda group, at 15.7 months, versus 11 months in the sunitinib group. This means that half of the people in the Keytruda group lived at least 15.7 months without their disease progressing and lived at least 45.7 months overall. Likewise, the ORR was 60% in the Keytruda group and 40% in the sunitinib group."
