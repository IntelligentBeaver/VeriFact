        "Targeted cancer therapies are drugs that target specific parts of cancer cells, such as proteins or genes, that help cancers grow and spread. They also may go after other types of cells that help cancers grow and spread. For some types of cancer, targeted therapies may work better than other treatments.",
        "The FDA has approved targeted therapies for more than 15 types of cancer, including those of the breast, prostate , colon, and lung. But they only work if your tumor has the right target. And targeted therapies can often stop working if the target changes or your cancer finds a way around the treatment.",
