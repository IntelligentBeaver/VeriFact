The goal is to remove as much of the cancer as possible while saving the healthy tissue around it. A surgeon removes layers of skin one at a time and examines them under a microscope until all the cancer is gone. This lowers the chance of requiring future treatments or surgery.",

        "Mohs surgery is a precise method that doctors use to treat skin cancer. It's done by removing thin layers of skin, one at a time, while checking for cancer in each layer. It works well for treating cancers such as basal and squamous cell carcinomas, especially in areas where preserving healthy tissue is important, such as the face or hands. The procedure has a high cure rate and works well for aggressive cancers. After surgery, the wound may heal naturally and require stitching, or reconstructive surgery, depending on its size and location. Mohs surgery has low risks and minimal scarring."
