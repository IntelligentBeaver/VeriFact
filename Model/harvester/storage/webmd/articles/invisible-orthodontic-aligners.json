        "Invisible aligners are thin, clear, and custom-fitted to your teeth, making them almost invisible when worn.",
        "Invisalign is the largest maker of clear aligners , but it’s not the only brand. Others include Spark, Reveal, and Clear Correct.",
        "Since you can remove invisible aligners, it’s easier to brush and floss your teeth than it is with traditional braces. (Photo Credit: Andrey Popov/Dreamstime)",
        "Braces vs. invisible aligners",
        "Braces use brackets connected by wires to move teeth into place. Invisible aligners are a series of tight-fitting, custom-made mouthpieces that slip over your teeth and move them little by little. Both braces and aligners move your teeth into a better alignment, but they differ in appearance and in what they can do.",
        "Avoiding “metal mouth” isn’t the only reason to choose a clear aligner. Unlike braces, aligners can be removed, making it easier to brush and floss well. That helps maintain better overall oral health."
