        "There are several types of antidepressants on the market. They all work slightly differently by targeting certain chemicals in your brain called neurotransmitters. The currently available antidepressants mostly work on two neurotransmitters: serotonin and norepinephrine.",
        "These neurotransmitters help control your mood and behavior. Researchers think that antidepressants stop your nerve cells from reabsorbing the neurotransmitters after they've been used. This helps maintain higher levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in your nerve synapses, allowing their mood- and behavior-altering effects to last longer.",
        "Also, experts think that increasing the amount of neurotransmitters in your synapses boosts levels of proteins that help protect certain cells in your brain. One of these proteins is called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). People with depression seem to have naturally low levels of BDNF in their brains. Some experts think that increasing BDNF levels in your brain is what ultimately brings your depressive condition into remission.",
        "For most types, you need to take the medicine daily for several weeks to months before symptoms improve. If one type doesn't help you, you can try other types. But don't just stop taking your medicine once you've started. You'll need to decrease your dose gradually over four weeks or you risk getting antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. This can cause symptoms such as fatigue, headache, muscle aches, sweating, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, dizziness, tingling, or shock-like sensations. Ask your doctor before you stop. They can help you come up with a schedule to help you wean yourself off the drug with minimum symptoms."
