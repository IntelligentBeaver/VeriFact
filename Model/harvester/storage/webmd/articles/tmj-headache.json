        "You have a temporomandibular joint (TMJ) on either side of your face that connects your jaw to your skull. It helps with important functions, such as opening your mouth to talk and chewing food. So how can TMJ cause headaches? If this joint stops working as it should, it can cause pain across your face and head.",
        "Your TMJ is the most used joint in your body. One part of it acts as a hinge, while the other part allows your bones to glide past each other. Between these two parts lies a disk made of strong, flexible tissue called cartilage. It acts as a shock absorber and helps your TMJ smoothly open and close.",
        "If this disk moves out of place, gets torn, or if something causes your TMJ bones to fuse together, you have what’s called a temporomandibular disorder (TMD).",
        "If you have problems with your temporomandibular joint (TMJ), it can cause symptoms like headaches from grinding your teeth, especially at night."
