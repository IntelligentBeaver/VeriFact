        "Sometimes, a simple action like sitting for too long can cause pain in your testicles. But lasting or severe testicular pain may mean you have medical issues that need treatment. Some of the most common reasons you may be feeling pain in your testicles include:"
      ],
      "bullets": [
        "Diabetic neuropathy . One possible complication from diabetes is nerve damage. If the nerves near your testicles are affected, you may feel pain.",
        "Epididymitis . Epididymitis is inflammation in your epididymis, the coiled tubes that store and carry sperm to your testicles. Most often, this inflammation happens because of a bacterial infection such as gonorrhea or chlamydia . Along with pain, you may get swelling in your scrotum, and it may feel hot to the touch.",
        "Epididymal hypertension. The slang term you may hear for this condition is “blue balls.” Your testicles can ache if you are sexually aroused and blood rushes to the area, but you don’t orgasm. It’s not dangerous, and it goes away on its own.",
        "Hematocele . “Cele” means a swelling or hernia, and “hema” relates to blood. When blood collects around one or both of your testicles, you can get a hematocele, or a blood cyst . This usually happens after you get an injury to the testicles.",
        "Hydrocele . A hydrocele is when fluid from your belly area builds up around one or both testicles in your scrotum. Hydroceles are especially common in babies.",
        "Orchitis . Sometimes one or both testicles swell because of a bacterial or viral infection such as mumps. Orchitis from mumps is common in children. Often orchitis and epididymitis are related. If they happen at the same time, it’s called epididymo-orchitis.",
        "Pain after a vasectomy . A vasectomy is a surgery that seals the vas deferens, which are the tubes that carry sperm. It’s a procedure people get as birth control. After the surgery, some people have testicular pain because of higher pressure in their vas deferens or epididymis.",
        "Spermatocele . Sometimes, dead sperm cells collect and form a fluid-filled cyst inside the epididymis near your testicle. Usually, a spermatocele isn’t painful, but if it grows large enough, it can become uncomfortable.",
        "Testicular cancer . Testicular cancer is typically painless, but a lump can be a symptom. Sometimes you may feel a dull ache or mild pain in your testicles or groin. It’s the most common type of cancer in people assigned male at birth (AMAB) between the ages of 15 and 35.",
        "Testicular torsion . If a testicle rotates, it can twist the blood vessels that lead to it and cut off the blood supply. This happens more often to the left testicle than the right one. It can happen at any time, and it’s most common in people ages 12 to 18. You’ll feel a sudden, sharp pain when this happens. Testicular torsion is a medical emergency, and you need surgery to treat it.",
        "Varicocele . A group of abnormally large veins in your scrotum is called a varicocele. They can ache during activity, and they may feel better when you rest."
