        "One thing to keep in mind is that doctors don’t know as much about Alzheimer’s in Black people. That’s because Black people aren’t in studies as much. They especially aren’t in studies that look at risk factors and changes over time. This means that what’s known about Alzheimer’s risk factors – including genetics, lifestyle, and other health conditions – comes mostly from studies of white people. Experts usually assume that those findings apply to other groups. But they don’t actually know for sure what drives Alzheimer’s in Black people and if there may be differences. So more study is needed to really understand Alzheimer’s in the Black community.",
