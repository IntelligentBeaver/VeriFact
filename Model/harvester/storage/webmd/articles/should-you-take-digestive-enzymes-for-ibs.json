        "If you have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), you may get the sense that your digestion doesn’t work properly. Eating a meal might send you running to the bathroom, doubled over in pain, or have you blown up like a balloon. While food isn’t a trigger for everyone with IBS, it’s a common complaint that can be helped by certain over-the-counter remedies. Digestive enzyme supplements are one such option widely marketed for the digestively troubled. But do they work for IBS? The answer is: sometimes.",
        "Understanding IBS",
        "IBS is known as a disorder of the gut-brain axis. This means there’s an irregularity in how the gut and brain communicate to express physical sensations such as pain. While the digestive tract will look structurally normal inside, there can be inappropriate muscle contractions and hypersensitivity in response to various stimulants, such as certain foods.",
        "The Role of Digestive Enzymes",
        "Digestive enzymes are proteins that our bodies make to break down food into absorbable nutrients. Enzymes have specific roles that target protein, sugars, fat, or carbohydrates. An enzyme works exclusively on its designated nutrient, so a protein-digesting enzyme won’t work on fat, and a sugar-digesting enzyme won’t work on protein. Therefore, an enzyme supplement can only be beneficial if it’s used to target the specific food that’s causing your digestive distress."
