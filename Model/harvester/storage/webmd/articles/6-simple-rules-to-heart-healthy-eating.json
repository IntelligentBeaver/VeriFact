        "What is a heart healthy diet?",
        "When I first became a cardiologist about 15 years ago, the answer to this question seemed simple. It was a low-cholesterol, low-fat diet. Unfortunately, that answer ended up falling apart. Turns out, eating foods with cholesterol probably doesn’t have much influence on your cholesterol levels; but eating processed, packaged foods with a “low fat” label has been terrible for our health.",
        "Today, the answer to the heart healthy diet question is more controversial. Is it low carb? Plant-based, vegan, Mediterranean, gluten free, DASH? The list goes on, and each diet has their advocates.",
        "But who is right? Unfortunately, the “experts” haven’t been very helpful. Each one seems to have research and reasons “proving” why their diet is best (and why you should buy their book).",
        "There was a time when I wasn’t sure what to tell my patients about a heart healthy diet.  So I did my own research. I read the important papers, attended conferences, talked to the experts and my patients to see if I could cut through the noise to come to a simple message I could share with my patients."
