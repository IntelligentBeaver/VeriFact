You cannot be vaccinated during pregnancy, but you should be before you leave the hospital after delivery.",

Having either is fine, but if the mother's blood is Rh negative and your partner's blood is Rh positive, your baby's blood type may not match yours (it may be Rh positive). This can be a problem during delivery, or even during miscarriage because your body may produce antibodies to protect itself from this \"foreign\" substance. This phenomenon is called Rh incompatibility. If your partner's blood is Rh+ (and yours is Rh-), you will be given an injection of Rh immune globulin (called Rhogam) during the 28th week of your pregnancy to prevent the development of antibodies that could be harmful to your baby. You will also receive this injection during invasive procedures and if you have any significant bleeding during your pregnancy.

All of these diseases can be passed onto the baby because of defective genes that the parents may carry (even if they don't have the disease.) Your provider may offer you a test for cystic fibrosis , an inherited disease that can affect breathing and digestion in your baby if you and your partner are carriers. You will also be offered genetic testing for Down syndrome , Trisomy 13 and 18, and spinal defects, which can be done in the first or second trimester of your pregnancy."

            "Pelvic exam: During the pelvic exam, a Pap smear is taken to screen for cervical cancer, and cultures are taken to detect sexually transmitted diseases (such as gonorrhea and chlamydia ). In addition, a bimanual internal exam (with two fingers inside the vagina and one hand on the abdomen ) will be performed to determine the size of your uterus and pelvis. This exam may also pick up on some abnormalities of the cervix, uterus, or ovaries."

You cannot be vaccinated during pregnancy, but you should be before you leave the hospital after delivery.",

        "Type and screen blood test: This test determines your blood type and Rh factor (a protein on the surface of blood cells that causes an immune system response). Everyone is either Rh negative (your blood doesn't contain Rh factor) or Rh positive (your blood contains Rh factor; 85% of us are). Having either is fine, but if the mother's blood is Rh negative and your partner's blood is Rh positive, your baby's blood type may not match yours (it may be Rh positive). This can be a problem during delivery, or even during miscarriage because your body may produce antibodies to protect itself from this \"foreign\" substance. This phenomenon is called Rh incompatibility. If your partner's blood is Rh+ (and yours is Rh-), you will be given an injection of Rh immune globulin (called Rhogam) during the 28th week of your pregnancy to prevent the development of antibodies that could be harmful to your baby. You will also receive this injection during invasive procedures and if you have any significant bleeding during your pregnancy. Additionally, an injection of Rhogam is given after delivery if your baby has Rh+ blood.",

Blacks, Jews, French Canadians, and people of Mediterranean descent are most at risk for these illnesses. All of these diseases can be passed onto the baby because of defective genes that the parents may carry (even if they don't have the disease.) Your provider may offer you a test for cystic fibrosis , an inherited disease that can affect breathing and digestion in your baby if you and your partner are carriers. You will also be offered genetic testing for Down syndrome , Trisomy 13 and 18, and spinal defects, which can be done in the first or second trimester of your pregnancy."
