It can be done with an operation through your belly, laparoscopically (entering through your navel), or via hysteroscopy (in which the doctor inserts a thin, telescope-like instrument called a hysteroscope through your vagina ). A laparoscopic or hysteroscopic approach is less invasive, less expensive, and requires less recovery time. The da Vinci robotic myomectomy is another technique that offers more precision and smaller cuts than standard surgery. There's a slight chance that what was thought to be a fibroid could turn out to be a cancer called uterine sarcoma . For this reason, the FDA recommends that your doctor not cut the fibroid into small sections before removing it, a process called laparoscopic morcellation.",
        "Uterine artery embolization (UAE) , also known as uterine fibroid embolization (UFE). This is a fairly simple, noninvasive procedure in which your doctor injects small particles into the arteries in your uterus that feed the fibroids, cutting off their blood supply. Unlike a hysterectomy, this procedure preserves the uterus. It's been used for years to help stop heavy bleeding after ch ildbirth or surgery. Symptoms improve in 85% to 90% of patients, most of them significantly.",
        "Medical management. Pain due to uterine fibroids can be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) like ibuprofen or naproxen. If that's not enough, hormonal treatments can help with both pain and heavy periods. These treatments include birth control pills and intrauterine devices (IUDs), as well as other drugs that work in various ways to reduce or eliminate your period. These aren't permanent solutions, though. Your symptoms will likely return when you stop taking them."
