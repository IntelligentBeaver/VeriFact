        "In the United States, TBRF is caused by three strains of a bacteria called borrelia: B. hermsii , B. parkeri , and B. turicatae . They’re spread through the bites of infected soft ticks , which live in the nests of small animals like mice, chipmunks, and squirrels. Unlike hard ticks, which stay attached for days, soft ticks only feed for 15 to 30 minutes before they drop off. Their bites are often painless, so you may get bitten and not realize it."
