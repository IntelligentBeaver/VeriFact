Under X-ray guidance, the catheter is moved into the blood vessels supplying the tumor in the liver . The doctor then injects liquid containing tiny radioactive particles into the proper artery (or arteries ). The particles stay in the tumor, blocking blood flow to cancer cells, killing them, and shrinking the tumor. In most cases, the surrounding healthy liver suffers minimal radiation damage after radioembolization. The radiation in the particles gradually disappears over a month. The leftover particles can safely stay put forever."
