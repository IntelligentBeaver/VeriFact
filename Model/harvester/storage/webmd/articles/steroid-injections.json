        "Steroid injections, sometimes called cortisone shots, are injections of man-made drugs called corticosteroids that can help ease pain and inflammation (swelling) in specific areas of your body. Corticosteroids are similar to cortisol, a hormone your body makes in your adrenal glands. They are not the same as the hormone-related steroid compounds that some athletes use.",
        "Your doctor may suggest you have a steroid injection to treat inflammation in your joints, or other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus , bad allergies, and asthma. There are different types of corticosteroids, including prednisone , methylprednisolone , and cortisone.",
        "How do steroid injections work?",
        "When you get ill or injured, your immune system responds by sending out inflammatory cells that aid in the healing process. As you get better, that immediate inflammation goes away. However, some types of injuries and diseases cause longer-lasting or chronic inflammation, which can mean ongoing pain.",
        "Like the cortisol your body makes, the corticosteroids delivered by steroid injections temporarily calm your immune system. That reduces inflammation so that you feel less pain. While steroids don’t offer any healing properties of their own, they can make you feel well enough to engage in rehabilitation -- such as physical therapy -- that can help repair what’s wrong with your body.",
