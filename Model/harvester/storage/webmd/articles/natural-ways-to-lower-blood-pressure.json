        "Losing weight is easier said than done. Whether you have a busy schedule or easy access to tasty treats, shedding pounds can be tough. But even a small change can have a big effect on high blood pressure. “If you can lose just 10% of your body weight, it can make a big difference,” says Renee M. Poole, MD, MMM, FAAF, a Family and Lifestyle Medicine Specialist in Los Angeles, CA. Extra body weight affects more than just how you look. It can strain vital organs (especially if weight centers around your abdomen). It can also decrease your blood volume, and as your weight increases, your blood pressure often rises as well."
