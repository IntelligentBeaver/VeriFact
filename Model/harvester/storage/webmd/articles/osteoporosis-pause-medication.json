        "You may need a temporary pause or break from osteoporosis treatment, especially if you take medications called bisphosphonates.  These medicines protect your bones and help your body lose less bone over time. Doctors call this pause a “drug holiday.” They recommend it to help you avoid side effects that can occur when taking bisphosphonates for too long. If you have osteoporosis, bisphosphonates help prevent fractures. They can lower your risk of spine fractures by up to 70%, other bone fractures by 40%, and hip fractures by 50%. “There are some very rare side effects linked to bisphosphonates. The risk is quite low, but it increases with prolonged and uninterrupted treatment,” says Elaine Yu, MD, director of the Bone Density Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. “To lower that risk, we recommend that patients consider taking a medication pause.” The FDA suggests that pausing treatment may not be a good idea if you are at high risk for fractures. These medications go a long way toward protecting your bones, and the side effects are usually minimal."

        "Bisphosphonates and other osteoporosis treatments can cause side effects such as nausea or dizziness, but they are usually mild and manageable. Still, if you take them for a long time, there is a small risk that they may cause more serious side effects. Here are some you should know: Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). It is a rare but serious condition that causes the death of bone cells in the jaw. It can cause damaged (necrotic) bone in the jaw to project outside the gum. Symptoms: Pain in the jaw Loose teeth Mouth sores Pus-like discharge from gums and mouth Swollen gums Atypical femur fracture (AFF). A type of stress fracture that usually appears in the upper part of the thigh bone. Diagnosis includes X-rays of both thighs, as fractures can occur on both sides. The main symptom is pain in the upper thigh and hip without a history of injury. Discomfort in the esophagus. It is unclear whether bisphosphonates increase the risk of esophageal cancer. Studies suggest that this possible relationship is not necessarily due to treatment, but rather to other factors such as age or certain health conditions. Symptoms include pain or burning when swallowing."
