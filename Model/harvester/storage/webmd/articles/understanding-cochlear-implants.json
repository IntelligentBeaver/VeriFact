        "A cochlear implant (CI) is an electronic device designed to help you hear better if you're deaf, partially deaf, or have trouble understanding speech. It has two parts: a processor you wear behind your ear, and a receiver and electrode array underneath your scalp. The outside and inside parts connect through magnets.",
        "The device sends impulses directly to your auditory (hearing) nerve , which carries sound signals to your brain.",
        "If you had some level of hearing before, know that a cochlear implant may not restore your hearing to the way it was, but it can help. Most people with severe to profound hearing loss can better understand speech in person or over the phone and can identify sounds like a ringing telephone, doorbell, or alarm.",

        "These devices have a microphone, processor, and receiver on the outside of your head. One style fits over and behind your ear, similar to a hearing aid, then attaches to a piece that secures to your scalp with a magnet. Another style has just one external piece attached to your scalp.",
