Falling under the category of feminine hygiene and sexual well-being, this beauty sector is worth over $30 billion and is projected to grow to $40 billion by 2025. Rightfully so, new products and emerging treatments are vast and there is a feeling of FOMO trying to keep up with the latest craze. The popularity of services catering to vulvar health has increased, and more at-home options are available, too. I wanted to delve into the world of vulvar skin care and guide you through safe and helpful options to try.",

An exfoliant is applied, either chemically (e.g., chemical peel) or manually exfoliated with a sugar or salt scrub. A calming mask is applied, and the treatment finishes with a moisturizer or oil. A vajacial can focus on several concerns, including hyperpigmentation, ingrown hairs, and post-waxing irritation."
