        "If you've been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, your doctor may recommend that you begin treatment with one of several types of DMARDs within a few months of diagnosis. DMARDs are one of the most important drugs for treating rheumatoid arthritis. They can often slow or stop RA from getting worse by interrupting the immune process that promotes inflammation. But they may take up to 6 months to be fully effective.",
        "DMARDs have greatly improved the quality of life for many people with rheumatoid arthritis. These RA drugs are often used along with NSAIDs or glucocorticoids. But with this type of medication, you may not need other anti-inflammatories or analgesics.",
        "Because DMARDs target the immune system, they also can weaken the immune system's ability to fight infections. This means you must be watchful for early signs of infection.
