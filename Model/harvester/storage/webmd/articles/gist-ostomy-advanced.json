        "People who have advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) can sometimes also have ostomy surgery. That’s an operation that reroutes your body’s waste into a bag that attaches to the outside of your abdomen. In other words, you’ll poop in a bag attached to an opening on the skin of your belly area, either temporarily or permanently. You’ll also have to learn new ways to care for your body, new eating routines, and new adjustments to activities such as exercise and sex. When you have a GIST ostomy surgery, your surgeon creates a new opening in your body called a stoma . Your bowel movements pass from your digestive system (your large or small intestine) through the stoma into a small, thin bag (also called a pouch) that connects to the outside of your body. You will need to empty the bag into a toilet several times a day. Having to do this may feel weird, upsetting and isolating – but keep in mind this kind of surgery isn’t rare. About one in 500 Americans live with an ostomy, either due to GIST ostomy surgery or other causes. But everyone who has an ostomy must learn daily care habits and changes that help prevent skin irritations, infections, leaks, and other issues."

        "Your health care team may suggest a stoma pouch system that’s best for your body and its needs. There are several options. Most come in either one or two parts. With a two-part pouch system, you’ll have a bag (or pouch) plus a skin barrier that protects your stoma and the skin surrounding it. The skin barrier is sometimes called a wafer or baseplate. With two-part systems, you attach and remove your pouch from the skin barrier (kind of like snapping on a lid for a food storage container). With one-part systems, the pouch and barrier stay connected. To care for your system, you should: Empty your pouch before it gets full – usually when it’s a third or half-filled. A full bag is harder to empty without spills. Change your pouch system, including your skin barrier, about every 3 to 5 days. If it leaks, change it right away, as leaks can irritate your skin. (Leaks that keep happening need to be quickly reported to your health provider.) Consider emptying your pouch before bedtime so it doesn’t fill with gas overnight. Today’s stoma pouches are designed to be odor-free. Many have carbon filters to prevent smells from seeping out. But if you notice odors, you can put deodorizing products in your pouch, such as drops or charcoal tablets, or you can take oral deodorants to make your waste smell better. Check with your doctor before trying any of these remedies."

Your doctor can prescribe medication to help. It’s important to keep the skin around your stoma clean. Wash with water and mild soap, avoiding alcohol, oils, or fragrances. Alcohol can dry skin out; perfumes can aggravate allergies; and oil-based soap could lead to slippery skin, making it hard for your pouch to attach. If you’re hairy around your stoma, consider carefully shaving or using other hair removal methods, such as laser removal. This is needed since hair can get in the way of ostomy attachment. (But check with your ostomy nurse for instructions.) You can shower with your stoma pouch on or off, though if you have had a type of ostomy called an ileostomy, you may need to keep your pouch on.

If needed, you can hide your pouch with special wraps and underwear. Some people find that they can also use colors and patterns to help with masking stomas. If you have a stoma above your belt line, wear a patterned shirt; if below, wear patterned (or dark) pants. Men also may switch from tight belts to suspenders, which can help hide pouches.",
