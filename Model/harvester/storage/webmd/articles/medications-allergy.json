Histamines tell cells to react to allergens, the substances that cause an allergic reaction. This starts a chain reaction that increases inflammation and blood flow in your body. Because antihistamines stop this action, they prevent allergy symptoms such as: Congestion Excessive coughing or sneezing Runny nose Watery eyes Facial or bodily swelling Skin rashes Gastrointestinal issues (nausea , diarrhea , or vomiting) Anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction Antihistamines work best when you take them before you feel allergy symptoms. Once they’re in your blood, they can protect against allergens and prevent the release of histamines from happening. Their effects build up over time."

        "For example, if you know you have allergies to pollen from a specific season, start taking an antihistamine before that season starts. Antihistamines come in several forms, including: Eye drops. To treat itchy, red, swollen eyes. Examples include: Ketotifen (Alaway, Zaditor) Olopatadine (Pataday) Nasal sprays. To ease sneezing, an itchy or runny nose, sinus congestion, and postnasal drip. Examples include: Azelastine (Astepro) Olopatadine Oral medications (tablets or capsules). For widespread treatment of allergies including runny nose, itchy or watery eyes, hives , and swelling. Some oral antihistamines make you drowsy because of the cells they attach to. These include: Brompheniramine (Dimetapp) Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) Hydroxyzine (Atarax and Vistaril) Antihistamines that are much less likely to cause drowsiness include: Cetirizine (Zyrtec Allergy) Desloratadine (Clarinex) Fexofenadine (Allegra Allergy) Levocetirizine (Xyzal Allergy 24HR) Loratadine (Alavert, Claritin)"
