        "Kids with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may have more trouble focusing, paying attention, controlling their impulses, and sitting still than those without it. This is because their brains work differently from those of kids without ADHD: They develop more slowly and have fewer chemical messengers like dopamine and norepinephrine to relay the signals that regulate behavior and emotion. Stimulant and non-stimulant ADHD medications work by increasing levels of these chemicals. Medicine is just one part of an ADHD treatment strategy. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends treating children ages 6 and older with a combination of medication and behavioral therapies. Every child is unique and responds differently to treatment. Getting on the right medicine can take time. Your child may need to try a few medicines and doses to find what works best for them."

It's important to find a doctor who you and your child feel comfortable with and trust. It's helpful to understand any medicine your doctor prescribes for your child, including how it works and what side effects it might cause. Here are some questions to ask your doctor when they prescribe any new medication: Why did you recommend this medicine? How does it work in the brain? Is it a stimulant or non-stimulant? What are the alternatives? How much does it cost, and will our insurance cover it? Are any generic versions available? When and how should my child take the medicine? With food or without? How often will you monitor my child while they take the medicine? How long should it take to start working? What kind of improvement can we expect? What are the possible side effects? What should I do if my child has side effects or the medicine isn't working? For how long will my child need to stay on it? How should my child come off the medicine? Can they just stop taking it, or do they need to taper off slowly? Expect to see the doctor about once every three to six months for follow-up visits. At these appointments, the doctor will check your child's height, weight, heart rate, and blood pressure. They'll ask whether ADHD symptoms have improved and if your child has had side effects from the treatment."

        "ADHD isn't like a cold or the flu. It's a long-term condition. Some people continue to have problems with focus, attention, and other executive functions into adulthood. Your child can stay on an ADHD medicine as long as needed to manage their symptoms. Some parents wonder if their child can take a break from medicine on weekends or over the summer, which doctors call a \"drug holiday.\" The benefit is a break from side effects. The risk is that ADHD behaviors could return. Experts say kids with inattention may be fine without their medicine outside of school, but those with hyperactivity could have more behavior issues if they stop. Your child's doctor can advise you on the best summertime medicine approach."
