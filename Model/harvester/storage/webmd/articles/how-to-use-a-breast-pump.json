            "Saves time. Using a breast pump gives you more control over the timing of feedings for your baby. You can create a schedule that works for you and pump at those times.",
            "Shared duties. When your breast milk is pumped and stored, it’s easier for others to help with feeding. This can be especially helpful when you're recovering from childbirth or during nighttime feedings.",
            "Increases supply. Pumping can help you increase your breast milk supply. It can also help create an extra supply of milk that you can keep in the freezer for later.",
            "Breaks. Because you can store an extra supply of breast milk, you'll have more flexibility to run errands, go back to work, and maybe take a vacation.",
            "Donor milk. If you end up with extra milk, you can donate it to other newborns who need breast milk."

            "Fewer immune system benefits. Using a breast pump is preferable to formula but may not be tailored to the baby's needs at the moment. It doesn’t offer the same benefits to the baby's immune system as breastfeeding does.",
            "Extra expense. Buying a breast pump and the supplies needed may cost extra money. This could include milk storage bras, bottles, milk storage bags, and breast pump equipment.",
            "Privacy concerns. You might find it challenging to use a breast pump in public places or at work. It can be hard to find a private place to pump, and sometimes the equipment is loud.",
            "Storage. Finding ways to store and keep track of pumped milk can be difficult. Even frozen breast milk can expire and must be tracked carefully."
