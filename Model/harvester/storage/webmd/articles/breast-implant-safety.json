Those cards include the device’s serial or lot number, style and size, unique device identifier (UDI), and a Toll-free phone number to the breast implant manufacturer. It is recommended that you have periodic imaging (e.g., MRI, ultrasound) of your silicone gel filled breast implants to screen for implant rupture regardless of whether your implants are for cosmetic augmentation or reconstruction.

        "Ruptures. Ruptures are a risk with either kind of breast implant. Ruptures might be caused by surgical error, a fall, or -- very rarely -- the pressure exerted on the breast during a mammogram . But the implications of a rupture are a little different for the two types. Saline implant ruptures are easy to spot. The breast rapidly changes shape over days as the fluid leaks out. If a saline implant breaks, all that leaks out is saltwater. The saltwater is harmlessly absorbed into the body. Silicone gel implant ruptures are more difficult to notice. When the implant breaks, the leaking silicone stays in the body. It can sometimes spread outside the breast and into distant lymph nodes. As unnerving as that sounds, studies haven't found that this results in any increased risk of disease. Nonetheless, if a silicone gel implant ruptures, your doctor will probably recommend removing it and any loose silicone. Ruptures of silicone gel breast implants are often \"silent,\" meaning patients and doctors may not notice them. They can only be detected by MRI . For this reason, the FDA recommends that women with silicone gel implants get an MRI three years after implantation and once every two years after that. MRIs may not be covered by your insurance. Over the course of a woman's life, these MRIs may cost more than the original implant surgery.",

Also, many saline implants can be adjusted after surgery. Months later, a woman could decide to increase or decrease the size of their saline implants without surgery. The doctor can just use a syringe to put in more liquid or take it out. The size of standard prefilled silicone gel implants cannot be changed.",
        "Eligibility. There are some differences in who can get the two types of implants. For reconstruction, women can get either type of breast implant at any age. But for augmentation, saline implants are approved for women 18 and older, while only women who are 22 and older can get silicone gel breast implants. The FDA explains that the risks are different for the two products, specifically citing the issues surrounding the removal of ruptured silicone gel breast implants."

In general, rupture becomes more likely as breast implants age. The FDA estimates that breast implants should last at least ten years. Studies have shown that some breast implants last much longer than that and others much less. Rupture isn't the only problem that requires surgery. Over time, breast implants can change shape. One breast might start to look very different from the other. Sometimes, the tissue around the implant hardens, a condition called capsular contracture. Surgery is the only way to fix capsular contracture. If you get breast implants and want to maintain your breast size and shape for the rest of your life, you should be prepared to have a number of additional surgeries. The surgery to replace an implant is not as involved as the original procedure. However, the risk of complications is actually higher. In addition, insurance rarely pays for these revision surgeries.",
