        "Does It Work?",
        "If you follow The Omni Diet, you’ll likely lose weight . It’s a nutritious approach to weight loss. And if you stick with the program for the long term, you’ll keep the weight off.",
        "Because you’ll be cutting calories from your diet and burning them through exercise, the weight should drop pretty fast.",
        "The promise of losing 12 pounds in 2 weeks is a bit of a stretch, but if you follow the program to a T, it could happen. If not, don’t get discouraged.",
        "While there are no studies specifically on this diet, there is a great deal of research to support its components. One of its best features is that the calories come mostly from non-starchy vegetables.",
        "There’s no guarantee you’ll lose weight if you go gluten-free, but if that helps you avoid overeating foods like bread and pasta, go for it. Just don’t replace them with gluten-free versions of those foods.",
        "There’s also little research to support the supplements (except vitamin D which most people don't get enough of) Amen recommends, and they’re unlikely to help you lose weight.",
        "Because Amen suggests avoiding dairy, look for other sources of calcium and vitamin D , such as fortified soy and almond milk.",
        "Is It Good for Certain Conditions?",
        "The Omni Diet is appropriate  for anyone living with diabetes , high blood pressure , and heart disease . If you have high cholesterol, be sure to check with your doctor about the recommendations for coconut oil, which is high in saturated fat. Because the primary source of calories is plant-based foods, the diet is low in cholesterol . Limiting starchy carbs and sugar may be especially helpful for people with diabetes; just be sure to check with your doctor if you plan to follow this diet.",
        "The Final Word",
        "If you’re up for making the commitment, the Omni Diet is a great option to help you lose weight, although it might be difficult to stick to long-term. It’ll take some work getting used to the new way of eating and increased exercise, but you’ll be slimmer and healthier for it."
