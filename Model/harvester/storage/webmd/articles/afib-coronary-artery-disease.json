        "The connection and difference between atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease can be confusing. Atrial fibrillation ( AFib ) is a form of arrhythmia, or abnormal heart rhythm. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition where blockages in major blood vessels reduce the flow of blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the heart.",
        "The two conditions have many similarities. Both AFib and CAD are common, and both are forms of heart disease. Older people have a higher risk of developing AFib and CAD. Many of the symptoms and risk factors are the same. There’s a strong correlation between the two. If you happen to develop both of them, AFib and CAD can aggravate each other in a vicious cycle that can limit your lifespan.",
        "Between 18% and 47% of people with AFib also have CAD, partly due to common risk factors such as older age, hypertension, and diabetes. The number of people who have both is rising rapidly."
