        "Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is a chronic, progressive, and degenerative eye disease that affects the macula -- the center part of your retina -- leading to central vision loss. It usually occurs if you’re over 50-60 years old. More than 1.75 million Americans have advanced AMD. That number is projected to double in the next few decades as our population ages.",
        "Worldwide, about 228 million people will be diagnosed with AMD by 2040, with people of European descent having the highest risk, but all ethnicities are vulnerable. Other risk factors include smoking, poor diet, obesity, and a family history of AMD.",
        "People with early and intermediate-stage AMD can have mild to moderate vision loss. But those with advanced or end-stage AMD typically develop severe vision loss and can have several symptoms, depending on the type of AMD they develop.",
        "Wet AMD symptoms include seeing spots in your central vision or straight lines as wavy and distorted, affecting your reading ability. Most people will get eye injections to help control the bleeding and prevent new blood vessel growth."

        "Dry AMD symptoms include washed-out colors and difficulty seeing fine details. Objects in the central vision may appear distorted and faded. Approximately 80% of the people diagnosed with AMD will have dry AMD, which accounts for about 20% of legal blindness (defined as 20/200 or worse in the better-seeing eye, best corrected with standard glasses or contacts).",
        "According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, eating a healthy diet and taking vitamin supplements can help slow the progression of dry AMD.",
        "When vision declines, you may be most affected by the diminished quality of life and have difficulty with even simple daily activities that rely on vision. You may also need high magnification for activities like reading, using a computer, and watching TV.",
        "Advanced AMD is severely debilitating, leading to reduced independence and significant emotional distress. People with moderate vision loss from advanced AMD have a 32% decrease in their quality of life, which is similar to what patients experience after breaking a hip. As the disease progresses, people report a 60% decrease in quality of life, which equates to the experience of someone with end-stage cancer who requires around-the-clock care. Despite this evidence, some doctors often understate the impact end-stage AMD has on people."
