        "Glaucoma is a disease of the eye that leads to blindness. In fact, it is the second leading cause of blindness in the world. The reason glaucoma is such a bad disease is that in most cases, you cannot feel it, you cannot tell that you have it, and by the time someone notices vision loss, it’s often already relatively advanced.",
        "The good news about glaucoma is that once it’s recognized and treated appropriately, usually people maintain relatively good vision for the rest of their lives. There are, as always, exceptions, and sometimes people with very challenging cases lose vision despite our best efforts. But truthfully, many of the people that go blind in both eyes from glaucoma are those who don’t get detected until the advanced stages, don’t have access to quality health care, or don’t follow up appropriately.",
        "What’s the difference between open- and closed-angle glaucoma?",
        "Before discussing the difference between open- and closed-angle glaucoma, we should discuss what an “angle” is. The “angle” of the eye is the drainage system of the inside of the eye. It has nothing to do with tearing outside the eye or one’s tear duct. Within the front part of the eye, there’s a structure that makes fluid and a structure that drains fluid. This drain is called the angle because it looks like an angle or a “V.”"

In most cases of glaucoma, lowering the eye pressure helps stop or slow the progression of glaucoma. We lower the eye pressure with three different modalities: a laser procedure, medication, or surgery. When the eye pressure is sufficiently controlled, in most cases of glaucoma, damage to the optic nerve can be stopped."

However, as stated above, if glaucoma is caught early enough and treated appropriately, most of the time we win and preserve vision. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, it is essential to get a comprehensive eye exam by an ophthalmologist at least once in your 20s and twice in your 30s. If you have a family history of glaucoma or blindness, you should likely be examined more frequently."
