In this approach, you get a single large dose of radiation in the operating room right after breast conservation surgery (before the wound is closed). 3D-conformal radiotherapy. You get radiation from special machines that can better aim it at the area where the tumor was. You’ll get treatments twice a day for 5 days.",

The doctor inserts several small, hollow tubes called catheters into the breast around the area where the cancer was. They stay in place for several days. Doctors put radioactive pellets into them for short periods every day. Intracavitary brachytherapy. This is the most common type of brachytherapy for women with breast cancer. The doctor uses a small catheter to put a device inside your breast. The device is widened and stays in place during the treatment. The other end sticks out of the breast. The doctor uses a tube to put radiation sources (often pellets) into the device. You usually get this twice a day for 5 days as an outpatient.
