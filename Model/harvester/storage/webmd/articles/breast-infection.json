        "Mastitis vs. engorgement",
        "Engorgement is what happens in the 2-4 days after your baby is born and your breasts start to swell, as your milk comes in. Your body sends more fluid and blood to your breasts to help with milk production and this can cause pain. Symptoms usually peak around day 5 and seldom last longer than 2 weeks after your baby's birth. Unlike with mastitis, no antibiotics are needed for treatment. Home remedies usually are enough."
