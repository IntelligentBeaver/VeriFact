        "When you have a serious health condition, such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), it helps to learn all you can about it — what it means, what you can expect to happen, and what you can do to improve your health. MASH happens when another more common condition, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), gets worse. Doctors used to call it nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Over time, the damage can cause liver scarring, or fibrosis, which interferes with your liver’s ability to function."
