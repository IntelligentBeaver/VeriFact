        "One in six Black men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point, compared to 1 in 8 men overall. They’re also more than twice as likely to die from the disease. One reason is that prostate cancer tends to be more aggressive in men of African descent. A 2022 study in the scientific journal Nature Communications found that they’re more likely to have two gene markers linked to aggressive prostate cancer: pleiotrophin and TNFRSF9. “We saw those markers even among [Black] men without cancer,” says Clayton Yates, PhD, a professor of pathology, oncology, and urology at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. But there are also hurdles to care that add to poor outcomes. One example is some men avoiding prostate cancer screening tests that could catch the disease early. “All these factors together create a perfect storm where aggressive prostate cancer can thrive,” Yates says. Here’s a look at some of the most common roadblocks and what men of African descent can do to push past them."

        "One of the best  – and less invasive – ways to check for prostate cancer is a blood test called a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, says Isaac Powell, MD, Director, Prostate Cancer Population Health Disparities Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit. PSA is a protein made in the prostate. High levels may mean prostate cancer. Yet only about 33% of Black men get screened, according to the American Cancer Society. “Part of the problem is very few primary care providers routinely screen for prostate cancer,” Yates says. In 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force published guidelines advising against PSA screening for prostate cancer in all men. They changed again in 2017, recommending men between the ages of 55 and 69 decide for themselves if screening is necessary. Yates says that because of this, screening often isn’t on a primary care doctor’s radar even though organizations like the American Cancer Society now recommend that all African-American men discuss screening with their doctors once they turn 45. The Prostate Cancer Foundation recommends starting at age 40."

        "Fear of being misled or taken advantage of are also obstacles to care. “In general, Black men have a lack of trust in the health care system,” Yates says. Much of this stems from the Tuskegee experiment, a 40-year study that left Black male patients with syphilis untreated. Although it ended in 1972, distrust remains more than four decades later. “Anytime I go out into the community to talk to men about prostate cancer screening, someone mentions it,” said Yates. Powell says all Black men should begin PSA screening at age 40, especially if they already have a family history of prostate cancer. He also recommends a rectal exam. “About 15% of men with prostate cancer have a normal PSA, even those with aggressive cancer. A rectal exam can reveal changes in prostate cancer tissue, such as extreme firmness,” Powell says. That’s why doctors typically recommend both. Powell also suggests seeing a urologist for more tests, such as a biopsy , if you didn’t get screened at a urologist’s office and your PSA levels are high. That’s anything above 4 ng/mL. You should also see one if your PSA levels are still normal, but have gone up one or two points since last year. Even if your PSA levels are borderline, it’s important to stay on top of things. That’s because Black men with a PSA of 4 have the same risk of prostate cancer as white men with a PSA of 13.4, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Cancer ."
