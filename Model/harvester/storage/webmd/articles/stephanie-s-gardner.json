She went on to complete an internal medicine residency in 1988, also at Georgia Baptist Medical Center, where she was awarded first prize for research in cardiac disease. She then did a second residency in dermatology at Emory, where she was chief resident, finishing in 1991. She published several papers and lectured on various dermatology issues during that time.",
        "Gardner worked for the Southeast Permanente Medical Group in Atlanta from 1991 to 1998, where she served as the medical director of dermatology at the Tucker, Ga., office. She took a leave of absence with the birth of her third child for the next four years. She then joined Aesthetic Specialty Centre in Roswell, Ga., and worked as a medical, cosmetic, and surgical dermatologist from 2002 to 2010. She is currently in practice at Dermatology Center of Atlanta in Johns Creek, Ga. She has lectured on numerous occasions in the Atlanta area and has been a clinical instructor in dermatology for Emory’s School of Medicine. She has also been a preceptor in dermatology for many medical students.",
        "Gardner was a medical consultant for Johnson & Johnson and for Allergan, focusing on medical and cosmetic dermatology issues.

Gardner serves on the board of the Emory Ocular Oncology Foundation, which raises money for ocular melanoma research and public awareness and prevention of this deadly disease.",
        "Gardner is board certified in dermatology by the American Board of Dermatology.
