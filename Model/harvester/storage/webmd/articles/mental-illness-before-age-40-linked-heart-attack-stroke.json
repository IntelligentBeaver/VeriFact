        "May 9, 2023 – People diagnosed with a mental health disorder in their 20s or 30s are more likely to have a heart attack or stroke later in life, according to a new study.",
        "The research builds on existing knowledge that people with mental illnesses tend to have multiple conditions at once. The findings are a potential compass toward helping those people live longer and avoid potentially deadly heart problems.",
        "The study was published last month in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology . Researchers analyzed insurance claim data from more than 6.5 million people ages 20 to 39 living in South Korea who had no history of heart attacks or strokes. About 13% of people had a mental health diagnosis at the beginning of the study, and they were significantly more likely to have a heart attack or stroke during the next 8 years, compared to people who did not have a mental illness.",
        "Specifically, the risk of having a heart attack was 58% higher, and the risk of having a stroke was 42% higher among people with mental illnesses, compared to people without mental health problems."
