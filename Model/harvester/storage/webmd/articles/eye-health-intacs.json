        "Keratoconus is a condition in which the cornea (the clear, central part of the front surface of the eye ) bulges outward and downward like a cone. Normally, the cornea has a dome shape, like a ball. Sometimes, however, the structure of the cornea is just not strong enough to hold this round shape. Keratoconus can cause progressive deterioration of vision. Initially, keratoconus is treated with glasses, but often, contact lenses , first soft, then gas permeable, are necessary to allow the eye to see adequately. However, because in most cases keratoconus is a degenerative disease, medical management is insufficient, and a procedure is needed to stabilize the deterioration of vision ."

Although the procedure usually improves uncorrected vision, the patient will often still need glasses or contact lenses after the Intacs are inserted. After the cornea has been reshaped, patients who were once unable to tolerate contact lenses may be able to return to contact lens wear and see even better than they did with the lenses prior to surgery. Some patients may even be able to see well enough to go back to simply wearing glasses."
