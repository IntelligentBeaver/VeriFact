        "June 27, 2025 — Growing up in the rural Midwest, I had a tick routine after walking in the woods: Shower, scrub my scalp, and feel for ticks. Pluck any I found — a regular occurrence — with tweezers. No problem and no symptoms.",
        "But how do tick experts — people who know where ticks are and how they spread, and employ the latest strategies — handle this growing scourge?",
        "After all, ticks are everywhere. In certain regions, if you’re bitten by a tick, there’s a good chance it’s carrying Lyme. A Dartmouth study found that half of black-legged ticks and a quarter of nymphal black-legged ticks in the Northeast tested positive for the disease over three decades of data.",
        "Other tickborne diseases throughout the country include anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and tularemia. And while vaccines to prevent Lyme and other tickborne diseases are on the horizon, they’re not available yet, so bite prevention is key.",
        "Turns out much of the advice today is the same as when I was a kid in the ’90s, but these days technology offers some upgrades. Here’s what tick experts do."
