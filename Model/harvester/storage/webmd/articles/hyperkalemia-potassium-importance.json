        "Hyperkalemia is when you have too much potassium in your blood. The body needs a delicate potassium balance to help the heart and other muscles work properly. Too much potassium in your blood can lead to dangerous, and even deadly, changes in your heart rhythm. Hyperkalemia vs. hypokalemia When you have hypokalemia, the potassium level in your blood is too low. You get potassium from food. If your potassium is too low, it may mean your body is losing too much of the mineral through vomiting, diarrhea , or using laxatives. Hypokalemia can cause weakness, heart problems, and even paralysis."

Kidney disease is the most common cause of hyperkalemia. Your kidneys help control the balance of potassium in your body. If they don’t work well, they can’t filter extra potassium from the blood or remove it from the body. A hormone called aldosterone tells the kidneys when to remove potassium. Diseases that lower the production of this hormone, such as Addison's disease, can lead to hyperkalemia."
