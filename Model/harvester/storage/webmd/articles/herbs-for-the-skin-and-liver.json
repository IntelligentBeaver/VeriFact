        "Dandelion is high in nutrients including vitamins A, B, C, D, iron, and potassium. It may assist with constipation, bloating, and water retention. Dandelion root may help with the joints, which is great for those with psoriatic arthritis. It’s an amazing herb for supporting the liver in cleansing, in addition to milk thistle.",
        "Milk thistle has certain properties that protect liver cells from free radicals and toxins. Milk thistle has been said to help with improving energy, depression, headaches, and toxic poisoning. It’s also been known to aid in recovery from alcohol, drugs, liver diseases, and medications that damage the liver. Psoriasis patients often try several medications over the years that can affect the liver, so incorporating milk thistle tea into the regimen could be very beneficial."

Herbs that are high in certain minerals and vitamins, and help with the lymphatic system, are the best herbs for skin health. The lymphatic system is a network of vessels that helps move fluid through the body. Our lymph nodes filter out the viruses, bacteria, waste, and toxins. However, sometimes our lymph nodes can become congested, and when the lymphatic system isn’t functioning properly, this may lead to skin conditions such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea. Some lymphatic herbs include cleavers, calendula, pau d’arco, and yellow dock.",
