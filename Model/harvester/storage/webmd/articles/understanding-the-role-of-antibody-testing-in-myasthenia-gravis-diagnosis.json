        "Symptoms, appointments, medical jargon, fear. With myasthenia gravis (MG), one of the first things doctors often do is an antibody test. If you’re anything like me, your first reaction is, “What’s that? Is it going to tell me what’s wrong with me?”",
        "I didn’t know much about antibodies before MG. To me, they were just vague things your immune system uses to fight off colds. I had no idea they could go rogue and attack your own body. But that’s exactly what happens in MG.",
        "When doctors suspect MG, they may order blood tests to look for specific antibodies that might be interfering with how your nerves and muscles communicate. The main ones are AChR antibodies (acetylcholine receptor) and MuSK antibodies (muscle-specific kinase). If one of these shows up in your blood, it can help confirm that what you’re experiencing really is MG."

        "But here’s the frustrating part. Not everyone with MG tests positive.",
        "About 10% to 15% percent of people with MG are seronegative, meaning their blood doesn’t show typical antibodies, even though they have symptoms. That can make diagnosis even more confusing and delayed. Because in a medical world that loves numbers and clear results, being seronegative sometimes makes doctors hesitate.",
        "That’s why it’s important to know that a negative antibody test doesn’t mean you’re fine. If your symptoms line up with MG, especially if they improve with treatments like pyridostigmine or worsen with exertion, doctors can still make a diagnosis. They’ll base it on your clinical picture, nerve conduction studies, EMGs, and how you respond to treatment."

It doesn’t fix the root of the problem, but it confuses or blocks the faulty ones attacking your body.",
