        "A new study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine calculated a 35% decrease in the odds of developing dementia among those with a genetic risk but who have a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness, or CRF. CRF refers to how well the heart, lungs , and muscles work together to supply oxygen during sustained physical activity. It’s a measure of overall cardiovascular and respiratory efficiency and is often assessed through activities like running, cycling, or brisk walking. In general, higher cardiorespiratory fitness is linked to better heart health, lower disease risk, and improved endurance.",
        "Overall, high CRF cut the risk by 40%, according to the new evidence.",
        "The researchers discovered that CRF was related to dementia risk in a linear, “dose-dependent” manner. The higher fitness that a person had at baseline, the lower their risk of developing dementia."
