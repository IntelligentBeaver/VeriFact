        "June 2, 2023 – A 5,000-mile-long seaweed blob heading toward the east coast of Florida contains “flesh-eating” bacteria, researchers from Florida Atlantic University said.",
        "Vibrio bacteria is already known to cause life-threatening illnesses from seafood consumption and disease and death from open wound infections. The new finding from the research team is that the bacteria can also attach itself to plastic debris caught up in the seaweed blob and might spread to people who simply touch the debris.",
        "That creates a perfect “pathogen” storm, FAU researchers said.",
        "“Plastic is a new element that’s been introduced into marine environments and has only been around for about 50 years,” Tracy Mincer, PhD, one of the study authors and an assistant professor of biology at FAU’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, said in a news release from FAU.",
        "“Our lab work showed that these Vibrio are extremely aggressive and can seek out and stick to plastic within minutes. We also found that there are attachment factors that microbes use to stick to plastics, and it is the same kind of mechanism that pathogens use.”"
