        "March 6, 2023 -- A new procedure could help with the problem of leaking tricuspid valves in the heart, according to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine .",
        "The tricuspid valve allows deoxygenated blood to flow between the right and left ventricles. When the valve leaks, blood flows backwards and accumulates in different parts of the body, leading to fatigue, breathing difficulties, and swollen hands and feet, among other symptoms.",
        "In the new procedure called transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER), doctors applied clips to the tricuspid valve, which narrowed its size and cut down on the chances of leakage, which is called regurgitation.",
        "“Tricuspid TEER was safe for patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation, reduced the severity of tricuspid regurgitation, and was associated with an improvement in quality of life,” the study concluded.",
        "The tricuspid is sometimes called “the forgotten valve” because it’s understudied compared to other parts of the heart, according to the National Library of Medicine. About 1.6 million Americans have the problem of tricuspid regurgitation ."
