But that doesn't mean you won't have to deal with shingles, which is caused by the highly contagious varicella-zoster virus, the same one responsible for chickenpox. Shingles , which affects an estimated one in five people, is a painful, blistering condition. It can show up at any time but is especially alarming if it strikes during pregnancy. Fortunately, shingles in pregnancy is rare. And, for most women who develop shingles during pregnancy, the outlook is good."

Although your immune system usually keeps the virus in check, anything that affects the immune system's ability to hold back the virus -- illnesses, immunosuppressive drugs, severe stress, or aging-related changes, for example -- can allow the virus to return with a vengeance.",

It may be accompanied by fever, chills, nausea , diarrhea , and difficulty urinating. The pain and tingling are followed by a rash , which begins with reddish bumps, most often on the trunk. In a few days, the bumps become fluid-filled blisters , which usually crust over and fall off after seven to 10 days."

        "Shingles can be quite painful. Many people who see their doctor for shingles say it was the pain that ultimately led them to seek treatment. Some report that the sensation of anything brushing across the inflamed nerve endings on the skin is almost unbearable. Even when the rash is gone, postherpetic neuralgia can persist, sometimes for years.",
        "Shingles can cause other lasting complications as well. If it occurs on the face, it can damage your eyes . Shingles of the eye can lead to scarring, which can damage your vision. It can also lead to glaucoma , an eye disease that can cause blindness later in life.",
        "Shingles can also cause hearing or balance problems, as well as weakness of the muscles on the affected side of the face. In rare cases, shingles can spread into the brain or spinal cord and cause serious complications such as stroke or meningitis (an infection of the membranes outside the brain and spinal cord).",
        "According to the CDC, more than one-third of people who get shingles will develop serious complications. People whose immune systems are suppressed because of medication or diseases such as HIV run the greatest risk of complications. Complications are also more common among people over age 60, which precludes women of childbearing age. Nevertheless, if a shingles outbreak affects your eye or you notice any symptoms outside of the area of the outbreak, you should speak to your doctor right away."
