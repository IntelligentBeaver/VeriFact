        "Angel Rose, 34, an assistant vice president at a bank in upstate New York, was interviewing candidates for a teller position, which required that a person have good people and communication skills, a professional presentation, and a strong focus on customer service, among other abilities.",
        "One candidate in particular stood out, but not in a good way. While they could have been very intelligent, their nonverbal communication and body language were way off. Their handshake was more of a finger shake, their eye contact was nonexistent, and their slouched posture exuded insecurity. For Rose, what the candidate said didn't matter because their body language spoke volumes: they weren't a good fit for the position.",

        "Body language, she explains, is everything from our facial expressions, to eye contact, to our gestures, stance, and posture. While the nuances of body language are complicated, there are some common body language signs worth a thousand words."
