        "A rotator cuff impingement is a type of injury that causes shoulder pain. It affects the muscles and tendons between your arm bone and the top of your shoulder. You use this group of muscles and tendons, called the rotator cuff, to move and lift your arms.",
        "An impingement happens when one of these tendons is injured, causing it to swell and get pinched by the bony top of your shoulder joint . The “pinching” makes it hard for blood to flow through. Because of that, your tendon can start to fray and split like a piece of rope.",
        "Doctors sort these injuries into three grades based on your symptoms and how much damage the impingement causes:",
        "Rotator cuff impingement is most common in older adults and athletes, but 20% of all people will get it at some point in their lives. This shoulder problem can often be treated at home."
