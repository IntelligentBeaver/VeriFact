        "When Sandy Cassanelli of West Springfield, MA, was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer 10 years ago, her first phone call was to the one person she knew would understand: a close friend who also had metastatic breast cancer .",
        "“She answered all of my questions and gave me hope,” says Cassanelli, who’s now in her late 40s. “She was the only woman I knew who had metastatic disease. If I hadn’t reached out to her right away, I would have gone onto the internet and read all sorts of statistics predicting I wouldn’t make it through the next 5 years. But she told me right away not to do that. She said, ‘don’t view it as a death sentence.’”",
        "Cassanelli is busy today raising her two daughters and running the Breast Friends Fund, a nonprofit charity where 100% of funds raised go directly to metastatic breast cancer research. One reason why she thinks she’s survived -- and thrived -- is all the social support she’s had over the years."
